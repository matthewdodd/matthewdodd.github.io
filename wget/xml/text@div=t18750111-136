                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I prosecuted the prisoner at Guildhall and he was committed for trial for embezzling some post-office orders and was tried and acquitted—this charge has never been investigated before a Magistrate—I recollect that he applied for his trial to stand over last Sessions on account of this fresh charge—I believe he applied to be admitted to bail and my solicitor opposed it—Herbert was the name that I took when I first commenced business because at that time I was doing a large trade at the West End of London, and the reason I traded under that name was because I was leaving the wholesale trade to go into the retail trade, and I cleared my teas under the name of Herbert and Co., so as not to interfere with one till I felt I was safe in carrying on the other—I only had one shop for a considerable time—I afterwards had two; and during the last few weeks I had four—up to the time I made an assignment the prisoner had authority to endorse post office orders and cheques—he had not a right to sign my name in all matters of business, it was a matter of convenience to send those things to the bank, and permission was given him—he had no right to sign letters with the name of Herbert and Co.—I was there every day—the time varied—I had little to do beyond going there—as head quarters I was naturally there the greater part of business hours of the day, 10 o'clock in the morning till 5 o'clock in the afternoon—sometimes I went to my other shops—the railway stalls did not require going to day by day—they had their goods sent in to them—the prisoner had the feeding of the shops and railway stalls</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, at 90, Queen Street, City, and was employed by the prosecutor in this case—I conducted the case at Guildhall—I knew nothing of Browning's case till after the committal, and on the matter coming to my knowledge, I gave notice to Messrs, Wontner, the prisoner's solicitors, on 12th December last—no application was made to me by them to inspect the books—application for admission to bail was made to Sir Thomas Chambers, and it was refused by him after facts had been laid before him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner was summoned to Guildhall on the charge on which he has been acquitted—he surrendered to that summons, and was admitted to bail until he was committed for trial—he surrendered on each occasion—I gave particulars of this charge to Messrs. Wontner, on 12th December, and also the names of the witnesses, and subsequently I gave them an abstract, of the evidence.</p>

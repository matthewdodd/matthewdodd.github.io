             sworn. - I am a constable; I was sent for to Mr. Holmes's shop to take charge of Williams; I searched her, but found no money upon her whatever; I took her to the Mansion-house; in going to the Mansion-house, I saw the woman with the child in her arms, (Gray;) she came up, and spoke to Williams, about twenty yards from Mr. Holmes's; we were going towards the Mansion-house, and she was coming the contrary way, and met us; she asked Williams where she was going; her answer was, along with that man, meaning me; I had not hold of her at that time; I said to Williams, do you know that woman; she said, she did very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in the hearing of Gray? - A. I cannot be positive, she might be about a couple of yards off; I immediately laid hold of Gray, and took them both to the Mansion-house. Before we went into the Justiceroom, I searched Gray, and in her right-hand pocket I found this screw box, which I opened, and found it contained, in a paper, twenty bad shillings; in the bottom of the box, between the paper and the bottom, there was a seven-shilling piece, two shillings, and a sixpence, all good; they were loose; I then turned to Williams, and said, I believe you have had that shilling from this woman; they were close by each other; she told me she had; the prisoner, Gray, said, she was a bad girl for saying so, and that she knew better.</p>

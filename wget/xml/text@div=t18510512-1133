                  </hi>. I am a stationer, of Buckingham-street, Strand. On 28th April, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning, I received information from my foreman, and went to my office—about two I saw the prisoner there, and gave him in charge—this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is mine—I only know it by the weight and size—I had such—the prisoner had no right to take it out of my office—he never offered me any paper for sale.</p>

On 28th April, about half-past eight o'clock, I was at work in the office—the prisoner came in and said he had ten quires of paper over, which he should make money of—I said, "The paper does not belong to you; do not take it out," and he said, "I have got a person named Blake, who knows where to sell it"—I said, "If you take it out there will be a bother about it"—it was then lying on a bench—I do not know whether this is it—I went out of the room, came back infive minutes, and he was gone, and the paper also.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a copper-plate printer, of Pitt-street, Old Kent-road. On 28th April, about nine o'clock in the morning, I called on Mr. Burrell, and was too soon to see him—I went to a public-house—the prisoner came in; I had seen him about three times before—he said he had had a very bad loss, Mr. Burrell stopped 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for spoiled work and paper; that he offered it to Mr. Burrell for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., who told him he had better sell it where he could—he went out and returned with a parcel wrapped up in an apron—I went out with him, and the paper was sold for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at a butcher's in Leather-lane, by a lame man, while the prisoner stood outside—I think this is it—I lifted up the apron and saw one corner of it—I saw no money pass, but they went into a public-house together, and I informed Mr. Burrell.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, F</hi> 39). I took the prisoner, and told him the charge—he asked to see Mr. Burrell that it might be settled, and said if Mr. Burrell looked in his accounts he would find it was all right—I went to the butcher's shop and found the paper.</p>

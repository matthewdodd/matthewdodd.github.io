On the 4th of March, between twelve and one o'clock, she called to see me, and stopped until two o'clock. On the same morning I put one of these gowns away in the drawers in the bed-room on the first floor. All the things were then safe - we were in the kitchen below; she went away about two o'clock; I have no lodgers. The street door is generally open - I did not miss the things till Thursday afternoon, the 6th of March. She had told me she lived at No. 11, Goldsmith-place, Hackney-road, and that her sister lived in service at No. 17, there. I went to her sister on the Friday morning, but I found nothing there; I found every thing but a gown at Wyatt's, a little higher up; also the fragments of a gown and shirt which had been cut up, I am sure they are mine.</p>

            . I live in Margaret-place, Hackney-fields. I took the prisoner in to sleep for a few nights, at the request of my neighbours. She slept in a small back room. She had a small hand box, and two bonnet boxes, with her; and was frequently in and out; and could bring things in without my seeing her. I keep a haberdasher's shop. Mrs. Joseph called on me on Friday, with Elias. I called the servant down. Mrs. Joseph said, she suspected her of having articles which she missed. She said she knew nothing of them. They asked her to fetch her box down, which she refused. I took Mrs. Joseph up to her room - there was a part of a gown cut up on the bed, which Mrs. Joseph claimed - her box was unlocked, and Mrs. Joseph took from it the rest of the things. and brought them down into her presence. The prisoner seemed agitated.</p>

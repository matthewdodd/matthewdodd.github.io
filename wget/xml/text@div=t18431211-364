                  </hi>. I am parcels-agent at the London and Birmingham Rail<lb></lb>way at Euston-square.

Rurtter against the Excise parcels, I said, "How is it that you have now a genuine signature against the Excise parcels?—I told you to employ Francis as usual"—he said Francis did not meet him as he had done before, and therefore he delivered them himself—it was his duty to keep this book himself entirely—he had no authority to part with it to any<lb></lb>body—it would be a breach of his duty to do so—on the 26th I sent for Francis, and said, "What do you know about these Excise parcels?"—he said, "I have usually met Thorogood in Falcon-square, where he has always handed me the Excise parcels; I have sometimes delivered them, and some<lb></lb>times employed a man named Bugden to do it"—I said, "On Friday what did you do?"—he said "I met Thorogood in Falcon-square, and received two parcels from him; and I met Bugden, and delivered them to him, who returned shortly after with the money and gave it to Thorogood, and in hit presence signed the book J. Smith"—he stated that the genuine tickets, or the right tickets, had been torn up by Thorogood; and the fresh ones supplied by him to Francis's parcels.</p>

               <p>St. George's—I have known the prisoner for the last two years; she lives within two or three doors of me with her husband—on the night of 23d, June, between 11 and 12 o'clock, I was coming from a party at No. 4—I was quite sober—when I got near the door I saw Mrs. Duncan standing close to, the door—I said to her, "I should be ashamed looking into persons houses"—she immediately began blackguarding me, and I said to her, "Now don't begin blackguarding me;" and I said, "I knew you at Wapping"—I was joking at the time—she then ran after me, and seized me by the hair of my head—at this time her husband came up, struck me, and knocked me down—I was still laughing and joking—the prisoner then took my shoe off, and knocked me about the head with it—she then ran into her own house; she came out again, and she had a knife with her—I caught hold of her hand, and had the knife in my hand—I saw the knife—I can't say whether it is here—she then struck me in the forehead; it bled, and I could not see—I am sure she did it.</p>

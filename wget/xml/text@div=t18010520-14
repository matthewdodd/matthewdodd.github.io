               <p>Q. Are you responsible for this property? - A. I conceive so, in some respects.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hart. Q. You have partners, have you not? - A. Yes; but this is a consignment to me only.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the consignment here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not the duty of the prisoner to bring cloth for the purpose of mending the bags? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And if they find there is more cloth than is necessary for the business, they carry it back again? - A. Yes; or charge me with it.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner came back very willingly, did he not? - A. Yes; he threw himself upon his knees, begged for mercy, and interceded as much as a man could do; I desired he would not make any consession to me with a view of mercy, for I should certainly prosecute him.(Charles Rowley, the constable, produced the property).</p>
               <p>Mr. Hawkes. I cannot swear to the cotton, it is impossible, I saw him pass my window, coming from the premises; I did not see him come out of the door.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. What is the distance between that window and the premises? - A. Not more than twenty-five yards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I stand in a predicament I never was in in my life before; It is worse to me than death to think of it; twenty-two years I have served my King and Country, and been in ten actions; a thing of this kind has been always beneath me. <rs id="t18010520-14-verdict75" type="verdictDescription">

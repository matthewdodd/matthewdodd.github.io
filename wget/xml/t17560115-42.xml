            . I am book-keeper to those gentlemen. When we were inform'd they had been rob'd, the gentlemen order'd, that the men, who cut the goods into garments, should be search'd. Mr. Ware desired I would give him my assistance to see them examined. I was by, and held the candle, while he searched the prisoner's pockets, when I saw the canvas, here produced, taken out. I ran a piece of packthread through them, that I might be able to swear that they are the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is this warehouse ?</p>
               <p>Kentish. It is in Seething-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say for himself ?</p>
               <p>Kentish. He said it was the first offence, and beg'd that we would forgive him, at another time he said somebody had put them in his pocket when he was asleep. The constable was waiting in the kitchen, and, upon the goods being found, was call'd, and had charge given him of the prisoner. He charged me to aid and assist: We then took him to the compter, and the next day, being Saturday, there was no sitting alderman. We brought him to his Lordship, it being the time of the sessions. My lord's clerk said, if he was committed, he must remain till next sessions; so he advised us to let him remain till Monday, to see the gentlemen, as they do not live in town. The prisoner was accordingly admitted to bail, and is now surrendered.</p>

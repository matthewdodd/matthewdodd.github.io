                  </hi>. I am an artist, living at 19, Fouden Road, Stoke Newington—in May, 1877, I inserted an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> to obtain a loan of 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I received this letter in reply. (<hi rend="italic">Dated</hi> 24, <hi rend="italic">Park Road, Dalston, May</hi> 21, 1877, <hi rend="italic">asking the witness to call at that address</hi>.) On receiving the letter I called to see the prisoner at 24, Park Road—there was a plate on the door, "Mrs. Dobson, Governess, patronised by Royalty," or something like that—I did not see the prisoner then—I afterwards received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This was from the same address, dated</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">st June</hi>, 1877, <hi rend="italic">and made an appointment to call on the witness at</hi> 9 p.m.; <hi rend="italic">signed</hi> "<hi rend="italic">E. A. Dobson</hi>.") The prisoner called on me soon afterwards, and said that he represented Mr. Dobson—he asked me how much I wanted, for what purposes, and what security I could give—I asked him what interest would be necessary, and I told him I could give him the deeds of an intended partnership—he proposed that I should give him a life policy of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him f would do so—he said that was satisfactory, and I should hear from him again—I subsequently received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 8<hi rend="italic">th June, signed</hi> "<hi rend="italic">E. A. Dobson" and said</hi> "My representative will wait on you and settle matters to-night at 7 p.m.") The prisoner again called on me—he told me he had called on a friend of mine whom I had mentioned to him, but had not suggested that he should call, that he found everything was satisfactory, and he should be able to give me the loan I required upon the security of the deed of partnership and the life policy—I saw him again, and he said I should have the money at 5 per cent.—he asked me to give him a bill of sale—I refused—he said that he was satisfied, and produced a receipt for 2 guineas, saying that it was necessary to settle that first—I paid it to him—that was to pay for the documents—he went away, and I did not see him again—I wrote seven or eight letters, and I called at 24, Park Road two or three times—a woman opened the door—I was told he was never to be seen—I subse<lb></lb>quently received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This was from the same address, and was dated</hi> 18 <hi rend="italic">th June</hi>, 1877, <hi rend="italic">and signed</hi> "<hi rend="italic">E. A. Dobson</hi>," <hi rend="italic">and said</hi>, "I am wait<lb></lb>ing to hear from Mr. Gray in answer to my note some days since.") This letter was also sent to my intended partner, and was handed to me—there is no date to it: "Re Loan. Private. Sir,—Yours to hand. Bill of sale on your furniture will be prepared. Please to say when you can be</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187804080070"></xptr>
               <p>waited on for the inventory to be taken. Yours faithfully, Edward A. Dobson." It was addressed to Mr. Gray—it is the prisoner's writing—I also received this letter, dated 10th July, 1877, in the prisoner's writing. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that, as the witness could not give the bill of sale, two responsible persons would be required to join him, and on his doing so the matter would be proceeded with; signed</hi>, "<hi rend="italic">Edward A. Dobson</hi>.") Also this one, dated August <hi rend="italic">4</hi>, 1877. (<hi rend="italic">This was from Edward A. Dobson, and expressed some surprise that the witness should demand a return of the</hi> 2 <hi rend="italic">guineas, as the prisoner had taken so much trouble in the matter as an agent, and that his solicitor would defend any proceedings the witness might take</hi>.) This document was written by the prisoner in my presence: "Hawthorn Villa, 24, Park Road, Dalston. Advance 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., terms (<hi rend="italic">blank</hi>) 5 1/2 percent. interest per annum; valuation 2 guineas; no other costs; bill of sale unregistered." I advanced the 2 guineas because I believed the prisoner's statement that he was a financial agent carrying on a <hi rend="italic">bonâ fide</hi> business—the words "financial agent" are on all his letters—I believed him when he stated that he represented Edward Dobson—I never got back the 2 guineas.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I never deposited the deed of partnership nor the policy of insurance, nor executed the bill of sale—the document I saw the prisoner write was not drawn when I paid him the 2 guineas, but on the first or second interview before I paid it—I referred to Mr. Hinton, a printer and stationer in Shoreditch, and the prisoner called on him—I was in business with Mr. Gray some years ago, and intended to take him as a partner—that is what I wanted the loan for—I did not put the prisoner in communication with him, but I mentioned him as my intended partner—the receipt was similar to this form: "Received of (<hi rend="italic">blank</hi>) the sum of 2 guineas, the whole cost of attending negotiation of loan, the sum being returned if business declined by us." I have lost the receipt—I said I would not give the bill of sale before I gave the prisoner the 2 guineas—the prisoner led me to suppose Dobson would lend the money.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 11<hi rend="italic">th August</hi>, 1877, <hi rend="italic">upon the Alliance Bank, for two guineas, signed "Chas. F.

(<hi rend="italic">These were headed</hi> 24, <hi rend="italic">Park Road, Dalston, and signed E. A. Dobson</hi>.) "10th September, 1877. Dear Sir,—Re 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

I handed him the 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. "13th September. Dear Sir,—I find that it will be Monday next before I can give you a final answer to your matter. On that day shall write or call on you." "23rd September, 1877. Dear Sir,—I should have written you sooner but did not get my client's reply until this afternoon. It seems they would much prefer your giving a respon<lb></lb>sible person as guarantee that your stock will be kept up to the value as security for the capital advanced. If you will, therefore, be good enough to let me have the name and address at once of some responsible person I will hasten the negotiation all I can as your agent in this matter. I assure you that I have left no stone unturned to get the loan done, but, from inquiries I have made, they seem to consider a guarantee</p>

                  </hi>. I am a confectioner, of 89, Islington Green—in October last I advertised in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> for a partner—I received this letter:—"24, Park Road, Dalston. 18th October, 1877. Sir—Should you prefer borrowing capital for a term of years at 5 1/2 per cent. I should be happy to see you here at once on the subject. Yours truly, E. A. Dobson." I went to the address and saw the prisoner—I asked if he was Dobson—he said "Yes"—I saw a plate with "Mr. Dobson's Office" on it and one on the door, "Mrs. Dobson," and on the window were the words "Auctioneer and Estate Agent"—the prisoner asked me if I wanted money or a partner—I said "I want a partner"—he said "I can obtain it for you"—I said "I have no security to give you"—he said "Have you a lease?"—I said "I have a lease of my premises"—he said "That is something; I see no difficulty in obtaining money for you"—I suggested 1, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. could be advanced, and there would be four guineas to pay for taking the inventory and preparing the agreement and the full negotiation—I said "Why do you want the money first?"—he said "It was simply to make it binding"—I said "I have an inventory taken"—he said "Then we shall not want to take another, that will save you a guinea"—I aid "Why do you want three guineas?"—he said "Sometimes people come to me and ask for money, and after I have been to the trouble of endeavouring to get it for them they say owing to some circumstances they do not want it and I have my trouble for nothing, therefore I must have three guineas, which will be returned if you do not get your money"—I asked him or a memorandum, which he gave me—I said I would consider the matter—he said he knew gentlemen who instructed him to find safe investments for their money, and he considered my business was a safe and good investment, and that I could afford to give him 6 per cent. and he would pay five, so that would pay him one per cent. for his trouble—I had several other letters, and I made an appointment for Monday evening, 22nd October, when I went to his house, and on the advice of my friend I parted with my three guineas, and on the Tuesday he called on me and I handed him the inventory—he gave me a receipt which stated that the three guineas would be returned "if business declined by us"—I saw the prisoner again the same evening after receiving this letter. <hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "My brother has reported the matter of his visit as to 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. This can be carried out at once. My brother will be with you between five and six o'clock this evening." These letters passed between us after paying the three guineas, which I paid believing his statements: "27th October, 1877. Dear Sir,—It would be quite Thursday next before I can get an answer from my client. I shall then call on you or write to you." He did not call."30th October. Dear Sir,—My clients</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker of 131, Goswell Road, St. Luke's—in January, 1878, I wanted a partner with 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and adver<lb></lb>tised in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi>—I received a reply and saw the prisoner—there was a plate on the railings, "Mr. Dobson's office"—I told the prisoner I wanted 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he had a friend who would advance it on good security—I told him I had my stock, furniture, and book debts amounting to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he came and looked at it and said "You want t man to conduct your business, not exactly the money; but the money is very handy at six per cent."—he asked for two guineas for the stamp and other charges—I gave it to him, and he handed me a receipt which contained a statement that if the loan was not advanced my money would be returned—I parted with the money believing the prisoner could do the business—I never got the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. nor the two guineas—some correspondence took place, in which the prisoner wanted increased security, which I declined to give, and demanded my money back—I called several times and could not find him—he was generally in the country.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. He wrote wanting some one to guarantee that none of the stock should be removed—I did not see him after that till I saw him at Clerkenwell police-court.</p>

I do not recollect seeing him between March, 1876, and March, 1877—I have seen his forms of receipt—I do not know whether I knew him in 1870—he had offices in Carey Street—I do not remember being instructed by the society to write to Dobson declining a loan—I cannot give you an instance of the society advancing money on the prisoner's introduction during the eight or ten years, nor the names of any persons receiving money on his introduction—I remember an application from Hackney for a loan on some printing plant—it was not granted—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) does not refresh my memory as to whether a communica<lb></lb>tion A was made to Dobson with regard to advancing money.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 31, South Parade, Trafalgar Square, Chelsea, and am a wine merchant, carrying on business at 16, Abchurch Lane, City—I have known the prisoner for some time, and since April last I have had business transactions with him; he carried on business as a stockbroker at 18, Austin Friars, his name was not on the door—I have visited at his office and he has visited at mine, and we have had transactions together—on Saturday, 5th October last, about 10.20, he called on me, bringing this cheque marked A. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>; October 4th, 1878. Messrs. Williams, Deacon, and Company. Pay to bearer 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Henry Labouchere." <hi rend="italic">On the stamp were the initials</hi> "F. A. P.") He said "Kindly get this cashed for me"—I said "How do you want it?"—he said "Get me one 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and eleven 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, pay 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into your bank for me, for I shall want a cheque on Monday or Tuesday for that amount, and bring the eleven fives down to Kempton Park to day"—I said I would do so—I have a banking account at the London and Westminster—I knew that he had no banking account and I had obliged him, before in the. same way—at the time he handed the cheque to me there was no receipt stamp upon it; he asked me for one and I gave it to him, and he put it on the cheque, and he put on the letters F. A. P. and the figures 4-10-78 on the receipt stamp in my presence—he said "If they ask at the bank who this cheque is from say from Pinckoff's"—I went with the cheque to Williams, Deacon, and Company, about 11 o'clock; an inquiry was made of me by the cashier, and I mentioned the name of Pinckoff's—the cashier then paid me the cheque with one 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I know it because I endorsed it in my own handwriting—it is numbered 29133, dated 2nd March, 1878—I paid this note into my account at the London and West-minster, the chief office in Lothbury—I also received the eleven 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, which I pinned together and took down to Kempton Park race meeting on that Saturday, where I saw the prisoner and handed them to him—the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. remained as it had been arranged—I did not see anything of the prisoner until the following Tuesday, the 8th; he came to me that day between 12 and 1 o'clock, and while he was there a clerk called on me from Williams, Deacon, and Company, and in the prisoner's presence he said to me "Mr. Tryon?"—I said "Yes"—he said "I have called to trace a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, can you tell me where you got it?"—at that time the prisoner was behind me reading a newspaper, and as I was about to reply he kicked my legs with his foot, and said "No, no, no, no," and that was the answer I gave the clerk, "No"—the prisoner said behind me "Kempton Park or Carter"—that was whispered, but loud enough for the clerk to hear—I then said "Prom Kempton Park or Carter, but I don't know where"—the clerk then left—after he was gone I said to the prisoner "There is some mistake about this cheque, what is the meaning of it?"—he said "Oh, yes, they paid me too much, that will be all right; I will go and put it right and be back in half an hour"—he then left, and I did not see him again until I saw him in the dock of the Mansion House—I know his hand-writing—this letter marked D is his writing—I don't think the envelope is—I do not know that handwriting—the prisoner might have called at my office about 1st August—I remember his bringing this cheque marked C—it is dated 1st August, drawn on Williams, Deacon, and Company, for</p>

               <p>75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., payable to bearer, signed H. Labouchere, and on the stamp is written 1-9-78, H. V.—he asked me to get it cashed for him—I said I would—he told me to get 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and ten fives, I did so, and handed the money to him—I remember his coming to my office about 30th August, on that occasion he brought me five 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—I paid those notes into my bank on the same day, and gave him a cheque in exchange for it—this is it—the cheque is dated August 30: "Pay to No. 977 or bearer 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Tryon and Co."—the number is the rotation number of the cheque—I put a number at his request—I said "What name?"—he said "No name, put a number"—these three letters, marked F. G. H., are in the prisoner's handwriting, and I believe the envelopes also.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had no business transactions with the prisoner before April—I knew of his being a liquidating debtor—I claimed 161<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as lent to him in January, but I wish to withdraw that proof—it was made up of 61<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for wine supplied, and 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. money lent on 12th January—I swore to that debt—it was not a true debt—I did not give him the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a music-hall one night in January—I have seen him at a music-hall more than once—on no occasion did I give him money at a music-hall—I did not know of any syndicate operations on the Stock Exchange with regard to a com<lb></lb>pany in which Mr. Labouchere was interested—I do not know anything about it—when the prisoner gave me the two cheques he did not tell me from whom he had had them—I did not ask him—at the time the clerk came from Williams, Deacon, and Company I had not heard of a large embarrassment in Mr. Labouchere's account—I knew nothing whatever about it—I was not asked by the detective Hancock to go to the Mansion House—I went to Mr. Mullen's office at first, and I went to the Mansion House on my own account—I did not believe I was about to be given into custody—I received a letter from Mr. Mullens, and on receipt of that I went to hi office—I did not go from there to the Mansion House—I was not kept in suspense as to whether I was to be a witness or a prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Mr. Mullens's clerk called on me, and I said I preferred seeing the principal, and I went on to his office and made a statement—I afterwards attended at the Mansion House several times and gave evidence. George Tinson. I am a cashier in the bank of Williams, Deacon, and Company, 21, Birchin Lane—Mr. Henry Labouchere has an account there—I have been in the habit of cashing his cheques for a long time—this cheque for 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was presented to me for payment over the counter on Saturday, 5th October—I have not the slightest idea who presented it—I cashed it in the ordinary way—I have my book here with the entry—it is in my own handwriting—I gave in payment for the cheque a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, No. 29133, dated 2nd March, 1878, and 11 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England notes—I believed the cheque to be a genuine one, and paid it accordingly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There are about 70 clerks in the bank—about ten would be employed in paying and cancelling cheques—this is my own cancellation—we know each other's cancellations perfectly well—I was not present when Mr. Labouchere went through a large bundle of cheques—some cheques were shown to me alleged to be forged, which I had cancelled—there were certainly over a 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that I paid myself—no inquiry was made into the cheques that were presented in 1874 that I am aware, I think only from 1877—there would be a few before that, but I did not see them—no forged cheques of 1874 or 1875 were submitted to me—I cannot tell you how many there were that I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187901130040"></xptr>
               <p>had cancelled, perhaps five or six—I should not think there were anything like forged cheques amounting to 40,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the 1st January, 1877, up to the end of 1878, nor to the amount of 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—those I had cancelled might amount to 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more than the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know what they amounted to altogether, but I believe it was something between 13,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 14,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not the slightest idea what the earliest date of these would be—I cannot tell you whether there were any earlier than 1877—I have the books here—I was not subpœnaed to bring the cheques—they are in the hands of the solicitors—I have not seen them—there are very few customers at our bank who draw on plain paper—some gentlemen occasion<lb></lb>ally draw on blank paper, but very few, not habitually, they usually draw on forms—to the best of my belief Mr. Labouchere is the only customer who invariably sends his cheques on blank paper—I have not brought Mr. Labouchere's cheques for 1874—I cannot possibly say how many cheques would represent the 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that I paid—if I saw the cheques I could tell those that I paid—I don't know whether it was ten or a dozen—they were exactly similar to this cheque, marked A, and I believe written by the same hand—the writing was so like Mr. Labouchere's that I passed them all—I could not pledge my oath now that it is not Mr. Labouchere's writing—all I mean to say is I look at the signature, and it is so like Mr. Labouchere's that if I had no reason to question it I should say it was his—they were all alike, and I paid them all—the cheques would not be returned to Mr. Labouchere every month, but whenever he liked to call for them—I cannot say whether ho ever had them returned—I know it must have been very rarely—of course any clerks in the house could go and look at the drawer where the cheques are kept—I suppose all the cashiers have dealt with Mr. Labouchere's cheques—the junior clerks who go round to the clearing house would not necesssarily have them in their hands they would only have them in their hands from the clearing-house to the bank, or when they write up the pass-book—it is no part of their duty to see that they are genuine—the senior clerks who cancel the cheques would go through them to see that they were right—the junior clerk has nothing to do with the cancelling, he only collects them from the clearing-house—I have no doubt that from 1874 to the time when the prisoner was taken into custody 40,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of cheques in a similar handwriting to this have been passed through the clearing-house or over the counter against Mr. Labouchere's account—all the cheques are registered in a book—customers who have printed forms would have the opportunity of ascertaining at once whether the cheques were genuine, if they were not upon the book delivered to him—a printed form is a great protection to the bank as well as the cus<lb></lb>tomer—if I saw nothing on the face of the cheque to make me doubt I should not trouble myself to look at the signature book; it depends upon circumstances how often an ordinary customer gets his pass-book made up; they vary; if it is a mercantile account it is done every week, and some have them every day, but private customers may not have their account made up in six or twelve months or two years—out of 1,000 customers quite one per cent would let us keep their pass-book for a year—I dare say there would not be one in 200 who would let us keep it for two years; we always send back the cheques to ordinary customers—if we saw amongst a number of cheques one not having a consecutive number we should make inquiry, but the chances are we should never see it unless the customer</p>

               <p>pointed it out to us—the fact of the consecutive numbers being disturbed, and a strange number interposed, would no doubt put us on inquiry—in ordinary cases we simply look at the pass-book, put the cheques together, and send them back—if I had any doubt of this at the time I should not have paid it; if it were presented to me to-day in its present state I should gay I would pay it; if Mr. Labouchere swore it was not his handwriting I should not pay it—in the face of Mr. Labouchere's oath I should not pay it—if it was presented to me, and I knew nothing of the present pro<lb></lb>ceedings, I should pay it—I should not pay any of these cheques now without looking into it thoroughly first; that is not because we have orders not to pay any more of the Labouchere cheques; we have no orders of the sort—I am told this is a forged cheque, and I say that the signature is so exact that I should have paid it if I did not know the circumstances; without reference to the circumstances I should undoubtedly pay it—with reference to the ledger accounts of all the customers, the balances are struck every three months—if the customer has got his pass-book we wait for him to bring it in; if we have it it is made up—the pass-book is a copy of the ledger—I cannot fix the date when Mr. Labouchere had his pass-book in 1876—I do not know whether it was at the bank all that time—I don't think we had his pass-book for some time; that would not be known to all the clerks; perhaps to three or four or half a dozen, it might be only two clerks, who make up the ledger and strike the balances; they do not change about—I don't know of the existence of any pass-book of Mr. Labouchere's—I don't think I ever saw one—he would not have any difficulty in looking at the ledger at any time—I cannot tell what his balance was on January 1st, 1877—the ledger would show; it is not here—I don't know that I was subpœnaed to bring it; I was subpœnaed to bring the books; we cannot bring the ledgers, they are all in use—the book containing Mr. Labouchere's account contains three or four hundred accounts; we want it every quarter of an hour—I have not a copy of his account.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Mr. labouchere has been a customer 15 or 20 years perhaps—his father was a partner in the bank—I cannot say that he has always drawn his cheques on blank paper—I know he has for a great many years—business-like customers have their pass-books made up pretty often—we have unbusiness-like customers who are somewhat irregular in that respect—Mr. Labouchere did not have his pass-book at all regularly.</p>

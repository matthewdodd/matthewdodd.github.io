In March last, I had a letter to deliver to Mr. Liffiton—I remem<lb></lb>ber delivering it—Mrs. Liffiton opened it in my presence—in conse<lb></lb>quence of what she said, I saw the prisoner the same evening, and asked him if he was in Titchfield-street district, in December—he said he was—I asked him if he had any recollection of a money-letter for No. 3, Charlton-street—he said, no, he had no recollection of such a letter—next morning he came to me, and asked me what I said about a money-letter the other evenings—I said, a person at No. 3, Charlton-street, Mrs. Liffiton, who I had taken a letter to—said she had been ex<lb></lb>pecting a money-letter from the country: and then he said he knew nothing about it—I saw him again on the Thursday, and asked him if he had heard any thing more about the money-letter—he said, yes; it</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence (written</hi>). "The first intimation I had of the letter not having reached its destination, was on Tuesday, the 17th of March, (a period of exactly three months afterwards,) when Mr. Lawrence, one of the inspectors, inquired if I recollected delivering such a letter. I did not, and accordingly told him so; stating at the same time that I would endeavour to do so. On the following day, Mr. Lawrence again spoke to me on the subject, and told me that he had reported to Mr. Stone, one of the acting presidents, my answer of the preceding day; but on referring to the money-letter book, had found my name signed for it; adding 'Then of course, you have got the receipt for it.' I interrupted him by saying, that since he had first spoken to me, I had recollected delivering such a letter, and giving it to a woman, who appeared to be occupied in the shop, who signed the receipt; which however I had unfortunately destroyed at the end of the year, with a great many others. Finding myself likely, in consequence, to lose my situation, I applied among old servants of the establishment for advice; and being told by one or two, that when similar circumstances of losing their receipts had happened, they were obliged to make the money good, and all parties were satisfied. I, unfortunately, listening to this suggestion, went on the 19th to Mr. Liffiton, and although I asserted then, as I do now, my positive conviction of having delivered the letter, I said, that sooner than get into any difficulty, I would pay him the three sovereigns, upon his saying that he had received the money and was satisfied, should any further inquiry be made about the matter. I may have acted imprudently and indiscreetly, but I deny having been actuated by any guilty motive."</p>

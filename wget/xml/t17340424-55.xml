The Rings and Money were lock'd in a Trunk in a little Closet. I saw them there but the Day before; for being to pay some Money, I had told it over. When my Wife return'd from Market, the Prisoner (whom she left to take care of the House) was gone away. This was on a Saturday; and an Alms-man afterwards told me, that he saw such a Creature at a House in Shoreditch. We went to the Place, and heard that she had taken a Coach or a Chaise to Kent on Wednesday; and we pursued, and took her on Thursday, at Badgers-hill in Kent - 'Tis on the other side of Green-hive - I found my 2 Rings upon her, and half a Guinea and 6 d. but the Rings are in the Justice's Hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coal-whipper. On 14th July I was coming from work—I met some of my mates, and we had some beer—I was then standing by the Duke of York—the prisoner came up to me—she took my hat off and went into a house—I went after her—she told me to give her a drop of beer—I said I had no money—I took hold of her, and some more girls came in and looked at me—they went out and came in again, and took hold of my arm, and opened the flap of my trowsers, and took my pocket out—I had in my pocket a purse with 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a few halfpence, but I could not swear the prisoner took it from me—she was in the room when the other two girls took hold of me—she ran out when they ran out—I went out and saw the policeman, and told him—I did not meet the prisoner again—I am not drunk—(<hi rend="italic">the witness was evidently intoxicated</hi>).</p>

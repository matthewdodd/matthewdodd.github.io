               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You were to keep these receipts? A. Yes - he brought me bread every day, and I paid him once a week.</p>
               <p>DAVID WYMAN re-examined. The prisoner ought to make up his account every night - he never accounted to me for any of these sums - I did not know he had received them - he was taken ill on the 21st of August, and went away - I then went round and found these sums had been paid - when he returned I had him taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe, while he was ill, he sent a man to work for him? A. Yes; I have two children - my wife attends the shop when I am absent - the prisoner has settled with her, but she would have entered any thing that she received of him - I swear I was at home on each of the days mentioned - I have not been out for four months more than an hour or two.</p>

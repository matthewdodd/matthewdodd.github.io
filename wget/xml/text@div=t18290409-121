I employed the prisoner to work and lodge in my house - he had soles and other leather to make shoes of, but I suffer no one who works on my premises to take any thing off; he lodged with me by the week. On the 20th of February he had the articles mentioned in his possession, and a pair of woman's boots to stretch; it was his duty to work in my house - he left me on the Friday without notice - his week was up on the Saturday night - he had been four or five weeks with me, and owed me money; all I have got of my property is one pair of lasts, which I found on the 4th of March at his lodgings.</p>

I went with the prosecutor and officer to search his lodgings - we found this pair of lasts there; on the 20th of February I was going to lodge in the prosecutor's house, and I went into the back room to get a light - I found there was no one there; there were two seats in the room, but I saw there were no tools in them - I opened a cupboard, where the prisoner used to put his work. and there was nothing there; I told the prosecutor's wife of it; there was another man there, who went away the same night the prisoner did.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at this public-house on Sunday evening, 9th February, sitting in a side box with three other men—the prisoner and the deceased were there, and the prisoner came over towards where I was sitting and said he would put her to sleep—nothing had been said before that, only they went to the bar and had a drink—he still kept talking after that and said that he had an instrument for the purpose, and afterwards he made the sign of the cross on his chest, saying that he would do for her—he afterwards put his hand in his jacket pocket, and pulled out the case of a razor like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he took off the cap of the case and 1 saw that there was a dark-handled razor in it; he then put the cap on again, put it into his jacket pocket, and commenced singing and dancing—there was no singing going on in the bar or behind—there is no music of a Sunday night—when he put the razor in his pocket he looked at the clock and said it is getting late, and he went towards the door, saying to the woman "Are you coming home?"—he was going out of the door and she pulled him back, <hi rend="italic">axing</hi> him for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to treat her chums—he said he would not give it to her—he was going out again, and she went and dragged him back a second time, saying again "Are you going to give us 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>?"—he said "No"—she put her hand in her pocket, pulled out 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and held it in the corner of her eye, squinting and aggravating him, and then he put his hand in his waistcoat pocket and pulled out some silver and put it in again—he then put his hand in his watch-pocket, pulled out half a sovereign wrapped in paper, and held it up in front of her, saying, "You have many of them stored by belonging to me, but it will not be for long," and then he started a dance again, and then the prisoner and deceased left—they both seemed to have some drink in them, but they were not drunk; she was <hi rend="italic">drunker</hi> than what he was—I saw no more of them.</p>

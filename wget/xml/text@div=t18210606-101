I gave her 6 d. to fetch the beer - I am sure she is the woman, and in the mean time I went up stairs with the woman, and paid her what she wanted; the prisoner then came up without the beer, and asked for 1 s. for the room, which I gave her. Soon after, another woman came up, and asked me to pay 1 s. for the room also, but without giving me time to take out the money, the woman I first went with, took me by the neck, and pulled me backwards; the other woman held me by the throat, and stopped my mouth. I pushed towards the window, and found it was too fast down to throw it up; they threw me against the posts of the bedstead, the others stopped my mouth; the prisoner held me and cut my pocket off, with a pocket knife, and cut my finger in doing it. I had five half-crowns and 6 s. in that pocket, after I had paid them. I had 22 s. when I went into the house - I gave her 2 s. They then all three ran away, leaving me in the house. I ran down after them and called for assistance, the watchman came up and took me to the watch-house. I saw the prisoner there two days after, and am sure she is the woman, I picked her out from five or six others; she denied it, and said,</p>
               <p>"You never saw me," I said,</p>
               <p>"You cut my pocket off;" she then said, She only fetched the beer - she had no light in the room.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 30th of May, about eleven o'clock at night, the prosecutor was brought to the watch-house, by a watchman, and said, he had been robbed and ill used in a house at the back of the George, public-house, George-yard; his hands were bleeding, and his handkerchief torn off his neck; there was a pane of glass fresh broken in the top room of the house, (which is the first floor), and some glass on the ground - I did not know whether it was done with that or not - his fob pocket appeared to have been torn; he said, it was cut with a knife. I went to the house directly, but nobody was there - I told him not to make a noise in the neighbourhood, but to meet me at the watch-house some other evening - he came to the watch-house on the evening of the 1st of June, before ten o'clock - I took him with me into two or three houses by the spot where he was robbed, where there was a quantity of prostitutes - he did not fix on any. I then took him to the watch-house, and went out alone, and brought in four girls; the prisoner was one, he immediately identified her, and said, what part she took in it - I found no knife or money on her; the house is in a very dark situation, I think I could not distinguish a person's features there at half-past nine o'clock without a light.</p>

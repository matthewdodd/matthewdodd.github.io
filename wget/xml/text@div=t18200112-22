            . I live in Dean-street, Westminster. On the 28th of December, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner with two others and watched them; a cart and a coach passed by. The prisoner crossed the road, and took the tea-board from Brooks's door. I called out Stop thief! and followed him down the Almonry with the tea-board under his arm. I turned up the New Way and saw two boys. One of them said,</p>
               <p>"What a row I have made." I heard a whistle - they turned and met the prisoner in the middle of Orchard-street, then all three turned down New Tothill-street into Swiss-yard. The prisoner went up to a cart and put the tea-board into it. I went to Mr. Brooks's other house and told him of it. He went with me, and took the prisoner at the corner of Swiss-yard. I never left the prisoner until I brought him to the cart, took the tea-board out, and gave him to the officer. I am quite sure he is the boy who took it. I had seen him before.</p>

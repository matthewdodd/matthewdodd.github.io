I was in bed on the night in question, the last, except my daughter; I fastened up the house about a quarter past one. I got up at about half past six in the morning. When I got up and was going down stairs, I found the door on the second stair case fastened, and I could not get down. I never found any obstruction before. At last, I opened it, and a parcel of tobacco pipes flew but; it was secured with a staple. When I went stairs, my bar door stood wide open; the two doors were wide open; the skittle-ground door was open, and one of the back doors was open. I found seven tiles taken off the roof of the skittle ground. and I supposed they must have dropped throuh the rafters; there was no other way, because every other place was safe; for the skittle ground is next an alley, and they climbed up, and knocked down a new brick or two, where it was just repaired. When they got through the roof, they must have climbed to a high window, the screw of which is not perfect, and that is the way that I suppose they must have got in; for on the outside doors, there was no violence; they had opened them.</p>

            . I went to bed between one and two; I saw my mother make the house fast. I did not get up until after my mother found the house was broken open. I know no more,than that I locked the bar up the evening previous to the robbery; and it was broken the next morning.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM SHIRES. I belong to the public office Bow-street. On the morning of the 10th of July, about half past six, I was coming down the City-road, and I heard a cry of stop thief; I looked down Old-street Road, and saw three men running; the prisoner was one of them, and I apprehended him. I took him to the watch-house, and starched him; I found a picklock key on him, a silver tea-spoon, a caddy-spoon, and one shilling and eight pence, all in farthings, in a silk handkerchief. I went to the house which had been robbed, and brought the servant girl down to Worship-street; and she said she could swear to the shawl which was round the prisoner's neck.</p>

               <p>THOMAS WOODCOCK. I am headborough of the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch. At about twenty minutes after six, on the morning in question, I was waiting at the corner of Agnes Terrace, when the prisoner, and two more passed me. I heard the prisoner make use of these words, if the cart had been there half an hour sooner, we should had the whole. That gave me a suspicion that all was not right; one of them had a bag with four copper saucepan covers, and other things in it. I followed them up to the Nelson, in Old street, and there asked the one with the bag what he had got; and he immediately put himself in an attitude of fighting; but after he found who I was, he said, I might have the things, and they all three ran off. I pursued them, and called stop thief. The thermometer was afterwards found in a privy in Hoxton.</p>

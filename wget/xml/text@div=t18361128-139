On Sunday morning, the 27th of November, I met the prisoner in Kingsland-road with a bundle under his arm—I asked him what it contained?—he said, "Some things"—I asked him what things—he said bridle and a pair of reins, and he was going to take them to an uncle in town to sell them to him—he said he had them from a man at Southgate, and he was to sell them, and get 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them, or what he could, and was to have something for his trouble—he told me he never saw the man before above once, and that he was a stranger to him—I found a pair of traces under his smock-frock besides which he never mentioned to me.</p>

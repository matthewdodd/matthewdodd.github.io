                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of Hamilton Road, Norwood—on Saturday night, 22nd March, between 12 and 1 o'clock, my wife and I were going home, when three men and a woman stopped us, and the prisoner asked me what I wanted with the woman—I said, "She is my wife"—he then knocked her down with his banjo—I asked him what he meant by it—then he knocked me down—the young woman pitched into my <hi rend="italic">missis</hi>, and scratched her—I cried for help, and the policeman came and took the two prisoners—I heard one of them say, "Knock them down, they have got plenty of money"—that was at the time my wife was knocked down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness—we were walking quietly together home, along the Gipsy Road—the prisoner pulled me away from my husband, and knocked me down with the handle of his banjo—I am now under the doctor's hands, in consequence of the violence received—the young woman took hold of my hair, and held me down—I heard one of them say, "They have got money, I know"—then someone said, "Come on, here's the <hi rend="italic">Bobby</hi>" and then they ran away, and the policeman came up—I had two florins, sixpence, and about twopen halfpenny in copper, safe about two minutes before—when the violence began, I let go my hand; I did not think of the money afterwards, I was so afraid.</p>

The prosecutor and his wife passed me on the morning in question, shortly before I was called to their assistance—they were walking quietly—the first noise I heard was a cry of "Murder!"—I was following them—about forty minutes after they passed me—I went up to them, and saw the prosecutor lying on the ground with Slade—the female said—"I give these two people into custody"—I said, "What for?"—she said, "Assaulting me"—she was very excited, and said nothing about the money then—on the way Slade said, "I give this party in charge for assaulting me"—the prisoners did not appear sober—the prosecutor appeared sober, but the woman appeared very excited, and blood was running down in front of her.</p>

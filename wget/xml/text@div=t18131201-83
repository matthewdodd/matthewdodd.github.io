We had a pint of gin hot. I then paid the reckoning and went out to go home. The prisoner followed me out, and asked me to go with her to the third door from the public-house, and as soon as I entered the door, the landlady of the house asked what I was going to give them to drink? I gave her a shilling, she fetched half a pint of gin. I told the prisoner I was a married man. I found the prisoner very busy handling me. I drank a glass of gin, and went out to go home. Going along, I put my hand into my pocket, and missed my money and my watch. On the next morning I went to the house where I had been the night before. I asked the prisoner for my watch; she denied having it. She said, if I had lost it it served me right. I got an officer: he found my watch at the pawnbroker's.</p>

            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Cordey, a pawnbroker. On the 1st of December the prisoner pledged this watch with me for 1 l. 11 s. 6 d. this is the watch.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This man accosted me at the public-house. He asked me where I lived; I told him a few doors on. He followed me to my house. On the next morning I found the watch by my bedside.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Might not the watch drop out of your pocket - A. I should think not.</p>

On the 15th of December last, I was coming down Chiswell-street, a very small distance from my yard, I saw the prisoner with a mahogany board; I asked him where he was going with it; he told me he was going to the round-house, a public-house in the City-road, I suspected him, and stopped him; I told him he must go back with me, the property was mine; he told me he was employed to take it by some person, he could not tell who; he said that person was to meet him at the round-house; I went with him to the round-house, and waited half-an-hour, but no person came; we then came back, and I shewed him that the property was mine, because I have more of the same boards cut out of the same log.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you so sure, from that circumstance, that you can venture to swear positively to it? - A. I can; as he could give me no account of the person that he said ordered him to take it, I apprehended him.</p>

            , 33, Gerrard-street, Soho. On Tuesday, the 9th of this month, on my return home, I missed my umbrella. I know nothing further of this transaction than that the umbrella to be produced here, is mine.</p>
               <p>ANDREW ROBINSON. On Tuesday, the 9th of this month, this paper was sent up to me by my servant, from a person at the hall door, to solicit charity. I said, I knew nothing about the person. I did not see the person. The servant brought up this paper three times, and said the woman would not go away. I went down stairs to turn her out,and it appeared she was a person who had come frequently to the house before to ask for charity, and I had given her a shilling; she became importunate and clamorous, and would not go away, and I sent for a constable to take her to the watchhouse, and he found on her this umbrella.</p>

               <p>-.I am beadle of St. Ann's Soho. Mr. Roinson sent for me to take this woman, who he said, would not go away. I took her to the watchhouse, and from there to Marlborough-street,and on bringing her back to the watchhouse, I found this umbrella between her legs, under her clothes.</p>

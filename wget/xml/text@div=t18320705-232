            . I live in Stingo-lane, and deal in rabbits. On the 23rd of June the prisoner came and offered to sell me three young rabbits, and an old one; I bought them of Maycock, and paid him for them - I cannot say who brought them; I gave 4s. for the four - Jennings took no part in the bargain; they both came in, and Maycock spoke first.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 23rd of June, I took the prisoner's at Fulham-bridge; I turned them out of a yard; Jennings had 4d.: there was a boy named Perryman with them - after they got to the watch-house, Jennings told me they had sold the rabbits in Stingo-lane, and divided the money between the three, which was 1s. 4d. each.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALESBY. Q. Where is Perryman? A. He was not committed; he had no basket - Jennings did not say, in his presence, that he had a share of the money.(Property produced and sworn to)</p>
               <p>Maycock's Defence. Between eight and nine o'clock in the morning I met this young man and Perryman together; Perryman asked me to buy a rabbit; I said No, but I would tell him where to sell them - we all three went together; I went in to ask the man if he bought rabbits - he said Yes; we took them in, and sold them.</p>
               <p>Jennings' Defence. I met the prisoner in Queen-street; he asked me to buy a rabbit - I said No.</p>
               <p>Jennings received a good character.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. You are pretty sure of that; you did.</p>
               <p>Dixon. Well, I believe I might, I dare say I did: in his right hand breeches pocket, I took these sixteen pieces of base metal; I then searched near the forge, and Blacketer said, here is something here, but I cannot get it out; here is a piece of rag, so I put my fingers in, my fingers being longer than his, and I pulled out these sixteen pieces of pewter, which are for patterns; the coiners generally work with silver patterns, but these are pewter; I searched further, and Grubb, I believe it was, said, Dickson here is a hole in the wall behind Cope, he looks very earnestly at it, I wish you would look into that; then I looked there, and I found eleven six-pences which are finished; and in the same hole, under some little rubbish, I found this milling tool, which is a milling tool for half crowns: I never opened the flask till I came to the Rotation Office, it was hot when I took it, I opened it there, there appeared to be ten six-pences which were run; the top of the flask was hot, (the flask opened) there is a pattern for sixteen in the flask, but the metal run short, there was only metal enough for ten: the sixteen pewter patterns, answer to every six-pence except the finished ones, which have been crooked afterwards: we found aqua fortis, scouring paper, files, sand paper, sand and facings, and every thing that is used in this business; I do not see any thing deficient: here is arsenick, and every thing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What dress was I in? - The prisoner was dressed but meanly, not so well as he is now, he had an apron on, and his hands were dirty, he had his coat on.</p>
               <p>What coat? - I believe it was a black one.</p>
               <p>One or two? - I believe one, but I cannot be particular.</p>
               <p>Was you at the Rose, in Rose-lane, playing at a little table where the marbles roll down, when you sent to Harris's house, to bring me down on this false accusation? - No.</p>
               <p>So you do not know what dress I was in, when you came in at the window? - I think you had black clothes on.</p>
               <p>It is astonishing to me, that a man should come here on his affidavit, and cannot tell what cloaths I had on, had I any cloaths on? - Yes Sir.</p>

               <p>I went with Dickson to this house in Rose lane; I stood behind Dickson, he looked in at the window, I did not look myself, I heard the blowing of the bellows in the shop; I followed Dickson in, and directly saw the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178212040080"></xptr> crucible quite hot, that he had been melting silver in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How do you know it was silver that was melting? - I do not suppose it was, I suppose it was metal; I burned my fingers with it, I felt it for a day or two; the flask when they run the metal in, was hot at the mouth; I held Cope, while Dickson searched him; he pulled out of his breeches pocket, some of the spray, I think sixteen; Dickson and I looked round, and found all the things that are here; Dickson as he brought them out, shewed them to Cope.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How did you examine these things to find they were hot? Did you examine them at all? - Yes, for I burnt my hand most terribly.</p>
               <p>Where was the crucible? - It lay down by the side of the forge.</p>
               <p>Where was the flask? - Just by the side of the anvil.</p>
               <p>Do you know what the anvil and the forge is? - Yes, there is a difference; they were close by one another; the first thing I examined was the crucible and the flask.</p>
               <p>Did you examine what was in the flask that you say now was hot? - They were not opened till we came to the office; I am sure they were warm when they came to the office.</p>

               <p>Court. Circumstances concerning any body that has not given evidence on this trial, are totally irrelevant to the purpose; you will not be admitted to prove these facts about a man that is not here; as to the witnesses that have sworn to positive facts, if you have any thing to say to attack their credit, you may produce any witnesses to that purpose.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The men that have given evidence against me, are a set of men that live entirely by rewards; I have witnesses here, by which I do not doubt but I can prove every thing contrary to what they have said; this is the most treacherous affair that ever was in the world.</p>

               <p>All I have to say is this, on the 12th of November I called on Mr. Harris, who was the man that lived in the house where this Mr. Cope was taken; I called to know whether Cope was taken, and Harris told me very freely that he was taken at his house, and that it was the greatest wonder in the world that he was not taken himself; that he had been a casting, and had put the pot on the fire, and stepped out for some sandpaper, and returning, his window being as usual open, he saw four or five men in the house, and heard his wife and the children crying, with that he stepped back into an alley.</p>
               <p>Court. This is nothing to the purpose, what this man said, have you an thing to say respecting the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Searles. No my Lord, no further than I know Harris to be in that way for some time; I never saw the prisoner at the bar before to day, I know nothing of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I should be glad my Lord, if you will look over this matter of defence, it is absolutely the truth, and nothing else but the truth, (handing up a paper) I am rather disappointed in not having my witnesses here; but if I must lose my life, I must lose it; it is the most wretched thing that ever was known; I am as innocent as one of these sprigs of rue.</p>
               <p>Court. I will read this paper to the jury if you chuse it, but you had better read it yourself.</p>
               <p>The PRISONER read his DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I am a Gun-maker in Goodman's-yard, Minories; having an order, I applied to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178212040083"></xptr> Harris to get some things done, which he promised, if I would bring him a pattern; I went to him in a day or two after, and informed him I could not get the pattern, and I gave him the best instructions I could; he promised to get them done, but did not do them: on the 9th of November, Harris came to my house, and told me he had a gun to repair, and would be glad if I would call at his shop in Rose-lane; I promised to call in a day or two, but in the afternoon Harris came again, and begged me to come as soon as possible that evening, as the person that the gun belonged to was in a particular hurry; that was this set of gentlemen that were waiting: Harris, when he came to my house, observing a gun rammer that my wife was stirring the fire with, he told me he had an old poker at home he would bit for me, and hoped I would not fail coming that evening: having some business in Spital-fields market, I went to Harris's, the door was bolted, they let me in; he said Mr. Cope, I am glad you are come, step this way into the shop, I went immediately, and began blowing the fire; and he laid hold of a poker, and said, this is what I intend for you; blow the fire, and I will step and fetch the gun; and he went out and locked the front door; and as I was blowing the fire, I saw something in the fire, and I put the poker in and stirred it, to see what it was, and finding it a pot, I took it out, and took a pair of bellows and blew the ashes out to see what was in it, finding nothing in it, I threw it out of the fire on the anvil; and then these men came in at the window, with pistols, and said they were come to look for dubs: I do not know what dubs are: they asked for the master of the shop, I said he was stepped out; they looked round the shop, and said, there is something else going forwards, and they searched, and found the things concealed; and now old gentleman they said, we must search you, and they searched me, and found nothing but a farthing about me; I had not been in the shop above two minutes: these fellows did not care who it was they took hold of. This Harris was a deserter; he as been tried twice, and sent to America, he came back again, and robbed a gentleman's house, and was convicted, and sent to the lighters, he received his Majesty's pardon, and entered into Lord Harrington's regiment; and has at different times received rewards from the thief takers: here is Dixon himself, to my certain knowledge, but a few days before, when this Harris was taken up for desertion, he cleared him himself, on consideration he should get him any man that would weigh forty. This is the most wicked thing that ever was done in the world, and if I die for it, I shall not give myself any concern; I am as innocent of it as the child unborn. I had a question or two my Lord which I have omitted.</p>
               <p>Court. By all means, any question that you wish to put.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Dixon. Where did you find the sixteen patterns? - In a hole under the anvil, the anvil stands on the half of an old coach wheel, and they were in the hole of the spokes.</p>

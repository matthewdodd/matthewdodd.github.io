                  </hi>.(<hi rend="italic">Policeman C</hi> 248). On the night of the 26th March I was on duty in Wardour Street, when I saw the prisoners at the corner of the street in conversation—it was about 11.30—they went to the corner of Little Dean Street and crossed to the corner of Little Pultney Street, and went on to Down's Place—after they had been there about ten minutes I went up the court leading into Down's Place—I saw West at the right hand corner at the top of the court leading into Down's Place—the other two prisoners, before I could reach West, came down, and I heard a loud report, like a smash of glass, which I found to be a water-trough which had been broken away from the woodwork—about 19 feet of it had come down right along the end of the premises—it was across the back part of No. 72—when I heard the noise McBean and Benjamin came from the corner where the water trough was broken down to where West was standing—they got part of the way down the court when I closed with them and prevented them passing—I asked them what they had been doing there—McBean replied they had been there to make water, at the same time pointing to some water on the flags—I told him that was not fresh urine and then spoke to him respecting the water trough and asked them if they knew anything about it, and they said they knew nothing about it—two of the prisoners, West and McBean, offered me their names and addresses and mentioned Portland Street—finding no help near me I kept them in quiet conversa<lb></lb>tion for a few minutes, when McBean passed to my left in the direction of the w.c. at the corner—he then came to the corner of the court again and was about to make his escape by trying to pass me, to force himself by me, when I closed with him and kept him back after a violent struggle—Bishop <hi rend="italic">C</hi> 78 came to my assistance—before he came up McBean said that if they had done any damage they would pay for it—Bishop came and the three prisoners were taken into custody—McBean behaved very violently the whole of the time—at the station I searched Benjamin and found on him a box containing matches and a candle (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—before we left Down's Place Bishop received <hi rend="italic">this jemmy (produced</hi>) from Fenton—I saw him hand it to Bishop—I didn't see where he got it from—West said he didn't know the other prisoners and they had only just come from the Surrey Theatre—I afterwards went back with the inspector and examined the place where</p>

               <p>the trough was—that is the gutter against the window—that is a rough sketch of it (<hi rend="italic">pointing</hi>)—I noticed several marks on the shutters about 6 or 7 feet from the ground—the distance from the ground to the line of the pipe is 9 to 10 feet—there is a skylight at the top, so that you can get down from the skylight into No. 72; in fact, could go round the whole block of buildings—there is a urinal in Little Dean Street where they were standing—there is no way out of Down's Place—there are nine little houses round there.</p>

They are all working classes that live in those nine little houses; they form a little square—I believe the w.c. is open to all in the court—I had not been in Down's Place for more than once in a month—McBean tried to slip his clothes and also again in Wardour Street—they gave me their addresses at the station—I went to McBean's and West's; they were correct—I searched there but found nothing—I found the matches on Benjamin—I found the piece of candle and two ordinary penknives—that is all—I sometimes use that kind of matches—I do not think it is common amongst working people for them to carry a piece of candle—it is composite candle—they could see without the candle outside—I never spoke to Shrives about it—I was examined twice at Marl-borough Street—I think when I was first examined I forgot to say anything about McBean being violent in trying to get out of the court—I spoke to Shrives about it after, but not to anyone else in the force.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MOODY</hi>. I searched West's lodgings and found nothing there—West did not tell me his name and address while in Down's Place, Wardour Street—he mentioned 5, Portland Street, that is where he is lodging—all three went down that passage—it was not at the corner that I saw West standing—it was inside the enclosure down Down's Place, the opposite corner to where people turn off to the w.c.—I said before the Magistrate that West mentioned something to me about having been five minutes coming from the Surrey Theatre—he could not get there under two miles—there is no rail or anything of that kind connecting the Surrey Theatre, and Wardour Street—I was present when West was searched—nothing was found on him.</p>

On 26th March, at 11 o'clock at night, I saw the three prisoner's standing at the corner of Little Pulteney Street—when I got into Peter's Street, I heard a whistle—I went down. Wardour Street, and Down's Place—I heard a crash, and I ran into the passage leading into Down's Place, and saw the other constable stopping the three prisoners—I stood in the dark and watched what they were doing—I heard the last witness ask what they were doing, and they said "Making water"—a man named Fenton came out of his house—he immediately went to the closet and pushed the door open and saw a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> there (<hi rend="italic">prod<lb></lb>uced</hi>), and picked it up and handed it to me—as he did so, West and Benjamin made a rush to get past—I seized hold of West and struggled with him, and pushed Benjamin back into the passage again—West said he lived at 5, Portland Street, and that they had been to the Surrey Theatre—I noticed McBean's chin, which had a mark on it as if he had hurt himself on a brick wall, and when I spoke of it he told me to b----myself ah it had nothing to do with me—I found on McBean, a small penknife, and a key.</p>

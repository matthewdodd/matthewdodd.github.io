On the 11th of December, between four and five o'clock, Butt gave me information; the prisoner was then in the shop, purchasing some articles; I staid two or three minutes, till he paid for what he had bought - I then put my hand into his breeches pocket, and pulled out about twenty-six skeins of sewing-silk; I sent for an officer, who found in his coat pocket five silk handkerchiefs, the buttons, and laces, which are ours; he said nothing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you know him before? A. He had been a customer six or seven times; he did not say it was his intention to pay for them; I did not ask if he had not put some articles into his pocket, off the counter: nobody else spoke to him; the things he bought came to 4s. 6d.; he gave me half a sovereign - his change was given to him at Worship-street.</p>

            . The Prisoner is the same Man who was convicted here in July was a Twelvemonth, of stealing Goods and Money in my House, to the value of 39 s.</p>
               <p>Then the Record of his Conviction, and the Order for his Transportation, were read in Court.</p>
               <p>Court. Here is Evidence of his Conviction, and the Order for his being Transported, but do you know that he was carried on board, or delivered to the Care of the Merchant who was to Transport him?</p>
               <p>Gearing. I heard he was delivered to Mr. Forward, but I can't swear it on my own Knowledge.</p>
               <p>Court. Can any of those swear it who had the Care of seeing him put on board?</p>
               <p>Mr. Nichols. In October last we delivered 152 Prisoners on board Mr. Forward's Ship; Mr. Forward gave us a Receipt for them, and I remember the Prisoner's Name was one of them; but among so many, I can't take upon me to swear positively to this Man's Face in particular.</p>

I made out this bill, marked A, to Mrs. Cuffley, for "1 sack of chaff, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I wrote that, and no more, and gave it to Bassett in that state—only one sack of chaff was sent that day by Bassett to Mrs. Cuffley, the other words and figures I know nothing about—when Bassett returned he paid me 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., as the money he had received—this other bill, marked B, is in Mr. Coleby's writing, it was for 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but something else has been added—Bassett paid me 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. upon it when he came borne—I did not see it before it left the shop, and do not know in whose writing this "4 trusses straw" is; but it is not my master's—Bassett took a sack of chaff, and two bushels of oats to Mrs. Cuffley's on 6th Dec.—to the best of my knowledge he did not take a truss of straw.</p>

From information I received from Mr. Cuffley, I went, last Saturday evening, to Mr. Coleby's shop, and while I was speaking to Mr. Gazes, Bassett came in—we were at that time talking about these bills, and drew Bassett's attention to them—he said, "That is my writing," pointing to the signature to both bills; "but that above," pointing to the alteration, "I know nothing about"—I took him into custody, and told him the charge—he said that he knew nothing about it—I then went to Mrs. Cuffley's with these bilk, and saw Earle—I asked him what he had received of Mr. Coleby's man on the 2nd of the present month—he said, "The regular allowance"—I said, "What is that?" he paused for a time, and said, "Chaff, oats, and straw"—I said, "And what on 6th Dec., 1855?"—he said, "The same; chaff oats, and straw"—I asked him if he was sure, he replied, "Yes"—I said that I should take him on a charge of obtaining, by false pretences, sums of money from his mistress—he again paused for a time, and said, "I am very sorry, it is the first time I have ever been in trouble, I only received the chaff," pointing to this bill of 2nd Jan; and pointing to the other bill, "the chaff and oats; and I should not have done it had I not been persuaded to do so by Bassett. I have always borne a good character before"—pointing to the bill, A, he said, "I told him when he brought the first bill that I would have no more of it; it is done now, let it go; we divided the money between us."</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoners' statements before the Magistrate were here read as follows: Earle</hi> says: "I am extremely sorry; it is the first offence I ever committed." <hi rend="italic">Bassett</hi> says: "I have nothing to say about the matter, except that what he told the policeman is all false.")</p>

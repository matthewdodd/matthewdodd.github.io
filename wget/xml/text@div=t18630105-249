                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Holland, a distiller, of Deptford—on 20th December, a man, not the prisoner, came there; and from what he said I expected some one would come there next day—on the 21st he came again with the prisoner to order some gin—they asked if we did not sell less than two gallons—I said, "No," and they went away together—they came again about 4 the same afternoon, and ordered two gallons of gin, to be sent to 18, Albany-road, Old Kent-road—I booked the order, and the prisoner asked me to show him over the distillery; I said, "Certainly"—the cash-box was at my elbow while I booked the order, and the other man could reach it; he had an Inverness cape on—I heard him behind me when the prisoner asked to be shown over the distillery—the prisoner stood where he was while I was finishing the order, and the other man walked out, and got out of my sight—the prisoner then said, "Well, I will not see it to-day, some other time"—I had used the cash-box half an hour before they came in, and put some cash into it—I had occasion to go to it half an hour after they left, no<lb></lb>body having been to it in the mean time—I then found a different cash-box, empty—there had been about 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in mine in cash, and some bills worth from 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went the same night to 18, Albany-road, but no such person was known—on the Sunday week following I met the prisoner at the Elephant and Castle, and gave him in custody—I said, "I charge you with stealing a cash-box;" he said, "I know nothing about it"—when the first man came in on the day before, the cash-box was in the counting-house, and he could see it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a potman, of Tanner's-hill. I heard of the robbery of the cash-box from Mr. Holland's on the same day, Friday—I was then in service at the Royal Albert public-house, New Cross-road, about 300 yards from Mr. Holland's distillery—on that Friday, about 2 o'clock, four men came to my master's house—they had a horse and cart outside—I did not see them come in it or go away in it—they were there about an hour, to the best of my knowledge—the prisoner is one of them; I have no doubt of him—I went in once, and attended on them.</p>

On Saturday, 6th May, I was on duty near the Rising Sun, at Twickenham, and about half past 12 o'clock at night I saw the prisoner in a meadow, in company with Susan Ginman—I knew her—she was sitting on the grass, and the prisoner lying by the side of her</p>

               <p>—I asked what they were doing there—Ginman said she was merely speak<lb></lb>ing to the young man, and giving him a little good advice—the prisoner was in liquor, and she was very much in liquor indeed—I told them they must go away from there, or I should take them to the station—the prisoner got up and walked away as far as the gate of the field, towards Richmond; he then turned round, and said, "Send my mate after me"—I told him to come back and fetch her, seeing that she was very much in liquor—he came back and lifted her up—she said she could not walk, that he had hurt her leg, that he had kicked her—the prisoner said that he had not kicked her, but that if she could not walk he would carry her—he then took her upon his back, and they went away towards Twickenham—about a quarter before 4 o'clock that morning I saw Ginman again, near York-villas, in the Rich<lb></lb>mond road; that was about 300 or 400 yards from the place where I had first seen her—I did not see in what state she was at that time, I did not see anything the matter with her leg—I spoke to her, and she said she had got a pain in her leg—I just moved her off the coping, and then left her.</p>

On Saturday morning, 6th May, about half past 3 o'clock, I was on duty in George-street, Richmond, and saw the prisoner standing at the top of a paved court, not far from George-street—I went down to know his business there at such an early hour; he appeared very drunk, as if recovering from a drunken sleep—I asked what he had been doing there—he said he had been <hi rend="italic">on the lush</hi> all night; that he met with a woman and went across the water with her, and got drinking along with her; that he had everything that was suitable to his mind, and then he had kicked her, and that she said, "Oh, you have broken my leg"—I asked him why he did so—he said that he was so drunk he could not tell what he did—he then pulled out a purse, and told me he had come from Berkshire the day before, and had 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the purse, and the remaining por<lb></lb>tion of it was three half crowns, which he showed me—I directed him to a coffee shop, and did not see him again till he was in custody, the same day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons. I was called between 7 and 8 o'clock on the Saturday morning to attend Susan Ginman—I found her at her own house, by the water side at Twicken<lb></lb>ham—she was sitting on a low stool before the fireplace, and complaining very much of her leg—I examined it, and found a compound fracture of the bones of the leg above the ankle—I had some conversation with her on the subject—I sent her to St. George's Hospital, as it was so bad a fracture, and there were no means of treating it there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at St. George's Hospital. The deceased was brought there on 6th May—I found she had sustained a compound fracture of the leg, about an inch and a half above the ankle—she continued under my care till her death, on the 14th—she died of mortifica<lb></lb>tion of the leg, from the fracture—the wounds on the leg were two lacerated wounds; she was of a bad constitution—about two days before her death I told her that I thought she was not very likely to recover—I think, from my communication to her, she was under the apprehension of speedy death, but T could not swear to that—she said two or three times that she did not think she should recover—she said that after I had told her what my opinion of her case was.</p>

               <p>No; she did not appear to have any friends that she cared about seeing—she had said that she thought she should not recover, two or three times, before I made the communication to her—it is not uncommon with some persons to state that, without haying any definite notion that they are really going to die directly, it depends very much upon the temperament of the patient.</p>

About 3 o'clock on the morning of 6th May, I was on duty in the Richmond-road, Twickenham, near the Rising Sun—I was on horseback—I met the prisoner carrying Susan Gin<lb></lb>man—she stated in his presence that he had kicked her, she did not state it in the shape of a complaint—the prisoner replied, "No, I have not kicked you"—she was very drunk, and the prisoner also—I asked her how he did it; she made no answer—I asked her a second time, after more conversation—she made no answer—I then asked her if he did it for the purpose—she said, "No, I don't know about that"—I afterwards apprehended the prisoner, about 2 o'clock that same afternoon—I found him asleep by the water side at Richmond—I told him the charge—he said he was not aware that he had kicked her—I observed a quantity of blood on the back part of the legs of his trowsers, and some on the front part of his boots—my brother constable asked him some questions about the blood, and he said his comrade's nose had been bleeding the night previous, and that was how the blood came on his trowsers—I had known the deceased nearly four years, she was a drunken, dissipated character—she professed to earn her living by millinery, but the principal part of her occupation was that of a prostitute.</p>

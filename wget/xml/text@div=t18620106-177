                  </hi>. I am a music publisher, and live at 21, Soho<lb></lb>square—on 16th September the prisoner came there in broad daylight—I believe it was between 12 and 1 o'clock—she said, "Mr. Jefferies, have you the Dixie's Land Polka?"—I said, "No"—she said, "That is very strange, I buy all my popular music at your shop"—I said, "I am a publisher; if you ask for what I publish you can get it"—she then asked me if I could recommend any pretty little thing—I took up a piece of music which was published the day before, called the Curragh Camp Galop, and said, "This is very pretty, if you take it on my recommendation, and don't like it, you can change it—she just opened it, closed it, and said, "That will do very well"—the price was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she gave me a sovereign—I have three bowls in my till; one for silver, one for copper, and one for gold—from the bowl for gold I took a half-sovereign, there being only one there, and put on the counter—she took it up—1 then took out 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and while I was doing that she appeared accidently to drop the half-sovereign on the counter—she said, "Dear me, that has a very strange sound, perhaps it is your old counter"—my counter is old and rough—I took the half-sovereign in my hand, and paid, "Bad, very bad"—I called to my son, And said, "George, have you taken a half-sovereign this morning?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Who from?"—he said, "From Cramer's collector"—I gave him the half-sovereign to look at, which the prisoner had given me back—he said, "I never took this half-sovereign; I never could have taken such a half-sovereign as this"—she heard that—I said, "Well, the lady gives it me back"—I took a good half-sovereign out of my pocket and gave it to her, and she went away with it, and the 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and the music—I took the other half-sovereign, put it in a piece of paper, put it in a cash box, and kept it so by itself, until about a week or ten days back—I then went to the office of the solicitor to the Mint, at the Treasury, Whitehall, and showed it to him—I made a mark on it, and on 1st December I gave it into the possession of the policeman—my son George had been to the till that morning, but no one else—the till is never left open—I and each of my sons have a key, and the till is unlocked every time it is opened—no other money had been taken out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Tegg, a publisher, in Pan<lb></lb>crass-lane—on Wednesday morning, 18th December, about 12 o'clock, the prisoner came there and asked for a copy of "Chesterfield's advice to his Son"—I gave her one—the price was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she gave me a sovereign, and asked if I could give her change—I gave her 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a half-sovereign—I had half turned round, and she rung the half-sovereign on the counter and said, "Dear me, this does not sound very well, I think your board if very hollow"—I immediately picked it up and found it was bad; and not the one I gave her—I am certain of that—I then sent for an officer and gave her in custody—Mr. Lindrum, another clerk, was in the shop at the time when I gave the woman change—I asked him for two half-sovereigns for a sovereign, and he gave them to me—he rung them both on the counter very carefully before he gave them to me, and I gave the prisoner one of them—I had seen her two years previously—it was in consequence of having known her that I asked Lindrum for the half-sovereigns.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you no half-sovereigns in the till? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—Lindrum is a fellow clerk of mine—my asking him for two half-sovereigns was all that passed between us—that was the only communica<lb></lb>tion I made to him—I looked carefully at the money I received from him, and saw it was good—I did not look at the date of the coinage, nor did I sound it—I could have got change from the counting-house, and should have done so, but it was to ascertain for a certainty that the money was good that I asked Mr. Lindrum for it—the reason was not because I had no money in the till—1 had half turned round before she sounded it—I gave her the opportunity of keeping that or substituting one for another—I never said that she could not have had time to do it—I did not say it in answer to the Lord Mayor, at the Mansion House—I never said that in consequence of her movements being so closely watched she could not have got rid of the money; I swear that—when she returned, the money I put it in the crack of the counter and tested it—Collins, the warehouseman, called out to me, "Don't do that, for good gold will break"—Lindrum was engaged at the counter with some books—I will swear he was not reading the newspaper—besides Collins there was, in the warehouse, a clerk, named Jay, at the desk—there were several others there besides me and Lindrum—Mr. Tegg was not there—I do not know that the man said, "Good gold will break;" but he objected to my putting it in the counter to try it—I</p>

               <p>went with the prisoner to the station, watching her all the time—it was not the half-sovereign I bad given her, but the one I had back from her, that I was going to test—before that I said, "This is a bad one; I know you, you have been here before"—she did not say it was a bad one, but thought it sounded bad, and then I tested it—it was 24th January, 1860, that I had seen her before—I was examined alone on the first examination—Lindrum was present, but was not called—I do not know why—I have no recollection of saying to Lindrum either on the first or second examination, "You will swear that the two half-sovereigns were good that you gave me, as no bad money was found on her;" nothing of the kind—I did not see the prisoner get rid of any more, or substitute one coin for another—the sovereign she gave me was perfectly good.</p>

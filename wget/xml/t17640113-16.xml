On Sunday the 17th of July, my husband and I were both out, at about five in the morning; we came home between nine and ten. I had seen the money, and counted it on the Wednesday before: upon going to the money, we miss'd it. About a month or five weeks after, I was going up stairs to a woman that mends old cloaths, that lives in the house the prisoner does; going by his room door, I saw him counting a great parcel of half crowns out of his hand into a green purse: I went home and told my husband of it; we knew he was wanting money before; we had often lent him money; the most at a time was 13 s. he owned us 20 s. and 3 d. and had paid me between eight and nine days after our money was gone, and I recollecting that when I was at his house, I laid my key of the room down on his table, while I dined with him. I saw him have it in his hand, but when I went to go away, it could not be found. I was forced to have my lock taken off, for another key to be fitted to it; the lock was not altered at all; and the prisoner had bought cloaths and a great many things: these things together, made me suspect he had got in, and taken my money. I never got the money again.</p>

He was carried before Justice Culpeper, (he chose to go before him) he was discharged: then I heard him say, Come along, my boys, we will spend a crown of the money now. His trunk not having any direction upon it, as he was going with it, was brought back again to the George-Inn, in Aldersgate-street. I desired the bookkeeper to let me know of it when it came, which he did: we let him come to own it, that we might be sure it was his trunk; there I was ready with a constable, and took him up again. I had before he came, had a constable, and opened the trunk: we found 17 half crowns in it, and 3 l. in small silver. I had, before it was opened, described a half crown that was all like sand holes on the tail side, and that was found amongst them; (produced in court) this I know to be my property, and was amongst the money I lost.</p>

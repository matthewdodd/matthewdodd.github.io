                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and lire in Whitecombe-street, St. Martin-in-the-fields. The prisoner came to my shop on the 10th of April, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, and said he wanted a pair of trowsers; that he had got a pair on that he had bought of me, which he approved of, and that was the cause of his coming for another pair—I showed him a pile of waistcoats and trowsers—he pulled down three waist-coats and a pair of trowsers—there was a man at the door in the passage—that man opened the shop door, and the prisoner went off with a pair of trowsers and three waistcoats—he walked out—I called out "Stop thief," and he was shortly secured—I have seen the property at the station-house.</p>

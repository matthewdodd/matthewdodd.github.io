On the 13th of February the two prisoners came into our shop, and enquired for an article which we had not got, according to the pattern that she had in her hands. I told her we could make the article if they would wait for them; they said it was for a gentleman, they would go and enquire, and perhaps return; the woman said she would buy a pair of half stockings, some people call them socks; I shewed her some and she bought a pair and paid for them; she gave me half a crown, I had to return her sixpence; we have two tills, I had to run from one counter to the other; I fetched sixpence and gave to her; prior to that I had sold twelve pair of stockings to a gentleman; I was putting them up intending to send them home, when the prisoners came into the house. I rolled them round with the paper they were then in, with intent to serve the prisoners; I pushed them near to the end of the counter, there were more goods on the counter; these silk stockings laid next to the prisoner; when I had given them the change, and they had gone out of the shop, I missed the dozen of silk stockings from the counter, that I had rolled round with the paper; I ran out of the house to look after the prisoners, I did not see any more of them till the 14th of April; I caused them to be apprehended in Covent Garden.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Walford. You never saw the prisoner in the house before - A. No. They were in the shop about ten minutes, talking about the hose and looking them out.</p>
               <p>Q. Two months had elapsed before you saw them - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A number of people come in the shop - what made you recognize them - A.He had a light great coat on, and a hand basket in his hand; he had that coat on when he was taken, and the hand basket.</p>
               <p>Court. That hand basket was convenient to put any thing in - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. These twelve pair of silk stockings were sold - A. Yes, to Mr. Scott, but they were not delivered; we were obliged to buy another dozen to deliver to him.</p>
               <p>MR. ROWLAND. I am a friend of Mr. Hummel's.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in his shop to assist on the 13th of February - A. I was out when the prisoners came in the shop; I found them in the shop when I returned, as I walked through the shop I saw the man take a parcel off the counter; I am positive to the man; he put it into the hand basket he had in his hand; the woman had a parcel in her hand, which she put in her muff when they went away; the first witness said, I will see if the hose are all right; after the prisoners were gone he missed twelve pair of silk stockings.</p>

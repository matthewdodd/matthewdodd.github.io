                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live at Hampstead—I had a grey pony gelding turned out on Hampstead heath on the afternoon of the 28th of January, and missed it about six o'clock that day—I found it at Mrs. Paramenter's, a horse slaughterer, in Maiden-lane, Battle Bridge—it was returned to me on the 31st, by Watts—it is now at the livery stable over the way—I gave 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I have seen the prisoner about Hamp<lb></lb>stead with a basket.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Mrs. Parmenter, a horse slaughterer, in Maiden-lane. On the 28th of January the prisoner brought a horse there, which I bought of him, for 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and returned it to Buckle—the prisoner asked 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—when I had bought it, I said, "Who am I to put it down to?"—he said, "To Mr. Buckle, of Hampstead"—we enter every horse we tray, in a book—I did not ask the prisoner his name—we buy of persons whose names we do not know—Mr. Buckle came himself about an hour afterwards, and claimed the pony—I delivered it to him on the following Monday.</p>

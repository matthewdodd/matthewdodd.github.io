I had no suspicion of his robbing me; but the landlord of the house where he lodged, came and told me he led a very irregular life, and he had reason to believe he had robbed me, for that he had seen tea littered about his box in his lodgings. I went to his lodgings before I spoke to him, to see if I could make any discovery; there I saw his box, in which was a crack in the bottom, I shook it, and there came out some loose tea. Then I went home and taxed him with it, and told him, what information I had had against him. I told him, I insisted upon searching his lodgings; he hesitated a little. I then asked him, if he ever had taken any tea from me? he said, he believed a little matter, a quarter of a pound, or so. I said, have you never taken chocolate? to which he made much the same answer. I said, for your own character, as well as my satisfaction, I shall insist upon searching your lodgings. He went with me, but did not care for opening the box. He said he had lost the key. Then I said, I would get a warrant and have it broke open. Then he took the hinges off the box; there we found three pounds of chocolate, and five or six pounds of tea, in different parcels; and some sugar, in different parcels. The sugar I can't swear to. The chocolate is marked with the two initial letters of our names, W. T. I took the prisoner before a magistrate, and he committed him to Newgate. His lodgings being out of the city I took him before Mr Welch.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner confess any thing?</p>
               <p>Wilson. He owned at his lodgings, before me and two others, that he had taken the things mentioned.</p>

            , the woman of the house where the prosecutrix lives. I went down to the pump for some water, when I returned, my mistress sent me to pawn the things on Snow-hill? I have not seen her since I have been in prison.</p>

               <p>To the prosecutrix. How long was it after you lost the things before you took the prisoner? - I went to synagogue at seven, returned at nine, and found my door broke open; the prisoner was in the house when I went out; she was out when I returned, and did not come home till noon; then I got a warrant and took her, and had her before Justice Justice Sherwood, and she owned taking the things to the officer. I did not hear it myself.</p>
               <p>Did you hear own it yourself? - Yes; at the justice's I heard her own it; I told her before we went to the justice, if she would own it it would better for her, and I would pay for the things; but she would not. I made her no promise afterwards.</p>

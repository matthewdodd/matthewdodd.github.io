                  </hi>. I am a hosier of 44, Fleet-street—on 21st May, about half-past 5 o'clock, the prisoners came together to my shop—Kelly asked for some pocket handkerchiefs—I got a pile of ten or twelve pieces, and placed them not before them, but near them on the counter—I opened seven or eight pieces and threw them on the counter—Kelly opened a piece on the top of those which I had opened, and complained that it felt stiff and harsh, and was very much pressed—she asked if I had nothing better—Rose was about three feet from her, and had a child suckling—I told Kelly we had handkerchiefs hemmed and washed, and she could tell better what they were—she asked me to lot her see them, and while I partly turned round to get the paper down, I saw a move of Kelly's arm, and when I turned round I missed a piece of light coloured silk-handkerchief; the only light piece that I had left before them—I took no notice of that, but showed her the others—she took no notice of them, but said she would have one off a piece which was opened, and I cut one off the piece—she gave me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay for it, and I had to give her 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—before I gave her change I cleared the other handkerchiefs from the counter, and I said, "I miss a piece of light coloured handkerchief, one of you must have got it, which is it?"—Kelly rose from her seat and said she was surprised at the charge—I reached over the counter and looked over in hopes of seeing the piece, but there was none—Kelly was then stand<lb></lb>ing away from the counter—I told them I was positive I had lost it, and I said, "One of you must have it"—they both declared their innocence, and said I might search them—I said, "I can't do that, but I will send for a policeman"—I said to one of my assistants. "Go fetch a policeman"—Kelly was then standing; I said, "You had better sit down," and she took her seat again—the policeman arrived, and Kelly again rose from her seat and said, "I have not got them, you may search me"—I wanted to re<lb></lb>cognise what pattern it was I missed, and I stepped to the other counter where I had lain the other to see which pattern it was—the policeman came towards me away from the prisoners, he spoke to me, and in the mean<lb></lb>time Kose had got up from her seat and took the seat where Kelly had been sitting—the chair must have been moved about six feet away—on turning round Rose was sitting down, and I pointed to the officer and said, "There is the piece of handkerchief I have lost"—it was then on Rose's dress aud rolled up; it was partly on her dress and partly against the counter—it had before been spread out three-quarters of a yard long—the policeman took the handkerchief, and I gave the prisoners in charge—this is the piece of handkerchief—it cost me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 315). I was called to the prosecutor's shop on 21st May, just before 6 o'clock—I saw the prisoners sitting on chairs before the counter—I told them they were charged with stealing silk hand<lb></lb>kerchief—I looked, but could see nothing—I walked past them to speak to the prosecutor, and after I passed them I saw the child move—I spoke to the prosecutor and then went and took this piece of handkerchief; it was standing between the chair and the counter, and partly resting on Rose's dress and partly on the ground—I had passed near the spot before and looked all around—I am sure if the piece of handkerchief had been there I should have seen it—the prisoners were given in charge.</p>

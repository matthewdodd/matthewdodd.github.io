                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live at 1, Queen's Place, Green<lb></lb>wich—the prisoner was in my service about three months—his duty was to carry the bread out to customers, and do anything I required of him besides—it was his duty to receive money from customers and deliver it to me in the evening—I have missed money which he had not accounted for to me—he left my service on the 22nd July—he had not given me any notice—I heard nothing of him till the 30th August, when I saw him and gave him in charge.</p>

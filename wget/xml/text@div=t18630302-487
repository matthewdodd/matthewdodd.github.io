Mr. Taylor was there, and it was through his mentioning the name, that I went in search of the prisoner—the dying man saw the prisoner brought into the hospital, and said in English, "That is the man that stabbed me"—the prisoner said that he was the man who had done it, not in English; he cannot speak English—Mr. Taylor interpreted what he said—the small pocket-knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was found on the prisoner.</p>

I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital—the deceased was brought there about half-past 10 or rather later, with a wound in his abdomen—the greater part of the contents had already escaped; the intestines were out in three places, and in one place they were nearly severed—it is quite possible that those three cuts might be the effect of one thrust—there was a great deal of hemorrhage, and he died thirteen days afterwards, of peritonitis caused by the wound—there was also a trivial incised wound on the right shoulder—I have heard that the prisoner said he was endeavouring to wrest the knife from the deceased, and he turned it and cut himself—I think that is possible—the wound was three inches and a half long—this knife would not produce it.</p>

I was going in a ship as cook to Shanghai; prisoner was going in our ship as cook; at 9.30 last night I went to prisoner's house; I saw him there; I asked him to come to my house in Limehouse; he said, 'No, not to-night.' I went back to Limehouse, and in five minutes he came to my place; the master of the house, his wife and two children, were there; his name is Blumber; prisoner said, 'Ahqui, you go and buy opium'; I said, 'No, I'll not go, you go yourself; I said, 'It's too late, I've walked till I'm tired, I'll not go'; the master was there at the time; prisoner asked me again to go out at half-past 10; I went with him; we were good friends up to that time; we walked four or five streets, when he said in Chinese, 'God d—you,' and he took a long knife from his pocket and gave me two blosubpœnaed, one in the belly and the other on the left shoulder. I had had no quarrel with him, no angry words, no blosubpœnaed; I ran away from him and called, 'Policeman'; I ran till I fell down; I never was in London before, and I don't know the street, but it was near some water where he struck me; the prisoner is the man. I had taken away a coat from his place last evening; it belonged to me; it had never belonged to the prisoner; I had lent it to him two weeks ago, and I took it back yesterday; he never said it was his coat: he didn't object to my taking it away; I don't know why he struck me; he said nothing; we had been good friends; I have never hindered him from going as cook in any ship; I don't know that prisoner was ever in the Strangers' Home, in the West India-road; the first time that ever I saw him was when he came to my ship; it is a very bad wound; I am in great pain; I don't know whether I shall get well again").</p>

I left the Sailors' Home and went to the Highway; then Ahqui never came ashore for a fortnight after this, and never gave me any money, and I had nothing to eat; then I went to his vessel and asked him for the money and watch; when I went into the galley to find him, Ahqui went into the cabin and told the captain and first-mate to turn me ashore; I went three times and they turned me out of the ship, and I went to the next vessel; I had no money and nothing to eat, and pawned all my best clothes to keep myself; then I went to the Dockyard to find a vessel</p>

Ahqui asked a Chinaman to lend him money; he would not, and Ahqui stabbed him in the arm; that Chinaman went away a month ago; the old Chinaman that lives under the railway arch can prove it; I have got nothing more to say."</p>

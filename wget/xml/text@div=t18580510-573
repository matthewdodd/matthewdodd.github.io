                  </hi>. I am a cigar manufacturer, at No. 4, Park Terrace, Cannon Street Road. On the morning of 3d April, at 6 o'clock, I found that my premises had been broken open—they were secure the night before—I I missed 160 lbs. of cigars, which were just manufactured—these cigars (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are my manufacture—I know the premises were fastened up at 6 o'clock the night before—we were about till 12 o'clock in the garden, and if the doors had been opened we should have seen them—a pair of folding doors, going into the top factory, had been forced open—they have to be got up to by a ladder; there was a ladder at the bottom of the yard—the stile of these doors was forced away—it is half glass and half panel—the warehouse is in the parish of St. George's-in-the-East.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 379). On Sunday night, about 11 o'clock, I went to the prisoner's house, and said, "Have you got any cigars here, we are police officers?" he said, "I have got a few in a box"—I took them out I of the box; there were nearly 10 lbs.—I looked round the room, and found a carpet bag under a mangle, in which were 5 lbs. or 6 lbs.; on the top of the mangle was a lady's bonnet box, in which I found this bundle of cigars (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I weighed them all afterwards, and they weighed 17 3/4 lbs.—I asked him where he bought them; he said, "Of a man for a sovereign, last Friday morning, in a public house"—he was told the charge at the station, and made no answer to it—I found other things in the room.</p>

I asked the prisoner, when the cigars in the box were found, whether he had any more cigars in the house, and he said, "No;" I said, "You may say what you like, but we will proceed to search;" and Copping took out a carpet bag, containing cigars, from under the mangle—the prisoner then said, "That is all I have; there is no more;" and, when the bundle was found in the hat box, he said, "I really did not know I had such a thing as that in the house at all;" and at the station he repeated the same statement; and I asked him there how he became possessed of them; he said, "I bought them of a man for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in a public house; in what street, I do not know; it is down a step"—he did not ask me to go there, or offer to go with me—I heard the sergeant ask him at the station where the public house was; he said, "I know the house, but I do not know where it is; I cannot tell you the street."</p>

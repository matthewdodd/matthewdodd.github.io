In consequence of information I went to his room on the 27th of October; I found him about nine o'clock the next morning - he lodged at my house - I told him he had taken something of mine. The officer wished me to leave the room, which I did. I found two duplicates in the fob of his old trowsers, which were in a box, that did not belong to him - I never knew him to use it. Next morning I went to the pawnbroker's, and found a child's dress and a pair of black trowsers, which were mine, and had been in my shop; and at Benton's I found another dress; I don't know when they were taken - I had bought one only a month before. He worked at piece-work - I occasionally left him in care of the shop; he was then paid 4 d. an hour. I at times sent him out with garments, for which I paid him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. - Q. Had you missed the clothes - A. No, they hung in the shop for sale. I knew the trowsers were his, having seen him wear them. He acted as my head man; I placed great confidence in him. He was going to be married, he said, he intended to redeem them after his marriage, and return them.</p>

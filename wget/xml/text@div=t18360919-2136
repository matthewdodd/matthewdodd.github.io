                  </hi>. I am the sister of the last witness. I live with my father and mother at Ely—I was with my sister at Cambridge in July—I saw Feaks at the Little Rose after I had been at my sister's about a fort<lb></lb>night, and I asked him if he had a parcel from my mother—he said no, he had not, and he said he had got situations for me and my sister—he said my sister's was a nurse-maid's, but he did not know what mine was—it was in the Borough—nothing was said about going to London then—we went the following week, and he said, "Are you ready to go?"—I said "No, we cannot go this week, but will go next"—that was at the same time—next Thursday we took our things up, but the wagon had not get in, and we waited, and when it came we put our boxes in—we waited which he baited the horses, then got in, and came off to London—we arrived at the One Swan, in Bishopsgate-street, about half-past four o'clock on Saturday morning—we staid there till nine o'clock, and asked if the good lady was coming—Feaks said, "Yes, I have sent the porter for her"—Mrs. Jones came by herself—she said she was the person who wanted the two servants—we were coming down the yard—Pettit, the porter, was with her, and he said, "These are the two young girls"—Feaks then came across the road to us—he did not say any thing—he and the porter went away—Mrs. Jones then ordered a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and the porter to put the boxes into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he said, "The booking comes to 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—he put the boxes in, and Mrs. Jones, my sister, and myself went to No. 2, Lombard-court—Mrs. Jones paid the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-man, and the porter for the boxes—when we got in it seemed a respectable kitchen, all full of covers all about—she asked us to have break<lb></lb>fast, and said we had better lie down, for we must be tired with travelling on the road two nights—Feaks came there in about half an hour, and the porter with him, I believe—I did not hear them say any thing—I was not in the bar—went into the bar—I afterwards went and lay down—on Sunday Mrs. Jones took us out walking—on Monday she told me to go out walking, and showed me in and, out, and told me which way to go—I went and walked up and down Fleet-street—nothing took place that Mon<lb></lb>day—on Tuesday I was walking down Fleet-street, and a gentleman fol<lb></lb>lowed me into the house—Mrs. Jones told us to go up stairs—she went up with us, and took 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the room—the gentleman ordered some negus for us to drink, and then he wanted me to go on the bed—I resisted, and would not—there was a sofa in the room, and * * * * * * *—after that he got up, and gave me half a sovereign—I gave it to Mrs. Jones—he went away, and I saw no more of him—Mrs. Jones would never let</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now if your sister has taken her oath, that after five o'clock she went out in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with a gentleman, and staid out an hour on that very Monday evening, has she sworn the truth? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am, very sorry to say it, but I am quite wrong—she was introduced to a gentleman on the Monday, and went out with him afterwards in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and he showed her about, and brought her back again to Mrs. Jones's, as near as I can guess about eight o'clock—my sister was introduced to a gentleman on Monday, I do not know at what hour, I was not at home—I was walking in Fleet-street—I walked up and down, and then went in—we did not have our tea till five o'clock—we were about an hour at tea—my sister had tea with us—we went to bed after tea, and did not go out at all—it was between ten and eleven o'clock next morning that the gentleman followed me in—my sister was up then—we did not walk together when we went to Fleet-street—(we did not go to bed generally till three o'clock in the morning)—I got up between seven and eight o'clock on Tuesday—it was after dinner in Monday that my sister went out in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with the gentleman, and after he seduced her—we dined at twelve o'clock.</p>

               <p>laughed and said so—we were all laughing together—I do not think she said she was going to London with <hi rend="italic">Old Patty</hi>—I have very heard Feaks called <hi rend="italic">Old Patty</hi>—I did not hear my sister says she was going to London with <hi rend="italic">Old Patty.</hi>—my sister lived with Mrs. Arbour at Emanuel College—she had another servant in my sister's place when we came away—I do not know the young woman—I know her by sight—I do not know her name nor any thing about her—she had not come before my sister left—we have seen her since in the street—my sister and I were at the fair together—I chatted to various people in the fair—I saw that young woman in the fair, I do not know her name—I never had any conversation with her—she is the girl who got no sister's place after she left Mrs. Arbour's—we had no conversation with her in the fair whatever—she said nothing to me or my sister—she might say, "How do you do?"—my sister did not know her name—she has been a girl in the street, I believe—my sister told me she was the girl who succeeded her at her place—there is an mis<lb></lb>take about that—I was at my mother Goddard's house, at Cambridge, about a fortnight—Ann Clark used to visit there—we left my brother's to come to London to this place—we told him that Feaks had got us a situ<lb></lb>ation, and that we were coming to London, and we came from his house—the wagon starts a mile or a mile and a half from my brother's house, from the Little Rose, and we both got in at the Little Rose, where it starts from—there is no mistake at all about that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If your sister swore you did not get in there, but followed the wag<lb></lb>on and overtook it, is that true? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> yes, it is true—we did walk on the road, and get in on the road—I do not know Francis Freeman, belonging to Wright and Shelford's wagon—I do not remember walking with the wagoner—I did not ask half a crown from any body at Hoddesdon for walking out with him in the evening—I never asked Freeman for half a crown, nor any young man—I swear that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you talking out with any body between eight and nine o'clock in the evening of the 8th of July, at a place on the road where all the wagons stop, and where yours stopped among the rest? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I never walked with any young man on the road or in the fields, not coming with the wagon—I did not—I swear that positively—I do not know George Everett by name (<hi rend="italic">looking at him</hi>) I do not know that young man—he knows nothing of me, nor I of him—he is the boy who came up when we came along in the wagon—there was a man and his wife, and six children, in the wagon,—I got out of the wagon with the woman. and helped her to carry her child—I did not get out between ten and eleven o'clock at night—I swear that positively—nor was I taken out—I remained in the wagon all night—I rode a little way outside—I cannot tell what o'clock it was—it was night—it was so very full I could not sit for the children when I first got into the wagon—I did keep in all night, but it was the next evening I got out, and rode on the foot-board a little way—after we got in I kept in all night, and my sister too—the second evening I rode by the side of the woman, with her little boy and that lad, outside—it was not very light nor very dark—it was about ten o'clock in the evening, or be<lb></lb>tween and eleven—I got out of the wagon myself—nobody lifted me out—I did not walk with any body—I got out, and got behind, and sat immediately on the foot-board—my sister was in the wagon—no wagoner kissed me or took any liberties with me that night—that I swear.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose, as your sister and you slept together on Monday night, she told you of the liberty the man had taken with her, and of his giving her the negus? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, she did not—we always slept together(—I took the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. after I was violated—I told my sister what had happened to me the next day—she did not tell me what had happened to her—Mrs. Jones told me she had been seduced—that was before I was introduced to the gentleman—Mrs. Jones did not tell me how much money my sister had got.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my mother in Cambridge. I went to live at Mrs. Arbour's after Mary Vale left—she knew I had succeeded her—I went the day she left, and saw her there—she had not finished her work when I went—she saw me—I remember being in the fair with Jessy Revel, and met the two Vales—we spoke to them—they said they were coming to London, and going to a place where they wanted several young girls—she said it was at an old <hi rend="italic">bawd's</hi>, and they expected to have <hi rend="italic">slap-up</hi> silk dresses—the evening before they left Cambridge I was with Revel, and met them—they had asked us the week before if we intended coming to London—when we said we should decline coming, they said were d----d fools—I said I thought we would stop in service and better ourselves at home, and I had no friends in London—she said she had been waiting a week for us, and she did not care much about our coming, for if we had, she should have been blamed for it.</p>

                  </hi>. I was assistant to the prisoner Feaks's wagon till last Midsummer. I have known the two Vales by sight about twelve months or more. On Thursday, the 23rd of June, the day before Mid<lb></lb>summer fair, Feaks and I started with the wagon—the two girls came up, and said they wanted to go to Cambridge, and we let them ride—Mrs. Onyons and Clark were there—we stopped at Mr. Prime's, and they got out there—while standing at the door they said they were going to stop at Cambridge fair, and then should go to London with us in the wagon—I remember Clark leaving her clogs behind her—the two Vales came for them, and took them out of Mr. Prime's house—on the road they said they should have a <hi rend="italic">flare-up</hi> at Cambridge, and then they should go to London—I remember on our road to London, the Wisbeach wagon joining ours between Enfiled-highway and Ponder's-end—the wagoner lifted Betsey Vale out of the wagon—this was between twelve and one o'clock at night—they stopped behind—it was quiet dusk in the night—I could not see what they were after—they never caught me till I got to Pon<lb></lb>der's-end—they were nearly a mile behind—they went away together—his wagon was before mine, and I minded both wagons—I saw Francis Freeman go out with Mary Vale at Hoddesdon—they went down the yard, but were not gone long—I was riding on the foot-board at one time, and after the wagoner left her, at Ponder's-end, she came and rode with me on the foot-board all the way to London.</p>

               <p>besides you and the two girls? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, a man and woman, and some children—they were in the wagon when she left, and her sister also—Feaks was in the wagon with them, asleep, I believe—they said they were going to live in London, and Feaks said he was going to take them to a place, one as a house-maid, and the other as a nurse-maid.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cousin to the Vales' father. I came with their mother to London, and went with her to Mrs. Jones'—I did not go into the room with her—I staid below—when they came down Mrs. Jones asked Mrs. Vale if she was going to take her daughters home—she said "Yes"—Mrs. Jones said she would have had them gone home six or seven days before, but they did not seem willing to go—when they got out of the door the mother said, "You shall go home with me"—Mary answered, and they both said they would not go home, for they had a room of Mrs. Jones at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. week. and Mrs. Jones behaved like a mother to them; she was so kind—after they said so many times they would not go house, the mother said she would leave them in the place till they should get a better place—Mrs. Jones was not present at this conversation—it was in the street.</p>

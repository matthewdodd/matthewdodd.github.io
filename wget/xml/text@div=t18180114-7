On Thursday evening, the 8th of January, about five o'clock, I was in the kitchen, and saw a woman go out of the door - I had not seen her come in; she was making towards the door to make her escape; my fellow-servant inquired if we had seen a woman of her description in the passage; I was looking for her when my fellow-servant, the laundry-maid, called out "here is the woman." I desired her to shut the door immediately, and went up to the prisoner, took her by the arm, and found a coat and a pair of sheets under her arm. I asked her what her business was there? she said she was a poor distressed woman, and came in to speak to the housekeeper. I asked her why she did not inquire for her, but she made me no answer. I then asked her what possessed her to do so; she said she was a poor deranged woman, and begged I would pardon her.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Croker. I heard a bustle in the passage on Thursday the 8th of January, on looking I saw the prisoner coming towards the pantry; I went to inquire who and what she was, and in a few minutes I saw her in the pantry, and my coat, and a pair of sheets, taken from under her left arm. I had seen my coat about ten minutes before; it was almost new; I had only worn it four or five times, and it cost me 5l.</p>

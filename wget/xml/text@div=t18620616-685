                  </hi>. I am an omnibus time-keeper, of Shepherd's-bush—on 2d May, about 7 o'clock, I was in the road by Shepherd's-bush—there was a performance of dogs, and a crowd collected—the prisoner was driving a dust-cart and standing on the shaft—I saw a child walking in the road, in the same direction as the cart—I turned my head to look at the dogs, and found the cart drawing on to the child—I held up my hand for the prisoner to stop, but he took no notice—I ran and took the child as the wheel knocked it down, and saw the wheel go over its head and neck—he had a bit of rope for reins—the prisoner kept on, but I ran and stopped his horse—I believe he did not know that he had run over a child—he was drunk.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 42, Norland-road, Shepherd's-bush, and am a dealer in paper-hangings—I saw a crowd in the road looking at the per<lb></lb>formance of dogs—I saw the prisoner standing on the shaft of a dust-cart driving with rope reins—the crowd was completely across the end of the street, and when the cart got near it, the man desisted with his performance of dogs, and the crowd nearly all moved over to the near side with him—I heard somebody shout "Stop, stop," and saw the man pull his horse away, as if he was trying to miss the crowd—a child ran from the side of the road; not the side the crowd was on—the cart diverged out of the square to miss the crowd—the child was coming in that direction, and ran across the horse, and the wheel went over it—it all happened in two or three seconds—it made me feel ill, and I stepped into a shop door for a minute or two, looked out again, and saw the cart standing there—the man seamed amazed, as if he did not know what to do—he left his cart and turned down the street, as if he would go home—some people stopped him, and in about ten minutes he went to his horse again, and drove it from Shepherd-bush gate—he was neither drunk or sober; it was evident he had had some liquor.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did it appear to you that the death was the result of an accident? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Decidedly—the prisoner was looking at the crowd on the near side; and if I look at my Lord, I cannot see the jury—I am convinced that it was an accident, and not the consequence of any carelessness—I was examined before the Coroner's jury, and they returned a verdict of accidental death—the child was three or four yean old.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Parker Wolff, and live at No. 3, Guildford-place, Clerkenwell; he is principal clerk to Mr. Flower, the attorney, in Hatton-garden. The prisoner was in our service about a month—I had a character with her—in consequence of suspicion I examined her box on the 25th of March—it was in the back-kitchen, unlocked—she was not present—I found in it a yard of paramatta, which is a woollen cloth, and is used to make ladies' dresses—it is my property—I have compared it with the piece from which it was taken, and it corresponds—I bare it here—when my husband came home I mentioned it to him, and he told her that he suspected she was a thief—she said it was a lie—he said how could she account for the yard of paramatta found in her box—she said it was a lie, that she had bought it at Manchester House for half-a-crown, and if I took it she should consider that I had stolen it—she was to leave that evening.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable G</hi> 58.) The prisoner was given into my custody between three and four o'clock on Friday afternoon, the 25th of March, at Mr. Wolff's house—I told her to come up stairs—she refused—I said, "It is a bad job"—she said, "It is"—I asked her how she came by this piece of cloth—she said she had purchased it—as I was taking her to the station she said her mistress had no business to search her box without her leave—I said, "I believe your mistress expects to find something else there"—she said, "I am certain she will find nothing else there, for that is the only thing I ever took"—she said, "Do you think I shall be transported or go to the House of Correction?"—I said, "That is a question I cannot answer."</p>

I am the wife of a book-binder, and live in the same house as the prisoner's mother—I have had opportunities of observing the pri<lb></lb>soner from time to time—I remember, on one occasion, her mother coming down to me, and requesting me to go up stairs to her daughter—I went up with her, and saw the prisoner tying up in a parcel two old gallipots, an old counterpane, a broken pair of snuffers, two tea-spoons, and an old table-spoon—she said she intended going into business for herself—I said, "What do you think of doing?"—she said, "Mother has got half-a-sove<lb></lb>reign, and if she will give me that I shall never want money any more; I think of purchasing a milk-can, and setting up in the milk business, and selling lucifer matches and milk"—I said I thought that was a very trifling sum to set up in business with—she said she knew it would do very well, and if I would lend her 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. she could get a dozen boxes of lucifers, and set up in business—she was crying bitterly at the time—I have seen her at many other times, and her behaviour was very strange indeed—on one occa<lb></lb>sion she said, if her mother would not let her have the half-sovereign, she would do something else—I asked what—she left the room, came up again in a few minutes with something screwed up in a paper, which she put into her mouth—I said, "What is that, Eleanor?"—she said, "No<lb></lb>thing but needles"—I said, "I don't think they are needles"—she said, "They are"—I requested her to tell me what it was—she persisted in it that they were needles—she was crying bitterly—she said, "I have got something here that will do for all; I am quite tired of my life; I can keep no situation"—I said, "Why?"—she said, "They find fault with me"—I said, "On what occasion?"—she said, "I don't know; some call me forgetful, and some call me stupid; I am determined to make an end of myself; I can do no good at all"—she told me she had got arsenic—I asked what she intended to do with it—she said, "To take it"—she then took some poison, as she supposed, out of her bosom—she told me she had been to a doctor's shop in Liquorpond-street and got it—it turned out to be a Seidlitz powder—she did not know but that it was poison at that time—I know that the mole of her head is perfectly open—I saw her at the time of her going into Mr. Wolff's service, and have seen her from time to time since—I consider she is rather flighty at times—I have conversed with her, and she is perfectly forgetful—she has been better for a few months, and then bad again.</p>

I remember going down to fetch Mrs. Hilary up to my daughter—she wanted to go into the milk line and I did not wish it—her behaviour struck me as very strange—it was in consequence of her behaviour that I fetched Mrs. Hilary—I lived on very comfortable terms with my daughter—we never quarrelled—I was the most tender of mothers—the policeman says that I have turned her out of doors, which is very wrong—she was once brought home from the station, where she gave herself up, and a policeman came with her—that is the policeman—(<hi rend="italic">pointing to the witness Phillips.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brickmaker, and live at Battersea. The pri<lb></lb>soner worked in the same field. Last Saturday night I took him to ray house to sleep, because he was very much intoxicated—I was sober—we got home about half-past ten o'clock at night—I counted my money—I had three half-crowns, one shilling, a fourpenny piece, and three halfpence—I put the three half-crowns in one of my jacket pockets, to pay the rent—I put the shilling in another pocket, and the rest of the money in ano-ther pocket, but all in my jacket—I put my jacket at the foot of the stairs—I went to bed, and did not awake till a quarter past eight; but the night before the prisoner made a mistake and went into my bed, and my wife called me to turn him out, which I did, and he left his clothes down stairs—in the morning I found my jacket, but it was removed from where I left it, and the money was gone—I saw the prisoner several hours after<lb></lb>wards, and asked him to return the money—he denied having it.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge at Hines's house. On Saturday night the pri<lb></lb>soner slept with me, but I went to bed first, and was asleep when he came up—I got up at half-past seven the next morning—the prisoner went down first—as I went down I saw the prisoner at the foot of the stairs, picking up some money—I heard it chink, and saw some white and brown pieces—he then went to the water-closet—he was the first person down stairs, and sent me to fetch his own clothes—I did not see any jacket—it was removed.</p>

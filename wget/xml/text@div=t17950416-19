               <p>Q. What are you? - We are trimming makers. When I went out I observed the door just going on the jar, and I observed the back of somebody just going off the steps; on proceeding towards the door, I found two or three skeins of silk towards the steps, which I picked up and threw them into the shop, and then I walked up and down the door, and saw nobody at all for the space of ten minutes, in the course of that time I see the prisoner come and put his hand on the latch of the door, and coming in, and then I followed after him, and asked what business he had there? when he let go the door and returned into the street, then I followed him at some distance, and he turned down an alley, and went into a privy in the alley, a public privy where the property was hid; I found the property in his arms, coming out of the privy door, I took hold of part of the silk, and held his collar likewise, and a young woman opening a door facing, with a candle; he threw down the silk in the dirt, which I got the young woman to pick up, and go with me, which she did; I took the man to our shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with the young woman all the time? - Yes, it has been kept separate ever since, I have it with me.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be value of it? - I look on it about a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Would it sell for that? - It would.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a damaged silk? - It is, but there is a quantity of it, and silk is a dear article.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom does that silk belong? - It is our joint property; here is a mark on this paper, the public sale mark, which we observed at the time it was brought.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen it? - I look upon it about an hour before the time it was stole.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the property at all till he was coming out of this place? - No, not till I see it in his arms.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I picked it up in a necessary, at the back of a public house.</p>
               <p>Q. To Nicholls. Did you ever lose sight of him? - No, I did not, from the time that he left the door, till I took hold of him.</p>

On the 24th of January I missed these articles, which I had seen about the 2nd of January in my box, which I always kept locked - I had been to the box after that, and on the 12th of January I missed two sovereigns and a half - I did not miss the other articles till the 24th; the prisoner left on the 24th - I knew of her going, but did not miss them till after she left; I did not see her again till about five weeks, when she was in custody, land the articles were found in her box, which she had left behind her at the room - it was not opened till then; I opened it myself, in Chester's presence; I had not inquired after her, nor sent for a constable - I saw these articles in her box with her own clothes: she had not called at my room before she was taken - I was not present when she was taken; I am quite certain the articles are mine; the handkerchief was not marked - the stockings have my initials on them, but not in my own work; the ribbon is mine: I have more of the same pattern.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How many young women had you in your room altogether in January? A. Three; the prisoner left her box under the bed in my room - she slept with me; I was not in the habit of lending my clothes - her box was not locked; there was full 10s. worth of her own clothes in it.</p>

I lodge in the house - I have part of the house; these persons were tenants of mine - I did not sleep in the same room; Eliza Porter also lodged there - on the 24th of January Miffling complained of losing things; the prisoner had left the lodgings about ten o'clock that night; I did not know but she was going to return - her box was always unlocked; a constable had been sent for before, but not on that day; she was taken into custody about five weeks after - she is a servant out of place.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You talk of an officer having been called - was she taken into custody then? A. No - she promised to give up the money and property she had taken then; I never asked for a promissory note for 5l., nor for any money, nor has my husband; I know when he found her, after she ran away, she wished to pay the money she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070030"></xptr>had robbed us of - she tells me she has pawned my things, and torn up the duplicates; we wished her friends to pay for things stolen from me.</p>

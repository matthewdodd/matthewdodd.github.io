                  </hi>. I live at Northall;. the prisoner was in my service. On 24th Dec, I sent him to London with some hay—he was either to sell the hay and bring me back the money, or if he did not sell it, to put it up at a public house—I found the horses and cart on my premises on Christmas morning—I do not know who brought them back—I believe they came back about half past 3 o'clock that morning; the hay was gone—I did not see the prisoner till he was in custody five days after—he never paid me any money for the hay—when I saw him in custody he said he had sold the hay, but had not got the money for it—I have known him twenty years.</p>

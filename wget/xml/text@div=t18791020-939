                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector</hi>). In September last I received instructions from the Russian Embassy, and in consequence placed myself in communication with the witness Solomon Barisoff—I found him living at 17, Hendon Street, Pimlico I had frequent communication with him—on 23rd September an agent of the Russian Government, nrnned Hiel Goldfarb, came over 'o this country, and I took some rooms for him at 67, Warwick Street, Pimlico; from that time he and Barisoff acted under my direction—in company with Inspector Dowdell I kept observation on those rooms in Warwick Street—I saw the prisoner come there on Sunday, 28th September, with Barisoff—Goldfarb was in his room at the time—I saw the prisoner leave on that occasion—I saw him again on Tuesday, 30th September, about 11 o'clock, he came alone—I saw him go to therooms—Barisoff and Gold, farb were both in the room I had previously received a communication from Barisoff—prior to the prisoner coming on the 30th I had searched Barisoff and Goldfarb, and also the room—there were no Russian notes about them, or in the room—I paw the prisoner leave—directly after he had left I received two notes from Goldfarb; he came to our room, which was an adjoining room—I initialled the notes at the time, and produce them; one is a Russian 10 rouble note, and the other a 25 rouble note—they are forgeries—next morning, Wednesday, 1st October, I saw the</p>

               <p>prisoner again; he came alone—Goldfarb and Barisoff were both in the room—I had searched them and the room before the prisoners came; there were no Russian notes about them or in the room—Barisoff went away soon after and I and Dowdell when into the room; the prisoner and Goldfarb were there—I went up to the prisoner, and told him we were police officers, and we should arrest him on suspicion of having forged rouble notes in his possession—I searched him—he put his hand on his coat—I said "Let me see what you have got," and inside his coat pocket found this envelope con<lb></lb>taining 10 forged Russian 25 rouble notes—the envelope was open—he then fainted—on coming to he said, pointing to Goldfarb, "He gave me the notes to change for gold"—I saw a packet of notes on the dressing table, and saw Dowdell take them up—I took him to the station, and charged him with being found in possession of forged Russian rouble notes—he said "I had no notes in my possession, and I did not know that they were forged."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I first got information from Mr. Vincent, the director of the Criminal Investigation Department—in consequence of something he said I went to the Embassy, and saw Barisoff there—I had never seen him before—I searched him on these occasions, not because I distrusted him, but to be sure that no trickery should be played by any body, to prevent the prisoner after<lb></lb>wards saying that he had planted these things on him.</p>

I am one of the inspectors of the Criminal Investiga<lb></lb>tion Department—I have been acting in this matter with Greenham—after the arrival of Mr. Goldfarb in this country I kept watch in Warwick Street—I have seen the prisoner go there from time to time—on Wednesday, 1st October, I was in an adjoining room there with Greenham—we went into the room, and found the prisoner and Goldfarb there together—on the dressing-table I found these ten 25 forged Russian rouble notes—I saw Greenham take these ten notes from the prisoner's coat pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. In July last I was living at 17, Hendon Street, Pimlico—I rented the shop and parlour of the prisoner, and carried on business as a fancy dealer and frame maker—the prisoner lived in the house, and carried on the business of a photographer—we are both Russians—some few weeks back I told him I thought of leaving, as I made very bad business—he said he had a very good business in bis hands—I asked what it was—he said false Russian notes—he asked me to write to my friends at St. Petersburg!)—he afterwards gave me two Russian notes, one for 26 roubles, and one for 10, to send to my friend as specimens—I took them to the Russian Embassy, and after that acted under the directions of the police—Mr. Goldfarb arrived from St. Petersburg in the name of Greeman—I introduced the prisoner to him—we met at Goldfarb's rooms in Warwick Street at different times, and the police came, and took the prisoner into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been in England about three years—I left Russia because I was charged with bribery, and sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment—I absconded from my bail; if I go back I must take my 18 months perhaps I may go back without doing the 18 months, by giving information to the Russian Government—I lived in the prisoner's house for 18 months—it was about two months before this happened that he spoke to me about false Russian notes—I went to the Embassy about two days after he first showed me the notes—he said it was the only business by which he could make money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employment of William Neville, a ware-houseman, of 11, Gresham-street—I was there on the evening of 28th January, standing at the counter about the middle of the warehouse—a boy, who is not in custody, passed me with several parcels of scarves, and passed out of the warehouse—I looked across the counter to the pile of scarves, to see if they had been deranged by the boy, and saw the prisoner coming up with several parcels of scarves—he left the place where they were—I went and stopped him, and asked him what he was going to do with them—he said a gentle<lb></lb>man in the street sent him in, and told him to take them, and that if any<lb></lb>body asked him what he took them for, he was to say that Mr. Harrison sent him, and it would be all right—I gave him to Mr. Wheeler, and went out to look for the boy—these are the scarves (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)</p>

On 28th January, about a quarter to 6 in the evening, I was called to Mr. Neville's, and found the prisoner there, charged with stealing two dozen scarves—he said that he was sent in by a gentleman in the street, named Harrison, to fetch three parcels out, and that if anyone said anything to him, he was to say that Mr. Harri<lb></lb>son sent him, and it would be all right—I took him into custody, and asked for his address—he gave me his father's address, and I found that he boarded with his father, but slept somewhere else, as his father had not convenience for him—I found twopence on him.</p>

On the 27th of March, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, I went out and locked my house up. I had upwards of 100 l. in my house, most of it was in Bank notes; they were all in a box under the bed, except two 1 l. notes, which were in a drawer. I returned between three and four o'clock in the afternoon and found the door as I left it - it appeared they had entered at the window. I went up, found the door broken open, and all the money gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. He lives next door to me. It was known in the neighbourhood that I had money in the house. I did not see the prisoner about the house; his wife and sister live with him. I saw him next day. I have since seen a 1 l. note, which I know to be mine by the hand-writing on it, it was in my house at the time. There was also a needle-case in the drawer next to that which contained the money - I have since seen part of the case. The prisoner was apprehended on the 30th of March.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did a young woman named Wedole occasionally work at your house - A. Yes; she is in confinement now - she was taken up for the pin-case.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not charge her with the robbery - A. Yes. I have a nephew named

               <p>Q. Have you not learnt that your nephew gave the needle-case to Clements - A. I do not know. I always kept the key of the bureau - I never gave it to my mother.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said that she had the means of getting your money, and that she did get it - A. I do not know that she had a key that could open my bureau. I will not swear that I did not say she had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention the robbery to Goddard - A.Yes, and to other people; they told me to go to the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not go to the Magistrate in your own neighbourhood - A. I was advised to go to Bow-street. I have seen a note in the possession of Mr. Cook - it has the name of Kayne, of Richmond, on it in my own writing. I did not put the date on it. I had taken one or two of him before.</p>
               <p>Q. His name would be on any note you took of him - A. I do not think I have taken three notes of him altogether. I never charged my mother with stealing it. She left my house suddenly.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you seen the notes safe after your mother left - A. They were safe in the morning when I went out.</p>

I was with him from that time till a quarter past one, when he went to dinner; he returned to me about two o'clock, and remained with me till near four. I went with him to Brentford to the election, and lost him in the crowd about five o'clock.</p>

               <p>What has his character been all that time? - I never knew any thing but well of him, and had a very good opinion of him, the other man went away that very morning, I charged this man on the Wednesday.</p>

               <p>Court. How came you to let three or four days elapse before you apprehended this man? - He denied it.</p>
               <p>Court. That was nothing, you could not expect any otherwise? - Because we wanted to catch and have them both together, Justice Staples persuaded me to have them both together.</p>
               <p>Court. The way to have them both together would have been to take one first.</p>

               <p>Did not you consider the other as the principal thief, the other who put it into the cart? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Would you ever have indicted this man if you could have apprehended the other? - We have been robbed so much that we should have indicted them both.</p>
               <p>Court. It appears to me strange that you should not immediately take up this man and secure him, one mark of innocence is a man staying in the way? - We thought we were sure of taking the other because he was a housekeeper.</p>
               <p>Court. But you was not sure of keeping this? - These men were both in one situation, I do not know that the other is the principal thief.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>

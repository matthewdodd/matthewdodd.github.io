I live at 56, Poland-street—I know the prisoner and her husband—they lived at 1, Union-street, Marylebone—I was there on 23d November—they had some angry words, and I saw them exchange blows in the parlour—the prisoner then ran into the shop—there is a door leading from the shop into the parlour—the prisoner pulled the door to after her—it came open, and I then ran out into the street.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you not know that she went to the hospital to see her husband? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I saw her there once—the shop they kept was a second-hand clothing shop, or broker's—this occurred about half-past 7 or 8 o'clock—there was a good light in the shop—I believe the gas was alight: I could not swear it—I could see plainly—I am sure it was alight in the parlour, because I took him in to look at his wound—the street-door was open—I did not see the prisoner holding the parlour-door while the deceased was trying to pull it open—I saw her go into the shop—the shop-door remained open.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you known these persons some time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; since they have resided there—I live directly opposite—the deceased was frequently in the habit of getting drunk—I have frequently seen him strike the prisoner, and throw things at her: it was a common occurrence on both sides, he striking and throwing things at her, and she resisting—I might have seen her the worse for liquor, but never like her husband—I saw him when he came back from the hospital that night—he was drinking again in a public-house—I saw him on the Tuesday and Wednesday mornings, he was drinking again—he went to the hospital again on the Wednesday—I am told the prisoner went to visit him there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dresser at the Middlesex Hospital—the deceased came there on 23d November, about five minutes past 8 in the evening—he had a superficial lacerated wound of the fore<lb></lb>head, not severe—it was about two inches long—it was made by some sharp-pointed instrument—it was more of a tear than a cut—I dressed the wound, and he left—I saw him on the Wednesday morning afterwards when he was in the ward—I did not see him brought in—I saw him after his death—he died on 1st December, of erysipelas, the result of the wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose with his habits erysipelas was almost a natural result of that wound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; it was a superficial wound—I saw the door with the hook on it at the inquest—the wound might have been produced by his falling against the hook on the door.</p>

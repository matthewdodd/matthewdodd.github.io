                  </hi>. I am an oilman, and live at 65, High-street, Poplar. On Sunday morning, the 21st of Dec., I went to bed a little after one o'clock—I was the last up in the house—I had looked at the fastenings of the house, but not the upper part—the kitchen window that was entered I cannot say was fastened, but the shutter was up, and bolted—the window was down—about a quarter to eight o'clock, in consequence of my servant telling me something I went down stairs—I found the kitchen window open, and the shutter leaning against the windows—any person could get in by removing the shutter and opening the window—I came up into the parlour behind the shop, and found a mahogany sideboard cupboard forcibly broken open, and all the silver that was there missing—there was a silver mug, gravy-spoon, three table, three dessert, and seven teaspoons, and two pair of old fashioned sugar-tongs—I found the till in the shop broken open, and missed from it 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I missed my wife's work-box from the sideboard cupboard in the parlour—this now produced is it—it contained my wife's work, and various odd things—I do not know the prisoner.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 21st of Dec., about half-past four o'clock, I saw three men near the prose<lb></lb>cutor's house—the prisoner was one of them—I was in King-street, about 200 or 300 yards from the prosecutor's house—they came over a fence from Mr. Holly's field, which leads to the back of the prosecutor's—I followed them and got within twenty yards of them—I lost them all at once—before I lost them, I heard one of them say, "I am d—glad we have got out of that"—I recollected having heard that voice before—I was not near enough to ex<lb></lb>amine them carefully, but from the appearance under the lamp, and the voice, I believe the prisoner to be the person—I have known him for the last seven years, and have been in the habit of seeing him about Stepney.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 21st of Dec., about eight o'clock, I was called into Mr. Sanderson's house—I ex<lb></lb>amined the kitchen window—it was closed at that time—the shutter had apparently been put up with buttons outside to keep it up while a person went to bolt it—those buttons could be undone from the outside—the shatter was standing against the window as if it had been removed—I found a cup<lb></lb>board in the parlour had been forced open, and a piece broken off—the till had been wrenched open with a pair of scissors, which were on the counter—I went into the back garden, and found a step-ladder standing against a wall at the bottom of the garden, which leads into a dug-up garden at the back—it was in Mr. Sanderson's garden, but placed against the wall of the other—I had seen that ladder several times before, on the other side of the wall—I found there a number of foot-marks—they began at the foot of the ladder, on the other side—I could not discover any impressions on Mr. San<lb></lb>derson's side, the ground was so hard—I found some where the ladder bad been taken from, and covered them over—I traced them to the bottom of that garden, where there is a ditch, and just opposite that ditch I found the box produced, and the contents lying about by the side of it—there were a number of foot-marks there—I traced them along the field to the spot where Plowright pointed out where the men got over the fence—I afterwards went with Plowright, and apprehended the prisoner—Plowright said in his pre<lb></lb>sence, "That is one of them"—the prisoner said it was not him, he could prove where he was that night—I asked him how—he said the old people could prove it—I went with him to his grandfather's, which is about a mile from the prosecutor's house—I asked the grandmother some questions in the grandfather's presence, about the prisoner's sleeping—she said, "He did not sleep here, he had his supper here, and he went up into the loft over the cow<lb></lb>barn; I will not tell an untruth; he could get in and out there when he liked, but he was there at six in the morning"—the caw-barn is little more than the width of this Court from the grandfather's house—the prisoner made no reply to that—I afterwards asked to look at his shoes—he showed me the shoes he had on—his grandmother told me they were not the shoes he had worn, those he had only bought on Sunday morning—I asked for the shoes he wore on Saturday night—he turned round behind a door, and reached me</p>

               <p>this pair—they are odd ones—one is nailed—the other has been nailed, but the nails are worn completely smooth—I afterwards compared them with the footmarks, by making an impression by the side of those I found there, and they exactly corresponded—I examined them carefully so as to ascertain—there was one place where I thought, before seeing the shoe, that it had an iron-plate, but I find this shoe has the nails worn off at the toe, and it smooth—I believe the foot-marks to have been caused by these boots—they corres<lb></lb>pond precisely.</p>

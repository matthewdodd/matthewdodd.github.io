                  </hi>. I am a coach-Builder, and live at Cumberland Cottage, Kennington-green—on the night of 28th May, about 11 o'clock, I was coming along Kennington-lane, by Vauxhall Gardens, and was accosted by two females—the prisoner is one of them—we went to the Duke of Cambridge public-house opposite—I gave them a pint of ale—while there the prisoner took up her dress, and I saw that it was torn—I had only had about half a glass of ale—I had nothing before that day—we stayed in the public-house about five minutes—I left it alone—the women followed me, and caught hold of my arm—I went round Durham-street—they still had hold of my arm—I then came round the Oval, and back into Kennington-lane—they pulled me down Miller's-lane, near a chapel there—the other woman had hold of my right arm, and the prisoner was on the other side of her—she went up to two men—she was not above half a minute gone—I did not lose sight of her—she came back almost directly, and, while she was coming back, I received a Blow across my mouth which knocked me down, and knocked two of my teeth out and loosened several—it was one of the men that gave me that Blow—I did not see whether it was done with some loaded instrument—the other woman still had hold of my arm, and while I was on the ground she took my watch and guard—the prisoner was about a yard off at that time—I was insensible for a time from the Blow, but only for about two minutes—when I recovered my senses, I saw the prisoner running off towards Vauxhall-Bridge—I did not lose sight of her till she was stopped by the police.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, L</hi> 158). About 11 o'clock on the night of 28th May, I was near Miller's-lane—I saw the prisoner coming along between a run and a walk, out of that lane, and directly after I saw a man run out—he said something to her as he ran past, but what it was I could not under-stand—about a minute or two afterwards I saw the prosecutor come out of the lane with another man—in consequence of what he said I went and took the prisoner into custody—I found that her dress was torn and pinned up—she said she knew nothing about it, that she had come the other way, from Vauxhall-Bridge—I am quite sure she was coming out of Miller's-lane towards Vauxhall-Bridge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Has the watch been found? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—it was dark in Miller's-lane, but there was a lamp at the corner—the prisoner came out right fronting me—I was on the opposite side of Kennington-lane—she came straight out into the middle of the road—it is a narrow street there—there was not another person there except the prisoner and the man who ran past—seven or eight persons came up afterwards, when I took hold of the prisoner, but there was not one person there till I had taken hold of her—she gave two addresses, one of them was a correct one—I do not know of her ever having been convicted before.</p>

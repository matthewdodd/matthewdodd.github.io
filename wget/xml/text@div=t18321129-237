             (Police-constable N 82). I saw the prisoner a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's, at eight o'clock in the evening of the 23rd of November, with something under his arm; I asked what he had got - he said some glass, which he had got from a house in Pearson-street, and was going to sell it - I took him back to the house; he unlocked the door, and said he took it out of the back room - I at the last found the prosecutor, who owned it.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL MARCH. This is my property; I have brought the frames here - they are all broken to pieces by the person who took the glass out; they were taken from the back parlour of my house, which the prisoner had the care of - the frames were hidden under the floor; I have no doubt this is my glass - I had seen it safe about three weeks before.</p>

            . I am a glazier. On the 13th of October, the prosecutor employed me to glaze some sashes - this is part of what I glazed - I know the glass belonged to these frames.</p>

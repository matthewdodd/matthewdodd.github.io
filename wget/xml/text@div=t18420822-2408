                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife. I was sent for home from Richmond, on the 14th of July, and found that my large box in the back-room second floor was broken open, and the articles stated gone—I had left them safe on the 1st of July, when I went to Richmond—after I came back, I saw the prisoner Onion come down in the morn<lb></lb>ing with some dirty linen, and put it into a washing-tub in the wash-house—I afterwards examined that tub, and found this pair of drawers, which had been locked in the box—I afterwards went with an officer to Onion's apartment, and found a night-gown, which had also been in the box, a baby's long petticoat, and a white frock—I employed Watson to mangle.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Cotter, and live in Warwick-row, next door to Mr. Crow—after Mrs. Crow went to Richmond I fre<lb></lb>quently observed Watson coming to the house—I asked Onion several times why Watson came to and fro so much—the first time she said she came to clean for her—she came every day after that, and her little girl came very often—I told Onion if Watson came backwards and forwards <hi rend="italic">so</hi> much, she (Onion) must not come to me, nor I to her, for I was afraid there would be something wrong—one morning, about a fortnight before the depositions were taken, I saw Onion leave the house with a bundle—the next time I saw her I said, "What was that bundle you went out with this morning?"—she said, "I was taking some washing to Mrs. Watson, I told you I was going to have my things washed"—she had said before that she intended Mrs. Watson to wash all her counterpanes, blankets, and things, as she was going to wash them very reasonably—on the Thursday before Watson was taken, I was looking out of my window, in the middle of the day, and saw Watson go from Onion's house with a large bundle, and go to Princes-row—I had some suspicion, and waited and saw her return—instead of coming back to Onion's house, she waited at the milk shop, at the corner of Princes-row—I saw no motion made, but in a minute or two Onion came out, met Watson, and they went away to<lb></lb>gether.</p>

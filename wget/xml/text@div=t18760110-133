                  </hi>. I am trading under the name of Gould and Company, twine manufacturers of Bull and Mouth Street—the prisoner was in <hi rend="italic">my</hi> employ in May last or the beginning of June—his duties were to get orders on commission—he had no authority from me at any time to receive money on my behalf—he was paid nothing in addition to his commission—he left me in June and came to me again in October—he was out of a situation and asked me to let him take some orders for me—I had been lending him money and thought if he could get some orders he might as well, and I did so—he finally ceased to do anything for me on the 13th November—that is the last time I saw him—in the month of November I supplied some goods to Messrs. Whitworth, and that is the invoice (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>)—I know the prisoner's handwriting—I never received that 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from the prisoner and he has never accounted for it in any way—in the month of November I also supplied some goods to Mr. Cooper for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., allowing for discount—prisoner has never accounted for that—from infor<lb></lb>mation I received I afterwards went to see the prisoner with reference to these amounts—he told me, before I had an opportunity of asking him what he had done with the money that he had taken some accounts in the hope of being able to repay me before they were really due; because he took them before they really were due at a greater discount.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had not known the prisoner before May last—he was introduced to me by a friend of mine and I allowed him to have some samples—I took him into my employ some few weeks after—we had not been in the habit of frequenting the same tavern—I took him into my employ about the end of May or the beginning of June—he took out my samples marked at a certain price, and if he could get more he was to have half the additional cost—I never called that by the name of "plunder"—he continued in my employ on these terms for four or five weeks; not more—I never authorised him to receive money.</p>

On one occasion, after he left me to take a situation as traveller in the country, he came up and looked in on me as a friend, and on that particular day one of my City houses always paid, and I asked him to run down to get a cheque which I knew was waiting for me; but he was out of my employ.</p>

               <p>him, but he had no authority to receive it—that was in May or June—a previous arrangement altogether—he was prohibited, but I accepted the money when he brought it—I thought I had no alternative—I did not dismiss him for breach of contract, neither did I say if it occurred again I would send him away—I think if these two sums had been brought to me by him I should have received them—I scarcely know what I should have done—I did not say to him when he brought the money from Belgrave Square, that he should not have done it—I continued him in my employ—Kino, of Regent Street, is a customer of mine—he never received a sum of money from Kino, and brought it to me or on my account—I believe Turner, of Forest Gate, was a customer—I never received through the prisoner a sum of 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from him at any time, that I swear—Copping is the gentle<lb></lb>man I referred to when the prisoner was not in my employ, and called on me—it was sometime previous to the last engagement, and the amount was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

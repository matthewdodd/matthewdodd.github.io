The prisoner Meredith came sometimes to our counting-house, to see his brother, who is in my employ. We have a number of stamps for use in our business, and I very frequently missed some. I accordingly put a private mark on those left in my drawer - they were 3s. 6d., 4s. 6d., 5s., 6s., and 8s. 6d. bill stamps. I made a small mark in the stamp, by which I should know them from all others. From five o'clock in the evening of the 13th of March, till nine in the morning of the 16th, I missed a considerable number - on the evening of the 17th I missed some more; Meredith had been at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060116"></xptr>my office that evening, and in consequence of something said by me to his brother, he was sent out, and returned; I saw him in the street, and he was taken to an opposite office - I asked him for the stamps - he denied having any, but I insisted upon having them, and said I had no doubt he had them on his person, and I would search him unless he would give them up - he then gave them up. I took him to my house in Chatham-place, and afterwards to the Mansion House. In consequence of information he gave us we went that evening to Zamira's house, in Duke's-place, but did not go in; we went there again on the evening of the 18th, and part of my stamps were found there. I never sell stamps in any way whatever - here are what I found on the prisoner Meredith when he was taken, and here are those found at Zamira's on the 18th - they are what I had lost on the 13th or 14th.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ALLEY. Q. Then it was not on the evening you took the boy you went to Zamira? A. No; we did not go into the house till the evening of the 18th; I have about six servants; the stamps were not locked up - they were in a private counting-house; Mereditch could have access to it, because he came at eight o'clock in the morning, before the clerks came; we have three porters and two clerks, but the counting-house is never left by myself or Mr. Smith; I think only one clerk or book-keeper knew where the stamps were kept.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to Zamira's house, at the corner of Bury-street, St. Mary Axe, on the 17th, and on the 18th I went in with the prisoner Meredith, Mr. Shirley, and a gentleman here - we sent Meredith in, who asked if Zamira was at home; they said Yes; as I went in he was coming down stairs; I said to him "Do you know this young man," (pointing to Meredith) who was standing with his back against the door - he said No; there was no other young man in the shop; I asked what he had done with the stamps he bought of Meredith; he said he knew nothing at all about them; I then told him I was an officer; he said "Don't make a noise, I have got my house full of company;" he then spoke to his wife, or an elderly woman there, and, to the best of my recollection, it was to go up stairs, and bring the stamps down; she brought them down and gave them to Zamira - he gave them to Mr. Shirley, who identified them as his property; here are four for 3s. 6d., four for 4s. 6d., and five for 5s.; they are quite clean, and here is a mark on every one of them; we then came down to the Mansion-house; they were then committed - Meredith did not deny it or say any thing about the stamps produced - it is a kind of grocer's and stationer's shop I understand.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Did he call to this old lady? A. No; she came without being called - he only said "Go and fetch me the stamps;" I heard all he said - he is not deaf that I know of.</p>

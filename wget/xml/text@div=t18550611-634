                  </hi>, Esq. I am a barrister, practicing in the Equity Courts—I am one of the directors of the Deposit and General Life Assurance Company—their offices at present are at No. 18, New Bridge-street, Black-friars—the prisoner was the secretary of the Company—he came into the office, I think, about Aug., 1853—1852 or 1853; I am not quite sure which—he resided at the Company's house—at first he had a salary of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year; it was afterwards increased to 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or rather more, I think—it was his duty to make such payments on behalf of the Company as were pre<lb></lb>viously authorised by the board, to open all letters addressed to the secre<lb></lb>tary, and generally to manage—it was his duty to enter, or cause to be entered in a cash book, all receipts on behalf of the Company—we had two bankers, the Commercial Bank and Messrs. Hopkinson's—our payments were made by drafts drawn and signed by the directors at our weekly meetings, and counter<lb></lb>signed by the prisoner—they required his counter signature before they were issued—it was also his duty to lay before us at our weekly meetings, a statement of all receipts and payments during the preceding week—when payments were to be made, either he or one of the clerks, by his direction, filled up the cheques; they were then laid before the Board, and signed by two of the directors, and they received his counter signature either then or afterwards—in consequence of something that reached my ears about 22nd July, 1854, I had a conversation with the prisoner; that was at a meeting of the Board—there had been two cheques drawn for the premiums of some assurances which we had effected with the Home Counties Com<lb></lb>pany, and those cheques had been delivered to the prisoner at some previous Board to be paid to that Company—I asked him what had become of those</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185506110073"></xptr>
               <p>two cheques—I have the particulars of them—(<hi rend="italic">referring to a paper</hi>)—one was No. 1211, dated 8th June, for 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and the other, No. 1212, same date, for 49<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this is a memorandum I made with a view to the inquiry before the Magistrate, as I had forgotten the exact amounts and dates of the cheques—we were sometimes in the habit of re-assuring with the Home Counties office; our practice was not to keep above 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on one life—when we took more than that, we reassured with another office—sometimes with one office, and sometimes with another—the Home Counties was one—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the cheques I speak of, and about which I spoke to the prisoner; they are for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 49<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., both dated 8th June, 1854—they were drawn for premiums on re-assurances with the Home Counties—I asked the prisoner if those re-assurances had been paid; he said they had—he ought to have paid those cheques to the Home Counties before the time expired during which the premium was payable—what that time was I cannot tell you exactly, but it would be at any rate within a month from the date of these cheques, probably a shorter period—it is the custom of offices to allow a certain number of days after the date at which the premium becomes due—I do not know, but I think these were new insurances—the risk on the part of the Home Counties would not begin until these were paid—they were new insurances; it was the prisoner's duty, therefore, to pay them at once—if for any reason the payment was delayed after the cheques were signed by the directors, it would have been the prisoner's duty to retain them in his own possession—when he told me that he had paid these two sums, I asked him to produce the receipts for them—he sent down stairs to have them produced—he sent the messenger or sent a message that those receipts were to be brought up—I had previously examined the voucher book where the receipts ought to have been, and found they were not there; the messenger returned without them—the receipts are pasted in a book called the voucher book—the prisoner directed the messenger to bring the voucher book—when he returned without the receipts, the prisoner after a time admitted that he had not got the receipts—he said he had had the receipts but had given them back—I wanted to know why, and said it was very strange—he said there was some question of account between him and Mr. Mills, the secretary of the Home Counties for which these receipts had come, and he had got them back; that was the substance of his statement—he said he would have them the next day, and I think we appointed a Board for the following day, the 23rd; I attended—I think the first Board was on the 21st, but I am not quite sure, and the next on the following day, the 22nd; it was the day after this conversation—the prisoner then produced the receipts—I said it was very extraordinary, and it was necessary to have an expla<lb></lb>nation about it, and I therefore proposed to the Board that a letter should be sent to the Home Counties to know when these moneys were paid, and, in fact, for an explanation—before the letter was sent, a copy of it was read to the prisoner; that copy is in the minute book—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "22nd July, 1854. Deposit and General Life Assurance Company. Gentlemen,—On the 8th June last, the directors of the Company drew two cheques upon their bankers (the Commercial Bank of London), one numbered 1211, for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the other numbered 1212, for 49<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.

               <p>this Company stated that the amounts had been paid to you; that he had had the receipts for them, but that the secretary of your Company had obtained them back, to day those receipts were produced, and are dated 10th June. On the part of the directors of this Company, I shall be greatly obliged by your informing me, under the authority of your Board, when the two sums in question were paid to you, and upon what day your Company first was under the risk of assurance on those lives; for example, whether if the persons, Armstrong and Prosser, or either, had died before yesterday, your Company would have considered itself liable to pay the amount insured by us upon those lives? I should also be glad to know in what mode those payments were made, and the circumstances under which the receipts were given. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, your obedient servant, R. A. Riddell, Chairman pro tern."—I drew up the letter, and read it over to the prisoner, and asked him if the facts were true; he said, "Yes"—(I know nothing of any former letter)—this is the answer—I think the prisoner was present when it was received and read—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Home Counties and General. 22nd July, 1854.

               <p>I did not know of until it was produced—it relates to cheques of a particular class—it is in the agenda book; it is a minute of what is to be done at the meeting, and the Chairman's notes of what has been actually done—it is the duty of the Secretary to transcribe that into the minute book as a record of what has been done—that is confirmed at the next meeting—Lord Drumlanrig is the Chairman of the Company—I believe he was Chairman in '53—this is the minute (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it is dated 14th Sept., '53—from the writing 1 presume Mr. Coode to have been in the chair this day—This is the minute in the agenda book (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "Upon Mr. Coode's question, Mr. Bevan explained the process of drawing upon our bankers in favour of borrowers, and his explanation was entirely satisfactory to the Company.")—I was not present on that occasion, and know nothing about it—this is the minute in the minute book of 14th Sept., '53—it is in the prisoner's writing—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "Mr. Coode stated to the Committee that he had been informed that in cases of loans, it was the custom of the Secretary, upon receiving the cheques from the Board, to pay the same into his own banker's, and allow the money to remain to his own credit for some time prior to handing the same to the parties, and that he had done so in one time to the extent of about l,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and Mr. Coode further stated that his informant had, in stating this to him, adduced it as a reason for the Company's balance at its banker's having been, and still being, so low. Mr. Coode, thereupon, called upon the Secretary for an explanation, which was thus given: first, the Secretary denies in to to that he pays the cheque into his credit, and retains the money there before handing it to the parties, and thereby benefiting his own and injuring the Company's credit; but, on the contrary, what the Secretary does is this; he gets the bill dis<lb></lb>counted by Hopkinson's before he even cashes the cheque. When he is advised the bill is discounted; he then, for convenience, pays the cheque into his account, and simultaneously sends the Amount due, to the party in a cheque of his, paying the law charges to the solicitor, and the premium, etc., to the Company, thereby benefiting the Company, inasmuch as by this process the cheque is not presented for one day; whereas, if the Secre<lb></lb>tary were to adopt the only other two courses, viz., a registered letter or a bank order, the cheque would of necessity be cashed instanter, and the Company's balance be immediately reduced; whereas, by the process adopted by the Secretary the Company gains a day, and sometimes two days, as well as the saving of considerable time, in either cashing the cheque and obtain<lb></lb>ing a registered letter, or cashing it and getting a bank order, both of which processes are avoided by simply enclosing a cheque to the party. The Secretary stated that it was done solely for convenience; that it was more trouble and inconvenience to himself personally; and he produced his banker's book, which proved that the allegation was totally incorrect and false, both as to the amount of 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as well as to the paying in the money immediately the cheque was drawn, and when drawn and paid in, retaining it any time beyond that required by the transmission of the cheque by one post and the return of it to his bankers by another, or by return of post His book showed that he had only even done this in four instances, and at remote dates, and that his assertions as to time of keeping the cheque were true; for it appeared that in each instance the cheque was cashed by return of post. The Committee considered his explanations entirely satisfactory, and the mode adopted by him to be the most convenient. The Secretary further adds that his mode is the best for the Company, inasmuch as if the Company were to trust the party to remit the premium, etc., it is doubtful how long the Company would have to wait for it; and, as an instance of</p>

               <p>this, in the case of Wildman, the Company was a week and more without the premium, owing to an informality in the cheque given for it, and the Company had to wait till a fresh cheque was obtained, the borrower having received a fortnight previously the whole amount, and given his cheque, which was returned, for the premium.")—that minute is signed by George Coode, Chairman—I have not myself traced several instances in which the prisoner has actually paid the Directors their fees, I only traced my own—I have not said that I had traced at least three—what I said was this; when I was examined before the Alderman, I found I had received three sums of money for fees, and at the moment when you put into my hand one cheque I thought it probable that I had received the others, but I find I have not—on one occasion, I think, the prisoner paid me my fees in cash—I think that was before he had a banking account at all—I think, on one occasion, he had a cheque for fees, and he went and got the cash at our banker's and paid us the money.</p>
               <p>

Kingsford, Norris, and Kendall—I do not at this moment remember any others—they were not discharged for irregular transactions in the Company; we dis<lb></lb>charged Kingsford because his health was unfit; he is liable to fits at times—that was so when Bevan was there—he was the keeper of the cash book, and had to make the entries under Mr. Bevan's direction—I have not found out repeated instances in which he omitted to make entries; I mean to say that, certainly; I do not know of any instance—Kingsford had been dis. charged once previously for incapacity, and was afterwards reinstated—I have not found defalcations by any one since Mr. Bevan left—Kendall was discharged because he disobeyed the directions of the Secretary, and Norris because it was thought he was mixed up with the prisoner's matters—we discharged him very shortly after the prisoner left—I have heard Mr. Bevan state that his wife has an allowance from her father; I do not disbelieve it; I do not know anything about it; her father is a very respectable man—we gave Mr. Bevan 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when he left; we gave it him as a matter of mercy, at his own request—there is some furniture of his in the house; we have not kept much, and there are some chairs, and tables, looking glasses, and so on; I really cannot tell how much—they are there still, and they are used by the resident Director—they are up stairs, not in our room—I should think they are not worth more than 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they may very possibly have cost 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I do not know—the prisoner professed his desire to make every re<lb></lb>paration, and he left that to pay us back part of what we had lost by him.</p>

               <p>to about double the amount of the loan, and we, in fact, borrow the money from our bankers to lend to them—the prisoner's explanation clearly refers to those loan transactions.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You lend money to persons who insure? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it is an inducement to parties to insure—the bankers advance the money upon the security of the bills or promissory notes that we take from the parties to whom we lend the money—it is done by many Companies, it is personal security—when we can get any other security we take it, but it is on personal security—the bankers do not take an assignment of the policy, they merely take the notes from us; they discount the notes for us, in fact.</p>

To Charles Bevan, Esq.: Dear Sir, we consider the lives of Armstrong and Prosser to have been re-assured to this office.

               <p>Mr. Beddall when he posts them; he can explain that—I know nothing about them—if you wish to know exactly when the money was paid, or how long he held these receipts, you can easily learn, because then they were entered there, they were not carried into the business cash book; when they were carried into the business cash book was the time I received the I premiums, and then handed back the receipts; that book will tell you—I have no doubt the receipt book is here (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—these are my initials, "J.

                  </hi>. I am a stationer, living at Croydon. In the course of last year I made application to the Deposit Company for thirty shares—4 1 had a letter of allotment, and on that sent a cheque for 152.—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I forwarded that to the prisoner, as Secretary to the Company, on 19th July, the date of the cheque—it has been returned to me from my bankers as a paid cheque—I received this letter acknowledging the receipt of the cheque—(<hi rend="italic">This was a letter, dated</hi> 22<hi rend="italic">nd July.</hi> 1854, <hi rend="italic">signed by the prisoner, acknowledging the receipt of a cheque for</hi> 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and stating that the shares should be sent)—I have never received the shares—some months afterwards I made application about them, and that led to an investigation.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an accountant In July, 1854,1 was employed to go through the books and accounts of the Deposit Company—I think I began on 26th July—I saw the prisoner at the office—I first went through the books by myself—it was probably three or four days after I first went to investigate the accounts, that I had conversation with the prisoner respect<lb></lb>ing them; about 29th or 30th July—I was passing him on leaving the office, and I remarked to him that it was a very large balance to account for on the cash book—he said, "Balance up the cash at the end of the month, and in five minutes I will give a satisfactory explanation of everything"—I balanced the cash book to the end of July—although Mr. Bevan was suspended he was still residing in the house—some days after, I made out a statement of the balance that appeared on the cash book at the end of the month, as also of some other cheques that had been drawn by the Company,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185506110092"></xptr>
               <p>and had been cashed by the Company's bankers, for which there were no vouchers in the Company's books during the months of June and July, and on 3rd Aug. a copy of that statement was handed to Mr. Bevan—I have that statement now in my hand; a copy of it was furnished to the prisoner—about 12th or 14th Aug. I went through that statement with the prisoner, in the presence of his solicitor, Mr. Lawrence—he was present during the whole time—the balance that was shown on the books on 31st July was 521<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., to be accounted for by the cashier of the Company—that ought to have been the balance in the hands of the Company's cashier to the 31st July—I arrived at that amount by taking the entries as they appeared in the books—there was a large account gone into between us with respect to amounts that had been discovered where there were no entries in the books; I have stated them in this account—I first called his attention to this deficiency of the 521<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he did not dispute that the balance <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the cash book was taken out correctly, and that that was the balance that ought to be in the hands of the cashier on 31st July, but he said there was 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3 that had been received, subsequently to his leaving, and was still in the hands of the cashier, and, therefore, that the balance at the time he resigned, and which he ought to have accounted for, was 516<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—he said in terms that that 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. he was not accountable for, and I admitted it at once—all the moneys that had been received between 2nd and 31st July, had been paid into the bank, except that 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., therefore that had to be deducted from the balance in hand at the time he resigned—he objected to the correctness of the cash book with respect to the entry of three bills of the amounts of 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said those bills had been twice entered in the cash book, whereby he was twice charged with having received the money; that they were entered when they were received, and afterwards when they were discounted—I found that two of them had been twice entered, but the third one, for 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., had not; it was not carried into account in the cash book, but some time afterwards, it might have been a month afterwards—I found that that mistake of the double entry had been corrected, I went through all the entries of the accounts of moneys due and cheques drawn—the payment of one cheque of 201<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Rashley was entered in the cash book, and the voucher appeared—I did not charge that against him at that time; it was not discovered then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the final result to which you came? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The final result was that he admitted a considerable portion of these items charged in the account—I should think about 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we did not agree on any balance between us—the prisoner did not admit all that was stated—I think the amount admitted in the account to be deficient, amounts to between 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but that was not a balance—he did not, at the close of my investigation, name any sum as due from him; he did not admit that there was any sum due from him as a balance—I had never seen his account before—it was handed me at the moment—I had not an opportunity of examining it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> With reference to the account which you say, on your own showing, showed a balance of 516<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., how much of that did he agree with you was due to the Company upon the statement of one side or the other of the books? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He admitted that the 516<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was correct, except those cheques for 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he said ought to be deducted I from it—two of those were properly objected to, the other was not—that I would be a deduction of 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from 516<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., making 406<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was the balance of the cash book, independent of the other items, which he admitted—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185506110093"></xptr>
               <p>then called his attention to items which did not appear in the books at all—I have a list of them; the first is an item of 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Armitage; he admitted that he had received that money, and had not accounted for it, therefore that would be added to the balance—the next item was 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received from a Captain Drummond; that he admitted, that had not been entered in the cash book—there is an entry in the rough cash book of the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid by Mr. Armitage, but it is not in the principal cash book—there is no entry of Mr. Warren's money at all in any of the books—the prisoner had access to the books during all the time he remained, at least till within a few days of the time he left—I think he left on 19th Aug.—he had access I to the books to make extracts, and look over them from 30th July to 19th Aug.—I find no entry in any of the books of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid by Perks for Danks' premium; there is no entry of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. having been paid by Perks—those two sums of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. form no part of the 516<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was not aware of any such items at the time the books were made up—the items of the account were taken one after the other, and the question how far he admitted and how far he denied them—he admitted the greater portion of them—he admitted the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., three amounts of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; all cheques that had been drawn for certain payments, and had not been applied to those payments—the amount of the sums admitted, independent of the balance in the* cash book, was about 220<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he admitted the receipt of money to the amount of 220<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which did not appear in the books.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did not Mr. Lawrence say to you, in the presence of Mr. Barnes, a Director, and Mr. Neison, when Mr. Bevan was there, "If you have any criminal charge, we are ready to meet it at the Mansion House directly?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have no recollection "of it; I will not swear he did not—I have no recollection that Mr. Bevan repeatedly said so—I may mention that when I entered the room, there was some excited discussion going on between Mr. Barnes, Mr. Bevan, and Mr. Neison—I do not remember hearing Mr. Barnes say, "We don't mean a criminal charge"—I will not swear he did not—I have not seen Mr. Barnes here to day—I did not see any letter from the prisoner, or the account itself, until I came into the room at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was a letter written by the prisoner in which he makes various claims of different items against the Company, ever placed in your hands 1 <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think there was a letter written by the prisoner along with the account, and which Mr. Barnes had in his possession—I had possession of the account and of the letter; the account was placed in my hands for the first time at the time the discussion was taking place—in that account there was a claim of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. against the Company by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe he also added that there was 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of salary due to him at the time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was a dispute between him and Mr. Barnes about that when I entered the room—I do not know whether that excited Mr. Barnes—I do not think he claimed anything for his furniture in the account—there was no balance finally struck.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> No balance was struck between the parties, nor any admission on one side or the other? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There could not be at the time, because I had never seen such a thing before.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185506110094"></xptr>
               <p>709<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but he gives them credit for that amount, less the 347<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. balance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is that independent of the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, ascertained to be defi<lb></lb>cient by the books? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know what he means by these items at all; that is no part of the moneys said to be deficient—he says he holds these moneys for the Company, but ho did not account for them at the time—the amount he gives the Company credit for is 362<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in this statement—this is his original statement—that is independent of the sum of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd which I had ascertained to be deficient.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

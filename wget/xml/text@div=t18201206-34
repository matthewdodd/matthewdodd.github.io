I went up again, about five o'clock for some money, I found it forced open, and all the things strewed about the room.

            . I am a constable. I produce two 10 l. Bank notes, No. 9,898, dated 10th of August, 1820. and 6,730. dated 22d of April, 1820. I received one from Mr. Wells, a baker, and the other from Mr. Anthony, a grocer. I took the prisoners into custody; I went with a search-warrant to Sapwell's lodgings, and took them there with him - they all lodge in the same house, but not in the same room. I found nothing on them. In the front room I found a quantity of blankets, shawls, stockings, gowns, and linen; and in a small tin case in the room I found one 5 l. and four 1 l. Bank notes - I took the prisoners in this room. Sapwell claimed them, and said he had taken them for Long, who did not contradict him - he must have heard it - it was on the 20th of October.</p>

            . I am nephew to Mrs. Shepard, and am a journeyman baker. I was out of employ in October<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182012060016"></xptr>- I know the prisoners. On a Saturday afternoon in October, about five o'clock, I went to my aunt's; I had seen the prisoners before I went, and had aranged with them that I should go and keep my aunt in conversation, while they went up stairs to see if any property was there. I did not know where she kept it; I knew the first floor was empty. We set out together from Charles-street, Lisson-grove, and went all the way together - the door is open all day. When I went in they went up stairs. I came out, and met them at the Yorkshire Stingo, public-house, New-road, about half-past five o'clock. Erratt said they had got 63 l. in notes, and we divided it; they gave me one 10 l. and eleven 1 l. notes - there were three other 10 l. notes among it - I observed no writing on them. I saw Erratt give my wife one of the 10 l. notes to change; she brought the change, and said she got it at Mr. Wells's the baker. I paid a quarters rent with my 10 l. note to Mr. Jones. Long lodged where I did. Erratt lodged at his father's in Marylebone, he frequently came there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where the linen-drapery and things were bought - A. In Oxford-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How old are you - A. Twenty-five, and have three children - we were all taken up together. Necessity drove me to it - I did not plan it. I was never up stairs but once, and did not know were the money was kept - they were sometime finding it. I told my wife we had a prize in the lottery.</p>

            . The prisoner, Long, lodged in the same house with us. On a Saturday in October, all three went out together, about four o'clock in the afternoon, and returned about six o'clock. They did not say where they they had been. I received two notes from Long; I took a 10 l. note to change for him. He gave me one on the Wednesday afternoon, and another in the evening - Erratt was there both times. I changed the first at Mr. Wells's, the baker, and the other at Mr. Anthony's, the grocer - I gave the change for both to Long. I went with my husband to lay out another at Brooks's, the linen-drapers, in Duke-street, Oxford-street, I bought the things produced there. He paid a 10 l. note for them; I cannot say where he got it - I did not see him pay the landlord. I remember the officer coming, and finding 9 l. which was part of the change of one of Long's 10 l. notes, which I got from Anthony. The 10 l. note my husband paid Brooks with was given me by Long.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had three 10 l. notes from Long - A. No, I think Erratt gave me the one I changed at the baker's; I gave him the change. I think my husband gave me that one I changed at Anthony's. Long gave me that one I changed at the linen-draper's in Duke-street.</p>

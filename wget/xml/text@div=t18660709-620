I said, "It is not worth your while to send down to me, I have the tea from London." He said, "Being at the seaside, it may be a superior article." I said, "Probably it may be"—they went for a walk and came back to tea—I thought I was going to get a very large order, but I only received 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of postage stamps in a letter for half a pound of the celebrated tea—letters afterwards came addressed to Mrs. Ablett—I have lived at Herne Bay some time, but never heard of anybody of that name there.</p>

               <p>there, but received no answer, and my letter was returned about three weeks afterwards through the dead letter office—after that I went to the institution again, and saw both the prisoners—I complained about the letter being returned, and they said that the lady had returned a week since to London, and they would give me the address when they got it—I think it was Wattez said that—I went again in about a fortnight, and saw, I think, Wattez alone—he gave me the address, "Mrs. Ablett, Mr. Shearing, 9, Mortimer Street, Herne Bay"—I wrote to that lady, but had no reply, nor did I have the letter back—I received this letter between the first and the last addresses—it is in Wattez's writing—I have seen him write—he wrote me the address. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated March</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">th, and stated that there were no situations on the books likely to suit the witness at present, but that the first that came would be sent to her, in the meantime giving her the address, "Mr. Donovan</hi>, 30, <hi rend="italic">King's Road, Ball's Pond," who required a young lady to instruct his daughter in music</hi>.) I do not remember whether I received that in March or April, but it was after I received the first address—I have not noticed that it is dated 20th March, and not April—I went to the institu<lb></lb>tion again, and saw Smith—I told him there was no such name as Mrs. Ablett at Mr. Shearing's—he said that it was all a mistake what I had seen in the newspapers—I had referred to that—I told him that he might either return the money or I should expose him—he said that it was not customary to return money when once received—this letter marked B is in Wattez's writing (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>): "Mr. Ablett, care of Mr. Henniford, 20, Old Street, St. Luke's.

My letter came back to me through the dead letter office—I did not go to the institution again—I received other addresses, but returned them—I went to the institution before that and saw Smith—I had written previously stating that I had not heard from the lady, and therefore nothing passed about the address—I merely said that he had my name on his books, had he anything likely to suit me—he sent me to a gentleman at King's Road, Ball's Pond, Islington, who he said required a housekeeper, and that no music was required—when I got there I found that music was required, so I went back and told him I was very much vexed at being sent that distance, because they wanted music, and I did not know music, but he did not take the slightest notice—I did not go back again—it was after that that the letter I addressed to Mrs. Ablett came back—I got no situation.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 7, Bedford Row, Clapham Rise—about the end of March I was living at Stamford, in Lincolnshire—I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi>, came to London, and went to the Cavendish Institution, 14, Mortimer Street, Regent Street, a week after Easter—there were placards in the window referring to various situations—I saw both the defendants—I told Smith I had called respecting an advertisement I had seen in the <hi rend="italic">Telegraph</hi>—he said that he could refer me to a situation, provided I paid 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I paid Smith 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and Wattez wrote me this receipt produced (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he was behind the desk—he then gave me the address of Mrs. Davis, Wigmore Street—I went there, and then went back and told Smith that it was a general servant that was required, and that Mrs. Davis was very annoyed that there were so many always calling—(I had asked them for a situation as assistant in a fancy general business)—he said that Mrs. Davis had misrepresented the place—he then gave me the address of Mrs. Menere—I asked him parti<lb></lb>cularly what situation it was—he said it was to stand behind the counter at a fancy baby linen shop—I went there, and it was a wardrobe shop, a dealer in second-hand clothes—I went back again, and saw Smith—I told him it was a very different situation from what I wanted, and that the vacancy had been filled up six weeks ago—he said it was very strange—some days afterwards I went again, and saw Smith—I got the address from him of Mrs. Bouverie, a fancy establishment, Edgware Road—I went there, and it was a dyeing establishment—I went back, and told Smith that they did not require any one—he said that he had nothing more on hand that day—I went again two or three times, and saw Miss Hawkins, but got no situation.</p>

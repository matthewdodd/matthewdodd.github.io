The prisoner, James Boyce, immediately said, "We won't hurt you - we will have what you have got;" I begged of them not to hurt me, and they might take whatever I had got; James Boyce said, "We won't hurt you - we will have what you have got;" James Boyce then took from my right-hand trousers pocket a case of surgical instruments, and two cases of lancets, and from my right-hand waistcoat pocket three keys, and a piece of ass's skin - my left-hand pockets were rifled by the person on the other side - from my trousers pocket he took two sovereigns, three shillings, a sixpence, and a pen-knife, which had a broken point - one of them took my hat off - that was neither of the prisoners; my cravat was then taken off; as soon as the man had taken my hat he said, "Now, give the b-g-r a rum one" - James Boyce said, "No, don't hurt the poor b-g-r," and they did not do me any personal injury. I am quite certain of James Boyce - Houghton came up to me, and felt my fob pocket; he unbuttoned the flap of my breeches, and felt to see if I had a watch, but James Boyce, who had examined it before, said, "The b-g-r has got no toy;" I had no watch. As they were about to leave me I asked James Boyce to give me my keys, as they would be of no service to them - he returned one key, and they all ran away immediately. On the following morning I went to the Police-office, and got Garton, Gleed, Armstrong, Hanley, and other officers, and after the prisoners were apprehended three persons called and told me I could recover my instruments - I communicated that to the officers, and the two cases of lancets were restored to me by Garton - I went with him to Dutton's, in Brook-street, Spital-square.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Nobody but yourself was witness to the transaction? A. One or two women say they were passing, and I believe, one of them is here. I was certainly alarmed - my attention was not much distracted till they threatened to give me a rum one - I then felt more alarmed; I think it impossible I can be mistaken in James Boyce's person; the parties were all strangers to me before. I am sure I am not mistaken - it lasted about two minutes or more.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there much noise or conversation? A. Among themselves; I had plenty of light to see them. I heard voices behind me as well as before - persons were in front and behind; I was not alarmed till one of them took my hat and said, "Give the b-r a rum one;" as Boyce said I should not be hurt.</p>
               <p>Q. If Boyce is the individual be interfered to protect you from injury? A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it frequently occur to you to make mistakes in persons, or are you pretty accurate? A. I generally am - I could not speak to the whole twenty, but I observed several of them, so closely as to speak with confidence. I never made a mistake in the identity of a person to my knowledge; there were not twenty persons in my view; I observed several in front, who I can identify; I should know the one who took my hat in a moment if I saw him. - Boyce was apprehended on the Wednesday or Thursday following.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PRENDERGAST. Q. You were much frightened? A. When I was threatened - I saw Houghton previously to the threat - he had searched my pockets while they were releasing my arms.</p>
               <p>Mr. ALLEY. Q. Had you abundant opportunity of seeing them? A. Yes, and have not the slightest doubt of them all; Henry Boyce was present, but not active - it happened in the parish of Bethnal-green.</p>

            . I am an inspector of the dismounted patrol. I apprehended Houghton on the Wednesday morning after the robbery, about six hours after I received the information - I took him in his bed; I told him he must get up and go with me; I asked where he had been on the Monday night before; he said he had had but 2 1/2d. in his pocket, and that he had been to the Angel and Crown public-house, opposite the church in the road (opposite Whitechapel church), spent it, and returned home;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140047"></xptr>the Angel and Crown is about three quarters of a mile from where the robbery was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was at the office, but not before the Magistrate, did he say any thing to you? A. He told me afterwards that he had been to the Angel and Trumpet public-house, at Stepney, on the Monday evening.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. You said at first it was in Whitechapel-road. I understood? A. He said the Angel and Crown in the road, opposite the church.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say "Whitechapel-road?" A. It is in Whitechapel-road; he said he went up Brick-lane to the Angel and Crown, opposite the church in the road, and spent it - he said nothing more on that subject - he said, "in the road," not Mile-end-road; Mile-end-road and Whitechapel-road are in a line - I cannot tell the difference. I swear he did not say the Angel and Trumpet - he said "in the road, opposite the church" but did not say what church.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Is it called both Mile-end and Whitechapel road? A. I call it both; the Angel and Trumpet is a mile from the other house, and not opposite a church.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. When did he say it was the Angel and Trumpet? A. Not till after Mr. Fuller had seen him, about an hour and a half afterwards - he said full an hour and a half afterwards that he was at the Angel and Crown, and then contradicted himself, and said it was the Angel and Trumpet - he had spoken to nobody but Mr. Fuller and the officers.</p>

            . I live at No. 15, Mead-street, near Shoreditch, in the parish of Bethnal-green, and am a journeyman shoemaker. I know Houghton. On Monday, the 11th of September, I was at the Angel and Trumpet with him; we started to go there at half-past six, and remained there till half-past ten; I will take my oath that he was not out of my sight five minutes during all that time; Sidebottom went with me and Houghton to the house; I do not remember seeing one Hawes there.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Who do you work for now? A. Mr. Pollock, of Shoreditch, near the church on the left hand side - I worked for him at the time of the robbery; I do the work at home with my father; I generally work till eight or nine, but sometimes leave off at dark; on Monday we generally do not get our work ready - we get it prepared - I generally go out earlier on a Monday; my uncle lives with us - neither he or my father are here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Sidebottom fall into a misfortune that night? A. Not that I know of - he was taken on suspicion of a robbery - I heard it was committed that night; I do not know whether he was taken that night; when I left the house I left him in company with a young woman at the door; I left the house at half-past ten o'clock; I know Hawes - I did not see him that evening; I know Fleet-street-hill; I was not there that night - I could go that way home, but I did not - I got home near upon a quarter past eleven o'clock; I saw no robbery that night - I never said I saw the robbery committed as I was going home - I swear that.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you never taken up yourself charged with any offence? A. I was taken for a slight offence - they took me for going down a turning, and said I was hunting a bullock - I was fined - I was never in custody for any other offence - the bullock hunt was six weeks or two months ago - I have not seen the landlord of the public-house here - he was not in the house when I went in, but the servant was, and she knows I came in, but her master would not let her come.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The landlord was not there? A. I did not see him for an hour or two - I did not see the landlady - I saw the female servant - she served us with what we drank, which was porter - we had no brandy or gin - we had two or three pots of porter - Houghton and Sidebottom drank with me - we each paid our own part - it came to 15d. - it was 5d. a pot - I went out on the opposite side of the way, and got some bacon and bread from a shop - I do not know who keeps the shop - I am not often at the Angel and Trumpet - I have been there six or eight times - we each paid 5d. - I changed a sixpence - I cannot say whether Houghton and Sidebottom paid in silver or copper; when I went in I dare say there were ten people in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140048"></xptr>the room, and more came in; I dare say there were fifteen or twenty there when I came away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Houghton call for you to go with him? A. No, I went from my residence at nearly a quarter past six o'clock, and met him down Brick-lane - we met Sidebottom at Hanbury's brewhouse, about one hundred and fifty yards from where I met Houghton - we went into the public-house together; I got the bread and bacon soon after I went in.</p>

            . I am a weaver, and live in Cheshire-street, Hare-street-fields. On Monday week I was in Houghton's company; I met him in Brick-lane about a quarter to seven o'clock in the evening. with Adey, and we went to the Angel and Trumpet, at Stepney; we remained there till the publican would not draw us any more beer; he said it was time to be going - I was the last who asked him for beer, but not the last in the house - I went away first, and bid Houghton and Adey good night; they were in my company from a quarter to seven o'clock till half-past ten; Houghton did not leave our company all that time - not to my recollection; if he was out it was not for more than five minutes I am sure.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. You have stated that you went away first; then Adey could not have left you behind talking to a woman? A. I went out of the house first - he did not leave me behind; I was taken up that night on suspicion - they said it was for stealing some pork; I was put into the watch-house, and discharged the next day; I know Fleet-street-hill - I went down Brick-lane that night about a quarter to seven o'clock; I do not know whether you call that passing Fleet-street-hill - it is at the end of the street - it was not a quarter past seven.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you in company with any woman that night? A. I was speaking with a young woman at the door when I left the house; Houghton and Adey came out just after me, and left me at the door talking to the young woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Who drank with you? A. Houghton and Adey, and another young man, who was in the house when I went in; we had two or three pots of beer; I will not be certain how many; I know what I paid for; I paid 2 1/2d. for a pint; Adey paid for the first pot himself; I think he gave a 6d.; he went out after asking for a newspaper,(which he could not get), and fetched some bread and bacon - the servant of the house served us with beer; I saw the landlord, but not when I first went in; I do not know whether the young woman who brought the beer was the landlady or servant; I had met them in Brick-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you certain this was the 11th of September? A. I cannot be certain of the date, but it was on Monday - last Monday week; I had been ino the City about work.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. You say there was another man at the house? A. Yes; he was not in our company at first, but drank with us; I do not know his name - I never saw him before.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer, and live at Stepney. Last Monday week I was in company with Houghton and Adey, at the Angel and Trumpet, Stepney, kept by Smith; I went there a quarter before eight o'clock, and staid till half-past ten.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Houghton there when you went in? A. Yes; we all went in together, and never went outside the door, not for three minutes, except for a necessary purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean you went in in company or at the same time? A. I went in at the same time as they did - they asked me to drink out of two or three pots of beer; I did not know them before - the two last witnesses were with him - we all went out together - the landlord would not draw any more beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Who applied for more beer, which was refused to be drawn? (the witness Sidebottom here said "It was me.") A. It was that person (pointing to Sidebottom).</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. How lately have you been at work as a bricklayer? A. Yesterday; I do not know Fleet-street-hill - it was a quarter to eight o'clock when I went into the public-house.</p>

            . On Monday night, the 11th of September, I saw James Boyce at the corner of King-street; it might be ten minutes past seven o'clock, but I will swear it was not later; I remained in his company till a quarter-past nine, by Hanbury's brewhouse clock; we stood talking there all that time; Chandler came up about a quarter-past seven, and remained with us till we went away, and during that time two other men came up - we were talking about the business at Bow - we are all silk weavers; I had left my work at dark, and was talking about the state of the business. I live in George-street.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. What distance is King-street from Fleet-street-hill - close by - is it not? A. Not very close - I dare say it is four or five hundred yards; I will take my oath he was a yard from me all that time - both him and his brother were there; and about five or ten minutes after eight, two Bow-street patrols, one named Skilling, came up and saw up talking.</p>

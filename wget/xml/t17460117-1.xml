               <p>Q. In what Manner?</p>
               <p>Drummond. As I was going home to my Family I met three Women; I pass'd two of them, and this Woman, the Prisoner, stuck by me; I found her Hand in my Pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it?</p>
               <p>Drummond. In King-Street, opposite George-Yard; and I said to her, you base Woman, you have taken away my Money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive her Hand in your pocket.</p>

               <p>Drummond. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you be sure it was the Prisoner, when there were other Woman about you?</p>

               <p>Q. How much Money was there?</p>
               <p>Drummond. Fifteen Shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. You say your 15 s. were gone; were not the other Women as close to you at any Time, that they might put their Hands into your Pocket.</p>
               <p>Drummond. They were not so close.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the Prisoner to be the Woman?</p>

On the 28th of October, between 10 and 11 o'clock, I was shutting up my shop; they are swinging shutters. As I was going to take the bar, up came a man and took my hat off and ran away with it. I and two men pursued and took him. He wanted to go through the George-inn-yard on Snow-hill, and the gate was shut, so he ran down to the Fox and Knot; there being no way through he came back, and we laid hold of him (it was the prisoner), and took him to the Compter. I observed he was a tall man in soldier's cloaths (such was the prisoner); he never was out of my sight, only at going under the gateway.</p>

            . I took a candle and went to the pond in Fox and Knot-yard; there I found the prosecutor's hat swimming, with the brims uppermost.</p>
               <p>Question to prosecutor. Did you see a hat in the prisoner's hand when he was running?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>I had been into the Fox and Knot-yard to ease myself; coming out again these men laid hold of me, and charged me with taking a hat. I said I knew nothing of it; I was very ready to go with them any where. I was quartered in Tyburn-road, and was going home as fast as I could.</p>

             . On Sunday Morning, the 18th of last Month, I sent my Servant into my Grounds to fetch up eighteen Sheep; I did design to go to Smithfield with two Calves, so I thought I would take some Sheep with me. My Servant brought but seventeen, and told me one was missing; upon which, I told them myself, and thinking perhaps I might get it again, I obtained a Warrant from Justice Clitherow to search for it. I had some Suspicion of Dean, and Flexmore's Father; and I went to Dean's House, and after we had examined him, and his House pretty rightly, he confessed that he,

            , went out on the Friday Night, and drove the Sheep up into a Corner, and kill'd it, and then carried it Home to Flexmore's House , Upon this, we went to Robert Flexmore's enquiry, and at the Top of the House the Constable found something wrapp'd up, which proved to be a Leg of Mutton . I brought Dean behind me to Town, and told him he had as good tell me what he had done with the Skin, and he said, Master we threw it into a Cart-rut ; and the next Day I sent my Boy, and he pulled the Skin out of the Rut, with a Fork: It was in a by-lane where Carts do not go sometimes for two Months. He found the Skin and shewed it to me, but I can't swear it was mine, for it was cut into ten Pieces I believe.</p>

I took him upon Suspicion, and when we had him out of Doors, he confessed that he, with the two Flexmore's went into Hawkins's Ground's on the Friday Night before, killed the Sheep there, and brought it home in a Sack.</p>

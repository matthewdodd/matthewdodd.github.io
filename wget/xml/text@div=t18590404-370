                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>). In consequence of instructions from the prosecutors, I followed Stiles's van on 23d March to Shoreditch—it stopped, he got down—How came up, and they spoke together—Stiles opened the boot of the van, the traveller Butler then came out, and Stiles got up and drove away—How had gone on—I followed to several other places, and at last arrived at the Lamb at Kingsland, where Butler got down and went into the house—How came up and spoke to Stiles—How stopped at the corner of the gateway—Stiles got up on the step of the van, took this parcel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) out of the boot, gave it to How, walked round the back streets, and then came into the Kingsland-road again—I had never lost sight of him, and as he was getting into an omnibus I laid hold of him, said that I was a police-officer, and told him to consider himself in custody for having the parcel—he had it with him, and Knight came up and took it from him—he said, "I will tell you all about it, I have brought it from Mackintosh's, and I work there"—I left him with Knight, went back to the Lamb, called Stiles from the tap-room into the street, and told him I was a police-officer, and to consider himself in custody for stealing a parcel the property of his master—he said that he had not, and knew nothing about it—I had seen them together before.</p>

I went up to Legg when he had How in custody—How was left in my custody with a parcel which he said he brought from Mackintosh's, where he worked—I asked him what it contained—he said, he did not know—Legg afterwards brought Stiles to me in a cab—I had the parcel on my knee, and said to Stiles, "You will be charged with stealing this parcel, and giving it to this young man"—he said, "You do not mean to charge me with stealing that?"—I said, "Certainly I do, I saw you do it"—when the charge was read over by the inspector, Stiles said that one of Mr. Mowatt's young men brought it out of the ware-house to him—I asked him who the young man was—he said, "I do not know"—we asked him if he should know him again—he said, that he should not, and should say nothing of it—I had seen the two prisoners before.</p>

            . I am a labourer, in the employ of Mr. Wabbleton, timber-merchant, near Waterloo Bridge. I was first introduced to the prisoner, Gardiner, on the 28th of March, by Saul; he lived at No. 13, Rose-street, Covent-garden. I took a letter to him that day, but did not find him at home - I saw him at home afterwards on that day, and told him I had a letter which Saul had sent me with, and I was to receive what he had written for. He said</p>
               <p>"Where is Saul?" I said he had sprained his ancle, and was not able to get out. He then said,</p>
               <p>"I am going to see about the things, if you will stop a moment I will go with you." I went with him towards St. Giles's church. I got nothing that day, but in going along he returned me the money which I had taken in the letter, screwed up in a piece of the letter. I saw him again next day at his own house; he asked me where I had missed him last night? I said I had missed him. He said it was of no consequence, as he could not get any; he also said</p>
               <p>"There is a man come out of the country for fifty fives, besides other notes, and it is very expensive for him to wait in town, but I cannot get them out of the country." - I got nothing from him that day. On the 4th of April I received five 1 l. forged notes from Harrison, and before I put them into my pocket I shewed them to Gardiner - he said,</p>
               <p>"These are good ones, they are all the 10th" (meaning the date.) He said,</p>
               <p>"Jane, have you got any money?" she said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, 1 l. 5 s." - I had paid her that for the five notes, I had received it from Christmas - (looks at five) - these are them. He said,</p>
               <p>"You must be very cautious how you pass them; do not offer two in one shop whatever you do." On the 6th of April I saw him at the Sun, in Windmill-street. I stopped there sometime, and came out with him, and just before he got to his own door he said</p>
               <p>"Here are the things," and shewed me a brown paper parcel. I went into his room, there was a stranger there, he took a paper from the window, came round, and slipped them into my hands, turning his back to me. I received four from him, and gave him 20 s. in silver for them - (looks at four) - these are them. I then came away. On the 18th, about ten o'clock, I saw him at his house; I said,</p>
               <p>"Have you got any more?" he said</p>
               <p>"Yes. Jane, what did you do with those things?" she said,</p>
               <p>"They are under the floor-cloth, near the fire-place in the front parlour." He and I went out of that door, he went into the front parlour, and picked something up from under the floor-cloth wrapped in brown paper - he opened it, and there were three 1 l. notes. He said,</p>
               <p>"They are all prime ones - give me 15 s." which I did; he wrapped them in brown paper, and gave them into my hands. I went with him into Long-acre, had a glass of liquor, and there we parted. (Looks at them) - these are them, they are in the same paper. He asked me if Saul ever told me he owed him any silver? I said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, he did; you need not be afraid of the money, you will have it on Monday." He said he was not afraid, but he did not know whether he had told me or not. This was on Saturday. I saw him again on Monday evening, about half-past seven o'clock; Wales and Saul were with me. Saul and I went into the house together; Wales stopped at the end of Rose-street. We sat down; Saul said,</p>
               <p>"We are come to complete the score and pay the 10 s. I owe you," which he did, and paid him 10 s. for two more notes, and I gave him 6 s. in silver for one; he returned me 1 s., saying,</p>
               <p>"You have given me 1 s. too much."</p>
               <p>Q. Was this for notes you were to receive - A. Yes; we did not get them that night. We had fifteen that night, left his house, and went to a public-house over the way. Gardiner came in, after we had been there half an hour, and wanted us to go into another public-house, which we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182005170037"></xptr>did, and in a few minutes he called Saul out - we parted. I saw him again next night at eleven o'clock - Wales accompanied us to Rose-street. After sitting down Saul said to Gardiner,</p>
               <p>"Do you know what you gave me last night?" he said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, fifteen." Saul said,</p>
               <p>"You told me there were but ten - when I opened the parcel I found fifteen." Then Saul paid him 2 l. in silver and 2 l. in notes, and I gave him 5 s. - (we had received the money from Foy and Christmas.) Gardiner said,</p>
               <p>"I will go and get the others presently." The officers immediately came in and took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. How long have you been employed by the Bank - A. Since the 20th of March. I have been paid for my loss of time. Nobody accompanied me to the house on the 8th.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. Liberter was introduced by Wales to Saul. On the 4th of April Liberter gave me five 1 l. notes in the presence of Christmas. On the 7th of April he brought four 1 l. notes, and on the 11th of April he brought three 1 l. notes to the Bank. On the 10th of April, at twelve o'clock at night, Saul brought fifteen. On the 11th of April I accompanied Wales and Jefferson to Rose-street; Saul and Liberter went in first - I did not see them go in. We went in in about twenty minutes, and found the prisoners and their servant, and Saul and Liberter sitting in the parlour - Gardiner was nearer to the fire; Wales went up to him, and took something off the ground, which laid between Gardiner and the fire. Wales held it in his hand and said,</p>
               <p>"What have you got here?" Gardiner said he did not know, that it belonged to those men, and if they were doing anything wrong it was more than he knew. I asked him who the men were? he said he did not know, they were strangers to him. After searching them I took them to Marlborough-street, and left Wales and Jefferson to search the house. Gardiner said at the office that the two men came in just before we did, and that the short man (Saul), asked him to look at two notes for him, and to give him two notes for 2 l. in silver. I asked if he had ever given him change, or had any money from either of them before? he said he had not. I then said,</p>
               <p>"Did not you think it a very impudent thing for a person to come in and ask you to give him notes for silver, if you did not know him?" He said Jane had seen him before when he had come to their house with girls, but that they were both strangers to him. He said afterwards,</p>
               <p>"Yet I think I saw them at the public-house near my house the night before." I found two papers in a drawer or desk close to where they were sitting.</p>

            . I am an officer. I employed Liberter by direction of the Bank, introduced him to Saul, and accompanied him several times to Gardiner's house. I accompanied Liberter on the 17th and 18th and on the 20th, 26th, and 27th - I went with both. I saw nobody have any communication with them. I marked a 1 l. note which was delivered to Liberter - (looks at one) - this is it. On the 11th of April I went into the house, and saw Gardiner sitting by the fire; I saw him draw his left hand towards his thigh, I attempted to seize his hand, and at that moment something fell from his hand on the floor; I picked it up, and asked him what he had got there? he said it was what those men had dropped (looking round at Liberter and Saul, who sat there) - and if they were doing anything wrong he did not know it, or it was unknown to him. On examining the paper I found it contained the money I had marked that day and given to Saul - there were two 1 l. notes, 40 s. in silver, and a 5 s. paper in copper laid on the table, which had been delivered to Liberter - we furnished them that evening, before they went to pay him for the notes. They were secured.</p>

They have been employed by the Bank, have been in training together day by day, and were to have 80 l. for my conviction. My brother went and asked them how they could deal in blood? Saul told him if I would give him 100 l. he would get out of the way and go to Scotland. I cannot bring my brother to prove this - I have other friends.</p>

            . I am an upholder, and lived in Great Windmill-street, but not now; I have been moved this day by an Habeas from the King's Bench. I have known the prisoner some time. On Monday, the 10th of April, I saw him at the Sun, next door to my own house, at six o'clock in the evening. I met him there, and was with him till, I should think, ten minutes past eight o'clock; it was past eight o'clock, I am certain. He left me in the street; we were to meet again, which we did, at half-past nine o'clock, and continued with him till half-past eleven o'clock. He then left me at the public-house in Rose-street, near Covent-garden - Harker was with us.</p>

               <p>MR. SERGEANT BOSANQUET. Q. How far is Rose-street from the Sun - A. I should think, half a mile. He went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182005170038"></xptr>out with me and Harker a little after eight o'clock. I parted with him in St. Martin's-court.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to meet him again by appointment - A. He said, some years ago he was a musician, and invited me and Harker to go and hear him and his two friends play the violin and flute. When we got to St. Martin's-court, he said he should go and seek for his friend Salmon; that is about half-way to the Sun. We went to a public-house in Rose-street, kept by Honeyball; I do not know the sign; it is in the same street as his house. I have never seen him since till now.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew this on Saturday - A. Certainly; I was here on Saturday, but was not examined.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see Harker - A. He came to my house in Windmill-street, and asked me to go to Burn's; the prisoner was there; I cannot say what part of the room he was in; he had some gin and water before him; I will not say whether any one was in his company or not; it is a small room; there might be other persons there; nobody took him out, or had any conversation with him but what I could hear. Harker called on me, and we went together; and we all three left together. The prisoner left us to look for two friends, who would entertain us with music, and we went into Hobb's; we parted at the door of the King's Arms, in the middle of the court. He might have gone either to the right or left. I should think it was twenty minutes or a quarter past nine o'clock, when we saw him at the public house, in Rose-street. We waited there a quarter of an hour for him, and took some supper before he came in; it was a hot knuckle of ham, which we bought opposite an oyster-shop in New-street; we finished it before he came in, which was about half-past nine o'clock. I observed the clock at the ham-shop.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this first called to your recollection - A. About two days after somebody came and told me Gardiner was in trouble. I thought that strange, when he had been in my company, and began to recollect what time he was with me.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know it was for anything on the 10th - A. I heard nothing of the 10th, I only heard he was in confinement. I never heard anything about the 10th at all. He said he was very tired, for he had been out to play the week before, which was Easter week.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time was you here on Saturday - A. At half-past nine o'clock in the morning, and remained till the Judges left the Court.</p>

            . I am a tailor, and live in Queen-street, Golden-square. I use the Sun in Windmill-street. I was in the prisoner's company there on the Monday before he was apprehended. I went in about six o'clock in the evening, and he was there. I remained there two hours, and went away with him and Hall. The prisoner left us at the door of the King's Arms, St. Martin's-court. He appeared to go towards St. Martin's-lane, on the way to Rose-street. We met him about half past nine o'clock, or rather later, at a public-house in Rose-street, kept by Honeyball; I do not know the sign. We left him there about half-past eleven o'clock; there was music and singing there.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. What reason have you for remembering this was the night - A. The gentleman who played the violin mentioned that he had been playing there three or four nights the week before, being Easter, and that he was tired. I heard he was apprehended on the Wednesday, but did not hear any particular time given to the offence he was charged with. He could not have left Burn's so as to go to Rose-street, if he did, he was back directly; it was about ten minutes' walk. After he came into the public-house in Rose-street I do not think he went out; he might, but I never missed him. I think it was about half past eleven o'clock when I left him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you go to the Sun alone, or did you take anybody there - A. I went alone. The prisoner, Hall, and several others, were there when I went in; it is a common sitting-room, and is divided into boxes. Hall sat next the prisoner, drinking.</p>
               <p>Q. You found Hall and the prisoner there - A. I cannot exactly recollect whether I went in with Hall, or alone; to the best of my recollection I went in alone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go from your own house to the Sun - A. Yes, and walked alone. I am quite sure I called on nobody. I had seen Hall in his shop in the course of the day, by daylight.</p>
               <p>Q. If any one has said you called on Hall, and went with him to the Sun, it is not true - A. I do not think it is. I cannot say whether I saw him at the door or not. I am quite sure I did not go to his house. I supped with Hall, in Rose-street, before the prisoner joined us; we had a knuckle of ham.</p>

            . I keep the Cooper's Arms, in Rose-street. On the 10th of April the prisoner was at my house.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been in the gallery of the Court, and heard all the evidence - A. I have, and was also here on Saturday. On the 10th of April, I went into the parlour; after eleven o'clock there was some music. We had a painting society there, and being a member, I went in, as I understood my servant was dancing. I recollect seeing the prisoner there, and the last witness, but I did not know them. There is one house between the prisoner's and mine.</p>

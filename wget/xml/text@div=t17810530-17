               <p>I am errand-boy to Mr. Lutell. On Monday the 7th of May, I was coming up Fish-street Hill, with a bundle of Mr. Ross's things; it had like to have fell on the ground. I had two great coats and a parcel besides the bundle. I asked a man going along the street to help me with it; he said he would carry it for me; he took it out of my hand; I told him I was going to <placeName id="t17810530-17-crimeloc65">Fenchurch-street</placeName>

               <p>Did you see the bundle snatched out of his hand? - No; I was rather before him; he then ran away, and I called out, Stop thief! and the prisoner was stopped at the corner of Birchin-lane with the bundle.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300014"></xptr> I took the bundle out of his hand, while the men held him. I took it home to my master's; he is an apothecary: there were some of my master's, and some of Mr. Ross's things in it: they had been out of town together, and I had been down to the livery-stables for them. I put it down on the table, and my master took it, and sent it down to Mr. Ross's, I believe. My master is not here.</p>

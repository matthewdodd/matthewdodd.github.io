                  </hi>. I live in Gray-street, Manchester-square, and am a coal-merchant. About eleven o'clock on the 27th of November I placed my truck on the rails outside the door—about twelve o'clock that night I was called by a policeman—these are my wheels—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>.)</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable D</hi> 121.) About twelve o'clock at night, on the 27th of November, I saw a man opposite Mr. Bourne's house, who, I believe, was Plumpton—I went round my beat, and came back again—I saw Con<lb></lb>nolly in Gray-street, with a wheel on his back—I came to the prosecutor's, and saw the truck without the wheels—I followed Connolly—he dropped the wheel, and ran to No. 18, Calmell-buildings—I said, "It is no use your running; I know you"—I went and awoke the prosecutor, and we went to the house in Calmell-buildings—we found three sweeps in one corner—we roused them up-Plumpton and the one discharged said, "What for?"—I said, "For the wheels"—they said they knew nothing about them—we took them into custody—I am sure that Connolly had only one wheel, and Plumpton is the man that I saw about there—I found the other wheel in the house where the sweeps were.</p>

I was not in the room at the time he mentions—I did not get home till half-past one o'clock—there were three of us taken—I had nothing to do with the wheels, and was not in the street where they were. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>.

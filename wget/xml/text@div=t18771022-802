                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Daniel Grayston, and live at 78, Belmont Street, Chalk Farm and let furnished apartments—on the morning of 10th October the prisoner called and asked for a furnished bedroom with a single bed—I showed him a room—he asked to wash his hands—he had said he would take the rooms and had gone for his luggage and come back without it—he went into the bedroom and then came down and talked to me about my baby—I went to the room and missed a ring and gold pencil—the prisoner was quietly leaving the house—I said he could not without leaving a deposit—he said he had no change—I said I would go with him to get change, and I went with him to get change, and to Chalk Farm station to get his luggage—it was not there—he said that was the wrong station—I said "It must have been the Prince of Wales Road station"—I saw the prisoner drop this gold pendant on the way to the station—it is my property, and so are these, the purse, four studs, silver watch, jewellery case and pin—they were in different drawers in the bedroom.</p>

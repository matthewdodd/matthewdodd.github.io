                  </hi>. I was at the Mitre, in Chancery-lane, on 11th Aug., I saw the two younger prisoners following a gentleman coming out of Ser<lb></lb>jeants' Inn, and Symonds was following them about a yard behind them, they went just past the Common Pleas-office, and Frost lifted up the tail of a gentleman's coat, and Atkins pulled out a green silk handkerchief, and the moment he did that he gave it back to the prisoner Symonds, who crossed and went as far as Bell-yard—he then crossed and went down Middle Temple-lane, the other two followed him—I followed and collard them all three, and kept them in custody—I collard Symonds first—the policeman came directly, he was just at the corner; I had made a communication to him—I was there when the policeman took the handkerchief—I told the policeman he had got it in his pocket—this is like the handkerchief that I saw taken from the gentleman's pocket.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Symonds. Q.</hi> Did you take me before the policeman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I did, and three or four gentlemen came at the same time to assist—I know this is the handkerchief that was taken, because you put it into your left side pocket—I told the policeman you had got it in your side pocket.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Symonds.

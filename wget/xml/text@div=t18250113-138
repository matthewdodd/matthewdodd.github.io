On the 15th of December, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came in, and one of the shopmen shewed her some Irish linen - I was passing her, and she remarked to me, that the linen she had bought of me, the week before, was not sufficiently fine for her son's collar, she wanted some finer - the young man, who is not here, went for some - I suspected that she had something under her cloak, but said nothing; she bought some galloon, and went out - I followed, and found the Irish, and a piece of silk, under her cloak; she fell on her knees, and begged for mercy for herself, and seven children.</p>

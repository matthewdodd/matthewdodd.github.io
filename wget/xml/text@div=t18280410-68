            . I am a patrol. On the 8th of April, about nine o'clock in the evening, I met the prisoner in Sharp's-alley, Cow-cross; it being a dull place I suspected him, and watched him into Cow-cross; I there stopped him and asked what he had got in the bundle under his arm - he told me a few files; I asked from where he had brought them - he said from home; I asked where he was going to take them - he said home again; I took him to the watch-house; Newton searched him, and found fourteen new files in his pocket, besides sixteen which were in the bundle.</p>

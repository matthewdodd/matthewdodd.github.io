Upon that, I said, Don't shoot me, for that will do you no good, nor me neither. He laid hold of my horse's bridle again, and I put his hand away; then he put his hand in my pocket, and I put the gun away from my body with my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, he put his hand in your pocket?</p>
               <p>Bailey. Yes; he did three times.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to him?</p>
               <p>Bailey. I said, friend, what do you mean, I am not willing to be robbed? he then turned away from me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do then?</p>
               <p>Bailey. I turned myself a little from him, then he turned himself round to see if the Uxbridge road was clear, and shot at me after I was going from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174405100027"></xptr>Q. How far were you gone from him?</p>
               <p>Bailey. About two pole I believe, not more, and I said to him, now you rogue, what good has this done you to shoot me, so he went to the stile from whence he came, and I saw no more of him, for my horse ran away with me, being frightened with the noise of the gun.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any of the shot of the gun touch you?</p>
               <p>Bailey. I was shot into my right arm and out at my elbow, it shot the bone all to pieces, I have had abundance of stones and bones come out in an unaccountable manner, and I was near twenty weeks in a languishing condition with this wound.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the stones and bones come out of that wound?</p>
               <p>Bailey. They came out of the very same place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take any money from you?</p>
               <p>Bailey. He did not take any, he would have taken some, but I would not let him, for I put by his hand.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you say to him after he had shot you?</p>
               <p>Bailey. I said, you rogue, what good has it done you to shoot me? and then he went over the stile - I cannot say he went over the stile, but I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Q. What time o'night was it?</p>
               <p>Bailey. It was about seven o'clock, it was a clear star light night, I saw him three poles before he came to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him before?</p>

               <p>Bailey. Yes; and I knew his father very well, the Prisoner lived then at Hillingdon End, and I believe he does now.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any disguise over his face?</p>
               <p>Bailey. No; none at all that I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time observe any thing of his voice?</p>
               <p>Bailey. No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the words he said to you?</p>
               <p>Bailey. He gave me no other words, but bid me stand and deliver my money, those were all the words that came from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you see the Prisoner, can you take upon you to swear that he is the man?</p>
               <p>Bailey. That is the man, and nobody else - For the Prisoner. Here is a commitment of another * person for the same fact, and Bailey kept him seventeen weeks in prison, and never appeared against him at the goal delivery.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever swear this fact to any other person but the Prisoner at the bar?</p>

               <p>Bailey. You are the person that did me the mischief.</p>
               <p>A Witness. Bowry had got a bill and was cutting an elder tree, and he called to the Prisoner, and asked him, if he would have any leeks, he said he did not care if he had, and they went into a hogsty which was new built, and there was a gun, and Bowry asked the Prisoner what time he would go, and he said as soon as he had carried his leeks home, with that I went in doors and saw no more of them that night.</p>

               <p>Bailey. I was so bad I could not speak; it was not Bowry that shot me, it was Fuller, and no body else.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever tell this to any body?</p>

               <p>Bailey. He was taken up the 27th of February 1743, that is twelve months and three days after he did me the damage.</p>

I went to him, and asked him as to the circumstances of the fact, and he said much the same as he has said now; I asked him who it was that did it. He said, he did not care to say who it was. I asked him whether it was Bowry: He said it was not him, as he said with respect to two or three other names that I mentioned. I asked him whether he would swear to any thing; he did not care to do it (he was in a very weak condition) but he said, if he lived to come abroad again, and was to see the man, he should know him as well as any man in England; I believe he was a little conscientious, as he thought himself a dying man, and so did not care to swear to any body.

            , Esq; As to the character of the Prosecutor, I don't think the man would take a false oath upon any account in the world. (I have lived all my life in the parish, and he always bore an extraordinary good character.) I have very good reason to believe so, because he was so cautious (when I was with him) what he said.</p>

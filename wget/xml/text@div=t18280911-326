               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not accuse a man named Williams? A. Yes, at Worship-street; I was in Williams' company, but did not drink; I drank a pint of beer or so at two or three houses; the prisoner was outside the office when Williams was there; he was about four yards off; he came and asked me for 3s. to pay for brandy and water which he had when we were drinking - I refused, and he said he would take me up for taking bakers' sacks; I had seen him before he came up to me; I had been looking for him for a fortnight: if I had not seen him he would not have spoken; it was Williams struck me, not the prisoner - he was with him - that was on the 19th.</p>
               <p>Q. The sack was taken on the 21st? A. Yes - I prosecuted two men here last November.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. We drank together on the Tuesday; he said Williams had robbed him; we went to seven public-houses, and were drinking from two to eleven o'clock; there glasses of brandy and water were scored to us; I left him, and next morning the landlady called on me about it; I went to the office to ask him for it - he said he would not pay it.</p>

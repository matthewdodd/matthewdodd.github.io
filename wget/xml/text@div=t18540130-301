                  </hi>. I am a seaman and shipwright, of Sunderland. When I am in London, I live at Poplar—on 6th Jan. I was discharged at Lime-house from my ship—I left there about half-past 1 o'clock, with a young man named Thomas Lamming—I had with me 46<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was seven months' pay which I had received, and also some money I had received in the West Indies—there was upwards of 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes and gold—I was inquiring the way to a tailor's shop, to buy some clothes, as I wanted to change my sailor's dress; and between the Highway and the Commercial-road we met a man, who took us to two or three tailors' shops, and I bought a jacket and a pair of trowsers—I wanted to put on the clothes, and he took us to a public house, which I have been told is in Skinner-street, the Weavers' Arms—I changed my clothes—there is a room up stairs—I was standing in my drawers, with my trowsers off, in the room, when three gentlemen came into the room where I was, and in a few minutes afterwards the prisoner came in—the man who took me there was a stranger to me, but I should know him again if I were to see him—he was there when the three gentlemen came in—the prisoner wanted to sell a muffler or handkerchief—he asked 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it; I offered him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but he would not take it—at last he said, "I will do it this way;" he pulled out some cards from his pocket, took three cards from the pack, and I put them on the table; he turned one of them, and said, "If you will lay the money opposite this card, and lift it up, you can have the handkerchief; but if you do not, you will lose if—it was the queen of spades or clubs; the colour was black—he then changed the cards, and put them all three down on the table, with their backs up—one of the others laid three or four shillings down on the table, and lifted the right card, and won the handker<lb></lb>chief—the one who took me there then bet a sovereign or a half sovereign, and lost—I was the next; I put down a half crown or 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at first; I do not know which; I then selected a card, and lost—he had changed the card before that, from the queen of spades to the ten of spades, saying,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185401300065"></xptr>
               <p>"I will change them"—I betted a second time—I put down half a sovereign or a sovereign, and lost—(I had drunk a glass of rum with the gentleman who took me into the room, in a public house on the road which I was not acquainted with, but I did not feel any particular effects from it—I went into a coffee shop after buying the clothes, and had two cups of coffee)—I put down a sovereign a second time, and lost that; I then put down a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and lost that; then I put down two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and lost them—I laid the money down on the table, and the prisoner took it up—I did not take notice of what happened next—I knew I had ruined my wife and family through my foolishness—I next saw him take the notes and money out of his pocket, and give them into the right hand of another man—I knew them to be mine by their being crushed—it was one of the three who had come into the room, and who had betted—when the money was handed to the man, he went away, but not immediately; he left about half a minute after he got the money—I asked the prisoner not to go, as I wished to speak to him—he said what did I want with him—I followed him down stairs, got him into a corner, and told him I had been wrongly swindled out of my money; he said I had not—I then went to the door, and asked Thomas Lamming, my Mend, to come in, as I wanted to speak to him—he did not come in—the man who had the money then went out of the room—the prisoner then made the attempt to go out, and succeeded—I followed him down stairs, and shouted, "Stop thief!"—he ran, and was turned by three or four men—he attempted to run past me, and I caught him, and told him he had robbed me—he said, "Don't give me in charge, and you shall have your own notes back again"—I kept hold of him till a policeman came—he told the policeman that if I would wait a quarter of an hour, I should have the money—I waited between the street and the public house—he took us to a public house, which I think they call the Pheenix—we waited there about a quarter of an hour, and then went to the police station, and gave him in charge.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. I suppose you would rather have won the money than lost it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; Lamming had been paid that day, but I had his money,</p>

               <p>and he did not play—I lost all my money—when I selected one card, and lifted it up, and found it was the wrong one, the prisoner lifted the other two cards off the table and kept them in his hand—he sometimes had the remaining cards of the pack in his hand, and sometimes in his pocket—there were seven persons in the room—I do not know whether they all played except Lamming—some of them played after I had com<lb></lb>menced to bet—I was the third who bet—I swear that the prisoner handed the money to another man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sailor, and live at Prince's-square, St. George's in the East. I am a shipmate of the last witness—I was paid off early in Jan.—I recollect being in Forson's company somewhere in Whitechapel—we met a man, who took us to a public house, which I do not know the name of, where Forson changed his clothes—while he was doing so, three persons came in, and about five minutes afterwards the prisoner came in, and pulled out a handkerchief to sell—I think he asked 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it; Forson offered him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he would not take it, but said, "I will do it this way," taking out a pack of cards, and shuffling three of them—I do not understand cards—the three men bet, and then Forson bet; he put down half a crown first; he lost, and then put down 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and lost that; then he put down half a sovereign, and lost it, and then he put down two sovereigns, one after another, and lost them, and then a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note; he lost that, and then put down two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes, and lost them—the prisoner took up the money, and I saw him hand the notes to another man, who said as soon as he had got the money, "I am off now"—Forson said to me, "Come, <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, let us go," but I said, "Stay still"—that was when he had lost part of the money—when he said, "Let us go," I thought he meant, "Come along, let us both go together," but he says he did not—the man got away with the notes, and Forson ran after the prisoner, and caught him—they all rushed out together—I was not in the street when the prisoner was caught, I remained in the public house; I was not able to go out—I have had a fall from aloft, which broke my foot, and I am lame—I did not bet at all—when Forson got hold of the prisoner, he said, "Don't give me in charge, and you shall have your own money back"—that was when he was brought back into the house—he was kept there pretty nearly two hours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you hear anything said about a card being marked? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; one of the party said that one of the cards was turned up at the edge—the game still went on—I suppose the edge was turned down again—I do not know whether it was put into the pack, or whether he went on with it—it was one of the three who came into the room who said that—it is impossible for me to tell whether he went on with that card, because if it was turned down again, it would be like the rest—I am pretty certain that there was cheating in the matter—I know the cards were changed once, the three he played with first—most likely that would be after it was said that one was marked—I do not understand it at all—I know they were changed once, three were put back, and three taken out.</p>

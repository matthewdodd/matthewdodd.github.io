               <p>I was last Monday at Chelsea Hospital with some company, and when I came home, I parted with them in the Strand, and I was going to St. Paul's, and I missed my road; I asked a watchman the way as I was going on the road, I saw a man run off from the door; there was another watchman coming, and there was this side of bacon standing on a bulk; I took it up, I did not carry it twenty yards, I asked him the way to Bagnigge-wells, I thought I was near there, and he took me into custody; I told him I had not stolen the bacon, and knew nothing of it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>

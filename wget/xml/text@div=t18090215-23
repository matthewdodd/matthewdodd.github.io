On the 28th of January my shop was broken open; I saw the windows secured myself; I went to bed at past twelve o'clock; between three and four o'clock in the morning I was alarmed by the knocking at the door; on coming down I found the shutter of the glass door was down.</p>
               <p>Q. Would that admit a person in - A. The pannel of the shutter was taken out, a boy might have got in, I do not know that a man could. I missed about fifteen yards of printed cotton and some shawls.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen these things the last time before they were stolen - A. The day before; there was an interior door in the shop where these things hanged; the arm was introduced through the hole of the pannel.</p>

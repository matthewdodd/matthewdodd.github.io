Haslem turned round and gave me very bad language, and said I had stole the clothes, that they were not my property, and got away; a person behind me said he supposed I was wronged, and desired me to apply to a person who took Haslem, that was about nine o'clock; Matthews was taken about twelve o'clock the same night. When I was before Justice Sherwood I saw the salesman who had bought the clothes; he had them at home then.</p>

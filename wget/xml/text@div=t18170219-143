I saw him cutting the seals off, and said, "he is cutting your seals off," and took hold of his hand. Mr. Meredith laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>BOWEN DUNN MEREDITH. I live in Whitechapel-road. Between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning, on the 31st of January, I was in Jennings's shop, Mine told me the prisoner was cutting my seals off - I caught him by the collar. My seals were safe when I went into the shop, I missed them, and distinctly saw the prisoner drop them. The seals and key were found just behind him; I found a pair of scissars in another part of the shop. My watch ribbon appeared to be cut with scissars.</p>

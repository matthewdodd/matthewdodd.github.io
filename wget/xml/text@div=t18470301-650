On the 20th of Feb., between eight and nine in the evening, my attention was called to the prisoner, who was standing. against my counter—the shopman who was serving her lifted up her shawl and took a piece of ribbon from under her arm—I then went round the counter and took another piece which was close under her arm—she begged very hard to be let off, and said it was distress led her to it—she had bought some ribbon, which she paid for.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engine driver on the Metropolitan Raikay—I have known the prisoner some time as a fireman on the same line—on Saturday night, 4th November, or early on Sunday morning, a few words took place between us respecting our faults, telling one another our faults, and little scuffle took place but there was nothing serious—my mate Prior was present—the prisoner and Prior had a fight, but it had nothing to do with me, I only tried to part them—the prisoner drew a knife out and I told him to put it away or I should call a policeman and give him in charge—he put it away and we parted good friends, as I thought, and shook hands—the prisoner and my mate had a fight on the Monday; and on the Tuesday I saw him strike my mate and knock him down in the road in Chapel Street—I went to part them, and said it was quite time the matter was settled it had been going on a long time—he said that he had done with he but he had not done with my mate, and he would have his revenge on me some other time—he drew a knife that day when I was talking to him—I saw it in his hand—I was close to him—on Thursday morning, 9th November, about 1.40, I saw him in Lison Grove—he walked in front of me and turned into Stafford Street and let me pass him—he then followed me and just as I entered the Chapel Street works he came running behind me—I turned round and he was 4 yards or 5 yards from me—he pulled a revolver from his breast and fired at me—I fell and lost my senses for a while, when I came to myself a little I got up and went towards him, and as I did so he fired again, but the shot did not take effect—I hallooed "Police!" and Murder)—as I ran away he fired at me again but missed me—I ran down the stain and fell insensible through excitement as soon as I had crossed the line.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I said to him that I had many times attempted to push him off the engine when he has annoyed me—I am much bigger than he is—that was before he was made a fireman, when he was in charge of the engine one night—I said that some time ago not, on this occasion—he said that if he was as big as me he would have a <hi rend="italic">go in</hi> at me that was after the Saturday.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman D</hi> 148). On 9th November, about 5 a.m., I was on duty in Lisson Street, and heard a shot—I stopped the prisoner and asked him what he had done—he said "I have shot a man in Chapel Street"—he was walking—I said "You will have to come back with me-"—he said "Very well, constable, you must do your duty.; I will go back with you"—a gentleman said "That is the man, he shot a man in Chapel Street, I saw him do it"—the cabman said "So did I"—the prisoner said "That is quite right, constable; I shot him three times"—I asked him what he had done with the fire-arms—he said "I have got them in my pocket"—I said "You had better give it to me"—he said "Very well," put his hand into the breast pocket of his coat, pulled out this six-chamber revolver (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and gave it to me, saying "There are two charges in it; it is not cocked, you need not be afraid of it"—I found two charges in it—it had been recently discharged—a bullet was afterwards shown me by a man working on the Underground Railway, and it fits the revolver—as we were going to search the prisoner he put his hand in his pocket and pulled out these seven cartridges (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which fit the re<lb></lb>volver—I afterwards took the prisoner to the foot of the prosecutor's bed, when a Magistrate attended—the prisoner said <hi rend="italic">"Joe</hi>, you got what you deserved; I told you you were too good a man for me to fight, but I should have my revenge out of you some day or other, I don't care whether you die or not, because if you die I shall have to die for it: I don't care, I have had my revenge."</p>

I am one of the resident medical officers of St. Mary's; Hospital, Paddington—on 9th November, about 9.15, Carr was brought there nearly unconscious, and I ordered him immediately into; a ward—I saw a circular hole in his shirt, and on taking it off, I saw a small hole about the size of the apex of my little finger on the inner side of his right nipple—it was very deep, and almost perpendicular—I saw a piece of his coat in the wound—his coat and vest were perforated at the same place—I removed the material from the wound and put in a large probe, but found that I struck nothing—I carefully examined his chest, and came to the conclusion that the bullet had passed into the pleural cavity—there were signs that a large quantity of blood had been extravasated into the cavity—the bullet is still in his chest—I called Mr. Giles, my colleague, we thought the man was going to die, and his deposition was taken—he afterwards had severe inflammation of the lungs; and pleurisy and in<lb></lb>flammation of the liver and bowels—the cells of his lungs 'have collapsed together, and a foreign body being still there he is not as certain of life as he was before.</p>

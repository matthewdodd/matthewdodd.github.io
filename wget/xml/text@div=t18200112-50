            . I live with Mr. Hoskins, in High-street, Shadwell. On the 21st of December, about three o'clock, or a little after, the prisoners came to the shop, and asked to look at some Irish linen? They both looked at it and spoke about it; they bought three yards of that, and three yards of print, which came to 6 s. 6 d. together. Wicks laid down a 1 l. note to pay for them. I asked her name and address? and she gave me,</p>
               <p>"Powell, 2, Church-street, St. George's, Shadwell," which I immediately wrote on the note with a pencil, and gave it to

            , our boy, to get change. He went out, returned, and went into the parlour to Mr. Hoskins - he brought no change - (looks at the note) - this is it. It has the pencil writing on the face. I afterwards wrote it in ink at the office on the examination. It is the note Wicks paid me that day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner PITCHER. Q. Did I stand close to her when she gave her address? Did I not stand close to the door - She stood close by her and both spoke and acted together - they both acted in the purchase. When the note was put on the counter she was gone to the door, but she returned directly, before I had finished taking the address.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was she from Wicks - A. About three or four yards - the note laid on the counter, and I was writing on it. I do not think she was present when Wicks paid me the note, but when she gave me the address she was, She was not a moment at the door - the note was paid while she went to the door. She must have seen it when I was writing on it, as she stood where she did before, and saw me give it to the boy to get change. When the boy returned Mr. Hoskins came out of the parlour, asked her whether she could pay for the things? and asked them where they got the note? - it was said that it was suspected to be a bad one; I did not hear what else passed. Wicks asked for the goods when they came into the shop.</p>

            . I am apprentice to the prosecutor, and remember the prisoners coming to the shop - they made a purchase. Scaife gave me a 1 l. note to get change. I took it out to a person, named Butler, but did not get it changed there. I took it to two other places, and at last to Mr. Dorvell's young man - they did not change it because it was forged. I took it to Mr. Dorvell, himself, who gave his opinion that it was forged, and accompanied me to my master's. I went into the parlour to Mr. Hoskins, and gave him the note; he went into the shop to Mr. Dorvell, where the prisoners were. I did not lose sight of the note until I brought it back.</p>

             brought a note into the parlour to me, I immediately went into the shop, and asked the prisoners where they got it? Wicks said she got it last night from a gentleman. I asked her the gentleman's name? She said she did not know. I then asked them both where they came from? They both said they lived in Black Lion-court, Tooley-street, or No. 29, Morgan's-lane, which I wrote on the note - this is it - (looking at it) - Pitcher said the place was called by both names. I wrote it on the note, and said it was a pity Wicks had given a false address, as I saw my young man's writing on the back,</p>
               <p>"Powell, Church-street, St. George's." Pitcher then said it was a pity she had given a false address. I asked them if they had any more of these notes about them? and if they were willing to be searched? Pitcher said,</p>
               <p>"I don't care who searches me," and turned out her pockets - there was nothing in them but a key, that I saw. I said I would detain the note, and if it proved to be a good one in the morning, I would give them the change, but if it was bad they would hear further from me. Pitcher went away and never returned. Wicks remained a little, then sidled out of the shop, and went away, leaving the note with me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner PITCHER. Q. You asked me if I could send for some one to pay for the goods. I went out to pledge for them - A. I cannot say I recollect it - it might be.</p>

            . I live at No. 215, High-street, Shadwell, and am a linen-draper. Curtis brought me a note. In consequence of suspicions I had of it I went to the prosecutor's, and found the prisoners in the shop; the prosecutor came from the parlour, and I told him, in their presence and hearing, that the note was forged. He said it was a pitty she had given a wrong address, and wished them to leave the note. I said I had no doubt but they were common utterers. The prosecutor took the address from Pitcher, and detained the note. Pitcher said she would go out and pledge her ring, and pay for the goods; she went out, and in a little while after Wicks followed her; I followed Wicks out. When she got to the door she did not not know which way to turn, but looked one way and then the other, as if for the other prisoner. I directed her towards my own house, being determined to apprehend her. As we were going along Pitcher came out of a pawnbroker's within one door of my own, and they joined company together immediately. I asked them to step into my shop, as I wished to have some conversation with them. I then sent for an officer, and had them apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you have any conversation with them - A. I had - Wicks said she got it from a man with whom she had been in the habit of cohabiting - they did not know I had sent for an officer. I wrote on a piece of paper,</p>
               <p>"Go for Hewitt," gave it to my boy, and said,</p>
               <p>"Go for Jackson, and see if my hat is done.</p>

            . My husband lives in Ratcliff-highway, and is a haberdasher; our shop is about ten minutes walk from the prosecutor's. On the 21st of December, before three o'clock, the prisoners came to my shop - it was nearer three than two. Wicks asked for womens' stockings; Pitcher stood by her. They both looked at them, and bought two pair at 18 d. each.</p>
               <p>Q. Who purchased - A. Both looked at them, and talked about them, respecting whether they were large enough. Wicks produced a 1 l. bank note - Pitcher stood by her at the time. I asked Wicks for the address? and she gave me</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Smart, No. 2, Fort-place, Bermondsey" I should imagine it was in Pitcher's hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. On Wicks giving you the address did Pitcher make any remark - A. No. I wrote on the note before them - this is it - (looking at it) - Pitcher was persuading Wicks to buy a stuff dress, but she said she could not afford it that day, and she would call again. I gave 17 s. in change - I believe Wicks took it; one of them took the stockings away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner PITCHER. Q. Did I not stand at the door the while - A. Not the whole of the time. They came in together, and talked about the stockings; Pitcher afterwards went to the door, and returned; the door is a very few yards from where Wicks stood. She was scarcely a moment at the door, she only looked at some stuffs, came back before the address was given, and was present when it was given.</p>

            . I am am an officer of Shadwell. I was sent for to the prosecutor's, and found the prisoners there. I searched them, and found two half-crowns, 1 s., and 6 d. in copper on Pitcher; also a duplicate for 6 s. I saw Morris search Wicks, but nothing was found on her - there was no silver, stockings, black stuff, linen, or any thing. There is no such street as Church-street, St. George's - I have known the parish twenty years.</p>

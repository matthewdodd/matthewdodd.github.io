I am in the service of Mrs. Neighbour, a coffee home keeper, at Upper Street Islington—on Wednesday night the 9th September, the prisoner came in between 11 and 12 and went into No. 2 box—there was no one else there from the time he went in till he was taken into custody—there was a salt cellar there—I served him with a cup of tea and one slice of bread and butter; that would come to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he paid with a bad half-crown I spoke to my mistress and a man named Dawson.</p>

I keep this coffee shop—on 9th September I saw the prisoner in my shop—my servant brought me a half-crown and I sent her to Mr. Dawson with it—I went to the front door and waited till she came back—she then handed me the half-crown again—when Mr. Dawson came I went to the prisoner and told him it was a bad one and that I thought I recognized him as a man who was in my shop on the Saturday, and then I</p>

               <p>took a bad half-crown—he said he did not know it was bad, and had not been there before—he was not the worse for liquor—a constable was fetched and the prisoner was taken into custody—I gave the half-crown to the constable—next day my attention was called to another bad half-crown, which was found in the salt cellar which was on the table in box No. 2 the previous night—I gave that to the constable also.</p>

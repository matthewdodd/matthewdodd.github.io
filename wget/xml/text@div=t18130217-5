            . I live at No. 1, Russell-place, Bow-street, Covent Garden. I am a widow.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you out on the 8th of February last - A. Last Monday week I was, from a quarter to half past eleven in the evening. I was coming from Whitechapel. I was in the <placeName id="t18130217-5-crimeloc30">Strand, near the bottom of Newcastle-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18130217-5-crimeloc30" type="placeName" value="Strand, near the bottom of Newcastle-street"></interp>

I heard some persons come after me; I turned my head, I looked, I saw three men follow me. I had no sooner put one foot before the other, I received a blow on the back of my neck. I was knocked down.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you tell by whom the blow was struck - A. I could not. I was knocked down. I saw two men run before me. I arose up immediately. Another man I found by my side. I had my pocket handkerchief twisting round my hand. I found the prisoner by my side; he was trying to take the handkerchief out of my hand. The moment the handkerchief let go I laid hold of the man by the skirt of his coat.</p>
               <p>Q. He succeeded in getting your handkerchief from you - A. Yes. I laid hold of the skirt of his coat, and called out, watchman, stop thief. The watchman and patrol came up, and took him. He was taken to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. When the watchman and patrol came up had he got away from you - A. No; they came up before he got away from me. He was taken to the watchhouse, and the handkerchief was found on him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose anything else - A. Nothing else than the mantle and pocket handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get your mantle again - A. No, sir. I lost the mantle the instant. I was knocked down. It was only pinned. They took hold of the hood, and it was gone instantly. It was not tied.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say anything when he was struggling with you for the handkerchief - A. Not a word, as I heard.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be out so late - A. Sometimes I am out as late as twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You are usually out late of nights, are you - A. Not always, sometimes, generally within these two months.</p>
               <p>Q. What way of business are you - A. Sometimes I take in needle work, sometimes I go out washing, and if I do not get enough to pay my rent I go out. I have a ready furnished room at four shillings a week.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been out - A. All day almost.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a light night - A. It was lamp-light; whether the moon was up I cannot say. It was near the bottom of Newcastle-street. It is not a light part. I cannot swear to the two men, nor can I swear that this man was going with the other men. I can only speak to him as the person that I found by my side, I was knocked down. I was a good deal alarmed and flurried by the blow. I soon recovered. I arose up, and found the men were gone from my shoulders. I saw two men running away. I found this person by my side.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you say you lost your mantle - A. When I was knocked down. It was only my handkerchief that was found upon the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he use any violence to get the handkerchief from you - A. Not as I perceived. He over-pulled me to get it from me. The watchman came up in two or three minutes after he got my handkerchief. I keeping hold of him he did not endeavour to get away as I perceived. I was in a flurry at the time.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 8th, I was out; I heard a cry. I got up as fast as I could. I saw the prosecutrix had got hold of the prisoner by the skirt of his coat. She said she had been knocked down and robbed, and the prisoner was one of them. She said she had lost her mantle. My partner and me took him to the watchhouse. Mrs. Ryan said he was one of them that knocked her down and robbed her. He told me she had knocked him down. I said, come to the watchhouse and settle it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the appearance of being down - A. Yes, he had. As we were going to the watchhouse I observed him busy with his hand under his coat. I said, what is this you are at. He said, it is only my handkerchief; so I took the handkerchief from him. He made no objection to my taking it. The prosecutrix and my partner were before me. When I went in the watchhouse I said I found a handkerchief. The prosecutrix described the handkerchief. She said there was a burnt hole in it; it had been darned up. I said she had described the handkerchief pretty well. I have had the handkerchief in my custody ever since. This is the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. This is my handkerchief.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence; called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

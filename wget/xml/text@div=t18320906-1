               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you worn it often? A. Not very; I swear to it by a stain of tobacco on the sleeve, and there is a piece of rag and different things in the pocket - no violence was done to my lock.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 21st of August, about a quarter to seven o'clock in the morning, I stopped the prisoner coming out of Three Cups-alley into George-street, with this coat on, over his own clothes; another young man was with him - I saw them running very fast, and stopped the prisoner; he made great resistance: as I took him to the station, I asked him where he got the coat from - he said he picked it up, he lid not say where; I have had it ever since: I returned to Davies' house, and found the rest of the property - I first saw the prisoner about fifty yards from the prosecutor's house, coming in a direction from it; I had been watching three or four of them for half an hour, and had seen him near the place about six o'clock, in company with three others - he had not got this coat on then; when I took him he had it on over his own black coat: I searched, and found only a knife on him - I cannot say whether the others had any thing about them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he putting the coat on when you saw him? A. No, he had got it on; he had been out of my sight about twenty minutes - the things would make a middling size bundle, such as he could carry; there was no mark of violence on the prosecutor's lock - I found nothing on the prisoner to pick it with.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How could the door be opened? A. By a skeleton-key very easily.</p>

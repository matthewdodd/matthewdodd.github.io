               <p>In consequence of some information, I went to the Fleet Prison; I went first to the strong room where the prisoner was in custody in the Fleet Prison; Mr. Lawrance, Mr. Carpmeal, and Mr. Harper went with me, and another person whose name is Bryan, I searched the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did these people all go into the strong room with you? - They did; in his right hand breeches pocket I found some silver, this was on the 25th of February, I don't remember the day of the week, about eleven or twelve o'clock. (The silver produced.) When we had so done we went into a room, his apartment, and there I saw a box which the prisoner declared was his; Mr. Lawrance took the base metal out of the box, I saw it in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this box open when you first saw it? - No, Mr. Lawrance opened it, he took out some half crowns, shillings and six-pences, and some broken pieces, and I think one half crown.</p>
               <p>Q. Did these appear to you to be good or bad? - Bad.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This man was in the strong room? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from the room where you found the box? - It is the next floor.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons were in the room where you found these things? - I think only one.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect his name? - I do not, he told me it was the man he was chum to.</p>
               <p>Q. That man is not here to day? - I have not seen him.</p>
               <p>Q. He was a prisoner likewise? - I understand so.</p>
               <p>Q. You talk about a box which you found there. Did the prisoner go with you to the room where you found these things? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you only talk of a box in that room? - We went back to him after we had been to that room and told him what we had found, he said it was his room; and Mr. Lawrance produced the money to him.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner never saw the box from which you took this money from? - He did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100017"></xptr>Q. In point of fact he was not taken to that place? - He was not.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the box opened? - I cannot tell whether it was opened with a key or without.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the money that was found the half crown, shilling, and other pieces of money appeared bad to you? - They did.</p>
               <p>Q. No man living who saw it could doubt it was bad? A man would have been a great fool to have taken it - I should not have taken it if I had looked at it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen. You have been asked as to this box, if I understand you right, you took this money to the prisoner, and asked him if that was his box, describing the box it was taken from? - Mr. Lawrance did; he said it was his box.</p>

               <p>I am one of the city officers; I went with Mr. Clarke into the Fleet Prison, the prisoner at the bar was sitting at the further side of the fire place in the Strong Room, in the Fleet Prison; I searched him, in his right hand waistcoat pocket I found these papers, I went with Mr. Clarke into another apartment, which we were informed was his room, he acknowledged the box I opened was his box.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing about the apartment? - I don't recollect he did. We found a little bench on the window, and on the bench a flask. (Produced.) On the bench there was a parcel of files, they were all open in the room on the bench; the bench was on the front before the window; I found all these things on the bench or under the bench, some galley pots, a pewter pot, some broken crucibles, a parcel of metal, a hand vise, several files, a vial, and a bottle with liquor in them; here are four galley pots, I will not be certain for all, but three of them were on the stone outside of the window. Then I went to the box, the box was locked, I opened it with my bureau key, and I found this base silver, a half crown, five shillings, and one six-pence; five incomplete things, which I will call shillings, two six-pences, incomplete, and then there was some get, and this paper was likewise in the box. There was some spoons found which are here.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any spoons in the box? - None.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with you when you found these things? - Carpmeal, and Mr. Clarke, and Bryan, and Harper; I went back after to him, and he acknowledged it to be his box.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew him the money that was taken out of the box? - I did not I attended the examination, and he saw the money; I shewed it him while he was under examination.</p>
               <p>Court. When he acknowledged the box did you describe the room where the box was? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body in your presence? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You had been in a room, and asked him if that box was his box, he said it was? - Now all these things were public for any body's inspection, perhaps you have heard that he has a Chum? - I have heard that; the Chum was below, and was brought up to open the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the Chum had the key of the door, and he let you in? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. And all these things were found at that window on the bench public? - Except that which I have described.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it was your key that opened the box? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Let us look at it, this is a very common key? - It is, but it was with some difficalty I got it open with it I assure you.</p>

               <p>I am the Chamberlain of the Fleet; the prisoner at the bar occupies No. 9, the room where the officers went; his Chum's name is Hunt, he was chummed on him the fifth of February, 1793. The man at the bar was the master of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he occupied that room before February? - Some years; he moved to another room, and moved back to that room again.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he been confined in the Strong Room? - I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever go into his room while he was there? - Frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been there in the month of February? - I cannot charge my memory.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see a box? - I see two or three boxes there in the room, the day they searched the room; I believe they searched several boxes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I think you say Hunt was the Chum then; who had been his Chum before? - One Rushton and others.</p>
               <p>Q. This man was not rich enough to buy off his Chum? - I never knew he did, as long as I ever knew him, he had his Chum; I cannot charge my memory that ever he paid his Chum out.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe this man had had the misfortune to quarrel with several of his fellow prisoners? - He has quarrelled with his Chum.</p>
               <p>Q. And I believe very shortly before this time he had a complaint put in against him, for an assault on some person? - He did, his name is Tracy.</p>
               <p>Q. In short, I believe this man is disliked by almost all the prisoners in the Fleet Prison? - I cannot tell; I have known him to have a quarrel with that man that was chummed upon him, and was obliged to put in bail. Tracey had been his Chum. Hunt introduced Tracey as his Chum, who has slept in that room during the absence of this man in the Strong Room.</p>
               <p>Q. Hunt then introduced Tracey into this room, who has indicted the prisoner for an assault. Now Mr. Keene how long before this discovery was made, was this man confined in the Strong Room, and unable to visit this room, which was his, was it four or five days? - I cannot speak exactly, it was thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Then for four or five days this room, and whatever the man had in it was completely at the disposal of Tracey? - It was so.</p>
               <p>Q. And Tracey who has an ill will to him, and indicted him for an assault has slept there, and been in that room. Now we find how very easily the box was opened; if that box which was opened was his there is nothing more easy on earth to open. Did not this man make pewter spoons? - I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know that he sold them about the prison? You have seen him at work? - I don't know indeed; I have seen him rasping and filing spoons when I have come in to gather the rent; I believe he has sold several in the prison.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Who is Mr. Tracey? - The man that was concerned in raising the Royal George.</p>
               <p>Q. He desired to get rid of Tracey? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not like him to come into the room? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Court. You told us you saw a box in that room which the prisoner acknowledged; was it described to him? - The colour of the box was described to him; there was one a deal box and this was a dark brown box.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him where you had been? - We did not; we went to him and searched him, and then we were directed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100019"></xptr>to that room as his room, and then we went back and shewed him what we had found, and he acknowledged it was his box it was taken out of.</p>
               <p>Q. You said before, that he had not seen the property? - He did not see it, he said, the box was his that the property was taken from, but he never was shewn it.</p>

               <p>Q. There was a bill of perjury preferred against you, was it tried? - There was a man of the name of Dillon.</p>
               <p>Q. Answer the plain question; have you been tried on that indictment for perjury? - I believe I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say only that you believe? was not you struck off the list from practising at the English bar? - Upon my oath I was; and hindered from proceeding in this kingdom, without being heard. I believe there was no other reason for striking me off, but because I was an Irishman. On my oath I was not heard. On my oath there was no ground for the indictment.</p>
               <p>Court. I look upon him as a competent witness.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - I do. I have known him some time; I knew two apartments that he occupied; the first apartment was No. 14, and I remember him at No. 2. There was only a wall between his apartment and mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him at No. 9? - I have been with him in the apartment No. 9, I think it is in the third gallery, I called on him only once there to the best of my recollection; I went into his room, he was only sitting by the fire and doing nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him at work there? - No, never. In No. 2, I have seen him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago? - I believe four or five months ago, when he lived at No. 14 or 15, there was some report of this business from a woman that he lived with; but I have often waked at night with the noise at No. 2, I was curious to know what it was.</p>
               <p>Court. I think this is nothing to No. 9.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police'Constable K</hi> 162.) On the evening of the 8th of Dec. I was on duty near Mr. Holloway's premises, at East Ham—I saw Keen<lb></lb>ing coming away from a wall—he went towards the backs of some houses, where Tarling lives—having some suspicion, I secreted myself—in about two minutes he returned, got on the wall, and jumped over into his master's pre<lb></lb>mises—he was followed by a person who I believe to be Tarling, who stood looking over the wall—he went back again—in about ten minutes Keening came round the end of the wall, through the garden, and towards the end of the houses a second time—he directly returned accompanied by Tarling, came through the end of the garden, and at the end of the garden I saw him deliver a basket to Tarling—it was not the prosecutor's garden—they came up the garden together, to within twenty feet of where I was standing, and put the basket down—they had some conversation—Keening then went to his mas<lb></lb>

I had several sacks of potatoes in a shed on my premises—I was not at home at the time this happened—I examined one of my sacks next morning, and found about half a cwt. deficient—I compared the potatoes remaining in the sack with those found on Tarling, and have no doubt whatever they are the same sort—I produce some of each—the shed was about 150 or 200 yards from the wall the policeman mentioned—the pri<lb></lb>soners were in my employ—Keening was at work cleaning some beasts that were tied up—he would be able to remove the potatoes from the shed—he was at work close against the shed when my son went in to his tea—Keening has worked for me, on and off, all his lifetime, and Tarling perhaps six months—he was at work the week before, and on the Saturday he received a guinea, to take for a little more than five days' work—Keening had 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week.</p>

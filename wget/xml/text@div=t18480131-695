                  </hi>. I live at 7, Lower Brook-street, Grosvenor-square—I have some race-horses. On 4th Dec. last I received this letter, marked "A"—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—" Mr. Kirtons', 3, Peerless-place,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184801310115"></xptr>
               <p>City-road, 4th Dec., 1847. Sir,—Understanding you are the confederate with Mr. Mostyn, in the Bea<lb></lb>tinck stud, I take up my pen to disclose the whole affair relative to the horses belonging to the Goodwood-stables being got at this last racing sea<lb></lb>son, more <hi rend="italic">particular</hi> in reference to <hi rend="italic">Planet, Redhcart</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Glentilt</hi>; and if we can come to terms, as I can prove the facts, the of <hi rend="italic">Planet</hi> and the other horses, <hi rend="italic">was</hi> got at, and a certain drug given to them so as to ensure their losing any race they starts for, and likewise injuring the constitution of the horses. I hear that it has been hinted, in some paper, this last week, that the trainer, Kent, knows all about it, and the stable likewise; but this I can prove to be false, and likewise that the same parties will again, if possible, get at the Goodwood Derby horses again next year, as one of the parties engaged in that affair is busily engaged in laying long odds against a horse called <hi rend="italic">Surplice</hi>, in the stable. If, Sir, you choose to come to my terms, the parties all concerned in the affair shall be given up to you, and likewise some of the stuff that was given to the horses, with every proof of the same, and no surmise, but all facts. My terms are as follow: that you shall send me, per return of post, on the receipt of this letter, a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note; I will then meet you on Thursday; it cannot be before, as one witness will have to come from the country, and I must send him some money down to pay his expenses up to London, at any place and time you choose to appoint; and I will bring all the witnesses and proofs against the parties engaged in it; and after I have done so, and have proved to your satisfaction that what I state is true, and the parties are in your possession, that you shall further remunerate me with a sum of not less than 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. If you agree to this, I shall thank you to let me hear per return of post, so that there be no delay in the affair, and that the parties engaged in it may be thoroughly exposed. Awaiting your answer, I remain, Sir, your obedient servant, <hi rend="smallCaps">HENRY HALFORD</hi>.')—In consequence of receiving that, I wrote a letter addressed to Henry Halford, 3, Peerless-place, City-road—I have no doubt that letter was posted—(<hi rend="italic">the prisoner admitted that notice had been given him to produce this letter, but denied having it</hi>)—it was to the effect that I should be happy to hear anything he had to say if he called on me, but I should decline sending the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. till I heard something more—some days after the prisoner came to my house, and represented that he had been sent by his father, who was unable to come himself—he asked me whether I had not received a note from his father, Henry Halford, promising to give me some information with reference to a conspiracy, which he alleged had existed, and did exist, for the purpose of drugging or poisoning race-horses; and if his father had not undertaken to produce certain witness, if 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was given him for the purpose of paying their necessary expenses up to London—I told him that I had heard from his father to that effect; and upon his further statement I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he gave his own name as Alfred Halford—he said he was to take he 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to his father; that he had sent him for it; that he was going to Manchester, for one place, and was to fetch up three witnesses, named Wood, Thacker, and Phelps—I do not know such persons—before I gave him the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he produced to me this letter, signed "Williams"—he said he had it from his father—he said his father had been implicated in these conspiracies for some yeard, and he had received large sums of money at different times—this is a letter purporting to come to his father, from Williams, the head of the gang—(<hi rend="italic">this letter was dated 13th Dec.</hi>, 1847, <hi rend="italic">from the Prince of Wales, Clarence-street, Brighton, in which several parties were named as connected with the supposed transaction, out of which the writer hoped</hi> 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">would be realized</hi>)—he said that his father did not intend to disclose the names of all the partied engaged, but only those certain partied who had behaved shabbily towards him upon some oc<lb></lb>casion; that he himself had not, up to that time, taken any part personally in the conspiracy, though he was aware of what had been going on; that he had no desire to take any part in it, but that his father and brother had not behaved well towards him; and as he knew they meant to deceive me, he would, if I would reward and protect him, work on his own account, and get me information which they intended to deny me—upon the strength of this statement, I gave him the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to give to his father—I took this receipt from him—I wrote it, and he signed it in my presence—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Received 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my father, Mr. H. Halford, to fetch witnesses up to London to prove that the Goodwood horses were drugged. For H. Halford, A. Halford.")—After that I had several interviews with the prisoner—he produced to me, upon those occasions, a mass of letters, some written in blue, and some in black ink—they were generally similar to the letters signed "Williams"—I have them here.</p>

               <p>to join them if I thought it would be of any advantage to me, and I said I would give you such protection as I could if you brought me informa<lb></lb>tion relative to the parties—when you brought me a letter with four crosses, and some drugs, which you said you had obtained from Williams, I cannot say that I trembled, I might have shown some agitation—I may have said I thought I had seen writing like it—I do not recollect saying that I knew the writer—this is the letter (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—letters, marked "D, "E," and "F," are my writing—I have no knowledge of such persons as Wood, Thacker, and Phelps, except as represented in letters purporting to come from them—you said a person named Ashcroft had been pointed out as one of the persons who had been engaged in drugging horses—I believe I said that a person had pointed Ashcroft out to me at Ascot races.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, of North Audley-street. A lady in Orchard-street, who goes by the name of Madame Sophie, is a customer of mine—on 2nd Sept., in the evening, the prisoner brought me this note—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Mrs. Sophie presents her compliments to Mr. Stephens, and will feel obliged if he will cash the inclosed cheque for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and by so doing he will greatly oblige; notes will do; No. 1, Orchard-street, Portroan-square")—(<hi rend="italic">Cheque read</hi>: "Messrs. Coutts and Co.; please pay Mr. Stephens, or bearer, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on my account; T. H. Sophie")—I told the prisoner I would send my young man with the money; she said, "You must send it directly, as they are waiting for it"—I put the money in my pocket, and followed her—she went towards Orchard-street, but turned down the first turning, quite in an opposite direction—I followed her some distance, tapped her on the shoulder, and asked her if she did not want the change for Madame Sophie—she said, "Yes, they are waiting for it"—I said, "Will you come with me?"—she said, "Yes"—she came with me to Madame Sophie's, who said that she had not sent her—she then said that she did not want to make any disturbance, and that it was a man outside.</p>

               <p>of June, about nine o'clock in the evening, I went, with my brother-officer to the Golden Key, in Tenter-street, Cripplegate—Keys went in first, then Webster, then I, and then Collard—I went to the first box—on the right in the tap-room, I saw the two prisoners, and a female—they were the only persons in the box—Mary Jones, who is not in custody, sat nearest the door—Monks sat next, and Bringlow the furthest from the door—there is a seat round the table—Jones and Monks sat against the table, and Bringlow with his back against the window, at the end of the table—Monks had no hat on, but Bringlow had—as soon as I entered, I saw Bringlow shove his left hand down his thigh, by the side of his trowsers—I went to him, put my hand down by the side of his, and said, "Old boy, I am as quick as you are"—I found this bag, containing this money, on the floor, close to where his hand was—I turned to Collard, who was standing with his back against the door, and said, "You see what I have picked up"—I then secured Bringlow, and searched him—I found seven<lb></lb>teen shillings in silver, and two shillings and three pence farthing in copper on him—it was dark, but there was a gas-light in the tap-room—I called for a candle; and under where Marks and Jones sat, I found this crown<lb></lb>piece—Marks said he knew nothing about it, and I believe Jones made the same observation—I then examined the bag; it contained these crowns and half-crowns, and in it was another bag; containing seventy-two shillings.</p>

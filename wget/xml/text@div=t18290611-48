On the 15th of March I left my house, between one and two o'clock, and returned between three and four - I had locked the house up, and put the key into my pocket; when I returned I found the front door unlocked, but not forced, for I could lock it again with my own key - four drawers in my bed-room were unlocked, and three broken open; nearly every thing I had was gone - I have seen nothing except my hat; I found that in the possession of the officer a few days after the robbery.</p>

            . I live at Edgware; I have known the prisoner nine or ten years. On the 15th of May I met him within twenty yards of the prosecutor's house, about five minutes before two o'clock in the afternoon, going towards the house - the road goes by the house; I did not speak to him - I am sure it was him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How do you know me? A. By drinking with you at the Mason's Arms public-house, Edgware, seven or eight years ago, and I saw you cross the field nine or ten days before this, but did not speak to you.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I apprehended the prisoner on the 22d of May, in Seymour-place, Marylebone; I said, "Let me look at that hat" - he gave it me of his head; I asked where he got the hat from - he said he bought it at Hall and Johnson's, Edgware-road; I said, "Then you must go with me to Johnson and Hall's" - we went, and saw Mr. Hall in the shop; I asked if he knew that hat - he said Yes; he took it in his hand, and said he thought he had served him with such a hat - Mr. Johnson then came into the shop, and Hall said, "Do you know any thing of this hat?" he said, "No, we have not got such a hat in the shop, nor have we had for some time" - Johnson then measured it, tried it in Hall's presence, and then said they had not got such a hat in their shop; he measured it with his rule, and with other hats - Hall said he thought it was one of theirs at first, but on looking at it he found it was not; I told the prisoner I must take him up - I asked him how he came to pull the lining out of the hat; he said he chewed tobacco, and used to put the quid into the hat, which dirtied the lining - I shewed it to the prosecutor on the 23d; he looked at it, put it on his head, and claimed it.</p>
               <p>ROBERT HALL. I live in the Edgware-road, and am a tailor and salesman, in partnership with Johnson. The prisoner dealt at our shop more than once or twice; on the 22d of May Argust brought him to my shop, and produced a hat - when I first looked at it, he being a customer, I thought he had bought it of me; when I saw it was of consequence, having looked at it more particularly, I was certain I never sold the hat, and that it never was in our shop - I am certain I never had one of that shape; I never sold him a hat, to my recollection - Mr. Okey, of London-wall, is the only manufacturer we buy of, and he has not got a block of that size; it was never in our shop</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q.Did you not say I bought it of you? A. I did at first, but said if I looked at it I could tell better; you asked if it was not one of ours when you took it off, and I believe I said Yes - you asked if you had not bought it seven or eight weeks ago; I said,"You never bought it of us."</p>

            . I am a hat manufacturer, of London-wall, in partnership with my brother. We supply Johnson and Hall with hats; we never had a hat similar to this in our warehouse for three years, and have not supplied them with such a hat.</p>
               <p>JOHN WORMAN. This is my hat - I lost it on the 15th of May, with other things; Argust produced it to me on the 22d, I think - I have found nothing else; I bought it of Mr. Burton, at Edgware, eight or nine days before - I had only worn it twice; I bought it to go to my brother's funeral - I was very particular in fitting it, and here are several marks on it inside, by which I know it; the man brought me six or seven before I could get one to fit me - it had a lining in it when it was taken away, and was drawn with a piece of blue ribbon; it is my hat - there had been a band round it, and the band was found in the field.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought the hat of Johnson and Hall for 7s. about nine weeks before.</p>
               <p>MR. OKEY. I can find no manufacturer's mark on it- these hats are made in Lancashire and Cheshire, and not in town; I should charge 5s. for it.</p>
               <p>ROBERT HALL. I moved to a new shop last Michaelmas, and particularly remarked we had not such a hat in the shop then.</p>

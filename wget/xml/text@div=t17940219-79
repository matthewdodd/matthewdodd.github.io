               <p>I am a patrole belonging to St. Sepulchre's. The prisoner was brought up to the watch-house about ten o'clock at night, we stopped a few minutes, and then we examined him; he said he had the money of his master for two days work; says I, whereabouts do you live? he said, he did not know; says I, are you a stranger in Town? he said no; but he would not give any more account for the best part of an hour. I have the half guinea, I had it from Bladen.</p>
               <p>Mr. Parker. It is a counterfeit, it appears to be quite new.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was doing some work for a person in the farriering line, and it came to half a guinea, and I received the half guinea for it; I had had three guineas in my pocket, when I came home I got a guinea changed, so that I did not know whether it was the half guinea that I had taken of that gentleman in the morning, or the half guinea that I got in change. This day I called, as I came along up Field-lane, where this gentlewoman lives, and I asked her if she would sell me a shirt? she said she would, I agreed for a shirt, and was to give her three shillings and six-pence for it, and I said I have not any silver at all without you give me change for half a guinea, I laid it down, and she weighed it and said it was light, she was afraid it was a bad one; I said I cannot tell where I took it, except I took it of my master; she said, I will send it over the way to a gentleman. If I had known it had been a bad one I had time enough to go away; as soon as the gentleman came I resigned myself up to be examined in every respect. As to that stuff, if it was touched with a hammer it would break all to pieces, it is what I had used in my business.</p>

On the 17th of Jan. last, between 2 and 4 in the Morning, I was waked by the barking of my little Black Bitch. I got up and look'd out o'Window. I saw the Glimmering of a Light, but being between sleeping and waking, I thought it might come from my Neighbour the Currier, and that his stirring might disturb the Bitch, and so I went to Bed again. But when I came down Stairs, about 7 in the Morning, I found my House was broke open, and several Goods gone. Some Tiles were taken off the Wash-house, and so the Door was unbarr'd and open'd. Then a Hole was cut thro' the Kitchen-door, and that was open'd too. When the Prisoner was my Journey-man he 'bizzled my Goods, and lived but a loose Life; so that I presently inspected him to be the Man; and so I had him taken up the same Day, and he confess'd that he brought 3 Men with him, and they broke my House open, and he confessed where he had pawned my Goods, and I found 'em accordingly.</p>

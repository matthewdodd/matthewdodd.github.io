            . On the 27th of December in the Morning I found my Chest broke open, and that my Goods and Money were taken away. The Prisoner Byrne is my Brother in Law and lodged in my House, and he absconding, and I hearing that the other two Prisoners were gone with him, I suspected them, and publish'd Advertisements. They were all taken at Huntington.</p>

            . I live at Huntington. The Prisoner's passing thro' the Town, I was told that they were suspected Persons, they having been seen at Godmanchester with a great deal of Money, and could give no good account how they came by it. Upon which, I and four more pursued 'em on Horse-back, and overtook them by a Wood side, out of the Road. We brought 'em back to an Ale-house, where Byrne took me aside and told me that his two Companions were Irish Rogues who had persuaded him to rob his Brother in Law, and had lent him a Pair of Shoe-makers Pincers to break the Chest open. They were carried before the Mayor of Huntington. Byrne had these Buck-skin Breeches on; these three Silver Spoons, and the Money in this Paper which is 30 l. 1 s. 6 d. were found in his Pocket; in this other Paper is 4 l. 10 s. which was taken from Bateman; and 5 l. 11 s. which is in this Paper, was found upon Clark. Byrne confest all before the Mayor, who took his Confession in writing.</p>

Clark and Bateman from time to time egg'd me on to rob my Brother, and said, they could get off any Goods. They carried me from one Alehouse to another, and at last I agreed with them to do it. They lent me a Pair of Shoemakers Pincers to break open the Chest. When I had done it, I went and told them directly, and gave them two Guineas to fetch their Cloaths out of pawn from

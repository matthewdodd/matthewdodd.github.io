            . I saw the prisoner come out of Mr. Child's and company's shop door March 21, about four in the afternoon, with a firkin, having hold of it by the two ends long ways, he came to my door, and I believe he might be a little in liquor; there he dropped it; I took hold of him and took him into Mr. Child's yard and called some of the servants to come and examine him. I think there was I. H. marked upon the firkin in black ; I was with the prisoner before my Lord Mayor, there he said he took it out of a cart, as it was going along the street.</p>

            . The firkin of butter belongs to Mr. Child and Company. (He mentions the partners names.) the other evidence had hold on the prisoner, and the butter lay at his foot ; we had ten firkins of this butter that were told and stood ready to be delivered, in the passage ; I went and looked at them, there was then but nine ; this in the street was the other, they were all mark'd J. C. with ink, we took the prisoner before my Lord Mayor, he said there was a cart going along the street from whence he had it.</p>
               <p>Q to Hitchens. Did you see the prisoner drop the firkin of butter?</p>
               <p>Hitchins. I did, he dropt it by reeling, and I laid hold on him directly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>There was a cart going by, down a hill, and turning off to the right, the near wheel went into the kennel, and the butter tumbled off, I called to the Carman; Carman, there is your butter off; this man came and said it was you that throwed it down from the cart, said I if you doubt my character, I'll get a character were I work, (please to put my trial back till my master comes with my character from Westminster,) he took hold on me and went and charged me with the beadle.</p>
               <p>Q. to Marshall. Was this missing from nearest the street, or backwards of the ten you mentioned?</p>
               <p>Marshall. It was from nearest the street.</p>

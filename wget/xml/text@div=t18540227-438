                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 178). In consequence of information, I went on Saturday, 28th Jan., to the Green Man public house, on the road to Bromley—I got there about 11 o'clock in the morning—I saw Grantham drive up there with a wagon, about half past 12 o'clock—the wagon was drawn by three horses—I saw him take a sack from the tail part of the wagon, containing about two bushels of forage—I saw him fill three nosebags, and then replace the sack in the tail part of the wagon again, with about a bushel of the forage left in it—I was in plain clothes—I was in the parlour, and could see what was going on in front—I remained in the house some few minutes after, and then went down the road towards Lewisham about 250 yards—I was standing there, and I saw Springett the ostler come down the road in the direction I had taken—I went into the Tiger's Head, to get out of his way—I remained there a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—I then saw him return past the Tiger's Head towards the Green Man—I came out, and in about five minutes I saw the wagon driven away from the</p>

               <p>Green Man by Grantham, and as it passed me I saw the sack was in the front part of the wagon, and apparently empty—I then went into the green Man, and called the ostler Springett out of the taproom—I said, "I am sure you have been receiving stolen property; I shall search your premises, and take you into custody"—I said it was horse provender, and he had just been receiving it—he said he had not—I went with him into the stable yard, and in a bin in a shed at the rear of the public house I found about a bushel of clover, black beans, and oats, which I have here—I said to him "This is what I expect you have been receiving from Mr. Coles Child's man"—he said, "I got it from a crib in front, about an hour ago"—I said "No, you could not have done that, for I have been here an hour and a half, and there has been only one crib used, and that was for hay"—he made no further reply—I took Grantham into custody about 4 o'clock the same day—I told him the charge, that he had been stealing the forage of the horses, the property of his master—he said he had done nothing of the kind—there was the sack in the wagon—I took him to Mr. Coles child's offices, and the sack was brought from the wagon—there was about a peck of forage in it—it was much smaller than what I had seen put into the wagon after the nosebags were filled—I had a sample in a handkerchief of what I had taken from the ostler, and I compared that with the sample of forage brought from the wagon—they appeared to me to be both the same Sort.</p>

SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you saw the wagon driving from the Green Man, the sack appeared nearly empty? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—this is the sack which was in the wagon—what is in it now, is what was in it when the wagon got home—my means of observing it when it was apparently empty were as the wagon passed by—I did not take the sack from the wagon when it returned, it was brought by a lad from the wagon—I did not take the sack to the station, it was brought by Mr. Coles Child's horsekeeper to the office on the Monday—they had it from the Saturday till the Monday.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When the sack was produced before the police Magistrate, were there not observations made that the quantity in the sack then was different to what it was when it was taken from the wagon, in Mr. Child's office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not remember that—I was present during the whole examination—there was no observation made, to my knowledge, that the sample produced on the second occasion was different to the sample produced on the first—the sample produced on the first occasion was much moister and darker than it was on the second occasion, because it had been a very wet day on the Saturday; and it had been kept in the dry all the time after that—I was about an hour and a half in the Green Man before the wagon drove up—I should say Grantham was at the Green Man baiting his horses for fifty minutes or an hour—I was not in the parlour all the time, I left and went down the road after I saw the nosebags filled and put to the horses' heads—I was down the road about ten minutes before I saw Springett walk down the road—I went into the Tiger's Head to avoid being seen—I went back to the Green Man in about twenty minutes—the crib to which Springett alluded is in front, at which horses are baited—there are several cribs that are used in front of the road—it is a sort of halfway house—it is a regular stopping house on the road—it is open day and night, and is a house at which a great many people stop—when I took Grantham into custody, he at once denied that he had been misappropriating his master's property.</p>

                  </hi>. I am horsekeeper to Mr. Child. On Saturday morning, 28th Jan., I remember Grantham leaving the yard with a wagon and three hones—I delivered to him about five bushels of forage in the sack, and the three nosebags, which were full—I delivered five bushels in the sack, because I did not know whether he was going to have three hones or four—we do not put them quite so much for three horses—five bushels is the quantity we put for four horses—I saw the wagon return in the afternoon, between 3 and 4 o'clock, as near as I can tell—I saw what quantity of forage the carman brought back; it was about a peck—this is the quantity, and this is the sack it was in—it is composed of chaff, oats, and beans—I have examined the forage found in the bin, and the forage that was brought home; I believe them to be Mr. Coles Child's property—I believe the beans in the two to be both one sample—I have compared the oats; they are black oats, and are both the same samples.</p>

               <p>keeper to Mr. Coles Child? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About eight years—I cannot tell how many sorts of black oats there are—black oats are commonly given to horses—the beans are common beans, I never heard any name for them—this chaff is red clover chaff—red clover chaff is commonly used to make up this mixture of forage—the wagon was to go to Bromley; it left the premises between 5 and 6 o'clock in the morning—I did not assist in harnessing the horses; it is the carman's place to do that—I gave five bushels of forage, besides the nosebags full—I did not measure the quantity that came back—between my master's establishment and Bromley it would be necessary to stop and bait; once going down, and once in coming back.</p>

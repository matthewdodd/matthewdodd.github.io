            . I am steward to his Excellency Count Salvre. The chapel in Charles-street, St. James's-square, was robbed on the 12th and 19th of March, and on the 6th of April, I was told it had been robbed again. I went in and found they got in at a window between fourteen and fifteen feet high. They got upon a post where his Excellency goes in at, and from thence in at a window. I observed on the inside the part where they had trod was dirty, which made me think there must be more than one; and as it had been robbed three times, it gave great suspicion of people in the yard. (There are three noble families in the yard.) This lay dormant till the 21st of April; then a person came and told me that Stapleton was a man concerned, that he had the surplice, which contained ten yards of muslin,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176905100007"></xptr> and had given it to these girls at the bar. The next morning I went to Sir

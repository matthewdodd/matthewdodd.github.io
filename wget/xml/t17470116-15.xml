Clark and Saunders being at my House that same Night, I enquired after Saunders, but could not find him: Some Time afterwards, I saw an Advertisment that the Silver Spoons and Salts were stopped at Mr Lloyd's in Smithfield; I went to Mr Lloyd's, and desired to see the Plate that was stopped, after a little Examination, he gave me a Sight of the Plate; Mr Lloyd did not know the Persons that left the Goods at his House, but he remembered Sparks , Saunders, and Howse so particularly, that he described them to me. Afterwards Mr Lloyd , at my Desire, went with me into the Country to do what we could in order to apprehend these People; while we were in the Country, Saunders was gone, and Sparks was stopped on the Highway upon Suspicion, and was carried before the Justice of Peace; Sparks was sent to New-Prison. The next Day Howse was taken up, and sent to New-Prison; after they were carried into Prison, they were willing to make Discoveries; I asked Sparks whether he knew of the Remainder of the Plate. Sparks said you must ask Howse; then Howse said, you must go and ask

I asked him what he would have an Ounce, he asked me 5 s. which was about the Mark; then he pulled out a Salt, which gave me a Suspicion: Says I, young Man, as you are a Butcher, I suppose you are known here; we never buy any thing of Persons we do not know. I went with him to the Lock and Key; coming into a Room, Sparks says to a Person, You know me, don't you?

I brought the 7 s. out, and delivered it into their Hands; Sparks and Howse had the Money between them.</p>

I am a carpenter, and live in Bowling-green-row, Little Chelsea, I went to the King's Arms, Fulham-road, on Saturday, the 8th of April, and met Parkhurst there—he asked me if I would buy a plane of him—I said, "What do you want for it?"—he said I should have it for a pint of beer—when I saw the plane I called for a pint of beer, and</p>

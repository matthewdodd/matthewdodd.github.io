               <p>Did you observe how the shop door had been opened? - Yes, by a key or something of a picklock; I missed nine pair and five single shoes, which made twenty-three in all; I sent my wife the next morning among the pawnbrokers and dealers in shoes, to stop them if they should be offered; in consequence of this a little after eight o'clock in the morning, Mr. Waters, in Back-lane, sent for me, he had stopped two odd shoes which he supposed to be mine; I went to Mr. Waters's, they had stopped the shoes but not the men, they described the men to me, and Ruff was taken immediately, he said he had the shoes of Young; the officer said he knew Young, and went and fetched him to the office, and they were both committed.</p>

               <p>I keep a clothes shop in Back-lane, on the 9th of this month, in the morning, Ruff brought a pair of shoes to sell, we suspected him and would have nothing to do with them; about half an hour afterwards Mrs. Lockey came to our house to stop the shoes if any should be offered; in about half an hour afterwards he came again with the same shoes, we stopped the shoes and sent down to Mr. Lockey; in the mean time Ruff went and fetched Young, he made a blustering and asked what business we had to stop his property, I told him if he would call in half an hour he should have them.</p>
               <p>Did you know Young before? - No.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he is the man? - I am very certain of it; when Lockey came he claimed the shoes, and we put him in the way to find the old man Ruff, and he gave<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178806250056"></xptr>up the young one; I believe the old man is rather impaired in his intellects.</p>

On the 17th of July I received information, and went to my sheds in White's-yard, and missed some lead—I cannot swear to this lead, but one part fits the turn of the gutter—I have lost about twenty feet—there was nothing particular about the nail-holes—I believe it to be the lead I have missed.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman G</hi>173.) On Friday, the 17th, I was on duty in Golden-lane about two o'clock in the morning, and saw the prisoner Price come running across, leaving Etteridge behind him, with something which he put down and ran away; I went to the place, and found it was this lead; I took it to Davies, and went after the boy, but could not see him. till Davies told me he saw him—I took price—I fitted the lead and be<lb></lb>lieve is belongs to that place—on leaving Etteridge, as soon as price got sight of me, he whistled to etteridge, who put down the lead.</p>

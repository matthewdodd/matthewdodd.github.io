            . My father's name is Joel Mordecai. On the 1st of July I and my sister lived at his house, in North-street, and we slept that night on the ground-floor. About half-past one o'clock I heard some person on the first floor stairs, saying</p>
               <p>"All is right." We got out of bed and called the watchman - Sampson came first, he sprang his rattle, and four others came. When they came i.e. two prisoners, (who are watchmen), Sampson and myself went into the first floor back-room, there were a pair of ear-rings and a ring in the front room on the second floor belonging to my sister - we afterwards missed them. When the prisoners came down stairs, I told them I thought the persons might have got between the bed and the mattrass - they said if I would stay down stairs they would go into the room themselves and search. They and Sampson went up; and when they came down they went away. After they had been gone about ten minutes, my sister said she was too frightened to go to bed - she would go up stairs. She went up, and said the things were gone. We waited till a watchman of the name of Cox was coming down the street, at two o'clock. I called him, and said,</p>
               <p>"What a shocking thing it is that the watchmen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150018"></xptr>should have stolen these things;" He said, he would go and see. By that time the prisoner Francis came up and said</p>
               <p>"Do you mean to charge me with the theft;" I said,</p>
               <p>"I do not know which of you it was, but it must have been one of you." The next morning we went to the office, and they were discharged on their own recognizances. On the Monday following I attended the magistrates on some other business - I then saw the things, and knew them to be my sister's property.</p>

            Was there any other jewellery in the room - A. Yes, there were two other articles, but they were covered with a silk skirt. Garrett went into the house the second time. My father is a plate-glass dealer - it is a house of good fame. I am married, but my husband has deserted me and is living with another woman. I have applied to the parish for relief, but do not now receive relief from them. After I had told the watchman I had been robbed, Garrett went up stairs and did his best to find the thieves.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On Sunday morning, the 4th of July, about half-past two o'clock, the prisoner Garrett called me over to him, and said there was something in his box not altogether agreeable. I went over, and found a piece of paper screwed up on the seat of his box - it contained a pair of ear-rings and a ring. We went down to the watch-house, and gave them to the officer of the night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Was he then on duty - A. Yes; some person might have put them into his box, which is in the public street, about three hundred yards from Mr. Mordecai's. It was on the 1st of July that Mr. Mordecai was robbed. Garrett said he thought there was some plot laid for him; and would I come as a witness to take them out.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When you were apprised that the house had been robbed, Francis might have been examined - A. Yes. Francis could have absconded if he thought proper; but he came the next day to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any quarrel with Francis - A. Yes, and with all the others, because they blowed me up because I had not stopped at Worship-street to be bound when they were all there - but I certainly had had no quarrel with him on the night of the Saturday.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Dark-house-lane, Lower Thames-street—I am single. On the 31st of March I got into an omnibus in Gracechurch-street, about twenty minutes past three o'clock—it was very full—a gen<lb></lb>tleman was on my left side, and the female prisoner on the right—the male prisoner was right opposite me—I had half a sovereign and two half-crowns in my right-hand pocket—I was going to Vauxhall—when we got to the Stone's End, the prisoners got out—when we got to the Town Hall I felt a fumbling at my right pocket—the omnibus was then going on—it was very much crowded, and I could not turn round to see what was going on—the mo<lb></lb>ment the female prisoner rose to go out, I turned, and found that my dress</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183704030241"></xptr>
               <p>and pocket were cut, my purse taken out, the money gone, and the purse put back again into the hole of my pocket, and the drew pinned up afterwards—there was no one near enough to hare been able to do that, but the! female prisoner—she got out about five minutes after I felt it—the man got out at the same place—I took hold of the female's cloak to stop her as she was getting out, but I could not stop her—I almost pulled her cloak off—I followed her out of the omnibus, and took the purse out of my pocket, ad accused her—she said she had not got any of my money, and I might give her to a policeman if I liked—I gave them both to a policeman—I am quite sure the dress was cut by somebody in the omnibus—I saw it safe between twelve and one o'clock, but I felt my purse and money before I got in—I never changed my place in the omnibus—here is the dress that was cut, and the pocket—the purse was tacked in again, and the dress pinned up.</p>

I got into the omnibus at Gracechurch-street, about ten minutes after three o'clock—I did not observe that the female prisoner at on the right hand side of the witness—I recollect the male prisoner requesting the omnibus to stop—he got out first—the female prisoner got oat afterwards, and as she got opposite me, the prosecutrix caught the cape of cloak—the said, "Stop, stop; I have had my clothes cut;"but the got out of the omnibus, and then the prosecutrix followed her—I saw a policeman—I did not see her attempt to get away—she must have felt her cape pulled—it was drawn by a sudden jerk.</p>

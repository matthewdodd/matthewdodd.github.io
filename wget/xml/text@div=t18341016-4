            . I am a lamplighter, and live in Marsham-street, Westminster. I was in St. Martin's-lane on Sunday morning, the 21st of September, at ten minutes before five o'clock - I went to turn off my lights - I saw the prosecutor standing with his back against a pawnbroker's shop, a few doors from St. Martin's-court; he seemed very intoxicated indeed - I know the prisoners, I saw them both with two more, they were coming from St. Martin's-court - they came up to the prosecutor, and one of them pulled his hat over his eyes, and the others struck him - I do not think either of the prisoners was the person who struck the prosecutor - Sullivan is the man who pulled his hat over his eyes - I went back to them and told them not to ill-use the gentleman - they then left him and went into the middle of the road - they then said something to one another and went back to him, under the pretence to pick him up - they then dropped him and left him, crossed St. Martin's-lane again, and went up into a court opposite - I then went into New-street, and saw two policemen, and told them what had happened - they directly ran and told me to follow them - (when they went back to him, with the pretence of lifting him up, I did not see what they did to him, as they were all four round him, and two attempted to lift him up) - the policemen desired me to follow them, and when we got into Bedfordbury the two prisoners ran into the first court out of New-street, in Bedfordbury - they all just came out of the court as the policemen got to the corner of it, and three of them ran down Bedfordbury, and the prisoner Anderson ran up the Bury - I followed him, and said to the policeman, "There goes one of them" - I followed him into Rose-street, calling, "Stop thief" - a policeman stopped him - I told the policeman to bring him back into Bedfordbury, and there found the other policeman had got Sullivan in custody - I told him I would go down to St. Martin's-lane, and there I found the prosecutor still lying where they had knocked him down - we took him to the station-house in Bow-street - I assisted the policeman in taking him there - the prosecutor was searched there, and two half-sovereign taken from him, some silver, a few halfpence, and his watch - I did not see any thing attached to his watch.</p>
               <p>Sullivan. Q. You saw one of the party pick the man up? A. Two, and then they went into the middle of the lane, and when I went back the man was still lying down.</p>

            . I am a policeman. I was on duty in New-street, Covent-garden, on Sunday morning, the 21st of September, about half-past four, or a quarter to five o'clock - Atkins came to me - I ran on before him to the top of Bedfordbury, and saw the two prisoners and two more come out of Goodwin-court - they were running - they turned to the right and ran down Bedfordbury, all four of them - I heard Sullivan say, as they ran, "Not that way, you b - , there is no thoroughfare - up the next court"- meaning Chimister-alley - I was about two yards behind Sullivan then, and immediately laid hold of him, and said,"You shall not go up the next court at all events" - one of them ran up Brewer's-court - another policeman went up there after him - I took Sullivan and held him at the end of that court to prevent any body coming up - I then took him to New-street, and saw Robinson standing at the end of St. Martin's-court with Atkins the witness - I proceeded to the station-house with Anderson, who was in custody of another officer - on going to the station-house Sullivan said, "This will do you no good, I shall be one with you" - on getting to the station-house I searched Sullivan, and in his pocket I found this piece of tow with this piece of chain on it, as it is now - I took this knife and a latch key out of his pocket - Anderson was taken by Attfield - he was searched, but I believe nothing was found on him - the prosecutor was also brought to the station-house - I took his watch from him there; there was nothing attached to it but a split ring.</p>

               <p>Sullivan. Q. You say, the four men went one way? A. They all turned to the right, and went down Bedfordbury - when I had Sullivan in custody, Anderson turned back, and ran by me, and Atkins said, "There goes one of them" - I said, "Run after him, and cry, 'Stop thief;'" but at first they all ran one way.</p>

            . I am a policeman. I was on duty in New-street, and heard the cry of "Stop thief" - I saw Anderson in Lazenby-court - I was coming through the dark part of the court - it is very narrow - I met Anderson in the dark part of the court - I asked him what he was running for - the lamps had been just put out - he said he was going home - I told him he must have been doing something, or he would not run so fast - he said he had been doing nothing - at that time Atkins came up, and told me to take him into custody for knocking a gentleman down in St. Martin's-lane, and that there was another in custody in Bedfordbury - I immediately took him into Bedfordbury - Sullivan was in the custody of Johnson - I searched Anderson at the station - nothing was found on him.</p>
               <p>JOHN ROBINSON re-examined.

             re-examined. I found the tow in Sullivan's left hand pocket - the chain was on it, and slightly entangled in it - it was not covered over with the tow, but lying on it - a person in the watch-house, who stood in the light, said, "There is a bit of chain in that tow," before I saw it.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183410160012"></xptr>Sullivan's Defence. On Monday morning, when I was taken before the magistrate, a bit of chain was produced which the policeman said he took from my pocket - I was sent to Clerkenwell for a week, and brought up again, and the magistrate asked the prosecutor if he had found any more of the chain - he said, "No" - he asked if any was left on the watch - he said, "No" - now he says, that three or four days afterwards, he found part of the chain in his pocket - in the mean time I was remanded from Monday to Monday, and now he says he has a piece in his pocket couresponding with it - he said, on the second Monday, that no more of the property was found, and he had nothing to add to his evidence - a week had elapsed between the examinations - Anderson was not in my company - I never saw him before I went to the station-house with him.</p>
               <p>Anderson's Defence. As I was coming down New-street, I heard a cry of "Stop thief" - I was not in company with the prisoner, or any body - I saw a man running- I ran after him - a policeman stopped me, and asked me where I was going - I said I was going home, but seeing a man run up there, I had run after him.</p>
               <p>JAMES ROBINSON re-examined. I do not know when I found the part of the chain; it might be a week after, or more - it was my daughter found it; she took it out of my pocket - I do not think this could take place at the second examination - when I left the public-house, I would not let the waiter see me home - I suppose I walked about the streets, and stopped to rest myself till this happened - the landlady said she thought I had had more than would do me good - I was in no company after the waiter left me.</p>
               <p>Sullivan. I can account for being there - I was going to Covent-garden market, and had the money in my pocket, which the policeman took from me.</p>

             re-examined. When I took the tow out of Sullivan's pocket, it was not put on any table - I had it in my hand, and while in my hand, Stace, who was formerly a serjeant in the police, said, "Why there is part of a chain in that tow" - it had not been out of my hand at the time.</p>
               <p>Sullivan. Two pieces of chain were put before the clerk at the office - the policeman said it was broken, and the clerk said it was of no consequence, he might join them. Witness. I put the chain in a piece of paper, and when I took it out at the office it was in three pieces - I put them together, and there is not now a link missing - took all that from Sullivan's pocket.</p>
               <p>JURY to ATKINS. Q. Are you quite certain the two prisoners were in company together? A. They were, I am certain, with the other two - they all four together, and there was no other person there - all four came down together, and went to the prosecutor, who stood with his back against the shutters, and Sullivan pulled his hat over his eyes - I never saw either of the prisoners before - I knew one of the others, which made me suspect them, as I knew he was a suspicious character.</p>

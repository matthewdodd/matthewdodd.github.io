               <p>On that day, Monday afternoon, the 21st of December, (I live in Rosemary-lane) and sitting near the fire, being poorly, the lad that I employ called me to look at a pair of breeches, to be sold for eight shillings, by a woman; she went away; and the boy paid her six shillings for them; I did not see him pay her; I saw her again in a quarter of an hour,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130077"></xptr>coming up the lane; and suspecting the breeches was stolen, I stopped her: I asked her where she got those breeches? she said, she bought them; I said, no, you have stole them; and she said, she did buy them; finding there was a Jew's mark on them: I found out the owner; the prisoner said, she bought them at a shop lower down. I asked him when he came to the door, if these were his breeches; he owned them: the prisoner held two shillings between her fore finger and thumb, and said, I gave that for them.</p>

               <p>I bought them of a woman; I gave five shillings and sixpence for them, and sold them for six shillings; it was more than I knew, if they were stole. This gentleman was walking backwards and forwards, and asked me what I had to sell; I told him a pair of breeches; the two shillings was what I owed the woman; as I only paid her three shillings and sixpence.</p>

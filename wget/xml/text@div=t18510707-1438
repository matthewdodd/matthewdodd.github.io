                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Pennicott, of 41, Hall-street, City-road. The prisoner was in my service five weeks—on Sunday, 15th June, I went to bed about a quarter-past 12 o'clock at night, leaving the prisoner up to attend to the lodgers—she slept in the kitchen—no one was in the house but her and me and the lady and gentleman who lodge there—I sleep at the top of the house—the prisoner had given me no notice to quit—I got up about half-past 9, and found the plate-basket in my room, which was not there the night before, and never used to be brought there—I missed my dress from my bed, my purse and money, three sovereigns, three half, sovereigns, and I think 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. were in the pocket the night before—I found my dress on the prisoner's bed in the kitchen, and missed the purse and money from the pocket—my room-door had not been locked—I was not disturbed in the night—my husband was from home—I have never got my purse or money—I counted it before I went to bed.</p>

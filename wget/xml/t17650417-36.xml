I met with her about eight or ten days after, and asked her what she had done with the things: she said she would bring them back again: I took her before Justice Welch; she confessed she had taken the things, and told me where she had pawned them, in St. Giles's, where I went and found them.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Grubb, a pawnbroker; the prisoner pledged these sheets, sauce-pan, and tea-kettle, with me, between the 23d of February and 2d of March. (Produced and deposed to by the prosecutor).</p>

               <p>I have been sick a great while, and was forced to make away with all manner of necessaries of my own: I had a daughter sick at the same time,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176504170022"></xptr> and a child died in the hous e: I did intend to make these good again; but times were very hard.</p>
               <p>Q. What way of life was she in?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. She sold gingerbread and oranges, in a very poor way, little better than a beggar.</p>

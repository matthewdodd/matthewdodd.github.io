                  </hi>. I am the collector of the Poor and Church rates of the parish of St. Andrew Undershaft, in the City of London. I had paid some money on account of that parish to the prisoner Paul before 18th Nov. last, 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. up to that date, and on that day a further sum of 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., making 290<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was to pay it into the bankers', Smith, Payne, and Smith—one of the partners of that firm is treasurer to the City of London Union—Paul told me he would give me a receipt from the bankers; he brought it to me—I suppose that is the receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); I do not know; I have no mark on it; I will not swear to it—I handed the receipt that I received from Paul to Mr. Thornton, at a meeting of the Board of Guardians—I know the prisoner Hawes—he was a clerk in the office of the union—that is at No. 51, St. Mary Axe.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">for Hawes</hi>). <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say he was clerk to the guardians or to Paul? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe him to be a clerk to the Board of Guardians; I have seen him writing papers for the Board of Guardians—the front counting house is divided off into stalls, one of which is occupied by Mr. Hawes—that is not in the same department of the office as that which is occupied by Paul—Paul's office is at the back of the house, and this is at the front of the house—Hawes would be principally directed by Paul what to do, I suppose; it was his duty to write parochial statistics and accounts, and anything that might be directed by Paul.</p>

               <p>demand that of him; lie was kind enough to say that he would send it to the bankers for me—it was the next day after I paid him the sum that made up the 290<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that he handed me the receipt—I have paid money into Smith, Payne, and Smith's, myself—I paid 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a fortnight ago, since that time—I am not in the habit of paying it to any particular clerk; the clerk that I usually paid it to in times past, I did not pay to in the last instance—I only know Mr. Crosier, whose signature purports to be to this receipt, by meeting him here; I did not know him before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the guardians of the City of London Union. Paul was assistant clerk to the board, and had been for some years—Hawes filled the situation of an occasional assistant to Paul; he was not an officer of the board; he was engaged by Paul, and paid by Paul—I was in the office when this forged receipt was brought there by Mr. Woodward; I saw it—this is it—Mr. Thornton was there at the time—he is chairman to the board—it was handed to him—I put my initials to it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you known Hawes as being employed by Paul? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Personally, I have only known him for twelve months; I know as a fact that he has been employed longer, but I have only been a member of the board twelve months—during that time I do not think he has been almost continually employed by Paul at the offices of the union; I think, from questions we put to Hawes in the course of the investigation, it has been on the average about two or three days a week, during the whole of the time; he would be a week or two there constantly, and then he would be absent for a week or two—he was occupied during the days he was there in writing whatever Paul might desire him to write—I have seen him there engaged in writing—I never knew him to be other than a well conducted man—there was not a serious discussion among the guardians as to whether Hawes should be prosecuted for this offence—I believe there was not a difference of opinion upon the subject; this matter has been discussed at the board in my presence—it was discussed after this matter was investi<lb></lb>gated before the Magistrate.</p>

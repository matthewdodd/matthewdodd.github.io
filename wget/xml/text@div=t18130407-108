            .</p>
               <p>Q. Prior to the 3d of April, had you missed any quantity of flour - A. Not me, Mr. Curtis had. I concealed myself in the accompting-house; the window in that accompting-house commanded a view of the sack, and nine other sacks; that sack in particular. The two prisoners were in the employ of Messrs. Curtis; Whittaker was a furner; he stands at the mouth of the oven, and throws the biscuits in. Cole, the boy, is called a parting boy, to part the biscuits, for the furner; he is an assistant to the furner; they work a great part of the night usually, and when they have got a certain quantity, they carry the biscuits up into the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the place where you were command a view of the place where the biscuits were deposited - A. He must pass me. I saw him come up about a quarter before twelve, on Saturday night, bringing up each, what we call a cotchet of biscuits. Whittaker had a candle in his hand; they went to the left, and shot the biscuits out of their bags, but instead of going down stairs proceeded to a sack of flour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that a sack of flour, in which they had any lawful business - A. No, it was not the flour that we use for biscuits, it was fine flour, kiln dried; what we use for biscuits, is called middling; that is in a bin; it pours down a hole into the trough where they knead; another man kneads the flour, and the boy's business is to divide the biscuits to the furner, that chucks them into the oven. There are three men and a boy in every gang.</p>
               <p>COURT. Out of them four, one kneads it into the trough, two mould it, then it gets to the furner, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070071"></xptr>goes into the oven - A. Yes. When they were at the sack of flour, I saw Whittaker hold the candle while the boy, Cole, took out the flour; they came towards the accompting-house, in a manner that made us think they were alarmed, and thought they were discovered. Whittaker came to the accompting-house with the candle towards the window, to look in; I and Mr. Curtis drew back; we could see the candle not the man; after he had looked he went to the sack again; at that moment Mr. Curtis raised his head, and prevented me seeing what they did, but I saw them at the sack long enough to take some more flour; they then went down stairs and left this sack.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did they put the flour that they took out of the sack - A. I thought it was a bag, but it proved to be the boy's apron, which had been part of an old sack; they took it down stairs with them. I and Mr. Curtis came out of our hiding place, and went after them. and when they had got down in the bake-house, Mr. Curtis asked them where the bag of flour was, that they had brought down; they pointed to some empty bags, and said, there: the flour was not there; the flour was on a table behind one of the men, in the boy's apron.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the quantity - A. A little better than three pound and a half; it was fine kiln dried flour exactly the same as was in the sack that they had taken it from. Mr. Curtis expressed his indignation to him; Whittaker said it was only a little flour he had taken to make a cake for his tea.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, besides wages, allowance is made to each of the men for bread money - A. Yes, three halfpence per day.</p>

            . Q. You, with the last witness, was watching - A. I was; I saw the boy take the flour, and the old man held the bag. I went down stairs and brought the flour up. Whittaker said it was only a triffing thing, if I would not take him in custody he would pay me for it. I said I certainly would not do that; he must go to the police-office, and I was certain it was not the first time that we had been robbed; he had been at the sack before. He declared it was only took to make a cake.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the sort of flour that he would take to make a cake of - A. He had no business with that flour at all; he had no business to take any flour to make a cake to eat; they all are allowed three halfpence a day bread money, besides their wages.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you weighed the sack - A. The sack was weighed about three nights previous; we found the deficiency to be forty-seven pounds weight and a half of flour.</p>
               <p>COURT. Forty-seven pounds weight and a half. Do you permit your men to take what flour they please, and make what bread they please - A.Certainly not. The door was not locked that night.</p>
               <p>Whittaker's Defence. I worked fifty-three years for Mr. Curtis, and his grandfather; I never robbed them of one penny. I only took a bit of flour to make a cake. In the night locked up as we were, I told Mr.

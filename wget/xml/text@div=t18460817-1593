                  </hi>. I am beadle of Trinity-square. On the 15th of July, in the afternoon, I saw the prisoners Hall and Levett, about a quarter-past three, in the Minories—there was a wagon of Sir Charles Price's there—I watched it—Hall and Levett were with it—I followed them to the top of Houndsditch—they stopped there, and Hall got on the shafts of the wagon, and gave this bottle and basket out of the corner of the wagon to Levett—it was down in the corner, and could not be seen by a stander-by—there were anchovy-casks and oil-casks in the wagon—I followed Levett down Houndsditch about 100 yards—I said, "Where are you going?"—he said, "To an oil-shop down here, but there is a gentleman behind me that I am going to carry it for"—I told him he had better set it down, and stop till the gentleman came up—I took him into a coffee-shop, and detained him till the policeman came—this is the bottle and basket—I asked Levett what shop he was going to take it to—he said he did not know—I went to Sir Charles Price's warehouse, in William-street, Blackfriars—Hall was sent for into their counting-house, and asked if he knew anything about a bottle of oil that he gave to Levett—he Said no, he did not know anything at all about it—he afterwards said, why yes, he did, he had given him a lift with it out of the docks—I had seen Hall and Levett together between eleven and twelve in the morning, with the wagon, it was then going down Thames-street, towards the docks.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer in the London Dock—Schwartz is foreman of the oil vaults—I have worked under him about six years—on the 15th of July there were three casks of oil and one over-drawn cask in a vault in the London Docks—by Schwartz's order I took two jacks of oil out of the over-drawn cask and put into a bottle like the one produced—Schwartz assisted in doing it, and two more men assisted in it—Schwartz took the flogger in his hand to take the bung out—there was a hook near the bung—he could not get it out, and he struck the flogger on his finger—I took it and got the bung out, and then we let the cask down on its side and let the oil run out into the jack—we then sent the casks and the rest of the oil up stairs out of the loopholes—I and another man hooked them on—Schwartz had given me directions, and he went away—I could not see the oil put into the cart because I was down below.</p>

Price—here is the filling and the overdrawing upon it, which shows it was the whole of the order.</p>

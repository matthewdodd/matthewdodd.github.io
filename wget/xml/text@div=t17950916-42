               <p>On Wednesday, the 9th of this month, I was moving; the draymen came to have the beer drawn out of the cellar; it accordingly was so drawn out, and when it was done, and the drays loaded, I shut up the house again, and locked up the tap room and parlour. The bed was in the parlour, locked up, the glass was in the club room, that was not locked, there was no key to that door; the door that locked up the tap room locked up the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss them? - About eight o'clock in the evening. I cannot say I see the glass there the day before, but the bed was in the parlour when I went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Had these people any connection in your house? - They lodged with me.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see your things again? - On the next day, at Mr. Warner's, the White Rose, the corner of Rose-lane. The room that fastens the parlour had been broke open.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the tap room broke open? - Yes, it was. I can swear to the looking glass.</p>
               <p>Q. These things are laid to be the property of Poole and Miller? - They are <rs id="t17950916-42-viclabel244" type="occupation">brewers</rs>

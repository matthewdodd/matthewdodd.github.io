                  </hi>. I am master of the Union Workhouse at Kensing<lb></lb>ton—my dwelling-house is in the workhouse—it is rented by the guardians of the poor of the Kensington Union—I and my family live there exclusively—provisions and other stores belonging to the guardians are kept there. On Saturday night, the 12th of Oct., at nine o'clock, I inspected the premises, and found everything perfectly safe—the things stated were kept in the cellars—there is a door which opens into an area—that door communicates with the interior of the house—that was shut, bolted, and barred with a cross—bar—I went to bed between eleven and twelve—next morning, about eight, in con<lb></lb>sequence of some information, I went down stairs—I was not the first person up—I found the door forced open, and missed from the cellar a large piece of beef and some cheese, which I know was perfectly safe the night before—I found a strong wooden bar had been forced away from the door so as to admit a man's arm to unbolt the top bolt, and lift the cross-bar up—the door was open—it opens into the area—they had forced some wooden palings away, and got down into the area from the back yard—the beef and cheese is the property of the guardians, and was in my care.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inmate of this workhouse. On Sunday morning, the 13th, between seven and eight o'clock, I went down to Mr. Dyson's cellar to take the milk—I had the keys of the cellar-door—I found that locked—I opened it, and on going into the larder, found the area-door which opens into the yard, open—I was the first person that had gone there that morning.</p>

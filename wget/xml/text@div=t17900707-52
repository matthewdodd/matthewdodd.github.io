             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an apprentice to Mr. Mackintosh, about half a year. One night I went to the prisoner's house, about ten o'clock, with a cap for her to make; I took it from my mistress; and I took her some edging and ribbon at the same time, for herself; it was thread edging; I did not measure it; after that I went there with some work; and she asked me for some pins; I told her I had none; and she asked me to get her some, and I took her some; and I took her some trinkets for herself; then I took her some more trinkets: she was at our house one day for some work, and she saw this edging in the window; and she said she should like some of it for a cap, so I took it to her.</p>
               <p>Court. Whose property was this? - My master's: I took it out of the box; I do not remember the day; she gave me nothing for taking it; and I was not to have any part of it: I was taken up, and she was taken up; I was obliged to tell of it, when I was taken up; I saw the lace in Houndsditch, where I was stopped; it was in the constable's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179007070049"></xptr>hands; it was the same; for I put a mark on the card, before I took it to her: I put a T. on it, in ink; I do not know my reason: my master knew nothing of it: the prisoner told me she should not let the people know below stairs, because they were very bad people.</p>
               <p>Did you think you was doing a wrong thing? - I thought it would never be found out: the prisoner told me not to tell her sister, for she would tell my master and mistress.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. How long have you been in any service whatever? - This was the first.</p>
               <p>When did you first begin to turn thief? - I cannot tell whether it was three or four months after I was bound; that lace was the first thing I ever took from any body.</p>
               <p>They told you you would be hanged or transported? - Yes, Sir, if I did not tell the truth; and I should not wish for any body to be hanged any more than myself.</p>
               <p>Did not you imagine that accusing some body else, would save you from hanging or transportation? - I thought so to myself.</p>

               <p>I am a constable: I produce the lace I found in the prisoner's room: it is thread edging: there were two little boxes in the room. her's and her sister's; and I found two pieces of lace all together; she and her sister lived together; they both very readily shewed the things in the room; and the prisoner said, for God's sake, deliver up everything, for I thought it would come to this: their boxes were not locked.</p>

               <p>On the 17th of June, this little girl went into Mrs. Ure's, a baker, at Houndsditch; she had a bad shilling: Mr. Ure called me in to search the girl; and I found some property of Mr. Mackintosh's, a bit of muslin, and some thread, and some tapes.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I cannot positively swear to the lace; but I have lace of the same pattern; and I have sold a great deal of that sort: these other things are mine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You believe this little girl to be as bad a girl as can be? - There is not a doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Court to Towsey. Is the T. you mention, on either of these cards?</p>
               <p>Jury. Was you instructed to mark these cards: can you write and read? - I can read, but I cannot write.</p>
               <p>Can you make a T.? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The Court ordered her to make a T, on the card, which she did. Handed to the jury.)</p>
               <p>Jury. This is nothing like the mark on the card.</p>

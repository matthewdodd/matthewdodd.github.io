            . I am a constable of the liberty of the Rolls. I went into Mrs. Child's room on the afternoon of the 21st of November, I found Mrs. Childs there and a strange gentleman with her, the gentleman said he knew nothing of Mrs. Childs, he had met her in the street; Mrs. Childs was very much intoxicated, the room was entirely empty, except the bedstead and the straw mattress, a pair of curtains, and a pair of drawers. She at last gave me the key of her trunk; in that trunk I found the duplicates of the property, and I found every thing at the different pawnbroker's but one sheet, which Mrs. Riordan could not swear to.</p>

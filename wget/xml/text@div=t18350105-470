                  </hi>. I reside at Mr. Robinson's, my son-in-law, who keep a baker's shop, in Blackfriars'-road. On the 22nd of December, about four o'clock, the prisoner came and asked for sixpenny worth of biscuits—I gave him seven, and he asked me if I could give him change for a so<lb></lb>vereign—I said, "No"—he showed me the sovereign, but I did not exa<lb></lb>mine it—I did not see where he put it again—he then said, "Can you give me change for a half-sovereign?"—I said I could, and I gave him 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me the half-sovereign in my hand—I said I thought it was bad, and I must weigh it—he said why was I so timid—I said, "I am a stranger to you"—he said, "You need not be afraid, I am only your next door neighbour"—I called the boy out of the bakehouse to give me the scales—the boy still stood there—the prisoner told him to go back, he was not wanted—he went and called the man—the prisoner took the 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and the biscuits, and went out—I found the half-sovereign was light—the man went after the prisoner, and brought him back with a policeman—I saw the prisoner scuffle with the people—he put something in his mouth, but I could not tell what—he appeared to be swallowing something.</p>

I went from the bake-house into the shop, and saw the prisoner standing in the shop—I saw the half-sovereign directly he quitted the shop—I then pursued him with Kent, and gave him into custody of the policeman—I was at the station when the prisoner was there, and heard him say to another prisoner, that he should go to Union-hall, and to Horsemonger-lane, and have six months.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in the London-road, and am a surveyor. On the evening in question, I assisted Gale in taking charge of the pri<lb></lb>soner, while the policeman was gone after another man—the prisoner said he had never been in the shop, and Mrs. Herbert was mistaken—the police<lb></lb>man then brought back another man, who had the seven biscuits, with him—the policeman asked him where he got them from—he turned and said, "From that man," pointing to the prisoner—the prisoner said, "You did not"—the prisoner at that time produced a piece of coin resembling a so<lb></lb>vereign, and while the policeman was questioning the other man, I saw the prisoner put it into his mouth, and swallow it—I said, "Policeman, he is swallowing something"—the policeman caught him, but it was too late—the prisoner was then searched, and a good half-sovereign and 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. found on him—I saw this bad half-sovereign, it was placed on the edge</p>

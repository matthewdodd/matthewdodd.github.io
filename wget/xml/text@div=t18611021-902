                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Israel Albracht, a baker, of 14, Commercial-road, Lambeth—on Wednesday, 18th September, the prisoner came for one pennyworth of bread—he tendered me a sixpence—I gave him the change, and he left—I had no other sixpence in the till—I afterwards gave it to a little boy to go and get change; he brought it back as bad, and I put it on the shelf till my husband came home; he put it in a vase on the mantle shelf, and I ultimately gave it to the policeman—on the next Saturday, 21st September, a little girl, named Elizabeth Fracer, came for a quartern loaf, and offered me a bad half-crown—I said, "Where did you get</p>

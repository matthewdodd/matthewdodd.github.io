                  </hi>. I am undergoing a sentence of hard labour at Holloway, for stealing some books, in August, the property of my masters, Messrs. Routledge—I had known the prisoner about three months previous to that, and saw him frequently—in the week previous to 10th August, I took him a dozen "Broadway" Magazines down to Paternoster Row from my master's premises—the trade price of them is 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—before that he said that he wanted some, and I told him I could get him some—I left them at Mr. Procter's public house, Paternoster Row, as arranged, and he called for them in the evening—I saw him next morning, and he said "I sold them 'Broadways,' and here is the money for them, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he said he had got a little more, and had paid himself—on 10th August, I took' a dozen shilling novels from my master, which I left at Procter's public house, by the prisoner's request—this was the day before I was taken in custody—I was charged before a Magistrate with stealing those novels, convicted and sentenced to two months' imprisonment, which expires on Thursday—I have come here to speak the truth, and tell all I know about it—I did not give him instruc<lb></lb>tions to take them to any particular place—I had been in the service about ten months.</p>

When Gray was taken before the Magistrate, I went in search of the prisoner, with a brother officer—I found him on 20th September, at 94, Milton Street, in bed—I told him I was an officer, and should take him in custody for receiving books from a man named Gray, who was in prison, and who was in the service of Messrs. Routledge—he said, "All right; I know all about it; I shall tell the whole truth about it"—I told him that what he said I should make use of in evidence—he said "I did take the parcels of books, I think three; the first I took he gave me 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a drink of beer for; the second parcel he gave me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and some beer for: I took the books to Mr. Atkinson, and the third parcel he gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for: I also took them to Mr. Atkinson, in Tudor Street: I told Mr. Atkinson I brought them from Gray, the porter at Messrs.

Routledge's—that Mr. Atkinson said, "All right," and he left the books on the counter, and left, and met Gray later in the day, who gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for taking the books to Mr. Atkinson—I asked him if he had taken any books to Mr. Atkinson before, he said "Yes"—he also said that he took a parcel the Thursday previous.</p>

            . I was in the employ of the Steam Washing Company. The prisoner did not pay me this 2l. 3s. 11/2d., but it has been accounted for since - he gave me some paper about February, and there is a memorandum about Miss Nicholls and others, but he never gave me the money.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he leave the service? A. He was in the habit of coming till February - I have not brought the papers here.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. While he was in the office did he inform you of an error to this amount? A. He gave me the papers in February; the prosecutor had forbid his coming to the office then, but he was in the habit of coming and transacting business as usual.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did he account to you weekly or how? A. He should account when he received it; it was in the latter end of February that he gave me the papers - he charges himself with this sum, but never paid it; I do not recollect the account being paid.</p>
               <p>MR. MACDONALD. The accounts should be communicated to Mr. Warner the same day, and entered.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There was a great sum of money out - I received monies, and paid them; when Smith was discharged I took charge of the works - Mr. Macdonald came down and sent me to town to receive the accounts, and it is not likely I should account to an inferior clerk; I kept an account of what I received - I received this sum, and stuck the papers on the file, with a quantity of papers, and I overlooked it; in February I went to the file, and seeing these papers, I said, "Warner, I received from Miss Nicholls 2l. 2s. 6d., give me credit for it, I have credited Mr. Macdonald for it in my cash-book" - and the information he has got is from that very cash-book. If I intended wrong him should I have settled it at all?</p>
               <p>MR. MACDONALD. I desired Warner to receive mone when I dismissed the prisoner; that was about the 10th of January.</p>

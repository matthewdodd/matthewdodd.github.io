                  </hi> I live with my father-in-law, Job Bishop, who keeps the Old Parr's Head, Old-street. The prisoner came on Monday evening, 14th Feb., and asked if I would lend Mr. Lee our steps for a few minutes—Mr. Lee is a neighbour—I let the prisoner have them, and saw him take them into Mr. Lee's shop—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi> I am in Mr. Lee's service. On the 14th, about eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into Mr. Lee's with a pair of steps—he gave some orders to Mr. Lee, and asked me to go with him with some size—I walked with him to Castle-street—he carried the steps—he told me to put down the size—I put it down, and he said, "You run back and fetch a basket of whiting"—I went back with the size, leaving him with the steps, and saw no more of it.</p>

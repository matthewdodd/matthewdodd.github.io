I live at 6, Bromley-avenue—on 24th June, about half-past nine, I was at the Elder Tree public-house, Crisp-street, Poplar, up in the bagatelle-room—the prisoner was there and a man of the name of Robert Roberts—there was a game at bagatelle going on—there was a stranger in the room <hi rend="italic">shoving</hi> the balls about—Lovett said to him, "If you touch them balls again I shall hit you"—Roberts said, "If you hit him I shall hit you, I think you are only a <hi rend="italic">chump</hi> of wood"—after that the prisoner and Roberts had a game at bagatelle together—the prisoner then went up into the club room, and about five minutes afterwards Roberts came up after him—they began quarrelling together, and Roberts was going to hit Lovett—the potman went in between them and parted them—Roberts then caught hold of Lovett's coat and dragged him down the stairs—they then went into the street and stripped, and fought—Roberts struck the first blow—the pri<lb></lb>soner then rushed in, and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> him on the ground—he was thrown by</p>

               <p>wrestling—I think both of them had had rather too much to drink—Roberts became insensible, he did not rise—a constable was sent fur, and he was taken away to the doctor's.</p>

I am potman at the Elder Tree—on this Saturday night I parted the prisoner and Roberts in the club-room when they were going to fight—I did not follow them into the street—I came out about two minutes afterwards and saw a mob—the prisoner and deceased had just pulled off their coats—I could not say who struck the first blow—I saw them both rush in to one another, and Lovett <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> Roberts to the ground.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the Poplar Hospital—about thirty-five minutes past ten on the morning of 25th June I saw the deceased man Roberts in our receiving-room, lying on a stretcher, insensible—I examined him, there was a lacerated wound on the scalp and a contusion on the left temple—he died within a quarter of an hour after his admission—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem examination</hi>—he died from concussion of the brain—I should think a fall against the pavement might produce the wound I found on the temple.</p>

                  </hi> I am a carpenter, in the employ of Thomas Mills—the prisoner was in his service. On 26th Aug. I received information, and missed a piece of lead, about 25lbs. weight—this is it—I am sure it is my master's by the marks on it—I had seen it safe on the day before, when it was taken up from the foundation with four other pieces—this was the largest piece of the five.</p>

                  </hi> I live in New-street, and am a carpenter—I was at Mr. Mills's shop on 26th Aug. I saw the prisoner come into the yard with his jacket and some pieces of board—I saw him place his jacket near this lead—he took his jacket away with something heavy in it, and put it in the truck—I told Lacey.</p>

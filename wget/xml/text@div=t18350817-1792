He lived with me—I live at No. 30, Fleet-lane—the prisoner was at my house on Saturday, the 27th of June—we rent the lower part of the house of Mr. Lawrence, who does not live there—I went out about three o'clock in the afternoon; I left the prisoner and my son, between eight and nine years old in my premises—I saw this property safe in a chest ten minutes before I went out—it was five sovereigns and above 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—the watch hung over the mantel-shelf—that belonged to his aunt, susan</p>

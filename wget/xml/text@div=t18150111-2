               <p>Q. When did the prisoner quit your house - A. On Friday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Who shut the shop door on the Thursday night - A. I did, myself: I bolted it and locked it. I was the last person up that night; it was dark when I got up, I arose the next morning at six o'clock; I slept in the shop. I got up to let my apprentice in, the prisoner told the boy to bring him a light down into the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find when you arose in the morning - A. I told my boy to strike a light; he did, and lighted the candles on the shop board; he took the prisoner a light down stairs; the boy went to wash him, he had the coats afterwards in his hand; they were on the shop board. one was a new superfine coat, the other was an old superfine coat. These coats were on my shop-board just going in at the door; the boy had them in his hand, when he shifted the candle block they were in his way, he put them out of his way; he put them down again; the boy told 
               <persName id="t18150111-2-person64">Welch</persName>
             the candles were ready to go to work; my boy shut the door after him; the shop door I opened in the morning to let him in. There is another door that goes into the street. The boy heard the shop door open, expecting him to go to work; then after a little time the boy heard the street door open; it was shut then that morning; I was the first up in the house. I heard the street door open, I did not know who was going out; the door was shut then, it was fastened the over night. I heard the street door open soon after the boy went to wash him, and then when the boy came out of the yard, the boy said, master, the coats are gone, and Mr. Welch is gone. I sent the boy down into Holborn where I was informed he was gone. Whoever it was could not go out of the yard door, they must go out of the street door. I heard it open. One of the coats comes to four pounds ten shillings, for the other coat the man charges me two-pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, was the prisoner to have left you that morning - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever return - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the coats after - A. No. I tried to find them. but I could not any where.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the prisoner apprehended - A. On the 3rd of January; I was present when he was taken; he was found at the Red Lion, Seven Dials. A young man saw him the night before, he watched him; the prisoner tried to get away; the young man watched outside of the house, he catched him.

            . I apprehended the prisoner in a kitchen, in a corner house of Red Lion-street, Seven Dials; there were two ways to get out of the kitchen, he went out of the back way, he pulled the door sharp after him; I opened it; a young man stood in his way, he could not pass; I took him in custody, and took him before the magistrate. I did not find the coats.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had a coat and a waistcoat to make for myself; he has a large shop-board where four or five can sit and work; I asked him to let me come and make a garment or two for myself; when my waistcoat was made we pledged it for twenty shillings, the money was all expended; he said when my coat was made he could pledge the coat for more money than I could; I said to him my friend, I will give you a couple of days lift. When he took me up the constable said, I was a fool if I did not take my wages; he told the magistrate he owed me three days wages; I said he has perjured himself. He then said I gave him my work; he then told the truth. It was day-light when I went out, I could see it was a foggy morning; the street door was open; Mr. Smith was jawing the boy. I wished him good morning. He was with me yesterday, he said if I could give him a little towards the clothes, he would not prosecute me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

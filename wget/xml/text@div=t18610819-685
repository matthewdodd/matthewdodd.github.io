I am servant to Mr. Berry, of 96, Great Russell-street, Bloomsbury—my master is an engraver—the prisoner is an appren<lb></lb>tice in his house—he lodges out of the house—about three weeks ago, on a Thursday, he left to go to his band practice, at 7 o'clock in the evening—he came back at half-past 10 the same night—I do not know how far away his lodgings were—he said he had come back for a music case—he went and took it—he said when he came in that there were suspicious looking characters outside the door, two on the step of the door—I had at that time fastened all the outer doors, except the front door which led into the street—I fastened the inner door, leading from the kitchen to the workshop", after the prisoner was gone—the workshop is at the back of the house—he went directly he had got his case—he did not say, as he was leaving the house, where he was going—I am quite sure of that—that was about half-past 10 o'clock—he went away, and I went to bed—when I came down in the morning, about half-past 7 o'clock, I went into the parlour—I felt a draught in the room as I opened the door—I am quite sure I had seen the window shut the night before—the draught made me look into the room—</p>

On the morning of 26th July I was called to Mr. Berry's house—I found footmarks on the area railings where some one had got over; it had been raining in the night—I passed through the area door and came to the first door leading from the kitchen into the passage—it fastens on the inside with a bolt top and bottom—the second door is fastened inside with an iron bar that goes across it; that is between the kitchen and the passage—I found that, by putting a knife or something through the crevices of the door I could unfasten it and let down the iron bar—I examined the desk and found it had been broken open—I compared this instrument (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) belonging to Mr. Berry, which I found on the floor, with the marks on the drawers, and they corresponded—the prisoner was given into my charge on the Wednesday evening—I told him he was charged with breaking into his master's house, and robbing him of 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold—he said he had done so, and was very sorry for it; that he had taken four out of the bag, and had thrown the rest of the money and the bag away.</p>

He said, "Adolphe, where are you going?" I said, "Home." He said he was wait<lb></lb>ing for me. He asked me to go a little way with him and I did so, to a public-house; when I left him he asked me whether I wanted any money. I said, "Yes," and he lent me some; that is how I came by the money which I had. Afterwards he said he would come next morning. He had come once or twice before to see me at my master's house, and he has sometimes asked me whether my master was out of town, and I said, "No." He asked at this time, and I said, "Yes," and from that time I have never seen him since. My master has been very kind to me, and it is not likely I should do such a thing.</p>

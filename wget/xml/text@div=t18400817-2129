                  </hi>. I keep the King and Queen public-house, on Paddington-green.

                  </hi>. I am agent to Mr. William Easted, who is contractor for building a sewer at Westbourn-green. I bought the bricks, and saw them delivered at the prisoner's wharf—they were usually conveyed by 12,000 at a time, in barges—they had a crown on them—it was my duty, or my foreman, to examine with the barge tickets the delivery of the. bricks to the prisoner's wharf—I had the control of the bricks till they were delivered to the prisoner—I held them on behalf of the prosecutor, and handed them over, counting them by the bills, to the prisoner.</p>

I think it was between eleven and twelve o'clock she came in by herself; she asked me for half an ounce of cotton; she was particular whether it was sewing cotton or drawing cotton. I took the shilling of her; I suspected it to be a bad one; I was looking at it, and on my looking at it, Johnson (the officer) came in; he asked me to take care of the shilling. I put it on the back counter by itself. There was no other money on the counter where it could possibly be mixed. After I had placed it there, Johnson searched her, and when Johnson had searched the prisoner, I gave it to him. I am sure it is the same shilling that I received of the prisoner. The till was before me, and the back counter behind me. There wast nothing there.</p>

            . I am a city officer. I was in St. Giles's the day this took place, about half past eight in the morning; I saw the prisoner; I knew the prisoner; I watched her and another woman; I followed them through many streets, and saw them alternately go into different shops.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of knowing what they went into the different shops for - A. Yes; they passed many shillings; they were put into the till. I followed them until they came to Mrs. Ward's shop; I looked through the window; I saw her tender a shilling to Mrs. Ward, and while Mrs. Ward was looking at it I went in. I desired Mrs. Ward to keep the shilling by itself; it was a bad one. She looked at it, and put it behind her. The prisoner was present, and never mentioned a word. I told the prisoner I thought she had caution enough before, instead of going on the same game; to that she said nothing. Before I went out I searched the prisoner; upon her I found another bad shilling of the same make, and the same letter on it; there is a W. on it. There was another bad shilling wrapped up in paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mrs. Ward give you the shilling that she had received of the prisoner - A. Yes, after she had marked it in my presence. This is the shilling; I have had it in my custody ever since. I also found upon her three shillings and one sixpence in good silver, and fourpence three farthings in good copper. I found several articles upon her, threads, &amp;c. In the course of her journey she went into shops, where these things could have been bought. She went into nine or ten different shops; a pork shop, wine vaults, haberdashers, &amp;c. I have had these shillings ever since. One of them is the shilling I had of Mrs. Ward, and the other I found upon the prisoner. This is the shilling I had of Mrs. Ward.</p>

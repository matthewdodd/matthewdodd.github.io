                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 12th of July, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, I found the prisoner at the Green Man at Hillingdon, with two breasts of lamb and a piece of beef, in this handker<lb></lb>chief—I asked what he had got there—he said (pointing to the prosecutor, who was with me,) "That man's meat"—the prosecutor claimed it, and it was delivered to him at the office.</p>

He told me, when I was bringing him here, that he did do it, and he ought to pet seven years for robbing such a poor man.</p>

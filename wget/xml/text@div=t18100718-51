            . I am footman to Mr. Dolman. The two hats and the great coat were hanging up in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181007180035"></xptr>the hall; the prisoner came to the door, I opened the door to him; he said, there was a parcel at the George and Blue Boar, Holborn, but the name was rubbed out, he thought, it was for us. I asked him to walk in. I told him, my master was not within, I would go up stairs and let my mistress know; he walked in, and shut the door after him. I went up two pair of stairs and looked down the bannisters; I saw him take down the great coat and the two hats, and go out of the door with it. I jumped off the bannisters one pair of stairs, and ran down the other, and got sight of him just as he went out of the door. I catched him about three hundred yards from my master's door, on the other side of the way: I never lost sight of him. When I laid hold of him he had got the great coat and the hats in his hand; he dropped them after I caught him, and Mr. Meriton picked them up.</p>

            . On the 25th of June I saw the prisoner about half after nine in the evening; the prisoner came in a direction as if from Mr. Dolman's house, he had a parcel with him running; the other witness caught hold of him, and I secured the property that he dropped, a coat and two hats.</p>

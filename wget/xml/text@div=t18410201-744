                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable N</hi> 82.) I was on duty, in plain clothes, at the fire in Finsbury-place, on the 2nd of February—I noticed the pri<lb></lb>soner about two o'clock—he was pushing behind a gentleman at the corner</p>

               <p>of Chiswell-street, and I saw him put his hand into the gentleman's pocket, and take out this handkerchief, which he put into his own breeches pocket—I took it from him—I showed the handkerchief to the gentleman, and he said, in the prisoner's presence, that it was his—the prisoner resisted very much—it took eight or ten people to secure him—I handcuffed him, and took him to the station—this is the handkerchief—it is marked "W. C.," but I lost sight of the gentleman, through the mob, and the prisoner struggling—I do not know his name.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a jeweller, and live in Whitecross-street. I was in company with Kemp at the corner of Chiswell-street—I saw the prisoner take this handkerchief from a gentleman's pocket, and put it into his own—Kemp seized him—he resisted very much—if I had not been with him he could not have kept him—there were a number of persons round him—the prisoner was taken to the station—he then said the handkerchief be<lb></lb>longed to him, but he did not say any thing about his cousin—we asked how he came by it, and what name was on it, and he did not know—I asked the gentleman to come down to the station—he nodded, but did not come.</p>

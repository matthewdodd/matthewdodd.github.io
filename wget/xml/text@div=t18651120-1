               <p>his business would amount to some 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, at all events he mentioned some amount—I asked him if he would require to pay in any bills and to draw against those bills; he said he should—he said they would be bills that he received in the course of his trade—I asked him what the probable floating amount would be—he said some 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I referred him to the head manager, and the result was that an account was opened very shortly after that conversation; he was supplied with credit papers at the time—we have a printed form in which a customer places his name and specifies the amounts which he pays in to his credit; those papers are received by us when the amount is paid in—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the credit papers we issued—they are all in Taylor's handwriting—they represent the amounts paid in between certain dates, which are on the face of them—there are a good many bills represented by these papers, more than seventeen, among them are seventeen marked from B to R inclusive—they repre<lb></lb>sent in round numbers about 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were paid in between April 6th and April 26th—every one of those bills has been dishonoured—the amount due to the bank by Taylor is about 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the whole of that may be said to have been contracted within that period—it was created by his drawing cheques against the bills, he had value for them; we charge a com<lb></lb>mission at the end of the half year—when we take bills in the way we took them of Taylor we then charge the interest on the bills—no discount has been charged on the face of the account; he drew the money—these (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) are the cheques, they were drawn between 6th and 26th April, some of them were paid subsequently—on 26th April I wrote this letter to him (<hi rend="italic">This letter stated that no more bills of Taylor's would be negotiated by the Bank</hi>)—on the following day I received this answer—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "27th April, 1865.

Dear sir,—I am much surprised at and very sorry to receive your note to hand this morning—I am not aware myself of any bills sent you, not likely to be met or are not good, and we are as anxious as you can be to have none but what will bear examination and turn out all right—the amount during the past month has been larger by far than I expected, owing to several large parcels sold by some new customers, very well recommended to me as cash buyers, having requested bills instead—if you will kindly inform me of any names you do not consider satisfactory I will refuse to take any further bilk from them at once, and if not trustworthy persons close their account"—I made another communication to him and received this letter—"April 29th, 1865.

I could not swear to him—on the second occasion he was ordered to stand up—I then said, "There was a man with him; I believe that man to be the prisoner Kelly"—I understood the best of my belief to be swearing; I am very positive now, and was so on the second examination.</p>

               <p>Kelly's; it was carried on under the name of Burgess and Co.—that was in consequence of a proposition from Nicholl to me—there was a conversation on the subject in the presence of Kell, to the effect that it must be carried on in the name of Burgess and Co., that Nicholl was a leather-seller, and it would prejudice him in his business, if he was known to be keeping a boot-shop—Nicholl mentioned to me the name of Brewer; that was in Kelly's presence: he said he was a respectable young man in their employ in Dean-street, that probably references would be required on account of an office that was going to be taken by him—the acceptances to these two bills marked "Q" and "R" are both in the handwriting of Farnham; they are signed "W. F. Brewer" in Farnham's writing, the man I was in the habit of seeing with Kelly, and have seen with Taylor—the signature to this agreement for the office, "William F. Brewer," is Farnham's writing—this letter is also Farnham's writing, it is signed "Frederick Reeves and Co." and headed "Langbourn Chambers"—this letter signed "W. Hamilton," dated from Langbourn Chambers, is also Farnham's writing, and this other also signed "T. K. Reeves and Co."</p>

               <p>the first week in March, I received a remnant of black hat-cloth from Mr. Devereux, the manager—I was directed to fold it up, and put it back again in the counting-house—while folding it, the prisoner told me to cut him off so much, pointing out about a yard and a half—I cut it, he folded it up, and put it into his pocket—I know he occupied two rooms at 10, Weston-street, Bermondsey.</p>

                  </hi> I am manager to Messrs. Gillham. These pieces are part of the cloth I lost—I gave instructions for it to be rolled on a roller—this is the cloth from which it was taken—I have compared them with respect to the cutting—if the prisoner had asked me, he would have been justified in ordering any one to cut it off—he might take hats by my permis<lb></lb>sion—I gave Gillham directions respecting this cloth.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> It was used for hats? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, the three pieces I charge him with stealing—I found them at his house—I am confident they belonged to this remnant—he was foreman, and was in the habit of selling hats by my permission—I have not to apply to my employers—they have given me permission to do what I like for four years, having an extent of business from fifteen to twenty thousand pounds passing through my hands yearly, I presume they have every confidence in me—the prisoner has sold hats on his own account—all the men have permission to sell hats by my permis<lb></lb>sion—if the prisoner had come to me with the money for this cloth I should have been satisfied—all our men deal in hats—I give them credit occasionally—they sometimes ask if I will allow a hat to be paid for on the following Saturday night, and I consent to that—I allow nothing else—I have given him longer credit than that—Mr. Spencer, who was the foreman before, used to take hats without my knowing it; but the prisoner had no right to take a hat off the premises without asking my permission—none of the men have taken hats, and paid for them afterwards.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had the prisoner any right to take cloth off the premises without speaking to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Decidedly not—if I had been absent during the day, and when I returned he had said, "So-and-so wanted some cloth," and had tendered the money, I should have been satisfied—the re<lb></lb>sponsibility of the business during my absence was in his hands—I asked him about the black cloth—he said, after a long while, "I took it; it is at home"—he was not asked any question about the black cloth before he was taken—if hats or cloth were bought, it was his duty to account to me directly—a fortnight elapsed between the taking of this cloth and its being found—I imagine I was in the City when it was taken, but I was there the two next days—I generally leave home at ten o'clock—I return at one or two, and stay till four or five.</p>

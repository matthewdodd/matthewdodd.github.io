The prisoner came to our house last Thursday fortnight, as the master of a ship—he came again on the Monday, or Tuesday following—I was putting some coals on the tap-room fire—he said, "Mary, here is a comb for you"—I took it, and said, "thank you"—this is the comb—it was not broken as it is now—I gave it to the policeman.</p>

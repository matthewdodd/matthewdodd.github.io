                  </hi> I am the daughter of Thomas Parsons, shoe<lb></lb>maker, of Old Brentford. On the 17th of March, between two and three in the afternoon, the prisoner came to my father's shop, and said his mistress, Mr. Gilbert, of Goodenough House, Ealing, had sent him for some boots and shoes for her to look at, he pointed to some boots and shoes in the window, and said he had tried them on in my father's presence—I left him take a pair of men's Wellington boots, and a pair of low shoes to look at, believ<lb></lb>ing</p>

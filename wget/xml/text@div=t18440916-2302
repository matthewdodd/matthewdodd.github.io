                  </hi>. I did live in Cambridge-street, Paddington. The prisoner was my cook for seven or eight months—on the morning of the 5th of Sept., in consequence of something, I sent for a policeman to search her boxes—they were searched in her presence—I found in them a great variety of articles, sugar, tea, rice, and other things, which I could not identify, but I could swear to this seal which was found—she was charged with taking these things—she said nothing at first—I then proceeded to search—at first she objected to have</p>

               <p>her boxes searched except in the presence of a policeman, but, before he came, she requested me to forgive her, and said she would be a good girl all her life—I can swear to this seal as having been mine for many years—I was in Yorkshire some time ago, and a starchmaker gave me these packets of starch—I know them—this pillow-case has my name on it, and was found with flour in it, in her box, and this silver thistle I can swear to as having been sent to me out of Scotland.</p>

About twelve o'clock, on the 5th of Sept., I was called to the prosecutor's house—I found the prisoner there—Mrs. Badger was present—I found some articles exposed in the room—I said to the prisoner, "You are given in custody for stealing these things," and pointed them out—I was taking them out of the box—the boxes were opened when I went in—I said, "You need not say anything unless you like till you get before the Magistrate"—I opened one box—it was not quite shut—I found nothing in that—I found most of these things in the first box—there was a gold pin, a gold seal, a penknife, and other things, and between her two beds, two packets of starch, and some tea—I then said, "You must go with me"—she said, "Oh what a foolish girl I am," and fell down on her knees, and began crying, "I wish I may die before I get there."</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief clerk at Trigg's flour wharf, Upper Thames-street. In July last, I remember some bales coming from Mr. Cohen, to be forwarded to the paper mills at Maidenhead, to Mr. Ve<lb></lb>nables—sixty and fifty-three bags, marked "C", came on the 20th, and on the 22nd, five bags came—they were to be forwarded to Mr. George Venables, at Cookham, near Maidenhead—I presume they are paper mills—I was in the habit of receiving such packages from the defendant—he is a</p>

               <p>rag-merchant, and Mr. Venables a paper-maker—I remember a complaint being made by Mr. Venables, respecting some of the packages, shortly after they came, and in consequence of that complaint, some of the bales were re<lb></lb>turned to Cohen—I cannot say whether it was to be repacked—they were re<lb></lb>turned on the 26th, 27th, and 31st of August—they continue on the wharf to this day—I mean the last lot which now lies on the wharf, came on the 26th, 27th and 31st of August—I cannot say they were the same as I had had before—the Maidenhead barge was not in town, and the sacks were discovered in the meantime—Mr. Kidd came to the wharf in consequence of a com<lb></lb>munication which I made to him—I had not observed any thing particular about the sacks before that—our foreman had made a communication to me—I directed Mr. Kidd's attention to the remaining part of the bales which lay at the wharf—the wrappers were rotten—all those that lay on the ground tier were rotten, from the dampness of the place.</p>

I remember a pack<lb></lb>age being there, containing rags, directed to Mr. Venables—it had been there, I suppose, about two months before I made any observation on it—I then observed that the wrapper was rotten underneath, through lying on the ground—there were sacks in it—nothing else but the bag—I saw the name of "S. Kidd" on the sacks, but no direction—I told the last witness of it—those sacks appeared in very good condition, fit to be used for flour—I saw Mr. Cohen and Mr. Kidd at the wharf—this lot of sacks were then before them</p>

                  </hi>. I am employed to collect the different sacks from the different bakers and millers supplied with flour—I was at Trigg's wharf in September last, when Mr. Kidd and Mr. Cohen were there—I noticed some bales and bags there, the outside wrappers of which were rotten—the bales were opened in the presence of Mr. Cohen—I cannot say positively whether Mr. Kidd was present—on the 7th of September I found one sack, and on the 8th twenty-two sacks of Mr. Kidd's—Hopkins was with me—seventy of Mr. Kidd's sacks were found altogether—I was not present when more than the thirteen were found—I saw them on the wharf in netting—the rest were up stairs at Trigg's wharf—the whole seventy were there when Mr. Cohen and Mr. Kidd were there—they were in good condition—some of them have never been used but</p>

               <p>once—(<hi rend="italic">producing them</hi>)—the whole seventy had Mr. Kidd's name on them—they are marked in three places on each side—I believe there an twelve marks on them—I found sacks in this package belonging to other millers—there were thirty of Sharpe and Whitburns—the others were in pieces, but the names were visible—I found the names of "Charington," "Phillipson," "Franklin," "Heaves," "Hutton," "Aves, and Sears," "Clements, and Wilden"—I know those persons to be millers—then were two more—I collect sacks for all those persons—I have no doubt but they use Trigg's wharf—it is general wharf for taking in flour—I got a knife, and cut open the bags—Mr. Cohen gave me leave to open them all—he said he had no objection to my opening any of the bales that wen there—the bales out of which I took the twenty-three sacks were packed in the inside of netting, and some old stuff on the outside, old bag matting—there is some of it here—the netting was large mesh—a person looking through the netting could not see these sacks very well, unless the old stuff had been torn—I weighed twenty-six of them, which was 1cwt. 1qr. 10lbs.—I do not know what old sacking sells at per cwt.—the defendant told me he did not know how the sacks came there.</p>

Q.</hi> Were any of Cohen's men with you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> One; be stood by, and helped to cut the matting open, and I looked them over—some<lb></lb>times one had the knife, and sometimes another—I do not belive that he took out one sack—I belive I took them all out myself—I had not seen Mr. Kidd before—I understood he was to be there, but I had not seen him before—I I first saw the seventy sacks on the 8th or 9th, when we had counted them all over—the sacks with the names I have men<lb></lb>tioned were in pieces—I could not see the names through the meshes—they were taken out from the inside—they would have come through the meshes, if they had not been so packed—at the outside the there were put large pieces to prevent the others tumbling through—I could see the corner of one of these flour sacks, the mesh being torn.</p>

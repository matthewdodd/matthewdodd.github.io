I am the wife of Alfred Tanner—we live in Lloyd's-place, Brompton—about half-past eleven o'clock at night on the 11th of May, I was nearly opposite the Chinese Exhibition—the two prisoners overtook me—they accosted me—I went with them to a public-house and had something to drink, and from that time I lost all recollection—I had a handkerchief and some halfpence in my pocket—when I found my recellec<lb></lb>tion again I was in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> in the Haymarket—I asked where I was, and one of the party made answer, "We are in the Haymarket"—I replied, "Why did you bring me here, let me get out"—the female prisoner got out first and I second—in getting out I was pushed or knocked down—I fell on the ground—while falling this shawl was drawn off my shoulder by the female prisoner—Cox was there—he got out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> also, and they ran off—they are the two persons I had been drinking with—I said to a gentleman, "For God's sake what shall I do? those four persons running up the street have robbed me of my shawl"—he said to a boy, "Run after those people, and give them in charge"—I went to the station—I saw my shawl and identified it—I saw the prisoners the following morning.</p>

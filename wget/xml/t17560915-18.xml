On the 22d of August I lost a silver watch out of the bar, that was hanging up by the side of the wall. I order'd all the gates to be lock'd, and put proper watches over the prisoners to have them all search'd. The turnkey and I found the watch upon the prisoner (produced in court, and deposed to.) The prisoner was in for stealing a book; he was very much in liquor, and said he did not know how he came by the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the watch put in your bar?</p>
               <p>Jones. It was hanging up by the side of the wall?</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it from your missing the watch to the time of your searching him?</p>
               <p>Jones. Two or three minutes.</p>

               <p>I know no more of the watch than the man unborn.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Was he very drunk?</p>
               <p>Jones. He was very drunk. He had been in the bar about half an hour before I missed it. There were two watches hung side by side, this was one of them; the other was hanging afterwards. He was the first person I search'd, because he was the last person that had been in the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find it?</p>
               <p>Jones. In the waistband of his breeches, not in his fob.</p>

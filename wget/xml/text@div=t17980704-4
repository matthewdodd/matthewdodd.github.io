               <p>Q. Are you sure, that what remained was part of your sheep? - A. Yes; it was marked M. S. on the left side; I know it to be mine, my flock consisted of one less than it had done the night before; I then got a warrant and went to Davis's house, where I found two shoulders boiling in the pot, the leg we did not find; then we went again in the afternoon, and found a pudding boiling, that was a mutton pudding, which we suspected to be the leg.</p>
               <p>Q.When was the prisoner taken up? - A. Two or three hours after it was done; the account that he gave was, that he saw the sheep lying dead in the hedge, and he cut part of it off.</p>

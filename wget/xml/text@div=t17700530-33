               <p>Mr. Mills. I live in Cold Bath Fields, I am a carpenter and broker. The prisoner brought this measure to me last Saturday, between one and two o'clock, in a bag. He asked me if I buy old copper, and took this measure out of his bag. (Produced and deposed to by prosecutor.) I said, this is a very good thing. (I saw the city arms upon it.) He said, I suppose you will give me no more than the price of old copper, 9 d. a pound. I said, Honest friend, how came you by it, it is a regular gallon measure? He said, it was his own property, and I should have it very cheap. I said, I was of opinion it was stole, how long have you had it? He said, he had had it some time, he bought it at Camberwood, (I suppose meaning Camberwell) for four shillings and a pint. I said, I believe it has this day been used, I shall not buy it; I shall send for an officer and charge you. I did, and charged him upon suspicion.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Here is E. C. 1764, upon it; I well know it to be mine.</p>

               <p>I had it of a man I never saw in my life before; I had no money to help me. He put his bag upon my back; I did not know what it was. He took me to a public house, and gave me a pennyworth of beer and some bread and cheese. Said he, Carry this to that shop and sell it, and I'll give you a shilling for your trouble. I went in, and that man stopped me, and would not let me go for the man. I am an <rs id="t17700530-33-deflabel174" type="occupation">Irishman</rs>

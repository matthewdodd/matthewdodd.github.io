                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Jonathan Crocker and another—I know the prisoner very well—he came to our house twice a day to take goods away—he was carter to Mr. Baker, the calenderer—he used to come about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, to take goods out, and brought them the next day about 1 o'clock—we were satisfied with his conduct till we found that he took away goods that it was not intended for him to take—I saw this piece of calico (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) about two minutes before he came on 8th May, it was safe, it had been put there and marked. I saw the prisoner take it away—it was not one of the pieces he was to take—it was not put amongst the property that he had a right to take—it was put very near the pieces that he was to take—they were on the floor, and this piece was about three feet from them.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant 4 P</hi>). On 8th May I was watching opposite Messrs. Crocker's warehouse in Watling-street—I saw the prisoner come up with a horse and cart for some goods—I saw him go inside and take away six or seven pieces which he had been ordered to take away, which he put into the cart—he then went back for six or seven more pieces, which he was to have taken, and at that time he took this piece off a pile by the side of thoso which he was taking away, and he put it in his cart with the others—he immediately drove away, and I followed him in a cab to Shoreditch—I saw him stop opposite the Bell public-house—he got out of the cart and looked about for a minute or two, and then he gave the boy that was with him some money to go and buy something, I did not know what, but afterwards I ascertained it was pies—in the meantime the prisoner tied this piece of fur<lb></lb>niture in this handkerchief—he took it into the bar of the public-house and gave it to the barman—I stepped in after him—I took hold of it and asked him what he had got there—he said something that he was going to take with him in the morning—I said" What is it?"—he looked at me very hard—I said, "Don't be alarmed, I am only a policeman"—he then opened it, and I saw this piece of print—I said, "I must take you in custody for stealing this from Mr. Crocker's warehouse, I saw you do it"—he said I could not have seen him do that—I said I did, and I saw him put it in the cart—he then went to the cart—I followed him home, and gave the cart to his masters—I then went to his own house and found some other goods—when I was there, he said, "I know I did wroug, I was going to take it back to-morrow morning"—I took him to the station and charged him.</p>

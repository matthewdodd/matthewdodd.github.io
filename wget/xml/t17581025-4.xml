            . I saw the prisoner at the bar go cross my kitchen, and take the silver cream pot from off a table, (producing one) this is it.</p>

               <p>Almond. No, she was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her before?</p>
               <p>Almond. No, I did not, I ran after her, and laid hold of her, just as she was going out at the door, and took it from her.</p>
               <p>St. John Borrow. I am constable, I was sent for to take the prisoner into custody, she confessed she had taken the cream pot, and desired we would let her go.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I had been out with a friend about a little business, she made me welcome, because she had heard good news concerning her son, who is abroad. I was coming home, and found the liquor had turned my head; I sat down at this gentleman's door, there I saw the water running from a cock, I thought if I drank a little it would do me good, so I went into the house for something to drink in, and the gentleman accused me with this milk-pot.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Were you quite sober? A. Yes, I always am: the water-closet is in an open yard, but not a public one - I am certain I left it there: I am sure I never attempted to put it into my trousers.</p>
               <p>CHARLES BAINES. I am clerk at an office in this yard. I went into the water-closet at three o'clock and saw no watch there.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH WEAVER. I am shopman to Mr. Burltor, a pawnbroker of Beckford-row, Walworth. On the 15th of December, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I took a watch in pawn from the prisoner's wife; I have seen them together - she pawned it in the name of Mary Hammond, Chiswell-street; she had been a regular customer for three years - she was at Guildhall: I never heard them address each other as man and wife - he has come to our shop with her.</p>

            . I am an officer of the Mansion-house. I took the prisoner in Martin's-lane, Thames-street, and told him the charge was taking a watch out of a water-closet in Size-lane, the day previous: he denied all knowledge of it, and said he lived at No. 14, Brook-street, Walworth-road, but afterwards said No. 5, Chiswell-street, Camberwell, and gave his name Smith - as I came from the Compter he told me his name was Hammond, and that I had mistaken him in saying his name was Smith: I went to Chiswell-street, found his wife next day, and asked her for the duplicate of the watch her husband gave her the night before, and she gave me this: when I was going to lock him up after the examination, he said, "To tell you the truth, I have got the watch, and it is pledged in the Walworth-road," but he could not exactly tell where.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not add that he had found it? A. I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>The prisoner delivered in a written Defence, stating that he found the watch in the privy, and was not aware he was committing felony. He received a good character.</p>

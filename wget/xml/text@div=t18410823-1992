                  </hi>. I am a sawyer, living in Finsbury-market. At half-past ten o'clock in the morning of the 21st of July, I went with my wife and child Robert to the Weaver's Arms public-house, in Crown-street, Finsbury—the child is three years old—when I went into the house, the prisoner was standing at the bar with a man who was intoxicated—I had been in the house a few minutes, and my wife came in—the prisoner asked my wife to drink some gin and peppermint with her—my wife said she would rather not—the prisoner said, "You look very bad, I will go and get you two ounces of ham"—my wife said, "I can't eat it"—she said, "Yes, it will do you good; I will take this child and get him a half-pennyworth of cherries"—she went out, and brought the child in again with the cherries, and said, "Where can I get the ham?"—I directed her where to get it—she was gone two hours, and did not return—I went out, and found her—I said, "What have you done with the child?"—she said, "I left it at the beer-shop in the market"—I brought her back, and said to the woman who keeps the shop, "Have you seen my child?" she said she had seen the prisoner with it, who said she had bought a new hat for it, and the body of a frock, and then the prisoner said it was left with a woman by the pump—I went there, and could not find the woman, and I gave her in charge—I did not find the child till between twelve and one o'clock at night, it was then in the workhouse, without its hat or hand<lb></lb>kerchief, which it had on when she took it—my wife's name is Ann.</p>

I was passing through Finsbury-market, about ten minutes to eleven o'clock, and met the prisoner with the child—I said, "Well, Bobby, where are you going to?"—the prisoner said she was going to buy some sausages for the mother and father—I asked where the mother and father were—she said, at the Weaver's Arms, and the father was very tipsy and quarrelsome—she went away with the child.</p>

On the 7th of Feb., about two in the morning, I was standing in front of the prosecutor's house, and saw the prisoner coming from the back into the road—I stopped him and asked where he came from—he said, "Out of the Shires"—said, "You came out of the build<lb></lb>ing here"—he said, "I have been sleeping in the stable"—I asked, what he had got about him—he said, "Nothing"—I said, "You have got something in your pocket"—he said, "It is nothing, only a few cigars"—I asked if he had any thing else, he said, no, he had not—I said, "There is something in the other pocket"—he said, "It is a bottle of rum"—I asked if he had got anything else, he said, he had not—I said, "There is something else"—he said, "It is only a few coppers"—I said, "You must go with me to the sta-tion "—the things Mr. Markin saw at the station were what I took from him—I produce them—I know Mr. Markin's back-door—the prisoner was coming from there when I saw him.</p>

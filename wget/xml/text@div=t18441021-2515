                  </hi>. I am a coal-dealer, and live in Litchfield-street. On the 16th of Oct., about four or five o'clock in the afternoon, I met the prisoner at a public-house in Broad-street, and I got into conversation with her—we were drinking for some time, we adjourned to a lodging-house in George-street, and I went to bed with her—I went to sleep—about an hour after I was awoke by a policeman, who produced to me my watch and chain, which had been in my pocket—these are them, and my handkerchief.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant at this house. The prisoner rapped at the room-door to come out—I opened the door—she ran down stairs to the street-door—I saw her stoop down and put something into her boot—I asked what she had done with the man's watch—she made no answer, but ran up stairs—I would not let her go, and called a policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father, John William Dobby, a cutler, of 95, Strand. On 6th June the prisoner came and told me to send some ivory knives next morning, between eleven and twelve o'clock, for inspection, to 39, Brompton-crescent—I took them there, and saw a man dressed as a butler, in a striped jacket—I asked for Mrs. Hemsley—he said she was engaged in her dressing-room—I said I would wait, and walked into the parlour—in a few minutes the prisoner came down, looked at the goods, and said they were not good enough; but if I would leave them she would show them to Mr. Hemsley, and let me know in the course of the day—she said she had a dressing-case, or a work-box, which she wanted fitted up with scissors, pen<lb></lb>knives, and piercers, and I was to bring patterns—she asked me to make out a bill, in case the knives suited, which I did, and was to send a proper bill with the other goods on Monday—I sent them by the boy—he is not here—he</p>

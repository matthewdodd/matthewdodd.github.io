                  </hi>. I live at 2, Fairfield-place, Stepney, and am a book-keeper—on the morning after the 22d April, about 10 o'clock, I was near the Royal Oak with my friend, Mr. Joiner, when the prisoner started out of a court by the Effingham, which is just by the Royal Oak, and struck me on the face with his fist, it was not a soft blow; he struck a cigar-tube out of my mouth, let his hand fall on my chest and took this breast-pin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) out of my scarf, and ran up the court; the cigar-holder fell from the effects of the blow—I went up the court a little way with my friend; and waited, the prisoner came down again, we turned round on him and said we would stand by him—he then <hi rend="italic">shaped</hi> at me, and planted a blow at my face, but with some difficulty I warded off the blows for a few minutes; he tried to get up a fight with me; we gave him in charge within about ten minutes—I kept him in sight, the prisoner is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 39, Dempter-street, Stepney, and am a photo<lb></lb>grapher—I was with the last witness on this morning, 22nd—as we were passing by Vine-court, Whitechapel, the prisoner jumped out and struck my friend over the mouth, and knocked a cigar-tube out, and he let his hand fall on the scarf, and took his pin at the same time; we were side by side—he then ran up the court—knowing there was no thoroughfare, we waited, and he came out again—he wanted to get up a fight with my friend, and struck him on the head; we afterwards gave him in charge to 300 X—I saw him examined at the station, we had a deal of trouble to search him—we found a hole in one of his pockets, and following round inside the coat, the police<lb></lb>man found the pin inside the lining, between the lining and the coat, it was pinned in—I was looking over the policeman's hand at the time—the prisoner was very rough indeed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did he strike you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he pretended to be in liquor—I know nothing about Miss McClesson—we had not in any way knocked up against the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, X</hi> 300). The prisoner was given into my custody—I took him to the station and searched him, and found this pin in the tail of his coat, between the lining and the cloth—there was a hole in the left-hand pocket, and I took some other things out of it—he was very violent, he walked quietly a little way, and then said, "You are going to take me to the station, yon will have to take me there dead"—I had to spring my rattle for assistance—a little farther on he said, "I will give you 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. if you let me go"—I said, "I intend taking you to the station," and I got him there.</p>

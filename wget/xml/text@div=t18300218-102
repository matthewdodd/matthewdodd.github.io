I met him in the middle of York-street; he said, "Mistress, this is a dark night for you"- I said, "Yes, and it is very slippery;" he said, "Take hold of my arm" - in going up William-street he gave me two pieces of coin; I said could not he give me some halfpence - when we got to a lamp he said I had taken some money from him; he put his hand into my pocket, and took some money out - I said, "Don't rob me."</p>

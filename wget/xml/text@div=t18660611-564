I am a carter, and live at White Hart-yard, Totten<lb></lb>ham—on Monday, 7th of May, I was driving a van with two horses along Wire Hall-lane, Edmonton, and there were two other carts following mine—Mr. Withey's was not one of these—his was a van—I saw him when he passed me—he overtook me—he was driving a horse and van—when he had got as far as my first horse he pulled up, because there was not room for him to pass—the obstruction was caused by a vehicle coming in an opposite direction—it was Mr. Millard's cart—the prisoner was driving it; at least, he was not driving it, because he was asleep—it was a heavy cart, with two horses—he had no reins—he was not on the driving-box—he was sitting in the bottom of the cart—I could see him in the cart—he was sitting on the off-side of the cart, lolling his head at the other side of the cart—I should say he was asleep—he did not look up or take any notice of the deceased's cart meeting him—the deceased hit at him with a whip—I cannot say whether he struck him or not, as I had got my own horses to attend to—it did not rouse him up, <hi rend="italic">as</hi> I could see—it did not hit the horses—I heard it hit the cart—the prisoner's cart did not pass on without touching the other cart—it hit the off fore wheel of the deceased's van—the deceased pulled up his van, and was waiting for the other to make way—he was thrown off—the stroke I suppose knocked him off—I saw the off wheel of the cart strike the off wheel of the van, and I then saw the deceased fall—he fell off the seat in front into the road—from where my wheel stood to the other side of the road is twenty-one feet—I was close on one side—there was plenty of room on the other side of the prisoner's van, and there was such room, that if he had pulled on one side there would have been no accident at all—I did not see the prisoner wake up—after he had passed the carts, he came back again—he should have gone on the hedge side—it is a country lane—the prisoner came back to where the deceased had fallen—the horses pulled the cart right through, till it got past all three and then stopped, and the prisoner came up to where the deceased was—Mr. Withey could not get up—he said something while the prisoner was standing over him—I do not remember what he said to him—he made a complaint of his being hurt—me and my mate put him in the front part of his own van—we met his son on the way home, and gave him up to him—I do not know his son by name, but that is the man (<hi rend="italic">pointing to Richard Withey</hi>).</p>

Q.</hi> Were you in front? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—there were two carts before me—one had got one horse, and the other two—the width of my cart was six feet from wheel to wheel, I believe, or six feet two—I was as close to the side of the road as I could get—I am sure of that—I was walking, perhaps it might be at the rate of three miles an hour—the deceased had entirely passed my cart—he was against my front horses—if he had swerved to his proper side a little more, he would have swerved the horses—he was as close to the side as he could get—there is not a footpath—there is a ditch; I could not pull my horses into the ditch—the deceased could not have avoided the cart if he had pulled a little to the left, because</p>

               <p>he had not got room—he was close to the side of my horses—there would be plenty of room for three carts on that road—some carts are not so wide as others—vans are not so wide as carts—I did not know the deceased—I saw the prisoner coming on before he came up to me—I cannot say whether the deceased could have seen him coming—I swear that I was at the near side of the road, and he was at the off side—he was as close to my horses as he could be when the job happened—I saw him pass my horses, not the cart—I saw nim strike at the prisoner—he did not lean over—he was quite close to him.</p>

The deceased was my father—on 7th May, I met him and took him home—I did not hear a statement made by him to Mr. Busk—my brother did—my father was taken home and taken care of—I sent for a doctor—he died on the 6th of June—he remained at home all that time, under the care of the doctor—he never got off his bed—he was seventy-four—his health was very good, indeed, before this—he was always hearty—he was not deaf or dim<lb></lb>sighted—I met my father between one and two in the day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon residing at Southgate, near Edmonton—on 7th May, I was sent for to attend a person of the name of Withey—he was lying on a sofa, in the sitting-room—he was quite helpless—I found his left leg quite helpless, and with his sons I assisted in getting him up to bed—on examining him, I found he had fractured the left thigh—he was suffering very great pain—I did not discover any other injuries at that time—from the symptoms that set in, I had reason to believe that there were other injuries—inflammation of the bowels—in the evening sickness supervened, which continued more or less till his death—I think the inflammation of the bowels was consequent upon the injuries to the thigh, consequent upon the shock to the nervous system and the acci<lb></lb>dent—he died on the 6th of June—he rallied a little from time to time, but not materially—the cause of death was inflammation of the bowels, caused by the injuries—he was seventy-four years of age—he appeared, with the exception of these injuries to be in as good a state of health as a man of that age would be—I had known him more or less for more than twenty years—I had attended members of his family.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose you are certain the inflammation did not proceed from any other cause? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was no evidence of it at all—I made an examination of it afterwards—it is very unusual for inflammation of the bowels to follow from an injury to the thigh—it might be difficult for a medical man to say what was the immediate cause of inflammation of the bowels, but the symptoms in this case proceeding in a reguler train, and there being no subsequent signs of it, I come to the conclusion that it was from the injury received—there was a gradual inflammation coming on in the bowels from the time I first saw him.</p>

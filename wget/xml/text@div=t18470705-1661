                  </hi> I am a shoe-maker, and live at No. 4, Tower-street, Seven-dials, in the parish of St. Giles-in-the-fields. On the 28th of June, about five minutes before five o'clock, I was in my room, which is the Second floor back—the prisoner lodged in the third floor front room—about five minutes before five, Edward James Maids, the prisoner's husband, came home—in turning the staircase, by my door, I saw he had his coat under his left arm—I said to him, "Higher up"—he scarce made me any answer, but went up stairs to his own room—in two or three minutes, his little girl, who is two or three years old, came up stairs—he said to her, "Polly, come in, and if mother comes in to-night there will be murder"—he said that before the prisoner came in—a few minutes afterwards, the prisoner, with her child in her arms, came in, and came up to my room—she had not been there above half a minute before her little boy, who is about six years of age, came up stairs, and she said to him, "<hi rend="italic">Teddy</hi>, go up stairs and see if your father is asleep; don't tell him I am here"—the child went up—he came down again, and said, "No, mother"—I and my friend had just had a cup of tea, and I said to prisoner, "If you had been a little sooner you could have had a cup of tea with us"—she sent her little boy up stairs again to get a bottle of tea, and he came down with it into my room—she sent him up a third time to get a basin out of the drawer with some sugar, and whether the father had any ill thoughts that the child was going to steal the sugar, I cannot tell, but I heard a smack, and the child cried—the prisoner was in my room—she put the little baby out of her arms on the bed, hastened up stairs, and said, "I will see that he don't knock and ill-use my children"—when she got into the room there were some words each way, and I could hear as it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184707050101"></xptr>
               <p>there were blows each way—I heard them in the room and on the landing, I believe, as if struggling—with that I heard him say there was a person he was intimate with, who had his place better in order than the prisoner's was, though she has always strove to the utmost to do what she could—when she heard this woman brought up, she said, "You sha'nt knock and ill-use my children for that b—y Mrs. Trissell, that w—e"—they had a few words again, and I heard her say all at once, "Take that, you b—r"—as she came down stairs I heard a kind of a fall, and as the prisoner came into my room I heard her husband call out to me, "<hi rend="italic">Bob, Bob</hi>"—I looked round as I was twisting my thread, and I saw a knife in the prisoner's right hand—she had then come into my room—I took the knife out of her right hand, and laid it on the table—I went up stairs to Mr. Maids—he was then lying very near the middle of the floor, in his room, in the act of crawling towards the chil<lb></lb>dren's bed—as he was on his left side, he said, "<hi rend="italic">Bob</hi>, I am an innocent man, so help me G—, of what I am accused of!"—I looked, and saw he had his hand to his left side—I said, "Don't mind me, let me see what it is,"—I undid his braces, and pulled his shirt out—I saw two spots of blood on the shirt, full the size of an egg; and in pulling the shirt up, I saw a wound on the left side of the body, just above the hip—I looked for some water, and there was none—I came down to my room and got about three pints of water and a cloth—I said to him, "Keep it quiet, if it had been more in front it would have been serious"—I went up stairs and washed the wound—I washed his face, and wetted his lips, and left a wet cloth to his wound, while I came down to wash myself and to get a clean shirt, to persuade him to go to Charing-cross hospital with me—he was removed to the hospital, and he lived from Monday, the 28th, till half-past two on the following Wednes<lb></lb>day—I saw him after his death—I helped him off his death-bed into the shell, and helped to carry him down stairs—that was the same man—I am sure I heard him say, "If mother comes in to night, there will be murder;" and I am sure I heard blows up stairs after that.</p>

                  </hi> I am a shoemaker—I lodge on the third floor of the house—I heard Edward James Maids come home that evening—I heard a child cry after he came home, and after I heard the child cry I heard the prisoner go up stairs—I heard her say, "You shall not ill-treat my children"—a scuffle then took place between him and the prisoner—I am sure of that—the last words I heard the prisoner say were, "Take that, you b—r"—I then heard him fall down.</p>

I went to No.4, Tower-street, and took the prisoner—when I entered the room she was in the act of drinking something from a cup—she swooned or fainted away—when she recovered she looked at me, and said, "If I have done it, God will punish me; but I do not know whether I have done it or not"—I had not spoken to her at that time—I then said she had better be cautious what she said in my presence—she then said no more—I found this knife broken up in the water-closet.</p>

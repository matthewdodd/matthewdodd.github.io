On the 4th of May, past ten o'clock at night, I was coming out of my own house, and found the prisoner lay at my door. I shut the door, and very civilly desired him to go away. I was outside; the watchman was coming by at the time I was entreating him to go away. I desired the prisoner civilly to go away; he was very abusive; he was an entire stranger to me; he swore many oaths in the course of abuse; he appeared to me to be drunk; he struck me with his right hand over my left breast, in consequence of my desiring him to go away, with his fist.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a blow was it - A. A good smart blow on my collar bone; it drove me against the house; against the jam of the door. As soon as he had struck me he snatched at my watch and got three seals, a watch-key, and part of a steel chain. After he had got these he d - d my eyes, and said he would have my watch; with his arm he got me round the hips, while with his right hand he endeavoured to take my watch out of my pocket. The watchman was very near. When he endeavoured to get the watch out of my pocket I charged the watch with him. He held himself so fast by me I could not get myself disengaged from him until the watchman got hold of him, and then with his assistance I got into the house and got away from him.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the seals - A. I do not know. I never recovered them since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Had you ever seen the prisoner before - A.I never spoke a word before to him in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do not you know that he lives within two doors of you, perhaps six doors - A. I do not know that he lived in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. You had seen him before - A. Very possibly I might.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not give me possibly. Upon your oath had not you seen him - A. No. I was never in company with him.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you keep this house - A. I keep it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181306020044"></xptr>Q. Was not Mrs. Rainbow lately indicted. Upon your oath have you known this man and repeatedly seen him - A. I may have seen him. I cannot swear that I have never seen him.</p>
               <p>Q. If you cannot swear that, my inference is that you have - A. I may have seen him. Yes, I have seen him before.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say a while ago that he was a total stranger; that is the answer I took down from my lord. Do not you know that he is a wheelwright, a very industrious mechanic - A. From what he said at the watchhouse. I never knew it.</p>
               <p>Q. You know there is a forty pound reward - A. I do not know it. I have heard it. I heard them talking about it in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Mrs. Rainbow indicted for - A. For keeping a bawdy-house in the house that I live in.</p>
               <p>Q. Are not you indicted for the same sort of thing - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that man is a witness against Mrs. Rainbow - A. No. Yes, I know he is now.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard there is a forty pound reward, and this watch-chain and seals you have never seen - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not break the chain yourself, did you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What business is Mrs. Rainbow; what business is carried on at that house - A. A lodging-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there many other people there besides the watchman - A. None but the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, was it you that called the watch first, or the prisoner - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner ever been in the house with you - A. Never to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the prisoner in the house with you that night - A. I never saw him until I saw him at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Now tell me what the prisoner first said to you. When he knocked at the door did not he say that he came after a girl that he had been with - A. He never spoke to me until I spoke to him.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was the watchman from you at that time - A. Just coming by the area rails when I first spoke to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. And so you want us to believe that this man offered you that violence; he knocked you down and held you round the waist while the watchman was so near - A. He did it.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance did you live from the watch-house that night - A. Near a quarter of a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at the door where you say this offence was committed - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find the seals - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear you do not know where they are - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What seals were they - A. A silver seal, two gilt seals; this part of the chain.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the man was searched or not - A. I do; nothing was found on him.</p>
               <p>Q. So at the next session your friend is to be tried at Clerkenwell - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Might you be one of her bail - A. Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been taken up and called to give bail - A. Yes. No.</p>
               <p>PETER FLANNAGHAN. I am a watchman. I went round Suffolk-street on the night of the 4th of May, I was calling half past ten; I was called by Mr. Flentham. I was about twenty yards off; he called watch. I went up, and the prisoner had him across the thigh. When I came up Mr. Flentham desired me to take him away. I took him by the breast, and dragged him out upon the flags.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Flentham say when he desired you to take him - A. He desired me to take him away, that is all. When I got him on the flags he struck me with his fist; then I sprung my rattle. The prisoner appeared to me to be drunk. There was another watchman came to my assistance; we took him to the watchhouse. We searched him. I heard nothing of the seals until we got to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Flentham charge him with - A. Taking three seals and part of a watch-chain. That was at the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you took him from the flags did you search to see if there was any watch-chain - A. No; I knew nothing of any watch-chain; nothing was said until he was brought to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. So that when the prisoner had hold of Flentham all he said was, watch, take charge of this man -</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. The poor fellow was very drunk - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JURY. We are perfectly satisfied of the man's innocence.</p>
               <p>COURT. It is a scandalous prosecution.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I hope I shall have a copy of my indictment.</p>
               <p>COURT. Yes.</p>

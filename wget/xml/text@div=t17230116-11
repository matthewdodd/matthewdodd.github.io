That soon after Elis. Hely fell upon him, beating him very much with her Fist. Upon this the deceased and Will. Smith fell to fighting, and were both on the Ground together; that the deceased was cut very much in the Head, and that Elizabeth Hely left him and fell upon the deceased while he was down; that the deceased call'd to him, saying, Master, Secure these People, they have murther'd me, Mr. Hawk's Son depos'd to the same Effect, as to the Occasion of the Difference, adding, That Elis. Hely falling upon his Father, the deceased said to her, You shall not abuse my Master. To which she swore, Damn him, she would give him as much, and fell upon him; upon which he told her, Were she not a Woman he would not take it. Upon which she told him, that there was one should Match him, meaning William smith; that thereupon Smith fell upon the deceased, and after the first Fall, when they were both on the Ground, she laid on the deceased violently with a Stick or Cane; and that when the deceased got up, he said, he was murthered. The Surgeon depos'd, That there was a very large Wound on the Side of the Deceased's Head; that the Skull lay bare for 6 or 7 Inches, and shrunk down towards his Ear, but he could not say there was any Fracture nor Depression of the Skull, but what the Wound was made with. That for about a Fortnight he was in a fair Way of Recovery, but for about five Days before he died he fell into a Fever. That he afterwards opened his Head, and found no extravasted Blood, nor no Fracture or Depression of the Skull; and that his habitation being in a Cellar, he did believe might be prejudicial to him. The Constable that apperenhended the Prisoners depos'd, that Elisabeth<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172301160003"></xptr> Hely, while in his Custody, said, That she laid on him very heartily. And a Watchman depos'd, That Elis. Hely said, Damn him, if he laid hold of her she would kill him. Elizabeth Hely pleaded in her Defence. That William Smith having been at her House for Some Money for Work, her Husband had paid him 3 s. and 2 d. and he being much in drink, her Husband bid her see him home; that going to see him home, they were overtaken by the deceased, and Hawks and his son, who saying, There goes a Rogue and a Whore, and that was the cause of the Quarrel. The Prisoners call'd some Evidences to their Reputation; and other Evidences to depose, the deceased had said, he had nothing to say against William Smith.

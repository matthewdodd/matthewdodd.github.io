I live at 116, Minories, and am an hotel-keeper—on 7th June, at 5.30, I was standing on Tower Hill—I saw the prisoner talking to another man—I passed them five or six paces—the prisoner came up and tapped me on the shoulder, and said "Are you the gentleman that came in the Boulogne boat?"—at the same time I felt a sudden jerk, but I. had a walking-stick in my hand, and I thought I had done it myself with that—I walked on a few steps, and then found that my watch and chain. was gone—I turned round and saw the two men talking very eagerly, and the prisoner had a white handkerchief in his hand—there were no other men near me—I gave the prisoner into custody—my watch was worth about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it has since been returned to me by the landlady of the house where. I was lodging, on the Monday morning; she said she had found it under. my pillow—I told the landlord that it looked very queer—he used rough language, and I went and told the inspector—I am quite sure that I had the watch in my pocket before the prisoner came up to me, and directly afterwards it was missing—the landlady, Mrs. Taylor, is here.</p>

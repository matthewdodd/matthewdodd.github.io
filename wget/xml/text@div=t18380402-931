                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Thomas Martin, a pawn-broker, on Snow-hill. About nine o'clock in the morning of the 31st 3rd March, I was at the window—there was a pair of trowsers and a waist coat inside the door—I saw them taken down—I did not see who took them, but I saw the prisoner walk past the window with them—I pursued him—he turned down a court and dropped them—I believe it was the pri<lb></lb>soner, but his back was towards me—I pursued him, and cried "Stop thief"—he was stopped by a man at the top of the court—he came back and was given into custody—he did not deny the robbery—there was no other person that could have dropped them that I saw.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. There were plenty of people about. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I believe him to be the man that dropped them—I did not see him take them down—I did not see him near the shop before they were missing—I asked him what he did it for, and he said, "For distress "—the things were cut down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter at the George. I heard a cry of "Stop thief," and saw the prisoner running up the court—I stopped him—I did not see him drop any thing, but he took a knife and threw it in at my door—it was a shoemaker's knife.</p>

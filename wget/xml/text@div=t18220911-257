I gave her 5 l., and said she would give me the difference tomorrow; it is a public-house. On the 7th of July, I came home about six o'clock in the evening, quite sober. I went up stairs and got eight sovereigns out of my chest, and put them into my pocket. When I came down stairs, the prisoner stood at her bar-door, and asked me to treat her. I gave no answer, but went into the tap room, where there were several persons - an old man asked me to treat him. I said I had no small change, but took out a sovereign, told him to go to the bar and get change, keep 1 s. for himself, and give me the rest; but instead of going to the bar, he went out of the house. I went to follow him, and the prisoner pulled me into the bar, and shut the bar door. I turned round, and shoved it right open again. I did not call out to the people in the tap-room. As I turned to open the bar door, she put her hand into my pocket, and took out seven sovereigns which remained. I laid hold of her arm before she had quite got her arm from my person; she had got her hand out of my pocket. I seized it, and asked her to give me them back, but she said,</p>
               <p>"I sha'nt." I asked her again; she told me to go to hell and get them. I did not call out, but went up stairs to consider what I should do. I expected she would return them next morning. I remained up stairs till next morning, without telling any one. I am a stranger here - I have not been in England for three years. There were soldiers and girls of the town in the house. I came down about eight o'clock in the morning; I saw her soon after. I came down, and asked her for my money; she said,</p>
               <p>"Go to hell, you old fool - what I have got, you gave to spend." I said I should go and find a friend to see into it; she said,</p>
               <p>"Go to hell." I went to a shipmate of mine; he went with me to the office, and told the Magistrate. This was on Thursday - the robbery was on Monday. My friend could not go with me before. I slept at her house on Tuesday, but at my friend's on Wednesday. I went there on Tuesday, about eleven o'clock, and asked her for it; she gave the same answer. She was taken up on Friday - she detained my box and bedding. I have come from prison now, as her husband has arrested me for a false debt, to prevent my appearing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How much have they been wicked enough to arrest you for - 
               <persName id="t18220911-257-person2372">A. </persName>
            19 l. odd; they owe me money now; he arrested me three weeks ago; I did not tell them I was going to sea; I had received twenty-one sovereigns at the office in the Commercial-road; I paid eleven away - I never bought a watch of the prisoner. I had been in company with no loose woman that night; I was at Bates's ten days before I received the money; I kept my room all night, and brought no girls there. Every body in the room saw that I was robbed. I understand some of them said that I had left the country, and so she got bailed. I know Spruder of White Cross-street prison; I never had any conversation with him about this; I never desired him to write me a letter - I cannot read. Jones was with me when I received my money; I went with him and paid my debts. On Saturday morning, when I received my money, her husband took me to see a dance. I took out four sovereigns that day, and spent about 2 l. in clothes.</p>

            . I live in St. Catherine's, and am the wife of an excise officer. I have known the prisoner two years. On the eighth of July, till about half past four in the afternoon, I was with her at Wapping; she begged of me to go home to her house; I went and left her in Ratcliffe-highway; she said she was going to see a friend - I stopped there, and saw her come home about nine o'clock. I did not see Baker that night - I made tea for her children, and was in the bar till nine; if he had been in the house I must have seen him. The prisoner was not at home on the Monday night in question. I have been examined before one of the Judges about this, and gave this account to the Magistrate also; she went to the office of her own accord.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you go with her - A. Yes; On the Friday I heard the prosecutor give part of his account, and I said she was not at home at the time. Jones was with him. but he is her enemy, for he persuaded him to do this rash act. I had some washing of his at my house, and when he came, he said he Baker should do such a rash deed, and send her out of the country. Baker had boarded with the prisoner when he was in England before, and owed them a considerable sum of money. I have heard Bates say it was 19 l., and I heard him say,</p>
               <p>"Oh mother, I will pay you in due time."</p>

I was in her company from that time till near nine o'clock; we went out together about five o'clock to the Minories shopping till near nine, then went home with her - the last witness was then in the bar; I did not sit down, but came home.

               <p>"There is 2 l. for you." My money was 14 l. odds. I was fourteen days in his house - he gave me no bill, or said what I owed him. He said I must pay for three men as well as myself.</p>

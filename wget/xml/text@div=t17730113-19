            . I was in the Hampstead stage on the 7th of January, in the evening, a little before six o'clock; there was in the same coach Mr. Mackey, Mr. Park, Mr. Curtis, and I think in all six persons, besides a child; we were robbed by three persons in company together; the coach stopt, and one of the men opened the door, with a large pistol in his hand. (A pistol shewn the witness.)</p>

               <p>Grignion. No, I had been robbed so often lately that I was not frightened at the time. I flung my money into his hat; I cannot tell how much; there was another man just at the side of the person, that put a pistol into the coach; I said take your pistol away and I will give you my money. As far as I could discern his countenance at night, I believe

            . Last Thursday se'ennight, at half past five, I saw the prisoner and Humphreys at the Castle in Kentish town, in a box; about five in the evening; I suspected them then; I went there with Joyce, a farrier; we got into the box and began talking of a robbery committed the night before; upon which the three people quitted the box immediately; the two prisoners and Humphreys. I suspected them to be dishonest persons upon seeing them start up on this conversation with respect to the robbery; I looked into the mug out of which they were drinking and found a good deal of liquor left; that confirmed my suspicion that they were in a hurry to get away or they would not have left part of their liquor. In about twenty minutes after they went out of the house I heard of this robbery.</p>

I heard of this robbery in about twenty minutes after; I am sure Male is one of those persons, because I observed a hole in his cheek.</p>

On Thursday se'ennight the two prisoners and I went to the Castle at Kentish town; we had a pot of beer and a paper of tobacco; we staid there about a quarter of an hour and then went away; I went on hearing the conversation about a robbery I had committed; the other two followed me in about five minutes; I waited at the door; I left the beer for them to pay for. We went down Kentish town, where we robbed a coach. I had at the Castle this cutlass; May had this pistol; Wilson had a hanger; (produced in court) I had it under my coat, putting the point into my pocket; I cannot tell how they concealed the pistol and hanger; Male presented the pistol and stopped the horses; Male opened the coach door; I was on the other side; he took something on the other side of the coach; I heard them desire them to put the pistol away and they would give them the money; we were all concerned in the robbery. After I got over the gate I threw away the cutlass, but Male did not know that I threw it away, nor I did not know that he had thrown the pistol away; but the pistol and cutlass now produced, were the pistol and cutlass we had at that time. The reason why we run away upon Sir John's coach stopping, was, because we knew it very well by the pace: a common stage goes much faster.</p>

            . I have known Wilson from his birth; he was always an industrious honest man. He was one time waiter at a tavern; afterwards a stone cutter; he has been since at sea; he has since that worked with his father in the stone cutter's business. For some weeks last past his father has not been able to find where he was.</p>

On Monday evening, 11th May, about a quarter past 6 o'clock, I saw the prisoner at the Holly Branch, and had some drink with him—I afterwards went with him to the Nag's Head, in the York Road—he showed me a bad half crown, and said, "We will go and get a pot of beer"—I said, "Not with that I will not, because it is not good money"—he took it from me, put it into his pocket, called for a pot of beer, and paid for it with a good shilling—as we stood at the bar, I told him that the best thing he could do was to have the half crown proved by Miss Pinnock, the landlord's daughter; she told him that it was bad, and I told him that the best thing he could do was to take it to where he had it—he said, "Never mind, I will <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> it off"—he asked me if I knew a man named Fish; I said, "Yes"—he is a labouring man at Battersea—I saw him yesterday morning—the prisoner said that he came from Windsor—the half crown was a smooth thin one.</p>

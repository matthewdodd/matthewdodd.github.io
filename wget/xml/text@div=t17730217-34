               <p>Q. Were they black stockings?</p>
               <p>Tolley. No, white. I suppose he took an opportunity to put them under his hat; I shewed him a pair of stockings that had a particular mark in them; I looked for them and missed them; I saw his hand go several times to his hat, so I catched hold of his hat and found three pair of silk stockings under it: I kept them in his hat till I sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine them: whose stockings were they?</p>
               <p>Tolley. Mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any mark?</p>
               <p>Tolley. Yes; (produces them).</p>
               <p>Q. How are they marked?</p>
               <p>Tolley. One pair with a 9 and 6; another pair was marked N, my private mark.</p>

               <p>I did not put the stockings into the hat myself; I put my hat on the counter, and tumbling the stockings about they fell in; I went to take up my hat, and he said what are you going to do with the stockings; I said they came there unknown to me; he said if I would pay for them he would not hurt me; I had not money to pay for them, so he said he would keep my hat; I said I would not go wit out it because he accused me wrongfully.</p>

The prisoner came to me in distress, and asked if I should have a job, to give him a turn. I gave him several<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200078"></xptr>loads to carry. I sent him to a toy shop with thirty-six dolls; he said he had met a lady, who had ordered him to bring thirty-six dolls to New William-street, Hampstead-road. I said I knew no toy shop there - he said, the lady told him to bring her 2 l. worth of goods. I said he had better take a few more, in case some were not liked and gave him 14 s. 6 d. worth more of dolls, and asked how long he should be gone - he said, an hour an half. I did not see him again till he was apprehended; he never returned with the money, goods, or basket. I sent to William-street - there was no toy shop there. I have not seen them since. I found instead of taking dolls to my customer, he used to sell them in the street.</p>

            . I met the prisoner in Tottenham Court-road, where he was standing selling dolls. I liked them, and was going to take a counter in the Bazaar, which I was to have the first week in January, but could not get it so soon; he brought them. I said I could not take them, but would call on his master - he said, he lived at Battle-bridge. I went there, and found Kendall knew nothing of them.</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoner, at a house in St. Giles's. I found the basket there in a cupboard, in a lower part of the house. He said, let the consequences be what they would, he deserved it; for it was the effects of liquor.</p>

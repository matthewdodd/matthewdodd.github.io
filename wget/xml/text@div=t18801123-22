                  </hi>. I am a bootmaker, of 4, Russia Lane, Bow—on the 29th October I was awoke by hearing a noise downstairs—I went down—I found prisoner standing at the foot of the stairs—I asked him how he came there—he said he didn't know—when I went to bed I closed and bolted the house—the back kitchen window was closed—I found that opened in the morning—no furniture was disturbed, only a stool knocked over.</p>

On the morning of 29th October I was called to the prosecutor's house—the prisoner was standing in the passage—I asked him how he accounted for being there—he said he did not know—I left him in the passage in charge of the prosecutor's two sons and went to the back—on returning I heard the prisoner say to the two sons "What are you going to charge me for? it would pay you better to give me a d—d good hiding and let me go than to lock me up."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I had been at work and was going home. I heard a man and woman quarrelling, and the woman was shouting for the police. I asked him what he was knocking her about for, and he pitched into me till I had no sense at all. I must have been knocked through the door by that man. I am no thief, and have never been convicted. I cannot account for being there only by being knocked about by the man I interfered with. I had no intentions of committing a robbery. I paid 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to a solicitor for my defence, who had me in a little box and brought the depositions to me. He said it was all right. I don't know who he was.</p>

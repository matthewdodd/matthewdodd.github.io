I have never seen it since - I lost it entirely: it was worth 3l. I saw the prisoner next day- he saw me, and ran away. I found him in custody afterwards, last Session.</p>

             I am between fourteen and fifteen years old. I was in Smithfield-market - my father gave me the mare to mind while he went round the market. The prisoner came, took it away from me, and told me to go to my father - he cut me with a whip, told me my father wanted me, and told me to go to him - I went to my father, and when I came back I saw neither the prisoner nor the mare: I have not seen it since. I saw him again when he was in custody, not before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Have you not seen me several times since? A. I saw him once at the corner of Catherine Wheel-alley, where he lived - he asked me if my father was at home, and said he was ashamed to come down to him - that was all. I had a basket on my head, and did not try to have him secured.</p>

            . I am a constable of Union-hall. I apprehended the prisoner in Great Dover-street, at the back of Kent-street, and told him it was for stealing Berryman's horse; he said he had sold it, and meant to take the money to him, but all on a sudden he lost it out of his pocket in the market - this was on the 29th of October: I had been a long time looking after him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming over Blackfriar's-bridge, and met this man with an old horse - he said,"You may as well come and run the horse for me, as you often do" - he said, "Take this, and try to sell it - ask 40s. for it:" I ran it about the market, and he sent the boy to say he had bought another one. I went back to the father, who gave me the mare - a man came, and asked what I wanted for it - I said 3l.; then he came and asked if I wanted to change it - I said No, to sell it; he said if it would go in harness he would buy it - I put it in harness, and he offered 45s. for it; another man offered me the same. The prosecutor said, "It cost me 50s., and the lowest you can take for it is 56s., and if that man bids you for it, I will come up and bid more;" a man came up and bid me 56s., and I sold it to him. While I was looking about for the prosecutor I lost the money.</p>
               <p>One witness gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

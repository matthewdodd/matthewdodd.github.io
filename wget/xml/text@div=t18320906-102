            . I live at No. 16, Great St. Andrew-street- Sheehy lived at No. 15; there is a gateway between her house and mine. On the 21st of August, about twelve o'clock, I heard cries of Murder! at the back of the house - I had heard nothing before; I went out, and saw the deceased take a handful of mud and throw at the prisoner, who had given her no provocation that I saw or heard; the prisoner then seized her by the throat, dashed her down on the stones, stamped on her breast once or twice, and kicked her on the breast once or twice - she was in a violent passion; Sheehy was carried up stairs - I saw no more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you at home between nine and twelve o'clock? A. Yes, and heard noises proceeding from the house; it appeared like persons quarrelling - I could not tell whether there were any blows; I heard Sheehy's voice several times, as if she was quarrelling, but did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060055"></xptr>hear the prisoner's voice; I believe the deceased to have been a violent tempered woman; I saw her about eight o'clock, she was not sober then; she stood at the corner of the court driving and tearing at every body almost; they were people who had given her no provocation.</p>

            . I lived in the same house as Margaret Sheehy; I did not notice her that evening till between eleven and twelve o'clock, when I was disturbed; I put my head out of window, and saw her laying on the pavement; I saw no body beating her; after that she came up stairs and kicked my door open - I lodge in the front room second floor; she afterwards went down stairs - I heard a person tumble down stairs, and saw her brought up as the woman who had fallen down - I know it was her kicked my door open, for I turned her out, as she used very bad expressions; and almost directly I heard the person fall down stairs, and am almost sure it was her - there was nobody else on the stairs that I heard; she appeared to fall down very heavily - she appeared in liquor; she had not time to go out into the street before she was brought up, and she never went out of the house after that; my opinion is that this was between eleven and twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When she was carried up stairs, did she appear able to go out again? A. No; she was a troublesome little body, and in the habit of getting drunk; I do not know why she kicked my door open; she appeared in a violent passion, and used very bad expressions - she fell down stairs directly after I put her out; Anthony Daley was one who was carrying her up stairs after the fall; she appeared very much hurt and worked in fits like, and was knocking her arms against the stairs as they carried her up - I was not at home in the evening.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did she fall backwards, or how? A. She fell head foremost every time, and once she came down<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060056"></xptr>the first landing, which was nine or ten stairs - she was very helpless, from liquor; I had not seen her at Ryan's door - Ryan met me; the last time I brought her up stairs I took her to her room - I slept in the room that night; she lodged with me - I went out for a candle, and was gone about twenty-five minutes, and when I returned her mother told me she had jumped up and said she would go to look for her ring, and had fallen down stairs again.</p>
               <p>MR. REID. The fracture would be more likely to be caused by falling headforemost than in any other position.</p>

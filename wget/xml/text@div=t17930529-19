            , I went and searched the house, and found one cask of four gallons in the house, in a closet, Harris Thomson was with me; I searched the house; I went into the garden, and in a place made in the shape of a pig sty, covered over with straw I found thirteen casks, and two bags of tobacco; the prisoner was in Bond's house at that time, he was setting on the table; I knew the prisoner very well, he called us by our names as soon as we got into the house; we could not find any more; we thought it was the best way to go and get a cart, I went to a farm house and got a cart, and loaded these goods to carry them away in the cart; we proceeded about two miles till we came on to a Heath called Carver's-walk in Walvering field, it is a lonesome place, there is nothing but a barn on the Heath, just as we came to the barn twelve or fourteen men came out from the barn armed with hedge stakes, clubs and bludgeons; the prisoner was one, he and the rest took the horse by the bridle and turned him about, the prisoner in particular did, they called to us and bid us stop we had got far enough, and should not go any further; then Thompson jumped out of the cart, I continued in it a little time, but not long, I should have continued in the cart, but some of them called, knock him down, or throw your stick at him, if you can reach him; then they got to the cart and began to take the goods, throwing the goods out into the ditches, all the time we endeavoured to stop the horse, and when we stopped the horse they threw the goods out, they at last took the horse by the head and turned him about, and went on, continuing throwing the goods out, they were continually saying, you come to fight, why don't you fight? let us begin, but we kept them off, they could not come within reach of us; after the goods were gone we left the cart there; the farmer when the scuffle began he went away.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they do when they had unloaded the cart? - We went back; we went home, and several of them followed with hedge stakes and bludgeons to see us quite away from the place.</p>

               <p>Court. When they had turned the cart round they proceeded on the road, and brought the goods off? - Yes, they did.</p>
               <p>Jury to Cass. Did you see him take any out? - Yes, but I believe he was in liquor.</p>

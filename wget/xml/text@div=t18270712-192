The prisoner and another came in about twenty minutes to twelve o'clock- I knew him before. He sat down, and had a pot of beer; I drank with him; he asked me the time; I pulled out my watch, and told him. He said, "You seem to have a pretty good watch there, let me look at it". I did so - he said it was pretty, and put it into his pocket. I asked him for it; he said, "I wish you may get it," and soon afterwards he went out with it. I went to him next morning - he rerefused to go with me - I told him he had had my watch raffled for; he denied it. I had him taken afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. How many other persons have you charged with stealing your watch? A. None. I never charged Talbot with stealing one, nor Pollock. I was at the Black Horse, that day, but charged nobody there with it, nor fetch an officer to take a man there. I found the prisoner at a public-house with Brooks, a hair-dresser - he staid there while I fetched the beadle to take him. I have never got my watch back. Two more were in his company, one is named Garvin - I swear I did not give him the watch to look at, out of my hand. I was sober; I did not see him go out; I did not know where he lived - I mentioned it to nobody that evening - I said I had lost it, but I forgot then that he had not returned it to me, but I recollected myself afterwards.</p>

            . I keep the Hat and Plough. I saw the prosecutor, Garvin, and another, drinking together - one of them said my clock was stopped - the prosecutor then pulled out his own watch, and said it wanted a quarter to twelve - the prisoner then pulled out his, and it wanted twenty minutes. The prisoner said,"Coachman, you have a nice watch there, let me look at it;" he took it, and sat about twenty minutes, with the two watches in his hand. Wiltshire then said, "You have my watch, I expect you to return it." The prisoner said, I wish you may get it;" and in about twenty minutes the prisoner and the other two went out; Wiltshire staid there. He said no more about the watch, and I suppose he had forgotten it - they were all sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many went out with the prisoner? A. Two. I had forgotten about the watch then - he did not hand the watch to the prisoner, he took it: he was taken next morning.</p>

The prisoner pulled out his watch, and the prosecutor his; he handed it to Connor, as there was a dispute about time; Connor had them both in his hand some time; he then got up and got as far as the door, then returned and said, "Here is your watch."

I heard a noise, came down, and found him in my tap-room; he said he had lost his watch in my tap-room; nobody was there - he went out, fetched an officer, and charged a man who came in, with robbing him, as I understood. I heard the same evening, that another man was charged with it. I think it was on the same evening.</p>

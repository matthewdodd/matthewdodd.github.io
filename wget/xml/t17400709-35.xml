I shewed him some, but by his Method of looking at them, I imagined he did not want to buy any, therefore I kept an Eye on him. And after he had looked out several sorts of Goods, he slipped a Paper of Pen-knives under his Coat, and told me he would just step cross the Street, and fetch some body to pay for what he had looked out. I asked him what he had got? he told me,- nothing belonging to me, and immediately run out of the Shop. I was not able to take him myself; but I called out to the next Witness to stop him; he took him, and these are the Goods I saw him slip under his Coat.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I went to the Shop and looked out 20 Shillings-worth of Goods for a Man that goes over Sea, which I laid by. Then I looked out these for myself, and asked the Gentleman if he had any Body to send home with me for the Money, for it was almost 7 o'Clock, and we Jews don't touch Money after our Sabbath is begun: but the Gentleman told me, he would let me carry them home, and I might bring him the Money. So I went away, and a Man followed me and bid me come back. What must I come back for says I? I am going to fetch a Man to pay for the Goods I have looked out: and as I was going to fetch him, the Parcel I had bought for myself dropped through a Hole I had in my Pocket, and they said I had stole them.</p>

            . The prosecutrix is servant to me, the gown was hers; it was missing about the ninth of January from out of my shop. I am headborough; on Easter-tuesday came a person and said, a woman was gone by with the gown on her back; I went after her, and took her at her father's house with the gown on her back. I can swear it is my servant's gown. (Produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutrix).</p>

            . I am a mantuamaker; I live within two doors of Mr. Pain in Shoreditch; I know I made this gown for S. Fordham, and on Easter-tuesday I heard the prisoner own she stole it from the father end of the counter, and it was want that made her do it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I was a fortnight saving of money to buy this gown, and I bought it of a woman in the middle of Rag-fair for three shillings, who the woman is I do not know. I happened to go by these people's door and they stopped me.</p>
               <p>Q. to Pain. Did you ever see the prisoner about your house?</p>
               <p>Pain. No, never to my knowledge till I took her up.</p>
               <p>Q. to S. Fordham. Did you ever see her before she was taken ?</p>
               <p>S. Fordham. I have known her almost a year, and have seen her near my master's house; she has been at our shop, my mistress sells meat, and the prisoner has bought of her.</p>
               <p>Q. to E. Murphy. When did you make that gown?</p>
               <p>E. Murphy. I made it the week before Christmas.</p>

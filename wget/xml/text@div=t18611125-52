                  </hi>. I am a shipowner, and reside at Stock-lodge, Ingleston, Essex—on 17th October, I was walking along Bishopsgate-street, about ten minutes past 6; and passing by Catherine Wheel-alley a man passed out, brushing me as he passed—I turned to avoid him, and the prisoner came on this side, rendered this arm powerless, took my watch and chain out of my pocket, and rushed up the alley—I am quite sure he was the man—I pursued him three or four steps, and then saw two women standing in the court—they stopped me and said, "Have you lost anything, Sir?"—the prisoner then seemed to have gained on me, and I went back and got a policeman—I paid 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the watch, and the chain, which was a present, was 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have never seen them since.</p>

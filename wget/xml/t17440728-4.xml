            . About the 11th of April I lost three shirts and five pair of stockings: the Prisoner confessed at Mr. Scot's house that she took two shirts, a shift, an apron, and a handkerchief, and that her aunt

             put her upon it. She proved before me, that her aunt was in the street at the time of her stealing them: she confessed likewise, that she had sent them to one Mrs. Skevington's in Ratcliff Highway to be pawned. I went to Mrs. Skevington's , and found one shirt that was my own, two shifts, one handkerchief, one neckcloth , and an apron. I spoke to the Prisoner's aunt, and the Prisoner did own it, and offered to make a debt of it if I would excuse it.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money was found upon the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Watson. There were three guineas, and 13 s. and 6 d. in silver, she said the remaining part of the six guineas she had laid out in clothes: the money was found in her box.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she acknowledge she took it out of Mr. Scot's drawers?</p>
               <p>Watson. She said it was Mr. Scot's, I cannot be positive she said she took it out of his drawers.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the Prisoner say from what place she took them?</p>
               <p>Scot . Her aunt was at our house, and I believe she took most part of the things herself.</p>

               <p>Q. How did she behave before this?</p>
               <p>Scot. Very well, she was a very good natured creature, I believe it was occasioned by her aunt, for she told her she was going into a house where there was money and good linen, and ordered her to bring them to her. The Prisoner had no part of the money the goods were pawned for, and I have the goods that she bought with the money, so that the loss is but trifling.</p>

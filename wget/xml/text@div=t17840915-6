               <p>On the 17th of last month, between three and four, I stood in my shop, the corner of the Bell Inn in the Strand, four doors from Drury-lane; I saw the boy go past, and I remarked him having a knot as his box was so small, I immediately heard the cry of stop thief! I saw the prisoner with that parcel in his hand, and I saw him drop it at the corner, and I believe he himself cried out stop thief! I saw him taken, he was stopped by a man whom we cannot find; I saw the boy pursuing the prisoner.</p>

I turned round and stopped; the boy said I had his bundle; I said I had not, I was willing to be searched, that gentleman came up at the time and said, that he dared to say I dropped it, and I asked whether he saw me drop it, and he said no, and when he came to the Justice's, he swore he saw me drop it.</p>

               <p>Court to Harwood Have you the least doubt in your mind? - No, my Lord, he had it more particular in his right arm, he dropped it down in the middle of the pavement out of his right-hand; in less than ten yards afterwards he was taken.</p>
               <p>Was any body near him at the time you saw him drop it? - Nobody at all, the nearest person I saw to him was the little boy.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any witnesses, prisoner? - I have no witnesses in this affair.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been a labourer at Truman's brewery. On the 19th of April I was coming down Holborn, and saw the Bee Hive Cam<lb></lb>bridge coach come in—it stopped near the Bell and Crown—an old gentle<lb></lb>man who gets his living about there had two small boxes, and was running a strap through them, to carry them, one before and one behind—I did not know him before—I believe he came out of the tap—he was about to carry them away, for one of the passengers, as a porter, and the prisoner wanted to take the job away from him—I am quite blind now, and cannot see the prisoner—I did not know him before—he wanted to push the old man away, and take the job from him—I told him not to do it, and said, "He is old enough to be your father; you will get another job in the course of the day"—he said nothing to that, but immediately struck me in the left eye—I will not be positive whether he had anything in his hand or not—I could not see that—I lost the sight of my right eye fourteen years ago—on the prisoner's striking me my eye-lid dropped, and I was in darkness directly—it appeared to me that it must have been done by something in his hand, from what ran down from my eye—I did notice whether any persons were standing near—I was taken to a medical gentleman, and from there to St. Bartholomew's Hospital—I have not been able to see ever since—I have just got the rays of light—I lost my sight at once—I have not been able to identify the party since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker. I was in Holborn on the 19th of April, when the Cambridge coach came in to the Bell and Crown—a pas<lb></lb>senger got off the coach, and two boxes belonging to him were moved off the coach—the prisoner wanted to carry them—Lester went in and called the old porter belonging to the house—the porter came, strapped the two boxes together, and carried them away—when the prisoner saw that, he said to Lester, "What business had you to call the porter out?"—as soon as the porter went away he took and struck Lester in the eye with a tobacco-pipe which he had in his hand, which caused him to lose his sight—I could see that he had a pipe in his hand, he was smoking it just be<lb></lb>fore, as the coach came along—I did not say anything to him—I removed Lester on one side directly under the archway, and saw that he was dan<lb></lb>gerously injured in the eye—the prisoner did not say anything when he struck him, but he stood in an attitude ready to come at him again, with his fist shut, but a crowd came round him seeing his eye injured, which caused him not to come at him again—I took Lester to a surgeon with a young man, and removed him from there to the hospital, as the surgeon directed me—I had never seen either the prisoner or the prosecutor before—I called a policeman, and the prisoner made his escape before the</p>

               <p>policeman came—we went down as far as Hatton-garden, but could see nothing of him—after coming from the hospital I went with the policeman to look for the prisoner, and going up Holborn-hill I saw him sitting on a form outside the Bull public house, with some cabmen, smoking a longer pipe than he had before—it was a different pipe—it was close by the Bell and Crown—Russell took him into custody, it was just one hour after he had struck Lester—the pipe he was smoking had sealing-wax on it, but the one he struck him with had not—when Lester was struck something came from his eye on to his check, which appeared to be the sight of the eye—it was not the eye-ball, it appeared to be like a scale—I was exa<lb></lb>mined before the Magistrate—I can read but not write—I made my mark to what was read over to me, and what I swore—this is my mark (<hi rend="italic">looking at his deposition, which being read, stated</hi>, "The prisoner had a pipe in his hand just before he struck the blow; it was then a whole pipe, with a small bit of sealing-wax at the end of it; when we found him at the Ball he was smoking a shorter pipe without any wax on it; I could see that when he took it from his mouth")—it was a much longer pipe when he struck him, but it was much shorter afterwards, because it broke.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at St. Bartholomew's. Letter was brought there—he had a wound in the anterior part of his left eye, through the anterior part of the globe of the eye—it was a very severe wound—there was an escape of a portion of the contents of the globe of the eye—he can just see the light, and that is all—it will never be any better, I am afraid—he cannot see with it, and will never be able to read, or see his way about—I examined it directly, carefully—it must have tan done with some instrument—it could not have been done with the hand—I do not think it could have been done with a single finger—any instrument might have done it, more probably a blunt one than a sharp—I think a tobacco-pipe would have produced it.</p>

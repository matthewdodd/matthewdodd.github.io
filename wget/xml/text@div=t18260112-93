On the afternoon of the 6th of January I found a piece of metal in a workshop, where it could not be used; I marked it, and left it in its place. I then kept watch, and at half-past five o'clock I placed Mead to watch; I then saw Rogers go into the shop where the metal was; on his return I followed him out - Mead called to me, and said, "That is he - in company with a man in a white coat;" Rogers had just passed the metal from himself to Murray - I secured them both.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What do you call this? A. It is composition metal. Murray had left us about a week; Rogers had been in the employ about twelve months - it is worth about 18s. I swear to it by the private mark which I made upon it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see this piece of metal in the early part of the day? A. Yes, under some sweepings - I put the mark upon it, and found the same piece between the two prisoners afterwards.</p>
               <p>RICHARD MEAD. I am in the employ of Messrs. Cox and Young. Worsfold ordered me to watch outside the gate; Rogers came out about half-past five o'clock, with this piece of metal in his hand; he went on a few paces, and gave it to Murray - I kept sight of him till Worsfold came up.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH ADAMS. I am an officer, and received this metal.</p>

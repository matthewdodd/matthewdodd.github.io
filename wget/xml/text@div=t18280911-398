               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You cannot say that you have seen the prisoner? A. No - I have between four and five hundred pairs; I am confident these had not been sold - my shopman, who sometimes sells in my absence, might have sold them; I can only answer for myself - when we sell boots and shoes, we enter in the book the price they sell for; every boot in the house is numbered, but we do not enter the numbers, only the price: we cannot tell the numbers of the boots we sell.</p>

            . I am an officer. I produce two pairs of boots which I found on the prisoner, in King-street, Seven-dials, about two hundred yards from the prosecutor's place, at a quarter past nine o'clock, that night - he was carrying them in a bag, and I asked him what was in it: he said "Two pairs of boot;" I asked him what kind of boots - he said "One pair of top, and one pair of Wellington" - I asked where he got them from - he said they were his own making, but declined to give me any more answers.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . I am shopman to the prosecutors. I did not sell either of these pair of boots to the prisoner; I have a slight recollection of him - he might have been in our shop to have bought things - I cannot tell when I last saw these boots in the shop; I do not know whether he has been in the shop for the last six weeks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you been shopman? A. About twelve months. I will not swear I might not have sold them to the prisoner; I know this pair of boots to have been my masters, because his mark<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110182"></xptr>is in them - they are our own manufacture, and we know the man's work; I might have sold them to the prisoner; or he might have bought them from anybody who might have bought them of us.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's son. I assist in the shop, and know these boots have not been sold- on the Saturday week before they were missed, I can positively state that these top-boots were in the shop - I noticed them that day; we sold a great many in the course of that week.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought them in Houndsditch.</p>

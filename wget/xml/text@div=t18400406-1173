                  </hi>. I am a farmer, living at Ruislip—the prisoner was my servant. It was his duty to take hay and straw to London—I live about twenty miles from London, fifteen from the end of Oxford-street—I allow no corn or chaff for the horses on the road, but a truss and half of hay—he had three horses to go to London on the 18th of March, with a load of hay and straw—I have seen a bushel and half of Oats produced, and a bushel and half of chaff and oats, which I believe to be mine—we have oats and chaff at home—he could mix them himself.</p>

I was on duty on the morning of the 19th of March, in the parish of Ealing—I observed the prisoner had a quantity of hay—I asked what he was going to do with it—he said his master allowed it him for the journey—I got on the cart, and found a sack containing a bushel and half of oats, and in the hind part a sack containing a bushel and half of oats and chaff mixed—he said it was allowed by his master for the journey.</p>

            . I can only say there was a riot before my master, Mr. Bigg's door, on the 17th of May, about four or five in the afternoon; there were a great many people assembled, throwing stones, sticks, and other things, at and into the house; it was principally aimed at Mr. Bigg's house; every window in the front was broke, and the lamps broke: I believe the riot lasted better than an hour.</p>

            . On the 17th of May, I believe, about six in the afternoon, I was going up Snow-Hill; I heard a person say there was a riot on Ludgate-Hill; I thought it my duty, as a peace-officer, to go there: I went; and when I got there, there were no windows at all broke: I was there just at the beginning of the mobbing; I believe there was not a man among the weavers threw a stone; I observed the prisoner at the bar was very active in throwing stones; he broke a great number of windows himself; he threw very large pebble-stones from the pavement; and after the windows were most of them broke, the lamps were broke; but whether the prisoner broke the lamps, I cannot tell; he had a large saggot-stick in his hand; he took one of the tops of the lamps upon his stick, and vapoured it about, and tossed it into a cart that was going along; after which he threw the same stick through a two-pair-of-stairs window: he was going to pull down the sign, but a gentleman that stood by him had more wit than he; he tapp'd him on the shoulder, and said. Take care what you are about, young man; the prisoner took the hint, and walked away; I follow'd<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176507100044"></xptr> him, thinking it in vain to take him then: In Cheapside I met Mr. Gates, the under city-marshal, to whom I told the prisoner was the principal man in the riot: that he had broke more windows, and done more mischief, than all the weavers. Immediately he seized him: I took hold of one arm, and he the other, and we led him to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bigge. This piece of timber was found in a two pair of stairs room, immediately after the riot: ( Produced in court).</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence; but called Mr. Ripley, his master, who gave him a good character.</p>

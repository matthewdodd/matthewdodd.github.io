                  </hi>. I am head waiter of Mr. Quelch's coffee-house, in Fleet-street. The prisoner came on Tuesday or Wednesday for a glass of ale, and gave me a bad sixpence—I gave him a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-piece—directly he left I discovered the sixpence was bad—I had kept it in my hand—I ran into the street, but could not see him—I then put the sixpence into a small box in a drawer, and locked it up—there was no other money in the box—it remained there till Friday night, when the prisoner came again, and called for another glass of ale, and put a bad sixpence on the bar-door—Mr. Quelch was there, and I said that the prisoner had been in for a glass of ale that week, and had given a bad sixpence—the prisoner said he had not been in the house before; that was not true, I had seen him several times—I marked the first sixpence I had taken, and gave it to the officer.</p>

               <p>RICHARD BOOTE. I am in the East India Company's service. On the 20th of December I received my pension, which was 1l. 15s.; I fell in with the prisoner Reed in cliffe-highway, between one and two o'clock in the forenoon; I had seen her once before - I went home with her; we drank tea, and then came out to take a walk about seven; I was perfectly sober; I had not spent all my money - we walked down the highway; I saw Hart about ten, or half-past ten at night - we had been in different public-houses; we fell in with Hart at the door of the Half-moon and Seven Stars; I had not seen him before; we drank together, in the same house - I was perfectly sober, and had my money safe; I went out with the two prisoners; they took me up a court in the Highway, and there took my jacket and hat off, and left me; they took one sleeve of my jacket off first, then capsized the jacket over my head, and dragged it off; I was not perfectly sober - I was walking home very cold, and fell in with the Policeman, who saw me home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long is it since you were at sea? A. I came home on the 9th of September, from the West Indies; I never was in this Court before, nor in any other - I had only been with this woman to drink tea, and it was there the jacket was found, as the officer said; I was walking quietly home when the officer spoke to me - I did not tell this woman I was going on board an Indiaman, and had no money, and left her my jacket - I did not give her any thing for her tea.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. I saw the two prisoners and the prosecutors going arm-in-arm together; I took notice of them - in about twenty minutes my brother constable spoke to me; we went along the Highway, and fell in with a companion of the woman's; we went with her to Glass house-street, and found the two prisoners in bed, about half-past one or a quarter to two o'clock - the woman was dressed; we made search, and found the jacket under the bed, behind the chest, and in the man's pocket I found this East India paper of wages.</p>

             (Police-constable K 104). I have the jacket which I found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the prosecutor so drunk that a jacket and a hat could be taken without his knowing it? A. He was perfectly sensible, but they took him up a bye place - he could have avoided being taken there.</p>

               <p>Hart's Defence. I met him with two women; they asked me to drink - I then left them, and went to drink<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030082"></xptr>with a friend; I afterwards met Reid, and went with her as a woman of the town - how the papers came in my pocket, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Reed's Defence. He told me he had no money; we met a friend, who treated us - the prosecutor said he had only 3s. about him, and would leave his jacket till the morning.</p>

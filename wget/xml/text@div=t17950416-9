               <p>Q. What time of the day was this? - It was about a quarter of an hour after one.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you met the prisoners. Did you know the prisoners? - Yes; I am certain of the prisoners. They immediately demanded our watches and money, and presented pistols to our bosoms.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they both pistols, or only one? - They had each of them a pistol. I gave them my money and watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the person that applied to you? - Simpson, the man in the light coloured clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did you give him? - Three guineas.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you much alarmed? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of them after they had taken your money from you? - They then robbed my mother, and after they had taken her money, they rode off towards Feltham.</p>
               <p>Q. That is where you reside? - Yes. After they had robbed us they pulled their silk handkerchiefs off their faces, and I had a perfect view of them.</p>

               <p>Q. Seeing them but a moment, and being much alarmed, then is it not possible you might have some doubt respecting their persons? - No, not a shadow of doubt.</p>

               <p>Q. Be so good as to tell us the particulars, as coming within your observation of this matter? - About a quarter after one, on the 24th of March last, I was stopped by these two prisoners; Roberts, the man in black, took my watch, they robbed us, and were extremely abusive; after they were done, both of them just passed the carriage, and took the handkerchiefs from both their faces, and declared they would shoot the coachman, if ever they saw him again, and was a great mind to do it then.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of observing the faces of both these persons that were present at this transaction? - No, I did not, only Roberts's, I could not speak to Simpson as to any certainly, I could not, I was too much agitated to attend to the person of the man who had not robbed me, but the person that robbed me I have not the least doubt of, he staid so long by me that I could not have the least doubt; I then desired my coachman to return home, and I had no other way of getting home.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I believe the young lady who has been just examined, was the first who lost her watch? - That I cannot say, because I was busy, talking to Roberts, it was as near together as possible.</p>
               <p>Q. Consequently you cannot ascertain who it was that took that lady's property?</p>

               <p>Q. Will you tell us what passed at the time? - We were going to take a little airing, Mrs. Villebois and her two daughters, and another young lady, and we were got but a little distance from Mrs. Villebois's house, and she observed how pleasant her house was, we had not passed but a minute, and Mrs. Villebois said, there is a couple of highwaymen; they came up, the prisoners at the bar came up with pistols, and demanded our watches and money; Simpson it was that robbed Mrs. Villebois. After that Simpson then demanded my watch and money; he says, now, sir, your purse and money, as to a watch I said I had none; sir, says he, you have, and I will send you to 
perdition if you do not deliver it; and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160020"></xptr>I got up upon my legs, and told him I had no watch; sir, says he, turn your pocket out; I said, I should not; with that they ordered the coachman to drive on, and pulled their handkerchiefs off their faces, and said, they were a great mind to blow the coachman's brains out, and if they met him again at any other place they would; this was because the coachman looked at them while they were robbing, they had told the coachman to keep his head the other way. I told Mrs. Villebois that she might as well pursue her pleasure, where she was going.</p>







               <p>Q. Have you any doubt of either of them? - Not the least doubt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. It was the person supposed to be Simpson that attemped to rob you? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not the opportunity of observing the person of Roberts? - Yes, as good, because Roberts was at my left hand, robbing Mrs. Villebois.</p>
               <p>Q. As Simpson attempted to rob you, your attention was particularly directed to him? - I had observed Roberts before that, he was robbing Mrs. Villebois; while Simpson and Roberts were robbing the ladies, their handkerchiefs were over their faces, it was about half way over.</p>
               <p>Q. Then all the opportunity you had of observing their faces, was for the moment they took it off, and spoke to the post boy? - It was, but I am certain of them</p>

               <p>Q. Tell us what you observed at the time? - Upon the 24th of March last my mistress ordered the carriage at half past twelve, and I got it ready as soon as I could, I believe it wanted about twenty minutes to one when I was at my mistress's door, she desired me to drive to Hanwell; and about a mile from my mistress's door, between there and Hansworth, I met Simpson and Roberts, Simpson had a handkerchief in his mouth, Roberts had nothing on his face, nor no part of his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Who desired you to stop? - I rather pulled up my horses, thinking it was a friend that wanted to speak to my mistress, and I turned my head and see a pistol in one of their hands; I immediately whipped up my horses, seeing some men about three hundred yards off, plowing a field, and Mr. Stone desired I would stop, and I did stop, and they presented pistols, and demanded their watches and money, and repeated it different times.</p>
               <p>Q. Now when Simpson came up to the coach, had he the handkerchief in his mouth? - He had it a little distance before he came up to the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you say to Roberts? - Roberts had nothing on his face; I turned my head to look at him, and Roberts d-ed me, and said he would blow my brains out if I turned my head that way, I saw Roberts had nothing on has face.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the person supposed to be Roberts, while the robbery was going on? - I saw him, but I cannot say whether he had a pistol or not in his hand; immediately I looked, Simpson said be would blow my brains out; and I looked no more after that; they said they were robbed, they rode off; my mistress said she was robbed, I driving on, as I thought to go towards Hanwell, my mistress told me to turn round, and go the same way back again; I looked afterwards and saw the prisoners, on a trot, very fast; my mistress desired I would turn back, and go the same way home again, she would go no further.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of seeing their faces before they committed the robbery? - Perfectly.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure hat is the man that you met? - I am clear of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you returned towards home? - I did, and made some inquiries after them, and we were informed they rode fast towards Belfound.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of your inquiries, did you pursue the way that you was informed they were gone? - I inquired myself by Feltham church.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go in pursuit of the men? - After I got home Mr. Stone desired me and the footman to go after them; we went and put a saddle on each of the horses that I drove, and we went to Belfound.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go next? - We went from there to Harlington; we went from Harlington across the country roads to Harrow, we went to Harrow, and inquired of a man who was a rope-maker.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to Harrow, did you meet with any persons like the persons that robbed you? Did you go to the King's Head, at Harrow? - I did.</p>

            ; there we found the two prisoners in the room, we took them in the room; we had got a constable, who I spoke to before, and there we searched them.</p>
               <p>Q. Now tell us what past then. What did you find? - After the handcuffs were put on them, Simpson says, here is the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any conversation about a watch by any body? - I told them they were my prisoners; they said, they knew nothing of me; I said I was very sorry I knew any thing of them; then we got the handcuffs on them, and searched them, and Simpson said, here is the watch; he put his hand towards his right hand pocket; I told the constable and told the Fosters, how they had just stopped the carriage, and robbed my mistress, and I insisted on their being searched; one of the Fosters took the watch out of his pocket, and three pistols were found on them, I see them after they were taken from them, but I cannot say who had them, they were loaded. They were not examined then, but they were brought to Bow-street, and justice Bond examined them, and said they were loaded, all three.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the watch? - One of the Fosters had it that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the watch yourself? - I may have seen it, but I cannot say I did know it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing else on them? - There was money found on them, but I cannot justly say how much.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a purse found? - There was a pocket book.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You seem to have laid a deal of emphasis on one thing, that is this, that at the time you looked at the men that robbed the coach, one of them d-ned his eyes, and said he would blow your brains out? - He d-ned me at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he not the opportunity of putting his threat into execution at the time, if he had been such a sanguinary man as you represent him to be? - He d-ned me, and told me he would, and I had no other reason to think but he would do it.</p>

               <p>Q. Were they loaded or not? - I did not see, I came home to let my mistress know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. They did not offer to make use of these pistols when you apprehended them? - No, they did not make any resistance at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did you see the watch when it was found? Did you know it? - Yes, I knew the chain, It was Miss Harriott Villebois's.</p>
               <p>-FOSTER sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you live at the King's Head, at Harrow? - Yes; I remember the prisoners coming to my father's house, on the 24th of March, about three o'clock, as nigh as I can guess; we had dined, but about three they came up to the door, and they asked for two gills of wine, which I served them with; then they asked if the family had dined? I told them yes, we had dined, and they asked it we had any cold meat in the house? I told them if they would please to alight from their horses I would see, and I served them with what we had, and a bottle of ale; before they had done Mrs. Villebois's servant came to inquire for these two men; I told them there were two such men there, and told them to follow me into the room, and my brother and I went up to Simpson, I told him I understood that there was a robbery committed, and I suspected they had done it, and I told them I hoped they would make no resistance, and then my brother and the footman and coachman and headborough took them, and they were handcuffed and searched, and I found a pistol, and the coachman said his mistress had lost a watch, and Simpson said it was in his left hand waistcoat pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. What became of the watch after that? - I have got it, and have kept it ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing else found? - There is four guineas and a half in gold, some silver and halfpence. (The watch produced.)</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. Is there any particular mark by which you know it? - Yes, there is a bruise on the outside, I know it from the whole general appearance.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. And that you say you derive from three years use of it? - Yes, I am positive of the watch.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Villebois. I am certain it is her watch, it is the watch she was robbed of.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the watch? - About seven or eight years, I gave it to Miss Villebois myself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a ship's steward. On Thursday night, 22nd Jan., I was drinking in a public house in Whitechapel—the prisoner was not there at first, but another man belonging to him was with me in the bar parlour—when I came out, the prisoner and another man came in—I treated them to drink—I was going home—the other man said to me, "Don't be in a hurry yet, you shall go home with me, and have half of my bed"—shortly after I went out, and the prisoner and the other man went with me—one got hold of me by one arm, and one by the other, taking me home, as I thought, to have half of the man's bed; I had been drinking, but I knew what I was about—I was able to walk—they took me into Plough-court—the. prisoner then took hold of me by the throat, and got me down, and the other one got hold of me, and turned my pockets inside out, and then tried for my watch—I had it in my fob, and my guard round my braces—they unbuttoned my waistcoat, and I screamed out, "Murder!" all that I could—I had about 37<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver in my pocket; I had 42<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. when I went into the public house, and I reckon, after spending what I did, I had about 37<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. left—it was in my waistcoat and trowsers pockets; I lost that—I am sure the prisoner is the man that seized me by the throat—I was very much hurt, and have felt the effects of it ever since.</p>

On the evening in question I heard a groaning noise in Plough-court, Whitechapel, and on going there I met the prisoner and another man coming from where the prosecutor was lying, about four yards distant—when I got up to the prosecutor, he was just raising himself up, supporting himself against the wall, and groaning very much—I believe he had been drinking, but at the station he was quite sensible—he appeared to be very much injured—in consequence of what he said, I turned back again, and went after the prisoner and the other roan—I took the prisoner into custody; the other one crossed over, and a brother constable stopped him—I told the prisoner I wanted him—he said, "What for?" I said, "For strangling a man in Plough—court"—he said, "What, me? what, me?" I said, "Yes"—I took him back, and met the prosecutor coming along—I said, "Is this the man?" he said, "Yes, that is the man that strangled me, that got hold of my throat."</p>

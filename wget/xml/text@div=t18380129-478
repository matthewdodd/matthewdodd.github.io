                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live at No. 4, Hartley-place, Old Kent-road. I purchased three sheep, in the carcase, on the 13th of Jan<lb></lb>uary, in Leadenhall-market—I had a cart there, standing in Gracechurch-street, under the care of a man who looks after the carts—I lost the carcase of sheep, weighing 88lbs., and worth 38<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am employed by the batchers, in Leadenhall-market, to look after their carts. On Saturday morning, the 13th of Janu<lb></lb>ary, I was walking up and down Gracechurch-street, watching the carts, and missed a carcase of mutton from Mr. Fulwood's cart—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner take it from the cart and put it on his back—I went after him, and told him to bring it back—he made me no answer—I called him again, he said something, but I could not tell what it was—he plunged the sheep against me, I lost my hold of him, and he ran round Lombard-street—I gave him in charge in Birchin-lane.</p>

I was employed to carry the carcase of mutton to Whitechapel by a man I do not know, and had never seen before—I was in the habit of attending the market, not being able to procure employment at my own business—I had not got far with the mutton before the witness stopped me, and told me to take it back to where I got it from—I pointed to the man, and said, "That is the man I had it of."</p>

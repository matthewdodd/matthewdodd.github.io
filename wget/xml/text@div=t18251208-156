The prisoner was in my service for a year and three quarters - he left me on the 1st of November last, but not on account of this charge. On the night of the 9th of September, between ten and eleven o'clock, on Mrs. Fryer's retiring to her bed-room, she found several drawers were open - she immediately called to me, and on going into the room I found my wearing apparel scattered about the floor. I examined the drawer in which my cash had been deposited, and discovered that a small bag, containing a 10l. Bank of England note, five or six sovereigns, and an old watch, had been taken away. I also missed a sabre from the room. I had seen my money safe on the 5th of September, when I took some out. I know I left the note and five or six sovereigns in it then, to the best of my recollection. The note was dated the 5th of August, 1825, and was No. 12,850; I had received it at my bankers, Messrs. Cottrel and Trails; I stopped it at the Bank, I think, on the 19th of September - I did not think of it before, but it was suggested by a friend, and I did it. The prisoner remained in my service about seven weeks afterwards.</p>

            . - The prisoner married my daughter. On the 8th of November he came to our house, and asked my husband to go with him to town that evening, but he could not, as he had to go to work early the next day. I came with the prisoner to town, and we went to Oxford-street, and there I bought eleven yards of calico, for a pair of sheets, and one yard of net, at Mr. Rawlins' - they came to 15s., and I gave the 10l. note, which the prisoner had given to me about twenty yards before we got to the shop, when he desired me to go and buy the articles, which I did; when I came out I gave him the whole of the change, and the parcel of linen; I then asked him how he got the note - he said he had found it; I gave Mr. Rawlins, the name of "Susannah Clarke, No. 24, Knightsbridge," because I had understood the prisoner that he had it from her.</p>

            . I am an officer, and took the prisoner. I did not, in the first instance, tell him what I took him for; I asked him if his name was Edwards, and he said it was; I then asked him to come with me a little way, and brought him to the Adam and Eve public-house, where a Magistrate was sitting to hear the case - I afterwards took him to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>CORNELIUS FRYER re-examined. Q. Did you say any thing to your servants about your loss? A. I mentioned it that night; the prisoner said he knew nothing about it, but he supposed they had got over the wall. The sabre was found on General Loveday's ground. I never had any particular conversation with the prisoner about it. I never suspected him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I found the note at a distance from the house; I took it up, and thought it was a bill; I understood my master on the night he lost it that his name was on it: there was no name on this, and I kept it a few days, and then got the witness to pass it.</p>
               <p>CORNELIUS FRYER re-examined. Q. Did you say your name was on it? A. Not that I know of. I used to put my initials on the notes when I paid them away; I do not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182512080061"></xptr>see my name on this note. The drawer in which the bag was was unlocked.</p>

On the 27th of Sep<lb></lb>tember, I was at the George public-house, in Castle-street, Leicester-square, with a person named Lee—the prisoner came in and sat down at the end of the table where I sat—he had a pint of half-and-half, and asked me to drink, which I did—I said nothing to him, nor he to me—I went out at eight o'clock, and he followed me—my box was at Grosvenor Arms—when I came out, the prisoner asked if I would accept of him to carry my box—I had said I was going to service—I asked him what he would charge—he said, "Nothing, but some drink;" and he had some half-and-half at the Grosvenor Arms—he sat in the tap-room while the waiter and I fetched the two boxes down stairs, and a bundle, they contained the five gowns and other things mentioned—there were two sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, and three half-crowns—I left the house with him—he helped me to carry the boxes to the Vernon's Head, in North Audley-street, where I was going to live—the next morning, at ten o'clock, I came to the place, and the box was gone—I had told him I was going to my father's house to sleep—I left the Vernon's Head about half-past nine o'clock—he was with me, and came part of the way home—he came to the public-house in Belgrave-square—he proposed to stay with me all night, I refused, and he was very angry, and said he would make me repent it before that time to-morrow night—I left him, and the next morning went to my place, and found the larger box, that contained these articles, gone—this is the box, and here are the articles in it.</p>

I accompanied her, car<lb></lb>ried her box, and left it at the Vernon's Head, the landlord of which and her had some words, and she came away from there—she said she would not go there at all, and requested me to call a cab, and to fetch her boxes away again that night. I told her I thought she had better let them remain till morning, and then I would fetch them away. We went from there to procure a bed, which she said she could get for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I said I would not give so much; upon which she asked me to go to her mother's, and said that I could stop there and sleep that night with her. We went to public-house, and stopped there drinking till a late hour; I then persuaded her to go home by herself, not liking to go to her mother's. She then proposed to me to take a lodging, where I could visit her when I thought proper, on the next day I told her that I had to money for such purpose; and she told me to go in the morning, get her box, and raise a few shillings to pay a week's rent down. I accordingly went on the on the next day and fetched it away, and pledged it for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

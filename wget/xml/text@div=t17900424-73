               <p>I am the wife of the last witness. I was present when the prisoner and another woman, who said she was her mother, came to take the lodging; I was to look to the prisoner only for the rent; she continued in our house about four months; she paid the first two weeks; then she said she was a married woman, and that her husband was in the country, overseer of a gentleman's farm, and asked me to let the rent go on by the quarter? I told her that was an uncommon thing to ask; and that I should expect to be better acquainted with her at the expiration of that month; I received<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240183"></xptr>that month's rent by trifles, at the rate of two shillings and six-pence a week; she went away about a week before she was taken up; she said she was going to nurse an old lady with a pleurisy in her side, which was just before the time she said her husband was to come to town; we took her up on suspicion; and she unlocked the door herself; and entering the room, I found the things in the indictment were gone; the feathers were taken out of the pillows and bolster.</p>

I then felt and found only 5 s. 6 d. left out of 2 l. 15 s.; I missed eight or nine half-crowns; I had not felt their hands in my pocket; the watchman took me to the watch-house - the prisoners were brought in in about an hour - I had been with two shipmates at Greenwich, but when I came to Fleet-market I had 36 s. in silver - there were some men in the same box with us at the public-house; the prisoners were searched in the watch-house, and eight or nine half-crowns found on them.</p>

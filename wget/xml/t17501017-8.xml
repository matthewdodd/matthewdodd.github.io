            . I am wife to the prosecutor, I miss'd this spoon on the 10th of this instant, the prisoner's husband works with mine, she had been at my house and I miss'd it in about two minutes after she was gone, I know no more.</p>

            . I was in the house, the prisoner ask'd for a few broth in a bason, she had some and eat it with a wooden spoon, I saw her put the bason down and take up the silver spoon that lay near it upon the dresser, this was tuesday was sevennight.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you detect her?</p>
               <p>George. I thought she was going to carry it to Mrs. North. Mrs. North came and made a rout about it, then I said I saw the prisoner take it; when she came again she was asked for it, she denied it; I heard her say she had no money before, and after that I saw her pluck out ten or twelve shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have no witnesses, but I can tell my story very well, I was at Mrs. North's mending her servant's gown, my husband came in, I went to drink a pint of beer with him; they had given me a few broth, and after I had eaten them a few more, I eat them and put the bason down, I laid the wooden spoon down and saw no other; that last witness stood near me, and there were ten or twelve men in the room. I went into the other room and drank part of a full pot of beer before I went out at the door. I want to know why they did not follow me and take it away from me? I had but one shilling and sixpence and some halfpence when I pull'd my money out, as that witness says; I tell the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. North. Did you see this money the other witness talks of?</p>

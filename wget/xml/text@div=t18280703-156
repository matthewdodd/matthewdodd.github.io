On Wednesday, the 18th of June, about ten o'clock in the evening, I was speaking to a woman who was going to Bristol, in the gateway of the Bull inn; the prisoners came up - Bigley knocked me down, and my hat fell off, and one of them took it up; they both ran away - I pursued and caught them: but my hat was gone - they had turned a corner; there was no other person in the gateway, but there was one or two about there - I went next day to Bigley's father, and asked if they would send my hat back, which was all I wanted; the old gentleman said, they were bad chaps - I let it rest till the middle of the day, and then got a warrant; I have never seen my hat since - I had been drinking; but I do not think my hat could have fallen off - I do not think it was a lark.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You went to Bigley's father before you got the warrant? A. Yes; I had not heard that either of them were going to prosecute me for an assault - I walked to the gateway; the woman told me she was going to Bristol - I had part of three or four pints of beer, and had been playing at skittles.</p>

I saw her go out three times, on the 25th July, with something tied in a shawl, and when I went to put the child to bed, I found feathers scattered about the room; I thought she had done it because we had had a few words, but on looking I found the bed had been cut in two places, and sewed up with new thread - almost all the feathers were gone; she came home in about an hour, and I gave her in charge; I have found none of the feathers; she had told me the tick wanted mending.</p>

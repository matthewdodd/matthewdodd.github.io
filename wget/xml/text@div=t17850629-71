               <p>Are you sure it is your's? - Yes, I know this was in the paper in the morning I took five pieces out of the papers, and they were so confused, I could not tell whether there were five or not, I threw them under the counter before I went after them, and when I returned I found only four under the counter, they were only got a little distance when I followed them.</p>
               <p>What is the value of that piece of muslin? - It cost six shillings a yard, there are eight yards of it.</p>

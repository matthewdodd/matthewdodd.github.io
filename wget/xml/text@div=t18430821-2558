                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Young, and live in Old King-street, Deptford, the prisoner lodged with us. On the 30th of July I saw that he had a pair of my husband's shoes on, and asked how be came by them, he made no answer—I asked him again, he gave me no satisfaction—I said he owed me quite enough, without taking them to wear—he called me a wh—he was at work, making a backing-cap—he is a deal porter—he jumped up with a knife in his hand, and stabbed me over my left eye—it bled—I laid hold of the handle of the knife, and got it away from him—he knocked me about afterwards, but still I wish to recommend him to mercy, for the sake of his wife and children—he did not touch my throat—I pointed out the knife to the policeman when he came.</p>

                  </hi>. I examined the prosecutrix's temple—it had an incised wound, a little better than a quarter of an inch long—I cannot tell the depth—it was two days after—it was such a wound as this knife would make—the skin was divided—there was a plaster on it.</p>

My wife ran down stairs, and I gave the knife and things to her. I begged of the prosecutrix to let go of my handkerchief, and she would not: her boy was behind, kicking me. I did not like to hit her, and pushed her against a barrow in the yard—I was obliged to strike her with my first twice in the eye before she would let me go.</p>

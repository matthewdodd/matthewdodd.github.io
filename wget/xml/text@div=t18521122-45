                  </hi>. I am fourteen years old; my mother keeps a public house in Fore-street. On 23rd Oct. the prisoners came together—Thompson called for a pint of beer and a pickwick—he gave me a shilling in payment, which I put in the till and gave him the change—there was no other shilling in the till—they drank their beer, went to the door, remained there about ten minutes, and then came back and had another pint of beer, for which Thompson paid 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they then had a third pint of beer, for which Palmer paid me with a shilling—I had not change, and gave the shilling to my sister to get change—she took it out, and brought back some change—soon after she came in, while the prisoners were still at the bar, Mr. Carter, a neighbour, came in, and said the shilling my sister had brought was a bad one—he had it in his hand, and gave it to me—I put it on the engine, and then went to the till, took out the other shilling, gave it to Mr. Carter, and that turned out to be bad also—there was no other shilling but that in the till; no one had been to the till but myself—one of the prisoners, I believe Palmer, but am not certain which, took the shilling off the beer engine—a constable was sent for, and the pri<lb></lb>soners were given into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Palmer. Q.</hi> Did you take the shilling away to see if you had change before you sent your sister out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I swear the shilling Mr. Carter brought back was the same I had sent out—I know it by a cross on the edge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, in Fore-street, next door to Mrs. Owston's. I remember the little girl coming to me for change on Saturday evening—I gave her two sixpences, and then took the shilling from her—she ran out directly—I looked at the shilling, found it was bad, and followed her directly into Mrs. Owston's, where I saw Edward Owston behind the bar and the prisoners in front—I said, "This is a bad shilling your sister brought me," and the boy said that man (pointing to Palmer) had given it him—when I said it was bad, Palmer said, "Is it?"—I gave the shilling to Edward Owston, and he put it on the beer engine and went to the till—Palmer then took the shilling off the engine, and said to Thompson, "You pay for this"—Owston then brought a shilling out of the till, and said, "Here is another that they gave me; is this good?"—I examined that, and found it was bad also—the boy said his mother was not at home, and a person named Sutton, who lodges in the house, was called down—the shilling taken from the till was then in my hand, and I gave it to Sutton.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 23rd I was called down by the little boy, and saw the prisoners in the house, and the boy said they had been passing two bad shillings—Palmer said, "Master, it is a bad <hi rend="italic">job</hi>; we will pay you, and let us go"—I said I would not—I sent for the police, and gave one in custody to Rowe, and took the other myself—Carter gave me a shilling, which I gave to Rowe—an hour and a half afterwards I found a portion of a shilling, which had been broken, on the ground where Thompson had stood—I gave it to Rowe.</p>

             sworn. - On the 23d of August, as I was passing Solomon's house, in Vinegaryard, I saw a pair of spurs in his window; I asked his wife the price, and she told me four shillings and sixpence, I gave her four shillings and three-pence for them; upon taking them home, I found they were of a better quality than the price I gave for them, and upon finding Mr. Roberts's name, I took them to him, the real worth is about eight and sixpence from the manufacturer.</p>

The prisoner at the bar; I gave him three shillings for them; I knew him, he said he was a spur-maker, he did not tell me where he lived; I am sure he is the man, I have seen him, and had dealings with him for four years past for spurs; I have kept shop myself, twelve months, and I knew him before, where I was shopman.</p>

               <p>Q. I dare say, if Macmanus had not come to your house, you meant to take a walk precisely that way? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Macmanus say, if you did not find the person of whom you bought them, he must take you to prison? - A. No, he said he would give me time for a little while; Mr. Roberts said, go to my shop, perhaps it is one of my men.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you fixed upon the prisoner in Mr. Roberts's shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Roberts. These are my spurs.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You do not mean to swear you had never sold them? - A. No.</p>

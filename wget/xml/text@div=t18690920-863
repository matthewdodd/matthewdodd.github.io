Watson, Doley, Behenna and Spence—we saw him in his own private office—I told him I had come there by the authority of the trade assignee, which authority, had been drawn up by his solicitor—by that authority I was empowered to take possession of all goods, chattels, fixtures, furniture and effect—I told him</p>

               <p>we had reason to believe he had money about him, and that we should have to take it from him by force, if he did not give it up quietly—at first he objected, but at length he allowed Watson to search his pockets—out of his breast pocket he took a pocket<lb></lb>book containing 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes, and from his trowsers pockets, 321<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., in coin, making 92<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. altogether—we took away no papers whatever, but retained possession of the premises, and everything that was there—we left Mr. Behenna, and another person in charge—we found a black leather bug, with several keys in it, and amongst them the key of an iron safe—on the night of 7th February, the premises were broken into by the bankrupt, and nine or ten books and all the loose papers taken away—I have seen them since, as they were produced before the Magistrate—a letter was left on the premises, by the advice of his solicitor, explaining the taking away of the boos—the place was broken open twice by the bankrupt; the first day we were there, and again on 7th February—before this he said that he had no books or papers—I saw him in possession of an iron safe, and a cheffonier—I was at a sale when they were bought in—I think the chiffonier was bought in for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the safe for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was a sale by the bankrupt, a few months before the bankruptcy—I was never indebted to him at all.</p>

I am now carrying on the business of an auctioneer and house agent, in the same premises as those formerly occupied by Edgington—I have known him for nearly three years; and about a year before his bankruptcy I was in his service as clerk—he kept an account at the Birkbeck Deposit Bank—I have seen him fill up the body of the cheques—he ceased to keep an account there when Mrs. Cox began to do so—after this time I have seen him send up blank cheques to Mrs. Cox for her signature, and then they were sent down to him again—I was present in November, 1867, in Cannon Street Road; when the business of the coffee-house was transferred—the price was 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, which Edgington received in notes—he took out of his pocket a roll of notes, and placed the 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with them—he gave gold to the seller instead of notes—I saw amongst the roll of notes two or three for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, and several others were of various amounts—I was present at the Bankruptcy Court, on 17th December, the month afterwards, when the sale of the Barley Mow took place—Edgington acknowledged that he had made over 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said to him, "You have made a good day's work; how much have you made; I suppose about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—he replied, "I have made over 200 <hi rend="italic">quid'</hi>—on 24th December, 1867, I went to 138, Cannon Street Road, to a tobacconist's shop, occupied by Mrs. Cox, and which had been transferred to her by Edgington—I saw there the cheffonier, which had been in Edgington's office three weeks or a month before—he had an iron safe about the same time as the cheffonier—I agree with the last witness as to his statement with regard to our visit to Edgington's premises—I remember Edgington having a number of papers relating to changes of public and other houses, each paper showing the</p>

                  </hi>. I was examined as a witness for the prosecution, it Guildhall and was bound over to appear here—I do not know why I have not been called to-day—I do not know that I induced you to accept any bills—300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in bills was paid to me instead of money as a considera<lb></lb>tion for my going out of the partnership, but I never realized anything—I had paid 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 270<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to go into the partnership, and bills making it up 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe the bills were destroyed—the partnership lasted a very short time—I arranged to go out, and received between 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in bills from you as a consideration for going out, a sort of return for what I had paid, but they never realized anything—I cannot remember what the other bills were for, it is three or four years ago—they were not merely given for my convenience—I am an auctioneer and public-house broker—the broker between the parties generally holds the deposits and transfers—I have known you hold large sums of money which you had to refund at the time of the change—the broker is the stakeholder between the parties—he stops the amount and pays the balance to the vendor—I do net re<lb></lb>member seeing any fraudulent business carried on—the advertising would cost from 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, and I have known you pay 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week would not be out of the way for the average of twelve months—I pay about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year for advertising, independent, of expenses, and the going back-wards and forwards would no about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in addition—I was with Mr.</p>

               <p>Fisher after I left you—I think I sent you five cases of wine at the time you had the Barley Mow—no doubt that was paid for in ready cash, as I have 110 charge against you—I was the auctioneer, and told all the things—the cheffonier and safe were bought in because we had a solicitor's notice that they were not included in the purchase—they were bought in at a very large price, that they should not; be sold—there was a great deal of excitement; you ran about the room saying, "I will bid the most for that cheffonier," and everybody opposed you, and that was how it came to be lucked down, to you at 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I should not have given one third for it, and the wife the same—there was no key to it, and nobody knew the contents—I think it was bought in at 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you in partnership with him at this time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he always kept these things in his possession, because he said there was a legal claim against them—solicitors letters, and a great deal of correspond<lb></lb>ence passed about them—I think the sale was in 1866.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Edgington. Q.</hi> Do you recollect going with me to the office of the Planet Building Society, with reference to James's mortgage? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I paid the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the solicitors of the Planet building society, Bolton &amp; Co.—he, bought the property, and you had to pay his debt—James was the owner, and had borrowed 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the building society, and you bought the property for 475<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—you paid 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. less, as you had paid the Society 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; they would not give up the security till you had done so—the claim was made some time in 1867—the solicitor claimed these two articles on the part of Mr. Boyd's representatives, and I was afraid of selling them in case an action should be brought, and so I bought them in—that claim was never enforced, as I believe the party was drowned—Mr. Broad, the pur<lb></lb>chaser of the Pentonville property, is my brother-in-law—I think we sold it of him jointly, for something between 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I received two or, three sums of you after I separated from you—I remember you hand<lb></lb>ing me a cheque of Mr. Baker's, for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it was dishonoured, and I sent it to Mr. Francis, by whom another cheque was paid to me in lieu of it—I received 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POWELL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you wish to sell the cheffonier? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, having received notice from the solicitors, but we wished to pass it through the sale; many things are passed through a sale, to make the sale look better—it was a nice article in the catalogue—everything which was advertised was passed through the sale—I have no means of verifying the date of the payment of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the building society—the sale of the wine was about July, 1867—I had a sale at Spitalfields at the same time—the amount was about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as far as I recollect—I joined him about August, 1866, and left him in 1887; or it might be in 1866; I do not re-member whether it was a month or two before the new year, or a month or two after—these payments I speak to relate to the period I was with him—the payment for advertisements, during the two months I was with him, averaged from 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the entries for advertisements were put into an expenses-book; I did not say in a <hi rend="italic">cash</hi>-book before the Magistrate, I said, "in a book"—there is a book which would tell the amount paid for adver<lb></lb>tisements—how do I know where it is?—there was a book in which when we paid anything out of our pockets) we put it down, generally at the end of tae day, or the second day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Edgington. Q.</hi> Would it contain anything like a correct account of the business of the office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it would contain the amount paid out for</p>

               <p>advertisements—I do not recollect taking it away with me when I went, or showing it to Mr. Trelevan a month afterwards—I have not got it, and do not know where it is—it is of no use to me; I would give it to you if I had it—I have not seen it for years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BROAD</hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). I received my conveyance from the building society, in September, 1866—that was not till the mortgage was paid off—I have the receipt—I held the property at Pentonville as collateral security—the bills were not met, and it was agreed with Mr. Durrant that the property should be conveyed to me, and I got my conveyance in Sep<lb></lb>tember, 1866.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Examined by Edgington</hi>). When Mr. Broad first took the property, there was, I believe, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. mortgage upon it—I believe that was afterwards paid off; but I was not present—I have not heard of it since; but it would not necessarily come to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I presume Mr. Broad would not receive his conveyance till it was paid off? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am inclined to think there is a mistake in the dates—I know there is a mortgage 'of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the building society, and I know it was paid off—I cannot say when; but I believe it was in 1867—I think Mr. Broad is mistaken in saying it was in 1866—I do not know who it was paid by.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Edgington. Q.</hi> I believe you were acting as my solicitor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have acted so—I received a number of books, and papers after the bankruptcy—they have been produced, from time to time—I never refused to produce them—all the books I have received I have here now, except some blank ones—there were three or four partners in one year, and all the transactions were entered in these books—there were no separate books—I have kept these under lock and key—you never gave me a set of statements, I know nothing about them—you asked me, just before the bankruptcy, if you would be allowed to sell what little property you had, for the expense, and I told you that out of your estate must come the necessary expenses—I told you that from 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was necessary—I do not know what furniture you sold; but you paid me some money—I heard Behenna examined in the Bankruptcy Court; he certainly did not give a clear account there—his evidence was taken down in writing—I told Mr. Commissioner Goulburn that the books and papers had been handed by you to me, as partnership books and papers, and I ought to have the order of the assignee and partner; but that I was willing to deliver them, if the Commissioner made an order, which he declined to do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. STRAIGHT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you known the female prisoner some time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I know nothing to the contrary as to her being a respectable woman—the cheffonier and safe were on the premises of a person named Boyd, who died insolvent at Christmas, 1866, and with no relations in this country—the landlord distrained, and they were purchased at the con<lb></lb>demned price by Edgington and Durrant; but the cheffonier was not sold under the distress, it was reserved; and I retained the key of the safe untill somebody administered—the safe was actually claimed by a solicitor named Ray, acting on the part of the administrator—I gave up the key to him, and have his receipt for it—I do not know whether Edgington sold the safe to Mrs. Cox.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Edgington, in his defence, stated that if he was allowed to put Mrs. Cox into the box, she could prove that the</hi> 92<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. found upon him was not his own money, but hers, which was the reason he did not enter it in his cash account;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186909200073"></xptr>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">that the prosecution was caused by Mr. Broad and Mr. Soddy, in revenge for his giving them in custody; that Mrs. Cox purchased a tobacconist's business, and employed him to manage it for her, which he did, and advised her to open a banking account; and upon his being arrested, the assignees got her locked up, that the should not give evidence for him. He referred to the accounts, and stated that they were substantially correct, and that Mr. Behenna had deliberately perjured himself; that as to being in the possession of money, he often had</hi> 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at a time, and only got 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">commission out of it, and the</hi> 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">which appeared in the accounts instead of</hi> 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">paid to Mr. Francis, must either be a mistake of his or of the accountant.</hi>

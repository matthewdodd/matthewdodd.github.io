On the 12th of October, I was awoke by the watchman between three and four o'clock it was dark, I got up and went down stairs, I saw the watchman standing by a broken window of my shop with his Lanthorn.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it been been broke before you went to bed the night before. - A. No, the shutter was cut at the bottom, either with a knife or chisel; I had shut it up the night before myself, the window was cracked open, so that any body could put their hands in and draw the goods out.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you miss. - A. Ten pair of velveteen corderoy breeches, twelve marsello waistcoats, eight swansdown waistcoats, twelve pair of boys small clothes, two pair of stockings and two women's shoes; I am sure they were there the night before. In the morning I went to Mr. Armstrong.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you see this person. - A. About eleven o'clock he was produced to, me at the office. I had seen the prisoner about five months before, he called in the shop and I sold him a waistcoat; he had the same waistcoat on when he was taken up.</p>
               <p>- WILLIAMS sworn. I am a watchman of Bunhill-row, I got out of my box directly as St. Paul's clock struck four; I beat round past four towards Chiswell-street; at the corner of Chiswell-street, I saw the prisoner come past, I asked the prisoner what he had got there, as he had a bundle under his arm, he made me no answer, he ran away directly, I ran after him and sprang my rattle and cried out stop thief, I told my partner at the corner of Grub-street to stop him, that there was a man with a bundle come down there.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Jones) What is the name of that watchman where the place was broken open. - A. I do not know, he is not here.</p>

               <p>Q. Why did not you have him here. - A. I forgot of it.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Williams) You sprang the rattle and called Stop thief, did you pursue him. - A. Yes, my partner said he did not come up his way; I said he has gone up Campden-court.</p>
               <p>Q. You had missed him then a little while. - A. Yes, for about a minute; we found him on a flight of steps that goes up one pairs of stairs in Campden-court.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him run up. - A. No, my partner being at the end of the next court, we knew that he could not get past, because he stands at the end of that court and I knew he run up Grub-street; when he found he was detected he was coming down the flight of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the bundle. - A. I do not know, we could not find the bundle; we found a pair of shoes at the entry where he was at the top of the flight of steps, where he had been standing, we took him in custody to the watchhouse. I asked him directly I saw him on the stairs, what he had done with the bundle; he replied what, me the bundle, me the bundle; yes, I says, you are the man, I will swear; he said he knew nothing about the shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the shoes there. - A. Yes, I produce them.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Jones) Can you swear to these shoes. - A. Yes, these are two odd shoes; one is lined with leather and the other with linen, the shoes lay within the reach of a man's arm at the window where the hole was.</p>

Yes, I had seen Jones in the morning in Golden-lane he told me that his house had been broke open; about eleven o'clock he was brought by the watchman to the office, the watchman gave the same account about seeing him with the bundle and finding the shoes as he has here, I told the magistrate I heard of a house being broken open in the morning, and with his permission I would take the shoes and shew them to Jones; I went to Jones's house and asked him if he had lost any shoes, he said yes, he had lost two odd shoes, one lined with leather and the other with linen, he said they had been a pair of his wife's mothers, she had bought them, they did not sit her, and she had left them to sell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then produce them to him. - A. I did, and he identified them. I saw the shutter where is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180610290016"></xptr>had been cut out of the groove, and a pane of glass broke.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you apply it to the place where the window shutter had been cut. - A. I did, to the frame of the window where the glass had been broken, it exactly corresponded.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you mean it corresponded. - A. It fitted to where it had been between the wood work and the glass.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you observed the wood work had been cut with that knife. - A. Yes, it exactly fitted the breadth of that knife between the wood work and the glass to raise the glass.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find any part of the knife broken off there. - A. No, I did not. The shutter appeared to have been done with a larger instrument a great deal.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Williams) Was there any body with him at the time you saw him running. - A. There was a person that passed me and tried to shadow my light.</p>
               <p>Q. Not the prisoner. - A. No another, at the time I was looking over the way he passed very slowly and asked me what o'clock it was; at the time the prisoner was passing on the other side. I did not mind what he said to me, I crossed over to the prisoner and followed him.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him throw the bundle away. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been out drinking, and I got intoxicated in liquor and lost my way, and got up this court, and sat on these steps and went to sleep till they came up the court; I heard the noise, and the watchman came up the court, they came and asked me where the bundle was, I told them I did not know what bundle they meant.</p>

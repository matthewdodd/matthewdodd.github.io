                  </hi>. I am a stationer, and live in Percy-street Tottenham Court-road—the prisoner was in my service for about a week before the 6th of December, as errand-boy—I sent him out with goods, and bills with them, with authority to receive the money for them—on the 14th of December, I sent him to Mrs. Peel's, in Woburn-square, with stationery articles, and a bill for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which is here—he never accounted to me for the money—on the 6th of December I sent him to Mr. Dolling's with goods, and a bill for 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he never accounted to me for that—on the 16th of December, I sent him to Blomberg and Co.'s, in St. Paul's Church-yard, with goods, and a bill for 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he did not account to me for that—on the 17th I asked him if he had received the money from Barron, Blomberg and Co.—he said he had not—I questioned him very closely—he still persisted he had not received it—I saw him that evening, in the presence of his father, about ten o'clock—his father and I searched him together—we found in the foot of one of his stockings a five shilling piece and a half-sovereign—he said at first he had lost part of the money, and intended to save up his money till he could pay it to me—he afterwards said he met a boy who was in distress, and gave him some of the money—he had received various sums for me—it was his duty to account to me immediately he returned.</p>

            . I am in the service of Messrs. Russell and Co. of the Bell Inn, Friday-street, and have been so thirteen years. In Michaelmas, 1822, I began to deliver parcels. The Excise Office was in my district, I had a delivery-book and tickets to correspond. The book was to be signed by the person who received the parcels; the amount of carriage and the address was entered - the amount included the carriage and cartage, and is entered in a column in the book. I have a ticket also mentioning the name and the amount of carriage. About March, 1822. I was in the habit of going to the Excise-Office with parcels; the three defendants were employed in the warehouse-keeper's office as porters - when I went to deliver parcels I saw all three of them; on one occasion Wright and Butler asked what I was going to stand? Daffin was present; it was soon after I began to deliver parcels. I told them I got nothing by the parcels, and could not afford to give anything. This conversation passed a dozen times before I consented to do it. They always spoke to me in this way, and generally all three were present. After this conversation I made out a fresh ticket, and destroyed the original one. The tickets I brought to the porters were backed by one of them, with the name of the place it came from. I then took it to Mr. Smart's office, and got the money. The signature in the book was close to the sum charged, and was signed by the porter. I made no alteration in the delivery-book, but I made out a fresh ticket several times, for the purpose of charging more than the original, and more than was stated in the delivery-book; the delivery-book was not altered. Smart paid me the sum on the new ticket. I believe it was in July, 1822, that I first consented to this plan. I continued to do so until the 14th of October last; on that day I took four parcels to the Office, and delivered them to Butler, and told him that from that time I would have nothing more to do with overcharging. He said I need not be afraid of having 1 s. on three which came to 9 s. I went there after that day, and Butler told me, in the presence of the others, that it was found out. He said it was blown, and desired me to take no notice of his knowing anything about it.</p>
               <p>Q. When Smart paid you, what was done with the overplus money - A. I gave them money to drink, or went over the way and ordered drink for them; we divided the rest of the money between us; sometimes I would give them 6 d. out of the overcharge, and at other times a pot of beer; I did not give them exact proportions of the overcharge. The next time I saw Butler was before the end of October; he came to me at the Bell, and wished me not to tell that he knew anything of it; I would not satisfy him - I told him I should do the best for myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Turn to the delivery-book of the 18th of July, 1822. Do you recollect delivering on that day any parcel at the Excise-Office - A. Yes, a parcel is charged here 18 s. 8 d. including cartage; I saw the entry signed by Butler; he signed it when I delivered the parcel. The ticket I took with me that day I destroyed, and made a fresh one. Butler knew I had destroyed it and made a fresh one at the time he signed the book. I believe this to be the ticket (looking at one) it is my writing, but is not dated. I have overcharged 8 d.; I charged it 19 s. 4 d. On the 20th July, 1822, there is an entry signed</p>

            ;" I saw him sign it. The charge in the book is 10 s.; I charged 11 s. 3 d. on the fresh ticket. I accounted to my master for 10 s On the 22d of July I find an entry signed by Butler, charged 16 s. I destroyed that ticket, and charged 16 s. 6 d. on the new one, which money I received from Smart. On the 25th of July there is another entry signed by Butler, charged in the book 2 s.; I made out another ticket for 2 s. 6 d. This was a small parcel, and in these cases the porters do not indorse the back of the tickets. I received 2 s. 6 d. from Smart for it. On the 12th of August there is an entry signed by Butler charged 3 s. 6 d.; I destroyed the ticket, and charged one 4 s.; Smart paid me this sum. On the 17th of August there is an entry signed by Butler, for 2 s.; and another on the same day, signed by him for 1 s. 8 d. I have charged on the new tickets 2 s. 6 d. and 2 s. 9 d. On the 22d of August there is an entry of 2 s.; I charged 2 s. 6 d. On the 23d of September a charge of 11 s. 8 d.; I made out a fresh ticket for 12 s. 2 d.; Butler endorsed it. On the 26th of September there is a parcel charged 19 s. 3 d.; I charged 19 s. 9 d.; Butler endorsed the ticket. On the 3d of October here is an entry signed W. Daffin, charged 2 s.; I have charged 2 s. 6 d. Here is an entry on the same day of 14 s. 3 d. signed by Daffin; I destroyed the original ticket, and charged on the new one 14 s. 9 d. I made out these new tickets in the office, in the presence of the porters; sometimes they were all there, and sometimes not. Butler wished me, on the 14th of October, to make a greater charge than I did; I was going to put the 6 d. on; all the defendants were in the office; Butler said I might as well add 2 s. as 6 d. I said I did not like to go to such an extent. He said I need not be afraid, for if anything happened he would let me know of it. Here is five parcels, signed for by Daffin on the 10th, charged 7 s. 3 d. - 16 s. 9 d.; two for 6 s.; 4 s. 1 d. I charged more for them all; 9 s. for the 6 s. - 17 s. 3 d. for the 16 s. 9 d. I have no ticket for the others. Butler looked over me while I made out these tickets, and Daffin was opening the parcels. Butler indorsed these two tickets. Butler said there should be two tickets made for the two parcels, and I might as well add 2 s. as 6 d. On the 30th of September here is a parcel charged 14 s., signed by Wright; I destroyed the ticket, and charged 14 s. 6 d. on a new one, with his knowledge. I gave the surplus money on the 10th to Daffin, in the presence of all the defendants.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Can you recollect the day when this wicked system commenced - A. It was in July. I never did such a thing before. I did it by their permission. I always carried blank tickets with me, as I sometimes lost my tickets, or had none for porterage or empty boxes, and was obliged to make them out. I never got any printed. Chace, the clerk, knew that I carried blank tickets, and my master also knew it. I got them out of the drawer, which is always open. Chace<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182310220048"></xptr>never knew of my making an overcharge. He knew I had blank tickets to use, if necessary.</p>

               <p>MR. BERNARD. Q. Was it before the last Sessions that you were sent to Bow-street - A. Yes; and after this charge was made, it has not been proceeded in. I used to send the liquor over to the prisoners. Chace always entered the parcels, and made out the delivery tickets. He has seen me take blank tickets.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he know for what purpose you took them - A. He knew I filled one up when I lost one, or one was wanted for porterage. He has seen me take them, and never told me not.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were you discharged from Bow-street, or held to bail - A. Discharged; my master became bail for my appearance on the following Thursday, which I did, and was discharged.</p>

            . I am superintending clerk of the Excise stores. My duty is to pay for all parcels that come from the country. The duty of the defendants was to assist me. When large parcels are brought into the office, they cut them open, to see where they come from. The delivery-book is brought to me. I look at it, and pay the ticket; when very busy, I have asked them to sign the delivery-book. It is not their particular duty. I paid all the tickets produced, according to the amounts charged upon them.</p>

            . I am the second clerk in the Store-keeper's Office of Excise. When Smart is not in the way I officiate for him. On the 22d of September, 1822, I find by this book, that I officiated for him. I find a parcel charged 12 s. 2 d. which came on that day. The ticket was indorsed in the hand-writing of Butler, and is signed in the delivery-book by him, and only charged there 11 s. 8 d. His signature is close to the sum charged.</p>

            . I am in the service of Messrs. Russell and Co. Jones was out of the employ nine months, except for that time he has been there as long as me, which is eight years. Jones was delivering porter when I first went there - the Excise-office is in his district. I make the entries in the delivery-book; he was furnished with a book of the charges. I have seen the several tickets produced - they are not made out by me, but by him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. He left you for about nine months - A. Yes; it was not for any dishonesty that I know of. I never knew of his having a blank ticket; if I had I certainly should have prevented it. I never suffered one to be taken away, and never saw him take one, or I should have hindered him. March, 1822, was the time he came back - he was delivering porter before he left.</p>

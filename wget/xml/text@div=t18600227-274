I am assistant secretary to the asylum at 60, Grace church-street—I have gone carefully through the books of the prisoner; I have them here—I find no entry whatever of the nine guineas, or of the five guineas, which have just been given in evidence—there is an entry of a subscription of one guinea from Mr. Dunlock, September, 1859, paid to Lewis Wood, the collector; but no five guineas, nor nine guineas—there is a book kept with counterfoils of receipts given by the prisoner at the office—I have seen the receipts produced here to day—I have compared them with the proper counterfoils—they do not tally with the books, neither have they come out of them—the number of the receipt given to Captain Dunlock is forty, and the date, 1st February, 1859—the counterfoil is for a different person altogether—the receipt evidently does not come from the book; it is on larger paper—I do not know of any receipt book at the office with paper of this sort—it has been taken from some book that has been in legitimate use at the office at some time, but not at that time—here is the receipt, No. 17, dated 29th November, 1858—that is a receipt of one guinea from J. Lawson—that does not tally with the receipt in the book—both the counterfoils are for subscriptions, not for donations of nine and five guineas, and they are of different sized paper.</p>

                  </hi> I am one of the detective officers of the City of London—I took the prisoner into custody at Castle Eden, in Durham, on 16th February—I told him I was an officer, and should take him into custody for embezzling sums of money belonging to the Seamen's Orphan Asylum—he said, "I am very sorry; I was in hopes that the committee would have looked over it"—I brought him to London, and his portmanteau, in which I found this pocket-book, containing thirteen blank receipts from a book similar to the receipts which have been produced.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's.</hi> I have only this explanation to offer; the blank receipts which Webb has produced were in the pocket-book as he states, but they have been used by me ever since I have been in the office as secretary, in one way or other. In the end of the year we generally fill thirteen of those receipts, and if there was a dozen or more left they were cut off and used by me as occasion required. I used to go down to the asylum; it was frequently the case that persons in the neighbourhood would subscribe if there was a receipt left for them. I used to leave some receipts there with the matron: persons used to come to the office and say, "Now, I can get you two or three subscriptions if you can give me receipts to give to the people."It would not do for me to enter them in the books, because the money was not received till seven or eight days afterwards, so that it would not have corresponded; I entered them when they were actually received, and that accounts for the discrepancy between</p>

               <p>the dates and numbers which has been alluded to. With respect to the five and nine guineas, I can't say how it has been caused, except that for the last three years I have been an invalid, and I frequently made memoranda of what I did with sums of money I had received, and then took the book to my house in the evening and entered them there, and these very likely escaped my observation. I solemnly protest that I never had two books. Those receipts I carried in my pocket-book, and if there had been any moral guilt attached to the circumstance of giving the receipts, as has been alluded to, and not entering them in the cash-book, it would have been much better if they had been included in my balance in the cash-book, for you will see there was a balance against me.</p>

               <p>Were there any such strong leading marks of neglect and abuse of this child, that you can state to the Court? - The child was so neglected, that the bones were through the skin; and there were holes through the skin.</p>
               <p>That was the observation you made, that the child was so thin, that the bones came through the skin? - I had not an opportunity of seeing, it was so still; I took it down stairs that morning: I had it a fortnight and one day; it appeared a little better; but when it had any thing that was nourishing, it was worse.</p>
               <p>Did you consult any medical person upon it? - I took it to Doctor Vaux the first morning; he is here.</p>
               <p>The child died the fifteenth day after you had it? - Yes.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240149"></xptr>How long had this woman had it? - I do not recollect how long; she had it the day before the mother was buried; the first day she had it, she went out at twelve, and did not return till four o'clock; and the child was crying then for victuals; the child's head was very bad; I was obliged to set up with it all night, to get it clean enough to take it into bed; she had never taken it into bed.</p>
               <p>How do you know that? - I have only her own words for it; she laid it in a drawer.</p>
               <p>That was like a cradle? - It was a drawer; it was only three feet and a quarter long; the child could not lay in a drawer after I had it two or three days; I frequently saw it in that drawer; she had no where else to lay it, that her husband would permit her to lay it in.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. You say the first day she had the child, she went out; that was two or three months before the child died? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you know the mother? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you know the disorder of which she died? - No, I do not know either father or mother.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that this infant had the misfortune to be born with a consumptive complaint? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>This woman had no cradle of her own? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Was not this a safe thing, to put it in this drawer? - No, I do not think it was.</p>
               <p>How many children had this woman, herself? - I do not know, Sir; she has three now; and one she has buried.</p>
               <p>This was a nurse child? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many beds had she and her husband, and her children? - Two.</p>
               <p>How often did the father come to see it? - Two or three times in a week.</p>
               <p>I always understood, to the time of its death, he came frequently to see it? - Yes, I believe he did.</p>
               <p>You had opportunities of speaking to him about his child? - I did send him word about it.</p>

               <p>I visited at the house of Mrs. Cass. I had opportunities of seeing this infant child: I have seen it twice in the prisoner's apartments; the first time I saw it, was within about three weeks after she had it; at the time I saw it in her own apartment, it laid on the outside of the sacking of the bed, on an old stuffed pillow-case (what was in it I cannot tell), with a pair of old blue breeches covered over; and I went to it, and it smelt very disagreeable; I told her it wanted nursing; and she said the child was ill, and would not bear nursing: between the next time that I saw it, I have heard her go out, and leave it, frequently, without any person to take care of it, except three times: she has three children now living; she had four, but buried one; the eldest is about nine years; the children were always together; the last time I saw the child in her apartment, it was in a drawer, on the same stuffed pillow-case, and the same covering; I only saw its face; I did not examine it: I saw it afterwards in Mrs. Cass's room; then it was in a most dreadful situation; I helped to clean the child's head, and the cap was eat into the head; I was forced to cut it with the scissars; it was very disagreeable, and quite devoured with vermin: I cleaned and dressed it according to Dr. Vaux's directions.</p>
               <p>Dr. VAUX sworn.</p>
               <p>I attended this child; I think it was the 26th of February; if I am not mistaken, it died within a fortnight. Mrs. Cass brought the child to me, observing it to be in the last stage, as they conceived, of a consumption; and that the child could not hold out many days. I thought the sickly state of the child required some better care and attention than what the woman who had the care of it seemed to extend to it; medical advice was out of the question; I desired her to carry the child to the churchwarden, that he might see the woman, to charge her to take care of it, or put it into the care of some other person; in consequence<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240150"></xptr>of this, a message came to me, to request I would attend the child in Mrs. Cass's care; accordingly I went down to see the child: but the child was in that weak state, and indeed so far gone, that it was quite unnecessary for me to do any thing for it; the child had a bad complaint indeed; I conceived the child to have been born of diseased parents; and as such the child's constitution partook of it; and I have not the least doubt but that was the case.</p>
               <p>Then upon your view of the child, you rather place the death of the child to the constitution with which it was born, than to any thing else.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and live in King-street, Hammersmith. On the 8th of Feb. I fetched a tub of butter from the Castle and Falcon—I left it in my cart in Newgate-street, about eight o'clock in the morning, while I left for about ten minutes—when I returned it was gone—I saw it again in the hands of the officer, and knew it by the direction on it</p>

                  </hi>. I was coming out of Mr. Wbeelton's ware-house, in Bath-street, Newgate-street, on the 8th of Feb., a little after eight o'clock in the morning, and saw Kelly carrying a tub of butter in front of him—he seemed as if he wanted to hide it—Connor was a short distance behind him, looking about him—I followed them down Christopher-court to St. Martin's-le-grand—Kelly then turned to the left, and Connor to the right—I followed Kelly—I turned and saw Connor following me, as though they noticed me—I ran back and changed my coat, took off ray cap, and put a hat on—I then ran to Little Britain, where I saw Connor carrying the tub, and Kelly was with him—they crossed over to the Horse and Groom, and went just inside the passage—I saw a policeman at the cor<lb></lb>ner of Bartholomew-close, and told him—this is the tub.</p>

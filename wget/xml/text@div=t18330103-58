             (Police-serjeant S 17). I took the prisoner on the 20th of November, on another charge - she said her name was Mary Hill, that she had come from Bristol, and had been living at the Saracen's Head and several other places; on Wednesday the prosecutrix came and stated her loss, and identified the prisoner - a man attended before the Magistrate, but he was not detained, as the prosecutor could not identify him - the same man was here yesterday.</p>

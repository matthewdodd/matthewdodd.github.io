He took a large box and some other trifling things - in a short time she returned, and asked if she had not left a box there - I said she had, but the man who took the first box out, had come back and taken it.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 30th of August the prosecutrix gave me information, and from the description I received from Dwelly, I took the prisoner on the 5th of September. I afterwards discovered where a young woman lived who cohabited with the prisoner - I went to her lodging, and there got a duplicate from a box of a gown and pair of stays; I then found three gowns and some other articles, at two other pawnbrokers - I found no duplicates of them, but the young woman pointed out where they were.</p>

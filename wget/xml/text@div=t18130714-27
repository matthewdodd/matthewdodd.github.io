On the 10th of June I sent this gelding with the rest of the horses to Old Ford Marshes. He was missing in the morning. The horse-keeper went for the horses about five o'clock; one horse came home short. I went in search after him directly. I thought he might be in the ditches, but however he was not. About two o'clock I heard there was a horse in Hackney marshes; I went to Hackney marsh. I saw the horse; he had his throat cut.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your horse worth - A. I valued him at five pounds. He was an old horse. I was sure it was my horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner any relation to you - A. No; I have known him for many years; his father and mother are in my employ now.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the general character of the prisoner - A. Why, he has <rs id="t18130714-27-deflabel163" type="occupation">been at sea</rs>

               <p>Q. Who did you send with the horse; was it the prisoner - A. No. The prisoner has not been in my employ lately. His father and mother have been for many years, and are now. He has been to sea away from me some time.</p>
               <p>- GOSLING. I am a servant to Mr. Monk, a horse-boiler. On the 10th of June, the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181307140025"></xptr>offered me a horse; he told me it was in Hackney marsh; he took me to see it. He told me that the horse was dead. He said it was his master's, and he was authorised to sell it by his master's order. He said his master cut the horses throat before he left the horse. When I came to the horse he asked two pound; I bid thirty-five shillings for it. We agreed to the price. I told him I should not pay him until I saw somebody that belonged to the horse. The prisoner proposed going to the Five Bells; he said they knew his master. When we got about half way between the two bridges he jumped into the river. I never saw him again until he was taken.</p>

            . I live at Hackney. On the 10th of June I was in Hackney marsh. I saw the last witness and the prisoner bargaining about the horse. After they had bargained I started with them. Upon going to the Five Bells I saw the horse lay with its throat cut. The prisoner said he cut it. By commission of his master the horse was killed. He said if we went to the Five Bells, Old Ford, we should find every thing satisfactory. In the way he jumped into the river, and swam across. That is all I know.</p>

            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner; I found a knife upon him; he said the knife was his own property. I asked him whether with this knife he had done the deed. He said, no, it was not; he had taken good care of that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. In the morning I was coming from Lea-bridge; a bargeman asked me to go as far as Whitechapel, and tell one of the horse-boilers to come down. I went, as he said he would pay me for it, and when I came back I could not see any bargeman there, and seeing the horse lay in an open place I thought I had as much right to it as he had. I never was in any trouble before.</p>

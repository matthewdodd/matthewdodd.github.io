               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. You could not tell what Green said to the prisoner at all? A. No; I observed them close together myself - I saw it on Green's shoulder - Green was my mattress maker and stuffer - he never was employed to carry out goods - the prisoner was not my foreman - he bore a very good character; and I had a very good character with him from Ludgate-hill, and had great confidence in him.</p>

            . I live at No. 4, Leather-lane - I was at work at Mr. Evans's on the 17th of January, and I saw Green and the prisoner - Woodward went out, and Green opened the door and let him in - Woodward asked Green to take this piece of oil-cloth round to the other house, to Holborn (Mr. Evans has another house in Holborn) - they went backwards into the warehouse, and took it, and then Green put it on his shoulder - Woodward opened the door to let him out.</p>
               <p>MAURICE EVAN EVANS re-examined. I have a shop in Holborn - I had not been moving any oil-cloth from the premises to Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. Would there be anything irregular in Woodward's sending the cloth to the other shop? A. At the time there would, unless we had a customer for it - there was no occasion to take it to the other shop, for this was an overstock which we had no room for at Holborn.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The direction Green took could not be seen by the prisoner? A. No; in going from our door you must go the same way, whether you are going to Holborn or Liquorpond-street - you could turn right into Holborn from Castle-street.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Are you sure his words were, "to the other shop?" A. Yes; that was all that took place.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you known the prisoner a long time? A. Yes; when the prisoner opened the door to let Green out it was done in a moment, and he went back to his work as usual - Green had been at work there, and he came down stairs while Woodward was out - Green walked up stairs, and came down without any direction from Woodward.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been employed at the warehouse in Castle-street in the afternoon - I had occasion to go to the house in Holborn - I was returning and knocked at the door - Green let me in - he said, "I am going round to the other house, shall I leave the candle in the middle of the warehouse?" - I said, "Very well" - I went out - I heard the outer door shut, and unless it is shut in a particular way it will not shut - I went back and stood in the passage, as my employer says, but I never had the property in my hand.</p>

               <p>Court to Barker. When did you lose it? - I think it was Friday. I lost it two or three days before the 5th of November.</p>

Was it the same Friday he came to you? - It was the Friday that Barker came to me the next morning, and said, it is my anvil. I described the man I bought it of; and he knew the man. I gave him 10 s. 6 d. for it. I told him it did not suit me to buy it. He said his landlord was going to seize on him for rent, and that he would rather sell his own property than his landlord should. - This was what he told me, I delivered the anvil up, when I was asked for it. I went in pursuit of the gentleman that I bought the anvil of. I am certain the prisoner is the man. (The anvil deposed to).</p>

               <p>I know nothing farther than apprehending him the next day, about a mile from the prosecutor's house, Brick-lane, Spitalfields, in a public house. Mr. Carter knew him immediately.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He had worked with me about six weeks.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was a work-shed wherein I worked. It was not an house, and as to breaking, there was no such thing, because the padlock was only a sham one, to put off and on, because he was to go in at any hour the same as myself, and when I took that to the man, he said he did not care whether he had it or not; but as I was a little urgent, because I expected to be troubled in the morning afterwards and I told him if he would keep it till the Monday, I would give him half a crown, and would have it again; which I gave him a shilling earnest out of; but I meant to replace it. I was coming down the morning after, for to tell Mr. Barker of it, as he and I were intimate with each other, but I could not come as soon as I could wish; and I was apprehended for the same. I had not any intention of having it from him.</p>
               <p>Court to Barker. Does he mean to say, that he had as much to do in your house as yourself? - He was with me five or six weeks, but the last two or three days he had absconded. He did not work for me; he worked for himself. He was to pay for his working there, but he never gave me but one shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he to pay for working there by the week; or how? - We never made any agreement about that. He gave a shilling, and said as soon as he could get more, he would give me some.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing the day you had lost your anvil, he had come to work, you should not have objected to it. - I should have objected to it, so far as this, that two people cannot work with one tool.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not forbid him. - I had, but he said, he would still give me something. There is another person that works in the shop, besides him and me.</p>

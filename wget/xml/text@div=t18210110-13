            , who live in Whitechapel-road. On Saturday, the 30th of December, the prisoner came in about noon, and enquired the price of gin; he said his name was Swan, of the house of Swan and Son, at Nottingham, and he intended to pay money. We agreed for a puncheon, he desired me to make out the invoice, and he would call again that day and settle for it. About one o'clock on Monday he came, I gave him the invoice, and he presented me with a check for 120 l. 7 s., requesting the difference, which was 54 l. 3 s. 6 d. in change. I suspected it, made an excuse, and asked him where I could send him the change? he said he would call again in two hours for it. I then immediately presented the check at Cox and Biddulph's. In consequence of what I was told, I went to Slaughter and Co., the purported drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what you heard what did you do - A. I got Griffiths, the officer, and had him apprehended. We found him at the counting-house. Mr. Smith interrogated him as to his possession of the check? he gave him the same account as he gave me of it; but after being very closely pressed he said he found it. The check was not out of my sight at the banking-house. I am<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182101100010"></xptr>confident it is the same check as he presented to me. I kept possession of it until I gave it to Mr. Smith.</p>

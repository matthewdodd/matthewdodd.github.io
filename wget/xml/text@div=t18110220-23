               <p>Q. Were you in the shop when the prisoner came into it - A. She asked to look at small quantities of ribbons; she paid about eleven shillings for several short quantities of ribbon, which she bought. The prisoner was brought to me by the young man that served her,

            , into the back shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search her - A. Yes; we took her up stairs in the back room, she was searched.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find upon her - A. I cannot say that any thing was found upon her, she contrived to get into the corner of the room, and in the corner of the room was a chair; I desired the young man to call up a female servant to search her, on his return I desired her to walk into the room. While he was absent I had strong suspicion that she was endeavouring put down the goods that she had about her; as the servant came up stairs I desired her to walk into the middle of the room; I looked down underneath her chair, I there saw a pocket lay.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether that pocket was there when she first came in the room - A. I am not certain, as I did not look. When I saw the pocket lay I took it up, I said, this is sufficient proof, this pocket contains our property. I did not examine the pocket untill 
               <persName id="t18110220-23-person249">Burton</persName>
             the constable came, then I took up the pocket in my hand, and turned the ribbons out. I recognized the principal part to be our property, the contents were seven half pieces of ribbon, amounting to one hundred and twenty-six yards. She disowned the pocket as being hers.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any of these pieces your shop mark - A. One or two my own mark, and the other the mark of the young man we employ, his name is

               <p>Q. Had you seen the ribbons in your shop - A. I cannot say I saw them; I knew the marks.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a woman's pocket, I suppose - A. Yes; she disowned it; she appeared to be working her things about. When she was ordered to walk up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181102200016"></xptr>stairs I heard her break the strings of her pocket, before she was taken up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prime cost of these ribbons - A. About three pound ten shillings; we estimated them at three guineas, the lowest value.</p>
               <p>HENRY MAGG. I was in the shop when the prisoner came in, she asked me if I sold night caps; I told her, yes; she looked at ribbons, and bought ribbons to the value of nine shillings and ten-pence; she clapped a silk handkerchief over the ribbon drawer, which was quite open, that made me suspect her; she gave me two five shilling pieces, I gave her twopence change. I was half over the counter, going to take her to Mr. Steven's; she asked me if I sold narrow ribbon, I told her, yes; she looked out as much as came to one shilling and tenpence, and I gave her the change; then I took her into the back shop. On her going up stairs she had her hand behind her, endeavouring to break the string of her pocket. Mr. Stevens told me to go for a constable, the pocket was found while I was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find there was any ribbon missing out of the drawer - A. I thought there was.</p>
               <p>- BURTON. I produce the property, it has been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Was there any woman of your family in the room before the search - A. No, only myself. There are one or two pieces not marked, these three that are marked that I swear to are worth thirty shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He put private marks upon them ribbons when the constable was in the place.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Is that true - A. Yes; but these three that I swear to had marks before.</p>

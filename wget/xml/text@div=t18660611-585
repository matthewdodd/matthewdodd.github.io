                  </hi>. I am a tailor at 22, Dorey-street, Princes-street, Lambeth—about 20 minutes to 10 on Saturday night, 12th May, I was going along Princes-street—before I came to the Red Cow I noticed five or six men outside, I stepped into the road and passed them—I had no sooner passed than one of them came and said, "Ain't you going to stand a pot to<lb></lb>night, old fellow"—I said, "I have no money for pots"—he said, "Give me a penny then"—I said, "I have no penny"—he went away, and two others came up and stopped me, and said, "You have got the price of some pots"—I said I had not—all this time they were trying to put their hands in my pockets—the prisoner was there—I could swear to him only by his dress and his voice—I can't say I noticed his face—he was the man who came in front of me.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 3, St. James's-place, Upper Fore-street, Lambeth—about a quarter past 10 on Saturday, 10th May, I was coming from the Nag's Head public-house with my husband, and saw the prisoner, with two others, holding Mr. Woolfrey by the hands, and he was like re<lb></lb>sisting, as if he wished to get away—I, thinking he was tipsy, was going away, when I heard a heavy blow—I said, "Good God, what a blow, they have knocked the poor old man down"—they had knocked him down—he was on the ground—they caught him up again by the throat—he was making rather a gurgling noise, as if being strangled—I then heard money fall out of his pocket—I will be on my oath the prisoner is one of the men—he had got hold of the prosecutor—I heard him say he had dropped some<lb></lb>thing—I went up to them, and one who is not here put his hand over to aim a blow at me—not the prisoner—the prosecutor hallooed for assistance—he said he was robbed—he did not say of what.</p>

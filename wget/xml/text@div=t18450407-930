                  </hi>. I am a linen-draper, and live at Pimlico. The pri<lb></lb>soner was my shopman seven or eight months—he left me in Nov. last—Mr. Mills came to me and showed me a piece of velvet—I considered it mine—he brought one yard, and I have another piece here which matches with it—this piece is six yards and a half, and it is marked seven yards and a half—I find this yard matches it exactly—this piece was for sale—I can speak to this yard as being mine—it is the same quality as this larger piece, and it is the same shade of colour.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and live at Willesden; Mead was my carter. On the morning of the 13th of Feb. I delivered him half a load of hay and half a load of straw, to take to Mr. Hoare's stable, in Great York<lb></lb>mews, and about the middle of the day I received a letter.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Earl-street, and am jailor of Marylebone Police-court. On the morning of the 13th of Feb. I was coming along the New-road from Edgeware-road—I saw Mead driving the bone and cart—Allen was walking and talking with him by the side of the cart—I saw the cart stop facing Homer-row, New-road—Mead loosened the ropes—as I passed I heard Mead say to Allen, "Carry it on your back"—I turned my head, and saw Allen take a truss of hay from the load, and go down Homer<lb></lb>row with it—I then met Thompson, and gave him information.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Allen. Q.</hi> Did you see me take it off the cart? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; but I saw it on your shoulder, and you were going from the cart.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant D</hi> 4.) I received informa<lb></lb>tion from Mitchell, and met Allen in the New-road—he had nothing then—I said, "What have you done with the truss of hay? you have taken it to Atkins's, you must go and show me where it is"—he went and pointed it out to me—I asked him to carry it away—he refused—I said, "I shall take you into custody for stealing this"—he said, "I have not stolen it, I was ordered to carry it by Mead"—I asked if he received any money—he said no—I took him to the station—he said Mead was in the habit of leaving hay—I returned, and took Mead at the corner of Stingo-lane—I said I wanted him for stealing a truss of hay—he made no answer, and I took him to the station, and there he said he was allowed to sell it by the coachman and groom of Mr. Hoare, on account of their not being able to give him anything for the delivery—I saw the vacancy of a truss of hay on the cart—this is the truss.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HODSON</hi>. This truss is like my hay, but I would rather not swear to it—here is a remarkable brown vein in it which went round the rick—Mead was not authorized to sell it.</p>

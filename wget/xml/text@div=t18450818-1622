                  </hi>. I know the prisoner, and knew her child—I saw it six weeks previous to its death, in the prisoner's room with her, at No. 8, Almonry, Westminster—it was then a fine healthy baby—I saw it on the 31st of July—I think it was twelve weeks old—it then appeared to be dying—the prisoner was not there then—she is a prostitute—I deli<lb></lb>vered the child into the hands of the nurse at the workhouse that day—I had been to the station, and they sent a policeman with me to the work-house—when the child was healthy I saw it in the prisoner's arms—she appeared very fond of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an unfortunate girl, and live in the next room to the prisoner. I was there before she came—she had lived there about two months—she was confined in the workhouse about a month before she came there—she brought a baby with her—it was a fine baby, and she appeared to be fond of it—I saw it every day until the 31st of July, when it was moved—it began to get very bad after she had been there about three weeks—she took it to the doctor two or three times when it began to get ill—he gave her physic—she gave it some, not all—it got worse—she went to the Westminster Hospital with it—I cannot say how many bottles of medicine she had for it—it was at home in the daytime, shut up in the room while she went out—she sometimes went out between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, and returned sometimes about one or two in the afternoon—she knew I was in the house—sometimes she left her door open—I used to nurse it sometimes—there were other lodgers—they did not nurse it—she would feed the baby when she came home at one or two o'clock, and then go out and leave it—she gave it bread and a little water—she would go out then, and come home between five and six in the evening—I was not always at home when she went out—I sometimes went out at ten or eleven o'clock, and came home at two—the baby was left in the bed in the meantime—when she was not there I used to take it up when it cried and feed it—I have heard it cry for half an hour at a stretch every day almost—it was not a very cross baby—it did not always cry when I went in—I have found the door fastened five or six times when it was crying.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical attendant at St. Margaret's Poor-house. I saw the child on the 31st of July, within half an hour of its being brought to the house—it was in a very emaciated and reduced state—there was no external injury of any consequence—it died on the 6th of Aug.—it had proper nourishment in the workhouse, arrow-root made with water and milk added—it rejected it at first, but subsequently retained some—it vomited at first constantly—I afterwards substituted barley-water and milk, as being lighter—it retained some, but it continued to a certain extent to reject a part of the food during the whole period—it never properly kept the food in the stomach—I examined it after death—I found quite sufficient food in the intestines to promote life, but the system would not act upon it, convert it into proper chyle, or produce suf<lb></lb>ficient nutritious blood—I found some increased vascularity in the lower end of the stomach, and the upper portion of the intestines—I attribute that to the child's having become in a diseased state for some period—its general appearance indicated a disease of considerable standing when the child was first brought in—I did not find a sufficient amount of disease to account for the death—the vascularity showed that there was a constitu<lb></lb>tional disease of some kind or other—from its general appearance, I should say it had laboured under <hi rend="italic">atrophy</hi> for two or three weeks—I expected to find mesenteric disease, but I did not—it had some wrappers on when it came in, sufficient to protect it—there was nothing in its general appear<lb></lb>ance, or in my examination, to enable me to speak positively as to the cause of its being in that condition—if it was from continued disease one would expect to find a sufficient morbid change, and that I consider I did not—I cannot medically assert positively what had produced that state—the want of proper food would account for it, but I could not state it was that which produced it, because there are several diseases that would pro<lb></lb>duce it, mesenteric disease, or disease on the brain, and they are very common to infants.</p>

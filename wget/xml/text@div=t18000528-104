               <p>Q. Were you sober? - A. Very sober; I was in no way disguised in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath were you perfectly sober? - A. I was very sober, to know what I said and did.</p>
               <p>Q. Now which do you mean to stick by; were you a little in liquor, or were you perfectly sober? - A. I was as sober as I am now.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been drinking this morning? - A. Yes; I have had a pint of beer for my breakfast.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner before that night? - A. No; she was with me about five minutes; she was taken to Queen-square Office on the 5th of April; I knew her again in a moment; I am sure she is the person.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you a constable now? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be no longer a constable? - A. I had a disagreement with Mr. Groves, one of the burgesses, and they said I should not be a constable again; the parish was taking my part, and Mr. Groves was against me; I have a parcel of premises in Duck-lane, Westminster, upon lease, and let them out in furnished lodgings.</p>

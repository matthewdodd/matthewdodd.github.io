               <p>Q. How do you know it was his apartment? - A. It was an apartment in my house that I gave him to live in, it is over the shop where the seal was taken from.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the apartment did you find this seal? - A. In his bureau or drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that bureau locked? - A. I believe it was, I was by the officer at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any property besides this seal? - A. No; it is impossible I can tell when I do lose property, I have several shops.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know this seal to be your's? - A. It is made by the same man that makes gold seals for me, it was the same pattern, and he produced it, and acknowledged it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago was this? - A.It might be three weeks or a month ago, I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time he made this acknowledgement, had you said, it would be better for him or worse, if he did not make such acknowledgement? - A. Not that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did not you tell him, in case he satisfied you about this, that you would not prosecute him, but permit him to go to sea? - A. Most assuredly not, nor any body else to my knowledge, his wife begged that he might go to sea, he acknowledged to have taken it, and he was very sorry for it.</p>
               <p>Q. This man is a young man, and has a very young wife? - A. Yes; he has been married, I believe, two or three years.</p>

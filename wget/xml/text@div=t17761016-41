               <p>What were the scales for? - For weighing the quantity of metal, I believe; there was a large quantity of charcoal, a stove and furnace fixed, with two melting pots in it, a quantity of copper, a pair of sheers, this pot (producing it) was on the fire with the pickle in it, but the fire was out; here is another piece of metal found in some part of the room, I cannot justly say what part; a sieve, scissars, a cork, and every thing that can be used in that way (the several articles were produced in court).</p>
               <p>What do you call that metal? - It is to melt down to make counterfeit shillings, they call it cicil; I believe there has been some pieces cut out of it.</p>

               <p>Are these instruments produced proper for the coining of silver? - Certainly so; here is the flasks into which the metal is poured.</p>
               <p>Is aqua fortis used in coining? - Yes; it is used to colour the metal after it is coined.</p>
               <p>What is that in the crucibles? - There has been metal melted in this crucible; (looks at another) that has not been used.</p>
               <p>What is that in it? - It is what they call get; it is laid in the sand when they cast, it feeds the impression; there is a piece of lead laid on the side of that and then impressions are made.</p>

               <p>Whether these crucibles and instruments may not be used to other purposes besides the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177610160062"></xptr> purpose of coining? - Certainly, where melting business is carried on.</p>

               <p>Do you know of a box left there? - I know nothing of Yardley; there was a box left at the bar; a man came and enquired for it, and said it was marked J. Y.; I looked, and it was so marked; I delivered it.</p>

               <p>You kept a public house in Golden-lane? - Yes.</p>

               <p>COURT. How did you know who to deliver it to? - He told me the mark of it.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see Yardley? - No.</p>
               <p>COURT. So a box is left in the bar you don't know by who; it stands in the bar where any body might see it; and you deliver it to any body that mentions the mark of it? - There is nobody admitted into the bar but my wife and myself.</p>

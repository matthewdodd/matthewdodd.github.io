On the night of the 12th of January I was in Castle-lane, Westminster—a few minutes before seven o'clock I saw the prisoner with this lead on his shoulder—I asked him where he was going—he said to take it to his master in Strutton-ground, West-minster—I told him I suspected it was stolen, and he must go with me to the station-house—he dropped the lead on my toes, intending to lame me, and ran away—I ran after him, caught him, and took him—when we were going through York-street he offered me some silver, and said, he would give me that to let him go—he said he was <hi rend="italic">hard up</hi>, and he should get fourteen years for it—on the following morning I went to the pre<lb></lb>mises in Stafford-place, Pimlico—I saw the shed this lead came from, there was another piece of lead rolled up ready for removal, it exactly fitted with the piece the prisoner had, and they covered the roof exactly—here is 561bs. of lead.</p>

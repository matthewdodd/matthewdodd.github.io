               <p>Q. How was it broke open? - A.By a skeleton key; I came into the house at five o'clock, and shut the door after me, the house door has a spring lock; after that I was with my brothers in the parlour; between eight and nine o'clock I heard the door open, I thought it was one of our lodgers, I opened the door to see whether it was or not; I saw the prisoner going off the step of the door with two bundles; I asked him who he pleased to want, and he said he wanted my father, but he had seen my father; I told him he had not seen my father, for my father and mother were both gone out; I asked him what things he had there; he said they were his; I said I am sure they are not, I will follow you; then he went to a public-house, and dropped the basket in the passage, and the other bundle he took with him and went out at the other door; then I came home again and did not see any thing of the man afterwards; I saw the basket and the bundle the next day at Guildhall.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable: On Sunday evening, the 5th of July, I was sent for to the Castle, in Norwith-court, to take charge of the prisoner and these bundles, (produces the bundles and a basket); he said they did not belong to him, he had found them; the basket was lying upon the table; Mrs. Harris came into the room, and she wished the bundles to be opened, the prisoner was present; she said, the things were not her property, but there was a particular gown that she knew to be the property of Mrs. Vaughan; he then said, if the things belonged to the lady, she was very welcome to take them, for they did not belong to him; he said he was rather in a hurry, he would call again presently; I told him, no, he must not go yet, I wanted to speak with him; I observed his left hand go to his left hand pocket, and draw back again; I heard, or thought I heard something fall behind him on the bench where he sat; I then desired him to stand up, because there was something that I wanted, and immediately I found these three skeleton keys, (produces them); upon that I searched him, and found upon him these six small keys, which are common keys, a knife, two screw-drivers, not broke, and this very strong serew-drier, broke (produces them); I said, he had so many tools about him, I should not wonder if he had pistols; he said, no, he had not, but if he had, bl - y end to him if I should not have had it; after I had taken him to the Compter, I went to Mr. Harris's to examine the street door, and the one-pair of stairs room door; the large skelation key opened the street door with great ease, perhaps with mare ease than the right key would; the smaller skeletons would not go into the lock of the one-pair of stairs door, and that door had been forced open, I suspected, at the hinges, because the bolt of the lock was not shoved back; I then compared the broken screw-driver with the bruises upon the door, and found it correspond exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. In the presence of the prisoner, did you hear how the basket came at the public-house? - A. Yes; two or three people said he had left it in the passage, and said he would call for it presently.</p>

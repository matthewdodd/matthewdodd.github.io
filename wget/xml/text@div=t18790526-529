                  </hi>. I am a draper of 47, Ossulton Street, St. Pancras—on 30th April, about 6.30. the prisoner came in and said, "I want a cheap pair of socks"—I showed him some marked 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he put down a florin; I took it up and pitched it farther on the counter for my wife to give change, which she did, and the prisoner left—I saw my wife put it into the till, and having a little suspicion went to take it out, and found three good florins and this bad one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which had a peculiar ring, and I kept it in my pocket—I had noticed the same ring when the prisoner tendered his florin, but being busy did not stop to examine it—the prisoner came again the next evening, about 6.30, and said, "I want a cheap towel"—I said "I have none; can I serve you with anything else?"—he said "No," and left the shop—I walked to the door and saw him cross the road and recross; I followed him to Phoenix Street, where he turned the corner and joined Esther Webster (<hi rend="italic">See next case</hi>)—they went through Clarendon Street into Skevington Street, where the prisoner went into Mr. Williams's, a tobacconist, and Webster crossed the road and stood on the opposite side waiting at a shop window—Wilson was in the shop some time; he came out, but went back and came out again in a minute or so and joined her—I went into Williams's shop and made a communication, and followed the</p>

I don't understand"—I said "You will know when the constable brings the female prisoner back"—when he brought her back the prisoner said, "I do not know her or any one for miles round"—he volunteered that—I said, "I charge him with attempting to pass bad money"—he said, "I cannot under<lb></lb>stand what it is about"—I gave the coin to the inspector.</p>

I am a news agent and tobacconist, of 14, Steb<lb></lb>bington Street—on 1st May, about 6.46 p.m., my wife served the prisoner with some tobacco; he put down a florin, she gave him the change, and he left—my attention was called to the coin, and I found it was bad—I went out and tapped him on his shoulder; two minutes had not elapsed; I said "You are wanted back in the shop"—when I got him back—my wife said, "This is a bad one"—he said "I was not aware of it; I am very sorry"—she said "It is, and you must give me that money and the tobacco back"—he did so, and said he had not done any work for seven weeks, and it was all the change he had got—he took the florin back—I examined the edge of it, and did not approve of the stamp on the edge—it was not marked, and I should not know it again—I did not ring it—M'Rea came in two minutes afterwards and spoke to me, and I went out and came back with a constable—I afterwards identified the prisoner at the station.</p>

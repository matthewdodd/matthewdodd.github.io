            . I am a butcher, and live at Stanmore. The prisoner came to me on the 20th of April, late in the evening, with twelve weather-sheep, he said he was going with them to Smithfield; and one was tired, he asked me, if I would buy it? he seemed to be at a loss to know what price to ask. I asked him, if he would sell them all? he was still at a loss what to ask. I had a suspicion he stole them, I put them into my yard. At first he said, they were his father's, afterwards he said, they were his brother's and his; he said, his father lives at Catridge-green, three miles beyond Chesham. I detained him. The sheep appeared dusty, as if they had come some distance. The prisoner was sent to prison on the 21st; on the 24th

            . I am servant to Mr. Marsh. The sheep were in our ground on the 19th about 5 in the evening, and we missed them the next<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176305180006"></xptr> morning between 9 and 10. I saw the fence was pulled up, and the stakes thrown by, and the sheep had been drove out at the place. I went in search of them cross the country, and found them in Mr. Harcote's grass. I am very positive they are my master's property, they were mark'd with J. M. in pitch on the near side, and a readle mark on their shoulders. The prisoner was then committed, I never saw him till now.</p>

               <p>I was hired to drive the sheep, and was to have half a crown for my trouble, and I was to sell them at 18 s. each if I could.</p>

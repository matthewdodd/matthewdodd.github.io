               <p>Q. On the 26th of July, did you loose a watch - A I believe it was on the 27th in the morning; I saw it about eleven o'clock on the 26th, when I went to bed; I laid it on the table, at the foot of the bed, in the bed-room.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of it - A. I gave five guineas for it, three years ago. At two o'clock in the morning, I was alarmed by my wife, saying that there was somebody in the room; I got up in the bed, and called soldier; I heard a man run out of the room, when I heard that, I got out of bed, and heard a footstep going up stairs; I followed it; he was going up into the garretu; I went into the room where I heard him go into; there I found two men in bed, one of them was the prisoner. I sent for an officer, and one of my children when she went to an officer, she brought in the watch; it was thrown out into the street, and knocked all to pieces. I said to the two soldiers, one of you have been into my room; the other man laid furthest from the window: he said, have you lost anything; I said, I did not know until I get a light. I got a light and missed my watch off the table. The other man said, if have missed any thing, it is the man that you have just drop into the room has taken it. My child brought the watch in not of the street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was I awake or a sleep when you came in the room - A. You were asleep, and snoreing.</p>
               <p>THOMAS TILLEY. I am a soldier. I was billeted at this house on the 26th of July. The prisoner slept in the same room with me.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him go out of the room that night - A. No. I heard him come in the room, the landlord of the house followed him in about a minute afterwards. When the landlord came in, I told him I was awake; if he had been robbed to go and see what he had lost; if he was robbed, it was the left hand man. He went down stairs, got a light, and said, he was robbed. I was there when the watch was brought in by the child, and the officer was sent for.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body else in your room - 
               <persName id="t18140914-83-person828">A. </persName>
            Yes, another soldier. I am confident it was not the other soldier that came in.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18140914-83-person829">Q. </persName>
            Did you observe the prisoner go near the window - A. The window was close to the side of his bed; it was open. I did not observe him go to the window.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. How old was the child that brought in the watch - A. Eleven years; she is not here.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 26th of July, or on the morning of the 27th, the prosecutor came up into my bed-room, he asked whether any man had been out of bed; he was answered by Tilley, no. I said, my partner had been out of bed, he must know it: he asked him if any thing was stolen; the landlord answered, he did not know. I was asleep at the time. The landlord went down to his room; he said, he missed his watch. I was instantly searched, and nothing found upon me. The watch was picked up by the landlord's daughter in the middle of the turnpike-road. Tilley, the soldier, offered me twelve shillings to acknowledge the thiefs, which I would not do. I have no doubt the said person, is actually the person; he must have throwed the watch out of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. to Tilley. Did you offer this man twelve shillings - A. I did, to confess the truth, to let me pass the board, knowing I was at Hammersmith when I should be at Chelsea; seeing the Doctor, I told him, that he was injuring me.</p>

On the 12th of July, at eight o'clock in the evening, I was returning from the City; I was not intoxicated. I went into a public-house in Holborn, for half a pint of beer; the prisoner stood by me - I asked the way to Mary-le-bone-lane; she asked me to treat her, and then she would show me the way - I paid for a glass of rum for her, and changed a sovereign to pay for it, and put the silver in my bag, which she saw me put into my fob - she then went out with me to shew me the way, and took me to a little dark street. I said that was not my way, for I must go along a broad street, and I would not go with her. She said that was the nearest way - I then followed her till she stopped at a door; she opened a room door, and said,</p>
               <p>"Come in, come in;" I said I must go home - she said,</p>
               <p>"Don't be frightened;" took me by the arm, and said,</p>
               <p>"Come in, and I will shew you the way directly." I went, in, and found another woman in the room; she sent her out, and came close to me; I could not understand what she said. She put her hand into my watch pocket, and took my money out; my purse was above my watch; she said,</p>
               <p>"I shall go and shut the door;" went out, and did not return. I got out of the room in about five minutes, and went into the public-house to inquire if they knew her. I am certain of her.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the Tuesday evening after the robbery, Abrahams described the prisoner to me. I went to the room where he said it happened; it is in Bainbridge-street - I found the prisoner in Maynard-street; the prosecutor came up; we took another woman, who he described as having been in the room - she is a common prostitute, her name is Keath - she said she was the woman who was in the room; but that the prisoner was not the person. He insisted that she was.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother—I have no other partner—we carry on business in Noble-street, in the City. The prisoner and her mother were in our employ—on Thursday, the 21st of December last—I delivered to the prisoner several pieces of cloth, for the purpose of having letters worked on the ends of each—among the pieces that I delivered there was one piece that measured 15 yards—I measured the whole of them on the Thursday, and she completed her work on Friday morning, about ten o'clock—I measured a piece that was 15 yards, and missed from it a 1/4 of a yard—it was of a blue colour—I found three of the pieces had been cut—half a yard was cut from one of them—I then went with Herdsfield the officer to the prisoner's mother, and he found, in the prisoner's box, these patterns of waistcoating—these pieces are dupli<lb></lb>cates of the goods we have formerly shipped, and it is possible we may want to refer to them, when merchants want the same sort of goods again—they are tied in bundles, and have a slip of paper put under the twine with the mark of the package on it—the tickets were gone when they were</p>

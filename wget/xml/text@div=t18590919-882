The boy says I was on the bridge when I spoke to him, and the man says I was about twelve or more yards on this side of it, therefore the boy's statement is wrong; and then the girls only swear that I am the man because I had a light waistcoat and cap on. It is very hard to have one's liberty sworn away by two children; they are not fit to take the oath; they can't tell now whether the man had whiskers or not The boy was proved to tell falsehoods repeatedly before the Magistrate. I had never been in the town at all that evening. I have a wife and children; my wife and one of the children are ill, and they have been in great distress since I have been apprehended.</p>

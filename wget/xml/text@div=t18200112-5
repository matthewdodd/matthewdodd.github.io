             delivered to me nineteen Devonshire oxen for sale, on his account. I was responsible for the amount of them. I sold fourteen of them at the market, and delivered the rest to my servant to put in a close by the roadside, at Southall, Middlesex. I marked all the beast sent to me with a large slip over the hip, and a short slip under it. I saw these five marked. One particular bullock I marked myself with a small V - the five were worth from 110 l. to 115 l.

He was driving them up the street, and asked me to lend him a hand to drive them up a little alley, which goes to his shop, which I did; I did not count them - it was a dark night - the beast were very much heated.

            . I am a butcher, and live at Pinner, which I think is about six or seven miles from Southall; the prisoner keeps a butcher's shop at Pinner - he was in a small way of business. On the 9th of December, about twelve o'clock in the morning, he asked me to come to his slaughter-house, which is up an alley, to assist in dressing three oxen. I went directly, and assisted in slaughtering and dressing them - he and his brother helped a little, but not much; he was present. I helped to kill three, and saw no more killed, but there were two heads in the slaughter-house. The beast were in a cool state.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the marks of the salesmen about the neighbourhood - A. Yes; I saw Welch's mark on them. I always work left-handed, by which I know my work from other peoples'. I have seen the five skins found at Lewin's - I know my work is on three of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing done with the meat - A. Two hind-quarters and a fore-quarter were cut up in the prisoner's shop, and another fore-quarter was sold to the master of the work-house, by the prisoner's direction. I helped to load a cart with four fore-quarters and eight hind-quarters, to go to Newgate-market - he said they were to go there. This was on the 11th of December.</p>

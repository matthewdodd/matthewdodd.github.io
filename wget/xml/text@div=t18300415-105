               <p>SAMUEL LAHEE. He never paid me that 4l. 2s.; but on the 18th of February, in his way to Marlborough-street after he was in custody, he paid at my office 24l. 8s., which was from a sale at Montague-street, Portman-square.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I laid out some of the money I received, and paid the balance - what is deficient is my wages, and the men who were employed with me.</p>
               <p>MR. LAHEE. The men came to me for their wages, and I refused to pay them till some articles were accounted for - the goods sold amounted to 28l. 2s. 6d., and I received 24l. 8s.; the prisoner and three others were employed there - I think they were there four or five days, at 4s. a day; I desired him not to pay the men, but I think it very likely he did.</p>

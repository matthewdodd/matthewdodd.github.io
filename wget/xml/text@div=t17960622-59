               <p>Last Friday morning but one, the 17th of this month, Mrs. Evans came to me, I got up immediately; she told me she had been robbed; I went with her to a private house in Fryar's-alley, and searched the house; I went up as far as I could go, and found the prisoner at the top of the stairs, he was standing upon the stairs with a bundle upon his knees; I brought him down stairs, and Mrs. Evans said, that was the man that had lodged with her, and that that was the property that had been taken from her house; after that I saw the property examined, I searched him, and found in his pocket a pair of shoes and buckles, and various articles, and a watch in his breeches pocket; he said, it was not his, it belonged to Harper, and the clothes he was dressed in; he had on a coat, waistcoat, shirt, breeches, and stockings, belonging to Harper, he told me they were his property; Harper was sent for, he was a long while coming, and I took him to the Compter; these are the goods, (producing them).</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. How far is this house from where Harper lodged? - A. About four hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you went to him, he told you immediately that all these things were Harper's? - A. Yes; he readily acknowledged it.</p>
               <p>Harper. This is my watch, I know it by the chain and seals, and maker's name; here is a black kerseymere waistcoat, and a pair of nankeen breeches, three shirts, one coat, a pair of black velveteen breeches, a piece of printed cotton for a gown, a pair of nankeen breeches, one pair of stockings, four muslin neck-handkerchiefs, and two cotton waistcoats; they are all my property.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What should you expect for all these things, if you were to fell them? - A. I should suppose, about six pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. All this property was taken upon the prisoner about four hundred yards from where you lodged? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you receive information that you had been robbed? - A. Half past six in the morning.</p>

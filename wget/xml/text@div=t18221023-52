Our linen is sent into the country to be washed. On the 5th of October, the carrier's boy brought the clean linen - and said he would call in half an hour for the dirty; it was put into a box, which in about half an hour another person called for, and took away. We supposed that he came from the carrier; this was about four o'clock - and about six o'clock the boy came, and we found the trick out.</p>

            . I am a constable. On Sunday, afternoon, the 6th of October, about half-past two o'clock, in consequence of information, I went to a chandler's shop, No. 6, Petticoat-lane, and found the prisoner in the passage, with two large bundles by the side of her, containing the articles stated in the indictment; which Mrs. Cowie afterwards claimed. I asked how she came by them; she said she had a bundle from a gentleman at Temple-bar, to sell for 15 s. for him - and the other was linen she had to wash; but all the things had Mrs. Cowie's initials on them. I understood her to say, she brought it from Mrs. Hall, of Camomile-street. I took her into custody. I turned her handkerchief aside, and saw she had a clean shift on, marked J. C. or C. C. She endeavoured to make her escape - and while I left her in charge of Morris, she bit the mark out of the shift.</p>

            . I am a constable. Sapwell left the prisoner in my charge. I took her into a public house, and while I was attending to the mob, I looked round, and she was biting the linen at her breast; I caught hold of her - she kept pulling at the shift with her teeth, and bit part of it out. I asked why she did that? she said it was nothing to me.</p>

He left me in Petticoat-lane, for three-quarters of an hour - then brought the small bundle, and said he wanted 15 s. for it; a Jewess stood at the door, and asked if I had any thing to sell - I shewed it her. I was stopped, and a constable sent for.</p>

            , said, here is your watch, sir, (pointing to the ground,) I saw the watch on the ground, about a yard or two behind the prisoner; I will not be positive whether it was one yard or two; the prisoner was then on the ground. Mr. Harrowell picked up the watch, and gave it to me. I called watch; two watchmen came up; I gave him in charge. I should mention, I lost a watch, a seal, and key, suspended by a ribbon. When the watch was picked up, there was neither ribbon, seal, nor key; these have never been found.</p>
               <p>Q. On which side of the bridge was it - A. To the best of my belief on the Middlesex side; I cannot positively swear whether I had past the centre of the bridge; the gentleman that found the watch, may be able to speak to that circumstance better than I can.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you running at that time - A. I was not running at the time the assault was made; the gentleman that picked up my watch, was behind me.</p>

            . On Monday evening last, I was passing the Surry side of Westminster-bridge, I saw Mr. Boucher about five or six yards from me. I saw him fall with a man, a little before me; Mr. Boucher was at the top; the man who was under, proved afterwards to be the prisoner. I did not know Mr. Boucher at the time. I heard him say, that the man had robbed him of his watch, or that he had lost his watch, I cannot say which. About two yards to the right from where the man and Mr. Boucher fell, I saw a watch; I said, here is your watch; I picked it up; Mr. Boucher was raising himself up, with the man in his custody; I gave the watch into Mr. Boucher's hands. Mr. Boucher then called the watch, and I walked some distance with him before the watchman came up. I saw him give the watchman charge of the prisoner; the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181505100025"></xptr>watchman took the charge; I then accompanied them to the watchhouse, in Westminster; after hearing the charge given in the watchhouse, I went home.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of of the bridge was this on - A. I believe on Parliament-street side.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there many other people about - A. I suppose there might be fourteen or fifteen, but not very near.</p>

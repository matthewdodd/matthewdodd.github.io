                  </hi>. I produce the order of the Poor Law Commis<lb></lb>sioners of Oct. 1826, constituting the Union of Greenwich—I am por<lb></lb>ter to the Union—on the 26th of Sept. I gave the prisoners admission to the vagrant ward—I admit the inmates at half-past six o'clock, and keep the house open for them till half-past ten o'clock—I think, to the best of my recollection, half-past eight o'clock was the last I admitted that night—when I went my round that night I left all safe—I was in the store-room for the last time at five o'clock—next morning I went my round about five o'clock—I then went to the store-room and found some bags, and clothes, and bonnets strewed about under the window—the upper half of the sash was down—I had closed it the night before—that window looks out into the vagrant yard, and is about a foot higher than I can reach standing upon my toes—a person cannot get into the store-room from the vagrant yard—there are bars to prevent it—the door of the room was fast, and I had the key—a person standing on the cill of the window might reach the bags from the racks, and the bonnets from where they are hung—I went into the vagrant yard and saw no one there—the door of the vagrant yard was shut—I saw the two prisoners together in the privy, and one bag behind Jones on the ground, and the other bag beside Higgins on the seat—the bag on the ground contained clothes and one bonnet, and that on the seat two bonnets—Jones had on a black coat, which had been in the store-room the night before, and he had come in in a frock—in the ward where Jones was locked up I found two black and one blue coat—Higgins had two jackets and two shirts on bis person, and while I went to get assistance these things had been taken off him—I found them down the privy.</p>

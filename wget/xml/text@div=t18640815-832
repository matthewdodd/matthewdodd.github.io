I am a hawker of jewellery, and live at Webber-row, Westminster—I was at the Goat in June, and saw the prisoner there—I heard the last witness speak to him about a half-crown—he is the same man—about ten minutes afterwards I went to the King's Head, which is a quarter of a mile from the Goat—I called for a pint of beer—the prisoner came in, and I saw the landlord serve him—he gave a half-crown, which went over inside the bar—the landlord picked it up, and said that it was bad—the pri<lb></lb>soner said that he was sorry for it, he could not pay for the rum, and they must take it back—the landlord gave him the half-crown, and he left—I saw him in custody three weeks afterwards.</p>

I am barman at the Dover Castle, Westminster-bridge-road—on 9th July, about twenty minutes past 9 in the evening, I saw the prisoner there—he had been there off and on since 5 o'clock—he asked for a pot of porter, which was threepence, and put down a William the Fourth half-crown—I put it in the till where there was no other half-crown; only fourpenny-pieces and sixpence—I scraped the edge of it along the counter—I gave the prisoner the change—the landlord went to the till in about half-an-hour—there was then only one half-crown—no one else had put money in the till—this was my separate till—I went out and found the prisoner in the middle of the road—I said, "You have passed a bad half-crown"—he said, "I will believe you or any other man"—he went back with me and paid with a florin, taking the half-crown back—I had not marked it, because I did not think he had passed it intentionally—he went away with it to the opposite house.</p>

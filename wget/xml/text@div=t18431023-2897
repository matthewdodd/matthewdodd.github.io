                  </hi>. I am a wine-merchant, and live at No. 8, Cross-lane, St. Mary-at-hill, in the City; the prisoner entered my service, as cellerman, on the 1st of May, 1820. On the 2nd of Sept. last I gave him warning, and told him that that day week I should dispense with hit services—I think he said he was sorry for it—on the Saturday, when he came to receive his wages, I told him that his week was up, there was his money, and I wished him health—(the amount of his wages was a guinea)—he said he was sorry for it; he thought that I was peevish, and that I should hare thought no more about it, and then he began crying—I imagine he alluded to having been dismissed from my service—I had not found any fault with him, only that his faculties gave way—when I gave him notice I said, "Your faculties give way, you don't know what you are about"—on the 2nd of Oct. I received this letter signed by the prisoner, but written in another hand.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">Letter read</hi>)—"42, Watling-street, Commercial-road Bast, 2nd Oct, 1843." Addressed, "Thomas Waller, Esq., Cross-lane, St. Mary-at-hill. Sir, Having for the last three weeks made every effort to obtain employment without effect, in consequence of business being in so bad a state, and finding my means are fast exhausting, I am induced to solicit you to recollect me, should you have any extra work, or can in any way make roe useful, or can recom<lb></lb>mend me to any situation the duties of which I can fulfil; and shall feel happy in being employed either in town or country, or reside either in the house or out, as may be required; and shall feel additionally grateful to you for any such favour, and hope you will not think me too troublesome when I take the liberty of waiting on you. <hi rend="smallCaps">THOMAS ROWE."</hi>

WALLER</hi> (<hi rend="italic">continued.</hi>) I rather think the body of this letter is the pri<lb></lb>soner's son's writing—I have had a letter which just resembles it. About nine o'clock on Friday morning, the 6th of Oct., I heard my bell ring—after the door having been answered, Rows came into my room—I said, "What do you want, Rowe?"—he said he bad been trying to get employment from morning till night, but he could not meet with any thing—he said he wished I could give him employment either in town or country—I told him I could not, that he knew nothing about farming—he had wanted to know if I could employ him at my farm—he told me he should be glad, if I heard of any thing—I told him if I heard of any thing I would let him know, but it was not very likely that I should—I said, "I dare say you have got enough to live upon; I understand that you say you have not got the property you had, because you have lent it to your son; therefore, if you are past work now, your son should do something for you"—I believe he said that his son had not had it, but that the greater part of what he had saved had been ex<lb></lb>pended on his sister, who had been suffering from ill-health—I said, "You</p>

               <p>have been living with me seven or eight years, and I have had very little to do for you, and, therefore, as old age is coming upon you, I have nothing to do with that, you might have provided something for yourself"—he said, "Then you don't intend to do anything for me?"—I said, "I have no em<lb></lb>ployment for you"—he then came closer towards me, very close to me, and then presented a pistol and fired at me—there is a railing which rails my desk off—I was inside the railing, and he was outside—I could not see very well what he was about—I saw him fumbling about something—I think he took the pistol out of his pocket—it appeared as if he was pulling something out of paper, or something of that sort, in front of my desk, but I could not sea his hand—he presented the pistol at my left side—I did not think at the time that I was wounded, only the shock—I immediately rang my bell, and called my man, Thomas Lock, who came in—the prisoner stood looking at me after firing the pistol—he made no attempt to escape—when Lock came in, I said, "Rowe has fired at me, lay hold of him"—Lock said, "He has got a loaded pistol in his hand"—I then saw there was a pistol in his hand—I went out of the counting-house towards the kitchen, followed by Lock—the female servant ran down stairs frightened, and went out screaming—when she re<lb></lb>turned I sent Lock for a policeman—the prisoner got out into the warehouse, and was let out at the door—I then proceeded to put on my boots, and found a bullet in one of them, which I took out—at the time I was fired at, the boots were standing on a stool behind me—it appeared as if the bullet had dropped into the boot—it had not gone through the leather—I gave it to the police<lb></lb>man—in consequence of feeling faint, and what my servant said to me, I afterwards examined my person, and found I was bleeding—I sent for a surgeon, who examined me.</p>

               <p>said nothing about it them—he might have said he was very sorry, and hoped I would look over <hi rend="italic">it</hi>, but I do not know whether he was alluding to the cord or not—I never mentioned the cord to him when I gave him warn<lb></lb>ing—when he went away he said he was sorry, he hoped I would look over it, and began to cry—nothing bad happened except about the cord, only I had seen occasionally that he did not know what he was about—he was blundering, mistaking one thing for another—I understood him, by looking over it, to allude to giving him warning.</p>

On Friday, 6th Oct., I heard the door bell ring, and, on answering it, found the prisoner there—he said, "Well, Thomas, how do you do?"—I said, "How do you do, Rowe, I have not seen you for a length of time?"—he said he was very sadly—he asked whether Mr. Waller was within—I said, "Yes, do you wish to see him?"—he said, "Yes, I do"—he asked where he was—I said, "In the counting-house"—I went up to inform my master, admitted the prisoner, and left him with my master—in rather better than five minutes I heard the report of a pistol, and the counting-house bell ring—I went up into the counting-house—I found the prisoner on one side of the railing, and my master on the other, both standing—my master said, "Rowe has fired a pistol at me"—I got between them—the prisoner said, "Stand back, stand back, I intend it! I have lost my situation, I can get no employment, and a man like that, (meaning the prosecutor,) is not fit to live"—I saw a pistol in his hand, and said to Mr. Waller, "Get out of the counting-house, whatever you do, get out, he has got another pistol"—my master then made his way towards the kitchen—I followed him, leaving the prisoner in the counting-house—about twenty minutes, or half an hour after, I accompanied inspector Waller down the Mile-end-road—when we had got through the Mile-end turnpike-gate, we saw the prisoner talking to a female—I pointed him out to Waller, who took him into custody—he said, "Yes, it is all right, I am the person."</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184310230077"></xptr>
               <p>corresponding in position and size with the wound in the back—in addition to that he had received an injury on the left side of his body—it was a bruise and swelling, without any wound—I was very anxious to know, for his safety, what number of bullets there were, and whether there was or not a bullet in his body at the time—I took great pains to examine the clothes, and as I made out, the injury in front was inflicted by a bullet that had gone first of all twice through the under part of his left sleeve, then through the breast of his cost—it had torn his waistcoat, but not gone through the lining, nor through the shirt, or flannel waistcoat—it might then have dropped on the floor—it must have been a violent blow—I should think woollen stuff would stop the progress of the bullet, if the pistol was fired off near the body—the breast of his coat was loose, and was a very thick cloth—I suppose the first bullet wounded his back, and the second was the one that struck him in front—I have heard the evidence—I imagine the wound behind to be caused by his standing sideways, as he must have been from the position of his counting-house—if the pistol was fired probably at the distance of a yard, the one bullet must have struck his back, and he involuntarily must have raised his arm, or something of that kind, and the second have passed twice through his sleeve, and through this hole in the breast of the coat—the position of the wound behind was such as would have been occasioned from the position in which the man stood at the time he was firing—I have no experience in gunshot wounds—I have attended him—he has been in no danger.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wine-cooper, and live at No. 42, Mark-lane. I have known the prisoner between eleven and twelve years—I have been in the habit of seeing him nearly daily—I took a house in Green-street, Mile-end, he had lodged there a number of years, and I took him with it as a fixture—he lived there till I left it—on several occasions I considered him eccentric in his conduct—I have seen him with a pair of pistols and a dagger, years ago—I believe these to be the pistols and dagger, produced—I have known him leave my house at eleven at night to go to hear the nightingale sing, travel all night, and come home at three or four in the morning—he used to leave my house to go to work a little before nine—when he has gone out at eleven and come home at four or five, Mrs. Hunt and myself have often asked him what made him go out at such a ridiculous time, and he has said, "Merely to hear the nightingale sing"—he has done that frequently—he has many times said that he has been as far as ten or fifteen miles—he never went out, to my knowledge, without the pistols—I should say they were loaded—I have not seen him, come home—I have not been up at the time—I cannot say I have heard him come in—I have very frequently been at home when he has come home in the day-time—in one or two instances, of a night, he has had these things in his hand, and gone to bed with them, put them under his pil<lb></lb>low, and alarmed Mrs. Hunt and myself very much—I have known him go to bed in the summer-time at five in the afternoon—he would sometimes lay an hour, then get up again, and go to bed again—I have heard him leave the house early in the morning—he has disturbed me very much—he has been in the habit of going round the garden at two or three in the morning with these loaded pistols—he has always told me he has been to hear the nightin<lb></lb>gale, when he has been rambling about in the night—at times I considered him anything but a sane man—he was very forgetful, and once within these six weeks he has been talking, and left off in the middle of conversation, and be<lb></lb>gan something fresh, quite contrary to what the subject was, quite in an unaccountable manner—when he came and told me that Mr. Waller had dis<lb></lb>charged him, he seemed to be in great agitation—I said, "You have lived a</p>

               <p>number of years with Mr. Waller, he never means to discharge you, you have committed some little wrong, and if that is all (about the cord he had bought) he would never discharge you if you were to go and petition him to let you go back"—he told me about the cord, and cried at the time—he fancied he was discharged on that account—he said he would not believe he was dis<lb></lb>charged—he bad left his situation a week then—he said he believed it was only a week's drill, (as he called it,) to learn him to be better behaved an<lb></lb>other time—I never knew him to be otherwise than kind, peaceable, and humane, the last man, in my thoughts, to be placed in the position he is in now—he always spoke of his master in terms of respect and gratitude—he said he was keeping him when there was really nothing to do—I never herad him speak of Mr. Waller but in the highest terms—his faculties have failed more latterly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live in Green-street, near the London Hospital. I have known the prisoner about twenty years—I have been there twenty-two, and he came to reside next to me two years after—I have known him to be in the habit of carrying pistols and a dagger about with him many years ago—I have seen him with them, and remonstrated with him, on one occasion particularly, the first time I saw them, he wished me to go out to spend the day with him at Edmonton, with some friends, I did not find out he had them till he came home, about nine o'clock in the evening, in the summer, it was hardly dark, I saw him take them out of his breeches pocket, and put them on the chimney-piece—he then put his hand up his sleeve, and pulled out the dirk—I remonstrated with him on the danger that might happen to him in getting over the stiles, or anything of that sort—he said he had them with him all day—I felt astonished—he said he usually carried them for his protection—I have known him go up in the even<lb></lb>ing, and open his back window, which was his bed room, when I might have been in the back garden conversing with some of my neighbours, put his head out, and put questions to us—I have heard him go out at unusual hours in the night—he has been generally out very early in the morning—it was his practice, and I have seen him come home when I had been getting up to attend to my business—I have met him long before he has had occasion to be up—he has been out at four or five o'clock in the morning, home again at six, and took his breakfast, before going to business—he</p>

               <p>has very often put his head out of window with hit cap on, and said, "I will give you a song," and has sung some silly old ditty or another—he has caused a deal of merriment among his neighbours, and those in the gar<lb></lb>dens behind—occasionally he would sing a verse, make some noise on his musical stick, and then sing another verse—I always understood that he lived with Mr. Waller—I have heard him speak of Mr. Waller in very respectful terms, and I always understood that he had got a very good situation, and was comfortable—on one occasion I asked him if he was busy at his hoouse—he said they were yery comfortable, but they did not do much businees; that Mr. Waller had a very large stock of wine, which it was his intention to get rid of gradually, and retire from business—on one occasion I stated, "You would then be out of a situation"—"Why, "he said, "as long as he is in business, I am certain to remain there, and I dare say, if any thing happens, and he retires, he will do something for me"—that seemed to be bis impression, from the answers he gave me—he has not resided next to me for the last seven years, and I have not seen so much of him as I formerly did—he occasionally called on me, but not for the last few months—I considered he was getting more feeble—he was always such an eccentric character, therefore I did not think much of it—occasionally, when I have seen him, I thought he did not seem to carry his age well—he seemed to be breaking—since I have known him he has been a different man—he began to get more foolish—indeed, I used to say of him, "That silly old gentleman, I met him again to-day"—I thought there was a silliness which I did not observe when I first knew him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of the last witness. I remember when the prisoner was living next door, nearly eight years ago, I and my sister were in mourning, and were in the garden at the back of the house——the prisoner looked out of his bed-room window, and fired a pistol in the direction of the opposite houses—we were standing near our own back door, just the length of the garden from where he fired—the gardens join at the bottom—I believe the shot took effect on one of the trees—it shot one of the branches off—that was not in the garden in which I and my sister were, it was opposite to where he was—we were very much startled—he said twice before, "I will have a shot at those two crows," and he laughed very much—there were no crows there, only I and my sister.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Trinity-square, in the liberty of Tower Without. I have directed my attention, to some extent, to the effect of various emotions on the mind, when in a diseased state—I have written a little work on the subject—I have known the prisoner for about twenty-seven years—I have seen but very little of him for twenty years, except meeting him in the street—twenty-seven years ago I lived more in his neighbourhood—we dealt with him when he was in business with his wife—I then knew a good deal of him, and he was a very respectable, quiet man—since that I have only met him, perhaps once a month, in the street—I saw him at his son's about three months ago, and have seen him since he was taken up.</p>

               <p>him by his master that he could do nothing more for him, would be calculated to produce such an effect on his mind and intellect as that he should be inca<lb></lb>pable of distinguishing right from wrong at the moment of his frenzy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe it would act so decidedly, because I have no doubt he is the subject of organic disease—I form that opinion from what I have seen in the progress of this man for the last ten years—he is a totally altered man, and has been progressively altering for the last ten years—I have seen enough of him, in<lb></lb>dependent of this case, to form that judgment—the change has been particu<lb></lb>larly manifest in his bodily health—I have no doubt disease was going on in the vessels of the heart and brain—the imbecility, and foolish acts and blun<lb></lb>ders spoken of by his master, would be the ordinary result of organic disease in the brain, or some of the organs—the decay of some of the organs very commonly happens at his time of life, and that which I have heard to-day is the ordinary evidence of that change—it would be the ordinary result of the change that takes place in the blood-vessels at advanced age, when there is disease, and of which I believe him to be the subject—a swimming in the head, and dizziness about the eyes, would be a marked symptom of such dis<lb></lb>ease, and is exactly what I should expect to find as one of the results of such a process going on—since he has been taken up he has complained to me of a swimming in the head—I never attended him professionally, at least not for many years; but he did complain to me when I visited him, and so sim<lb></lb>ply, and so in harmony with his situation, that I have no doubt of its truth, that he was a subject of giddiness—taking all the circumstances of this case into consideration, his fancying that he was dismissed for buying an absurd quantity of cord, and that the female servant was the cause of his dismissal, I believe that when he fired the pistol at his master he was totally out of self<lb></lb>control.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And that, I presume, without there being any organic disease in the system? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> But that is an organic disease—old age produces organic disease, of which these are the signs.</p>

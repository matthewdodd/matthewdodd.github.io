On the 31st of March, I shut my doors and went to bed, but I was not the last person up - in the middle of the night I was called up by Mr. Jones, who keeps a public-house next door to me; he told me my back premises were all open; they had been shut the night before, and fastened inside with a bar - there were no marks of any violence whatever, but the bars were all undone, and the doors were open - I had about twenty-two pounds in crowns, half-crowns, and shillings, in my counting-house - I had a bitch there which had two pups, one of the pups died, the mother was very ill, but did not die - when I came down the officers were in my yard, and in consequence of what they said I spoke to the prisoner Nigh, who was my head man; he and Summers slept in a room in my yard, and could come down and open the doors without going into the street - I spoke to Nigh, and told him if he would confess I would do all I could to save him; Summers was in the shop at the time, and might have heard that - I afterwards called Summers in, and told him that Nigh had confessed to me; he said it was no such thing, he had nothing to do with it; I told him he had better walk into the parlour, and consider and confess to me - I know nothing more than what they told me.</p>

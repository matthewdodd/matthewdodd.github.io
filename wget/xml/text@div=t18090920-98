             took my wife by the hair and pulled her down on the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your wife here - A. No, I did not think she was of any use here. I took my wife away from her and turned my wife towards the front door to go home they laid on the floor, both one by the side of the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you quite sober - A. Yes and my wife too, I believe the prisoner had drank a little, when the prisoner was eating her bread and cheese, she had the knife with her then, I saw her put it in her pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took your wife away, I suppose you pushed the woman away - A. No, I left her on the ground, my wife and she had been changing a blow or two. When I took my wife away, she came up to me, drew the knife, and put it into my back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her open the knife - A. No, my back was towards her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it make you ill at all - A. Yes, I have not done a stroke of work since, I kept my bed about three weeks. In a day or two afterwards she called upon me to see how I did, she asked me to drink, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her give you the wound - A. No, I know she did it, there were no one besides me, and her, and my wife. When she had hold of my wife's hair, I laid hold of her hand and took it away.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a great deal of trouble to get it away had not you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you hurt her at the time - A. I do not know, I did not stand for that at the time.</p>

               <p>Q. No, your thoughts were to get your wife away - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. This was quite a sudden quarrel between your wife and her - A. Yes, I had no ill-will to her. It arose in the heat of the moment at that time. I did not imagine that she had any ill-will to me; I have drank with her several times afterwards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had no such thing as a knife in my hands; his wife called me a many bad names, and told me to get shaved.</p>

             came to my shop with a wound on the lower part of the back upon the hip, the wound was better than two inches in length, and about half an inch deep.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to be done with some cutting instrument - A. It was such a wound as a knife would occasion. I dressed the wound; he used to come in two or three days to have dressings to dress it himself; I did not consider it a dangerous wound, I did not advise him to keep his bed. He could not work; it would not allow of him stooping; he could not sit down well, he must either stand or lie.</p>

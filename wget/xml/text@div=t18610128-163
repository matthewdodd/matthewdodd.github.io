                  </hi>. I live at 2, Red-lion-street, Wapping, and am apprentice to my father, a lighterman—we work for Willock and Son—on the morning of 19th January, I was on the river in a barge laden with lead, at Fresh Wharf, about two hundred yards from the Tower—about 7 o'clock I heard a noise with the last pig that was lifted on the gunwale—I was in the cabin—I came on deck and saw a boat shoving away—the prisoner was in the boat—there were four pigs of lead in the boat—there was one pig on deck, near the gunwale, on my barge—when I first saw the boat in which the prisoner was, it was about four yards off alongside—I hallooed out for the police directly—I found no police came so I stood on the gunwale of the barge for about two minutes while he was rowing off—I saw him throw the first pig overboard against the stern of the <hi rend="italic">Crocodile</hi> steam-boat—that was while I was standing on the gunwale of the barge—after that I ran through the wharf and took a sculler from Billingsgate, near the Custom House, and rowed after him—he rowed towards over the water, and then he turned back again when he saw me coming, and rowed towards Brewer's Quay, and when we got to him there was none of the lead in the boat—I had lost sight of him from one end of the steam-boat to the other—that was the only time I lost sight of him, when I went round to get the sculler—he was rowing past the steam<lb></lb>boat then—when I overtook him at Brewer's Quay he was going on board a coal barge there to get a sweep of coals, and I told him I was going to give</p>

               <p>him in charge for stealing the lead—he said, "I had made a mistake"—he is the man—I saw him alongside of my employers' barge—afterwards, at the police-station, I was shown by the inspector of the Thames police two pigs of lead that were picked up—it was the same lead that had been in my masters' barge.</p>

RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was it he said when you told him you charged him with stealing some lead? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said I was mistaken—I slept on the barge that night; I was put in charge to watch her—it was laden with a great quantity of lead, nothing else—the weight of a pig is about 1 cwt. some of them run 114lbs.—there was not a soul on board the barge but myself, I was there all night alone; I was in the cabin—there was no bed there; I was not asleep—I was just lying down—I was disturbed by the noise and came up and saw the prisoner in a boat about three or four yards from the barge; he was not so far as six yards—it was not dark, it was just break of day, 7 o'clock—it was a clear morning, quite bright—it was last Saturday week, in the middle of the frost—I cannot tell that the boat was the man's own—it was the first time I ever saw him—I know there are men who go about to sweep barges for which they get the sweepings—I saw him throw one of the pigs into the water—I did not shout to him—I only hallooed out for police—the other pigs were then in the bottom of his boat—the pig went down with a great plash, in the water—it made a great noise—I heard and saw it—I followed the prisoner and never lost sight of him, except from one end of the steamer to the other—I kept turning round as I was rowing—he did not turn to meet me when he saw I was following him—he turned to row into Brewer's Quay, and we went there to him—the sculler that I took was with me—when we got to the boat there were no pigs of lead in it—there were four hundred and forty-three pigs in the barge that night—they were put on board on Friday—I counted them and loaded them; nobody assisted me—I loaded them myself; I took them from a schooner—I do not know whose schooner it was—she has gone away and the people with her.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Thames police-inspector</hi>). On Saturday morning, 19th January, I received charge of the prisoner from the last witness—he was alongside of a coal barge at Brewer's Quay—the charge was mentioned to him, he said he knew nothing at all about it—I conveyed him to the station—I went to the barge on the following Monday afternoon—the barge was then lying at Bagent's, she had delivered her cargo, and it was Iying on the wharf—it was pointed out to me by the last witness—I had previously received some information on the Monday afternoon from a man named Harris, and had at the same time obtained possession of two pigs of lead—I produce one of them to-day—those pigs were, shown to Wardell at the station—the prisoner was not present then—from the spot Harris described to me, to the Tower, is about from a hundred to a hundred and</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

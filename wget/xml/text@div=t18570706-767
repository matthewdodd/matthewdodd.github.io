                  </hi>. I am a detective officer. On 19th June, at 11 o'clock, I was in Cheapside, near the Post Office gates—I saw the prisoner, and on the opposite side from her were two men, about fifteen or twenty yards from her—I saw her speak to a gentleman who was passing along Cheapside—she left him, and went to the two men—they remained in conversation a short time, and the prosecutor came by—the prisoner then left the two men, and spoke to the prosecutor—she walked by his side towards Foster Lane—the men crossed over to the opposite side of Cheapside, and stopped—the prisoner and prosecutor stopped at the corner of Foster Lane, then went along Foster Lane, and the men followed at a distance, re-crossing Cheapside—they turned into Gresham Street, and then they all four went to the corner of Cheapside; the men walked at about twenty or twenty-five yards' distance, sufficiently near to keep the prisoner and prosecutor in sight—at the corner of Wood Street the prisoner placed herself in front of the prosecutor, and remained so not less than half a minute, then turned round in a hurried manner and ran across Cheapside, towards Friday Street, followed by the two men—I spoke to the prosecutor—he was sober, though he had had some drink; he was able to walk and talk—from what he said to me, I went after the prisoner, and found her running along Friday Street as hard as she could—I went after her, stopped her, and told her that I belonged to the police, and I suspected that she had robbed the gentleman she had just left—she said, "I do not know what you mean," and at the same time I saw her hands moving under her mantle—I laid hold of them, and found her left hand clenched—I forced it open, and found in it this foreign bill of exchange for 108<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a Scotch bill for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and an envelope with the prosecutor's name and address in full—she said, "They are only some pieces of paper; the gentleman gave them to me"—the prosecutor came up—I told him what she had said, and he denied, in her presence, that he had given them to her—I took her to the station, and stated that I had seen two men in her company, and she said, "Yes," pointing to two gentlemen who came with me from Friday Street, "and there they are"—they were not the two men whom I had seen—she refused to give her address.</p>

               <p>these poor girls into custody if they persist in troubling gentlemen when they are not wanted—I do not think the prisoner saw me at all—I was in plain clothes—the prosecutor expressed a wish at the station house not to press the charge; he said that he did not wish to appear—I heard the prisoner ask the prosecutor a question as to his wife being at Edinburgh; I recollect the word "Edinburgh" distinctly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a merchant, of No. 21, Harp Lane, Tower Street. The prisoner accosted me on this night close to Wood Street, and walked alongside of me a little way, and then ran off suddenly—Haydon spoke to me—I felt in my pockets, and missed two bills of exchange, also a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, a half crown, and some shillings—I did not give them to the prisoner, nor did I give her my address; I gave her nothing.</p>

Q.</hi> Did not you give her your address? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not remember doing so—I am married; I have no children—my wife was not in Edinburgh at that time—I do not remember saying that my wife was in Edinburgh, and asking her to come and see me—I was not quite sober; I had been out with some friends, and had been drinking a little, but not freely; I knew what I was about—I was not aware that anything had gone out of my pocket till Haydon came up to me—I said at the station house that I would rather not appear—one shilling was left in my waistcoat pocket—I do not recollect any hand going to my pocket—I will swear that I did not give the prisoner the envelope, and speak to her about my address.</p>

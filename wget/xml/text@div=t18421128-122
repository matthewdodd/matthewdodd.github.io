                  </hi>. I am shopman to the prosecutors, who live in the Edge ware-road. Between six and eight o'clock in the evening of the 8th of Nov., I was serving the prisoner with various articles—among them some gloves and net—I showed her some similar to these—she objected to them, and I showed her some others—I saw a pair similar to those I had shown her under her cloak—I then narrowly watched her, and saw her take a pair of mits from the counter, and put them in her bosom—I said the articles she had bought came to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11½<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she said she had only a sovereign, but she lived only over the way, she would go and fetch the remainder—I gave information, and when she was going to leave the shop, Mr. Hunt stopped her—she was taken to the end of the shop, and Mr. Hunt bad some con<lb></lb>versation with her—she denied having anything in her possession—I said I was confident she had taken a pair of mits, and then she produced them—she afterwards produced these gloves and net.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Waghall, brickmaker, at Ewell. On the 30th of May I brought a mare to Smithfield to sell. I saw the prisoner and another person at the corner of a street by Smithfield Bars. The prisoner crossed the road; his companion followed him. The prisoner asked the price of the mare. I said 5 l. He offered 3 l. I refused it. He then asked if I would take 3 l. 10 s. I refused. He left me, and in about twenty minutes I saw him down on the pavement, near Charterhouse-lane. His companion left him, and came and asked me to move the mare down there, which I did. The prisoner asked me to move her up and down, which I did. He then offered four sovereigns, which I refused. The prisoner then said,</p>
               <p>"Come, young man I will treat you with a pint of porter for showing us the mare." We went to the Red Cow, public-house, in the lane. I had a pot of porter, which the prisoner paid for, and while we were drinking it, his companion said, if I would take 5 s. out of the five sovereigns, they would take the mare. I consented. The prisoner said we must have the bridle, cloth and saddle into the bargain, which I refused, but said I would buy him a new halter, or give him 1 s. to buy one. I went into the market, leaving them in conversation. I returned with a halter; the prisoner took it out of my hand, and put it on the mare: His companion gave me five sovereigns. I gave him 5 s. He told his companion to take her to the Ram and give her a feed; he asked for my master's address, which I gave him; he asked how far I had to go. I said fourteen miles; he said I had better go by the coach immediately, as I could go for 1 s. I then suspected the money was not good; I rung it, and told him I thought it was bad. He assured me it was good. I came down into the market, and went into a shop and shewed it to a gentleman, who said it was counterfeit. I never lost sight of it. I came out, and got Hull's assistance; he went with me to Stainton. I shewed them the five sovereigns. We went and found the prisoner in the market. Stainton told him he was concerned in passing bad sovereigns; he said he had nothing to do with it. Two more were found on him at the Compter, with my master's address in his pocket-book.</p>

            . I am an officer. I attended in Smithfield on the 30th of May, and went with Pearce in search of the prisoner, and found him. I took him to the Compter. On searching his right-hand pocket, I found five good shillings and a few halfpence. He pulled a small bag out of his left-hand pocket, containing two bad sovereigns, which I marked in his presence.</p>

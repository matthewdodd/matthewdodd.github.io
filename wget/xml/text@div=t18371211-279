                  </hi>. I live in Union-street, Hoxton. About half-past four o'clock in the afternoon of the 6th of December I was walking along and met the prisoner—she accosted me with some black lead pencils, and asked me to buy some, and kept following me on to the place where she robbed me—she told me a piteous tale, and followed me on—I lost her about Little Britain—she came to me again opposite a friend's, where I was robbed, down by Coppice-row—I had 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., among which was three half-crowns, in my waistcoat pocket—I was induced to pull out my money to give her a trifle—I took out the whole of the money—I had not put it into my pocket again a moment before she put her hand into my pocket and took out two half-crowns, and ran down a court—I followed her and took her hand, brought her back into Exmouth-street, and gave her in charge of a policeman—she was taken to the station and searched by a female—I said I heard the money chink, and the officer went into the court and found the two half-crowns.</p>

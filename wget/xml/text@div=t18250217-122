            , by the prisoner - I knocked at his door twice - somebody inside said, "Father, there is a knock:" the prisoner then unlocked and opened the door - I went in, and told him I had called for the rent due to Mr. Mason, his landlord. I read him my warrant - he said, "Oh! I have got no money now" - I said if he would go and get it I would wait a little. - He said, "Oh! No, I shan't go out after it;" I said if he would, it would save the expences: he said he should not. I said if he did not I must distrain. I walked to the back of the room, put my hand on a work bench, and said, "I seize and distrain on this for, and towards 2 l. 10 s. due to Mr. Mason, your landlord, for rent - he then walked deliberately from the door towards me, and came up right behind me; I thought he was going to put his coat on to go out for the money, but as I put my hand in my pocket to take out my inventory he came behind me, took hold of my collar behind, kicked my feet up under me, seized an axe off the bench, and began chopping at my legs, and as I was down he continued chopping - I kept the blows off as well as I could, but finding I could not keep them off, I said, "Well, let me get up, and go out" - he said he would be d - d if he would, for I should never go out of the room again alive; he struck at my head with the blunt end of the axe - I caught the blow on my arm, and in struggling he thought that my hat saved the blows, and said, "That d - d hat is in the way:" he made a kick to kick my hat off, and in so doing lowered his body, which enabled me to catch hold of the handle of the axe; I got up - we struggled: my man came in, and one Munroe followed him, and we three, as well as we could, got him half way down stairs. The constable came, and we got the axe from him. My legs are cut in two or three places; it was done when he first began to chop at me, not in the struggle: if it had not been for my own activity I must have been cut in pieces. Mr. Dodd, a surgeon, attended me ever since; my leg is chopped direct across the shin bone. As I walked to the surgeon small bits of the bone worked out with the blood, through my stocking. There is only one wound on the bone - the other is lower down. I never touched him till he threw me down. There was no other goods there to seize.</p>

            . I am the watch-house keeper. The prisoner was brought to me. I asked why he had committed himself so as to cut the man's legs in that manner, and said he might have taken his life - he said, "D - n his life - his life is nothing to me," and he would do it again to any man who attempted to take his tools.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170058"></xptr>The prisoner, who had conducted himself in a very incoherent manner during the examination of the witnesses, upon being called upon for his defence, stated that he understood it was illegal to distrain tools, and entered into a very singular and unconnected statement, of his having received the Holy Spirit on the 23d of December, 1813, which came from Heaven as a flame of fire, entered his mouth, and burnt his stomach - that it prevented his working, and compelled him to preach and pray continually - that this happened when he was confined at Warburton's mad-house.</p>
               <p>RICHARD SKINNER re-examined. I have known the prisoner five years: he lives next door to me - I always considered him to be in an unsound state of mind. Four or five years ago he came and asked if I would let him go up stairs, for there was somebody talking to him through our wall - my wife went up with him. He opened the cupboard door, and said there was something very bad going on, for there was always an evil spirit talking to him through the wall. I have heard him, through the wall, on Sundays preaching to himself; he has come into the yard, and said he was like our Saviour, and had fasted forty days and nights. He used to hold up a gingerbread twist in his hand, and say so. I always observed the same state of conduct; he has a wife and child, and is a very industrious man; he was called Bogie by the neighbours. I believe him to be insane. I have heard that he was confined in a mad-house. I saw his wife a day or two after he was taken; she said she had not been to him; they do not live together.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Ehlers, of 14, Ship<lb></lb>alley, a seaman—on 5th May, about half-past 3 o'clock, I went to Limehouse police-station to make an application, and met the prisoner and three women—he took me to a public-house, gave me a glass of beer, and put something in it which made me blind and crazed in my head—I had not been drinking before that—I never touch drink—the prisoner then told me to come with him and his wife, he said, "Come to the omnibus"—he talked to me about the case before the Magistrate that day—his face was scratched, and he told me the name of the woman who did it—I said, "I have only just taken a glass of beer, and I feel as if I should go crazed"—I said that I would go home—he said, "Never mind, we will see you home"—we all went to a coffee-house, and he asked me if I would have some gin, but I would not—we left that house, and he said, "Give me your cape and your bonnet"—I said, "No, I shall not"—he said, "Never mind, if this woman comes who has been before the Magistrate she will pull your bonnet to pieces," and he took off my bonnet, shawl, and cloak—I went down the street where he lives—he went into a third public-house—I followed him, and two or three women—he had a pot of beer there—he then had my bonnet, shawl, and cloak on his arm—he ran away with them, and I asked his wife for them—he also tore my frock to pieces in trying to get my watch and chain from me—a little boy told me that he had gone down a passage—I went there, and met him—he took hold of me, and took ray watch and chain—I saw him take them—I did not see him again till the policeman took him half an hour afterwards, and took my cloak from him—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), but the watch and chain were not found.</p>

I am a seaman of 6, Johanna-place, Limehouse—on 5th May, between 2 and 3 o'clock, I was walking by Limehouse Church, and saw the prosecutrix coming across the street, having words with another woman—I stopped at the corner to see what might happen—she went to. wards the prisoner, who had got her cloak, bonnet, and basket in his hand—four or five women crossed towards them, and the prisoner and pro<lb></lb>secutrix</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

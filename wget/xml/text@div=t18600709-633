                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Turner of Tottenham, a gardener—on Saturday, 30th June, I went to the Stratford railway-station—I took a ticket there, put it in my purse, and put the purse in my pocket—there were two half-crowns and a key in it—there are some stairs at the station by which you ascend to the platform—when I went up the stairs the two prisoners came up with me; there were some tipsy men below; the prisoners began talking to me going upstairs about the men—Strange was close to my pocket side; Colley was on the other side of Strange—I felt a drag on my dress while they were close to me, as we were going up the stairs—I went to the waiting-room and left them on the top of the stairs—I felt for my purse to put back some change into it, and it was gone—I then ran back directly, and saw the prisoners down below, against the door—I said to Strange, "You went up stairs with me; I have lost my purse;" she said, "No, I did not; I have not been up any stairs"—the porter then asked Strange if she would mind being searched, and she said, "No"—we then went to the station master's room with both the prisoners—I have since seen the purse; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the key and the half-crowns are in it—the porter brought another purse and asked me if it was mine, and I said, "No"—the prisoners were taken to the station; nothing was found on them, and they were discharged, but on this purse being found, they were taken again.</p>

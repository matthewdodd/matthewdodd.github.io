On the 21st of the last month, betwixt 12 and 1 at night, the prisoner was coming down stairs with a six-leaved India screen of Mr. Moore's, I said, what have you got there? he said, a screen that Mr. Count (my husband) had given him, and he was carrying it up stairs; I said, then carry it up, he did, and set it in the same place it stood before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>S. Count. He used to write for my husband, my husband writes for stationers. After that he was charged with taking a pair of breeches that were missing; he owned he did take them, and sold them near the Seven Dials; I went there and found them; he mentioned his selling the waistcoat at another shop, where Mr. Moore found that.

               <p>I depended she would not appear against me, so I have brought no witnesses, thinking I should<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176310190004"></xptr> be acquitted. Pray, Mrs. Count, what is my character?</p>
               <p>S. Count. He has worked for my husband about six or seven months, he minded his business some little time, he might have earned 30 s. a week, but he latterly neglected his business, and I was afraid he would bring himself to something bad.</p>

            . I am a Constable upon the Keys, about 11 or 12 at noon, I saw the Prisoner lurking about a hogshead of tobacco, at Butolph's wharf ; I watched him, and saw him take some tobacco out of the hogshead: I followed him, and took him; he said it was a very small matter, and hoped I would forgive him; I said I would not, if it was never so little.</p>

            . I am a gangsman. We are for the merchants, and the landwaiters are for the King. We put the goods into the warehouses, and lock them up, and if they don't turn out right we make up the deficiency, and make every thing answerable, as they were when they came in. I have employed the Prisoner daily and hourly, and have intrusted him frequently, I have intrusted him with money, and I never found him to deceive me in any thing, but he was always just and true.</p>

            . (A constable upon the keys) I have known the Prisoner about a year and an half, and know him to be a reputed pilferer . He is one employed by these gangsmen to do what they call sweep for the soot; that is, to work for what they can thieve or steal.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was informed by some lemon porters that there was some tobacco lay under some planks, and so I took it.</p>
               <p>Jury. I desire to know whether Hartley saw him take it out of the hogshead.</p>
               <p>Hartley. I saw him take it out of a hogshead, but I can't tell whose property it is, because there were more merchants than one concerned in that ship. <rs id="t17450911-11-verdict55" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. I keep the White Horse Inn at Lee, in Kent—the prisoner was my barmaid for ten months up to Sunday, 11th December—there was a till in the bar which she had the care of—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—here is a bowl for coppers in it—on 9th December, about 12 o'clock at night, I cleared the till as is my custom, leaving a certain sum in to com<lb></lb>mence with next morning—the prisoner had then gone to bed—I found half-a crown and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. concealed under the bowl for the coppers—I marked them, replaced them, and went to bed—I had had suspicious previously—on Saturday morning, about 11 o'clock, which was the first opportunity I had, I went to the till and missed the marked half-crown and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. only the prisoner and the cook go in and out of the bar-parlour, and occasionally my wife—on the Saturday night the prisoner went to bed at half-past 12—I then cleared the till, leaving 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver and copper—I raised up the copper bowl and found two half-crowns and a florin—in the presence of Brown the policeman, I marked them, replaced them, and went to bed—on Sunday morning the prisoner was down before me—she had the com<lb></lb>mand of the bar and the till—I went to the till about ten o'clock, lifted up the copper bowl and missed the half-crowns and florin—I then sent for Brown, whom I had ready at the door, called the prisoner into the parlour, and said, "There is money missing from the till"—she said, "Money missing from the till?" and looked very much confused—she kept saying so—I told Brown that she was the only person who had access to it, except the cook who lighted the fire, and that the prisoner must have it about her—Brown-said, "Come, pull it out; I am sure you have got it"—she begged of me to let her go—I said, "Let you go, I cannot think of anything of the kind; you will be getting into some other service and serving them the same"—she said, "Pray let me go; if Mr. White will let you go up stairs with me, I will give you the money up and all moneys that I have"—Brown said that she should not go out of his sight—she said that she was not going into the public line again, and begged me to forgive her—I saw Brown take two half-crowns and a florin out of her dress-pocket—she must have dropped it down the side of the bowl, as she could not get it out with the coppers in it—I found it at the side, upright—the bedrooms are all on one floor—the prisoner slept in a square room, down a little passage, in the corner—she went to town on the Saturday by the 10 o'clock train, I think—she came back about 1—she was absent three hours, or three hours and a half.</p>

               <p>Do you mean to say there was a hole that fitted? - Yes; it was where the shutter closed; the impression was not half an inch long.</p>

               <p>Court to Mrs. Wright. Which of you was last up that night? - We both went to bed together; our lodgers were gone to bed; it is a man and his wife; I am positive they were gone to bed, because I was the last person that fastened the street-door, and I know nobody went out afterwards: I desired my husband to shut the window: I did not see him shut it: it was fastened: the pin and the key were within side.</p>
               <p>Is there any bar? - No.</p>

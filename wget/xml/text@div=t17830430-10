               <p>I live in Oxford-street, I know the prisoner; as I was going to my lodging, she asked me to go with her to her lodgings, which accordingly I agreed to, then she asked me to treat her with some Holland's gin, which I did, two or three half quarterns and some porter, there was another companion with her that brought in the liquor, after that happened, I begged to go to bed along with her, which I accordingly did, I paid her what she asked, and the other came in, I stopped, and I agreed to sleep with her all night.</p>
               <p>Court. How much did she ask? - One shilling.</p>
               <p>Who was the other woman? - I do not know her name, I had not been in bed above twenty minutes, before there came a knock at the door, this prisoner at the bar and a man threw me across the bed, and threatened to take my life away if I made any resistance, they laid hold of me, they put their hands in my mouth, which tore my mouth very much, my breeches were on the pillow, I held them as hard as I could, and I halloo'd murder two or three times, but I durst not halloo any more, and nobody came to my assistance, till after they had got off.</p>
               <p>What did they do to you, when they threw you down on the bed? - They robbed me of my watch, and eighteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Who robbed you? - The prisoner at the bar one, and the man I did not know.</p>
               <p>Who took the money from you? - They all helped to aid and assist in taking it.</p>
               <p>What, not the woman that you agreed to sleep with all night? - Yes, she was one.</p>
               <p>Who was the woman that you agreed to sleep with? - I cannot tell her name, she was one of her companions at the bar, I took the constable, and took her the Monday night following, we found her at the opposite door, at the public house, up two pair of stairs, the watchman heard me when I cried out murder, they made their escape backwards, over a wall.</p>
               <p>How did you describe this woman to have her taken? - I knew her very well,</p>
               <p>Why you was with her but a little while? - I was with her an hour or two, I took more particular notice of her than the rest; I had not time to see the man; it was about ten or eleven o'clock, the 22d of March.</p>
               <p>You immediately agreed with the other woman as soon as she came in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Why, she was the woman that brought you the gin? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you go to bed with the other woman? - Yes, about the space of twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>Was you drunk or sober? - Why I was not drunk at all.</p>
               <p>What quantity of gin did you drink? - Only three half quarterns among three.</p>
               <p>So you do not recollect any thing of the other woman, or of the man, nor of their persons? - No, not of the man particularly, because I had not time to see him.</p>
               <p>Court. The woman brought the gin up, as soon as you went to this girl's lodging, that was before you went to bed with her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there a candle in the room all the time? - Yes, there was a candle, but it was put out when they all went out.</p>
               <p>Was there a candle in the room, when you went to bed with the second woman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So you did not know this woman before that night? - No.</p>
               <p>Then this woman came up, and gave you the gin, and drank a part of it, before you went to bed with this woman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do not you recollect her at all, you seem to have been so struck with her, as to quit this woman? - I could not recollect her person at all, the man is a weaver, he is known very well, but they could not find him, he escaped.</p>
               <p>Did you ever find your watch again? - I never made any enquiry after it, for I thought it was all in vain.</p>
               <p>Nor the money, I take it for granted? - No.</p>
               <p>Where had you been before you came home with this woman? - I had been along with two or three of my partners at work<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300027"></xptr> at Somerset house, I was no ways in liquor at all.</p>
               <p>What did the other woman immediately assist upon the others coming in? - Yes, she let them in.</p>

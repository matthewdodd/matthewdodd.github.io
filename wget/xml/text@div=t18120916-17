               <p>JOHN SMITH. I am a servant to Messrs. Bedford and Liddiard. On the 17th of July, between five and six in the afternoon, the prisoner came to our warehouse, she asked for a person of the name of Atkins; no such person lived in the house; she was told, no, there was no such person. She returned. I saw her take the parcel and put it under her cloak; that parcel was in the warehouse. The warehouse is the lower part of the dwelling-house, and under the same roof. I went to the packing-board where it laid, and pursued the prisoner into the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Then finding it was not there, you went after the prisoner immediately, did not you; how far had the prisoner gone from the door before you overtook her - A. About twelve yards. She was walking. I pulled her cloak aside, and told her she had something that she had no business with. She said she had not.</p>
               <p>Q. When you pulled her cloak off one side, did you perceive the parcel - A. I did, under her arm, I stopped her and brought her back, and examined the parcel, it contained three pieces of worked muslin, and one piece of printed cotton.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any cambric besides - A. Yes, one piece of cambric. I took her to the warehouse and called assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. I hope you called louder than you now speak to us; who came - A. The warehouseman. The warehouseman took the things in my sight.

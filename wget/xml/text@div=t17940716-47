               <p>I am an excise officer, I was so on the 11st of February, 1792. On that day between the hours of eleven and twelve in the forenoon, I was going along Old-street and I met a cart, and found John Ekars and William-Brown in the cart, I knew William Brown six years before, I surveyed poplar three years close by his house; I have been in a public house with him twenty different times, the Green Dragon; I knew him very well, the cart drove on as far as the corner of Golden-lane; Ekars got out of the cart, and when he got out of the cart I had an opportunity of passing by to see what was in the cart, I saw several bags, four or five, it seemed to me to be tobacco, and there were five or six half anchors in the cart, when I passed by Ekars gave Brown the whip and said drive on gently, I will go before and see that it is clear, they drove about twenty or thirty doors further in the street, to the door of

            , an entered dealer in tobacco, when he drove up close to the door, Brown unbuttoned the leather on the further side of the cart, Ekar's was in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160075"></xptr>Wisemans shop. I turns round the cart and looks in and see some bags and a large W marked on most of the anchors, he was stooping down tumbling the half anchors towards Wiseman's door; I put my hand into one of the bags, and my hand came out all rappee snuff, this I did while Brown was stooping down, he did not perceive me, and at the same time I secured the rein of the horse and I said to Brown, pray, sir, what have you got in the cart? he immediately looks about at me and said, d-mn your eyes what is that to you? then he took the whip up and first of all he began to slog the horse to get off, it was a very good horse, the horse sprung but I had hold of the rein, and then he began to slog me with the thong of the whip, every stroke brought the skin off; my hat dropped off, I lost my hat, never saw it after, the mob took it away; I told him the consequence of obstructing me in my duty, and I told him what he had got in his cart, and that he had got smuggled goods, I knew him to be a smuggler for a great many years; on my telling him that, he kept on slogging me the more, then the horse, then me, till we got opposite the public house, when the horse sprung very violently against the windows and knocked in four or five panes of glass with the shafts, when he sees that, he turns the butt end of his whip and steps out to the shaft and struck me several times on the head, and gave me one blow which cut me two inches along here; the publican, Nixon, just then came to the door and I begged him to assist me, that I was an officer, and I found the blood come all over me and blinded me, in the contest I got the whip from him into my hand, with my pulling it the covering of the butt end rather slipped, and I saw the lead cast about the end of the whip some inches in length; Mr. Nickson unclinched my hands at last, being afraid I should be killed, and took me into the house, and the horse and cart drove away; Mr. Nickson laid hold of me and laid hold of Ekars, and said, I will be paid for the damage done, before I let any of you go; Ekars said, I will call another time, and pay for the windows, let me go, and he went away over a wall into a back alley.</p>
               <p>Q. The indictment was not preferred till last May? - It was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you made any search after him from the time that you received she injury? - I have a dozen times, both with myself and the runners; the first time we went of a Sunday morning, and we watched about to see if we could see any thing of him, and we went to Brown's house, and the people knew me. In short we never could find him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you confined after this affair? - I was very ill, I could not do my duty for sometime; and there are the clothes I had on, that are nothing but blood all over; and sometimes I am affected now with the change of weather, the bone of my head is hurted as well as the slesh.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. You say you knew Brown long? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore it is not likely you will be mistaken in him? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. And, I think, you never saw him from that time till this last fortnight? - Yes, I saw him going into Mr. Nelson's, in Whitechapel, but I had not the warrant with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him soon after this transaction? - No, not for some time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember when you saw him first after this happened? - In Whitechapel, about half a year afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw him without knowing him of course? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you could not have seen him and been with him, and yet not know him, since that time? - No, I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, in the course of all this business, speak to him by his name? - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160076"></xptr>am not sure; I said, I know you very well, and you will suffer for it.</p>
               <p>Q. You know Ekars, the other man, very well? - Yes, and I knew Brown very well, and knew him tried for the same offence once before.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course, as you surveyed so long where he lived, he knew you? - I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Q. According to your apprehension, did not Brown know you? - I cannot say that. He knows I very near catched him with four or five and thirty bags of tobacco, and he turned about and carried the goods into the country again.</p>
               <p>Q. Though they knew you was an excise officer, yet Ekars said he would go and see that it was all clear before he would take it out? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. This was at twelve o'clock in the day, was there any body there that day? - Yes, a great many.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you have got some of these people here? - I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you never was sitting down drinking with him at any public house? - Never, from that time to this; I have never been in a house with him since the transaction; I went into a house where Ekars sat drinking, but as soon as I went in he went out, but Brown was not there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know one Nuby? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember meeting Nuby on this business? - Yes, at the Duke of Clarence's, Newport-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with him? - One Hughes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no one else? - Nobody that I knew, nobody that had any thing to say about this business.</p>
               <p>Q. Now do you remember saying concerning these people, that you knew one to be Ekars, but the other you could not be sure to? - I never said any such thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. It is unnecessary to ask you whether Brown was in company at that time? - He was not, I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. How you might be quarters they sent for me in order business by a petition.</p>
               <p>Court. Nuby came to you with some propositions on the part of Brown and Ekars? - Yes, and I told him that I could not say any thing to it, the board of Excise had got it in their hands, and whatever they mean to do I was agreeable.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Look at this petition? - This is the first petition of Ekars and Brown. (The petition read.)</p>
               <p>Jury. Was it perfectly understood by Brown that you was an officer of the Excise before any scuftle took place? - I told him at the first that I was an Excise officer, and would shew him my commission, I said that immediately as I laid hold of the horse's head, before any blow was given.</p>

            Did you tell him on whose account you applied? - I applied on Ekars account only; I did not apply for Brown.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. What business of life are you in? - I am a farmer at Poplar.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the neighbourhood in which Brown lives? - Yes, he lives close by me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Brown? - Sixteen or eighteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew him about February 1792? - I have known him ever since; I don't know particularly the time.</p>
               <p>Q. From February 1792, how long was he absent from his home? - I believe I can tell by the account, because his horse grasses with me; I never knew him leave his house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he leave his house about February 1792? - He might be away a week or more; or he might be at home a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he was backward and forward the same as usual from February 1792, to March, April, and May, in the same year? - Clearly so.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where he went in September 1792? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any petition that Brown sent to the commissioners of excise? - Ekars and Brown were together, I told him about being along with Norman; and Ekars said, what can we do? I said, the only thing that you can do, will be to try a petition; you had better have the opinion of your attorney on the business, and I dare say, Norman has no objection to settle it; and I said, that I dare say four or five guineas would make him easy; I said, you had better pay him that then go to law, and into extremities of that sort. They seemed rather to agree, as Norman said he would not be ill natured.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time when you saw Norman at the Duke of Clarence, did Norman and you go into the house together? - <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160080"></xptr>No, I believe I was in before him, and he came in afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you appointed to meet there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came into the house, he and you fell into conversation? - Not immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. How were you engaged before he fell into conversation with you? - We had some rum and water, and he had to go away to some brick fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the other person? - One Hughes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you think Brown was at that time? - Brown was sitting in the tap room at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Norman came into the room where you was, and he did not stay very long? - He staid a good while; Brown came into the parlour and came in at the door, and had a pint of beer; he was desired to withdraw, and he did withdraw.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Norman and he speak? - No, I don't know that they spoke at all.</p>

               <p>Q. Brown did not meet him twice? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. So that you mean merely to speak as to guess, that Norman might see Brown? - Certainly, I cannot swear that he did see him, but he was as plain to him as you are to me.</p>
               <p>Court to Norman. How came Ekars not be taken into custody before he died? - The runners were after him, but we could never take him. When I first went into the public house I went into the parlour, the door was shut fast, and me and another were sitting drinking of a pot of beer. After that Mr. Nuby came in, but Mr. Brown was not there indeed, he might be in she tap room, I did not go through the tap room; but on my oath he was not in the parlour.</p>

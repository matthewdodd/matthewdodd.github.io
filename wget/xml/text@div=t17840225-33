               <p>I went out of my house on Monday afternoon last, about four o'clock, and double locked my parlour door, I left nobody at home, I shut to the street door, which has a spring lock, I am quite sure that the lock of that street door catched, for I heard it catch, there is no other door to the house but the front door, the sashes were all shut and fastened, I returned about seven o'clock in the evening, and met my husband taking the prisoner to Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Mr. Keys, Prisoner's Council. You went out about four? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you any lodgers? - Yes, they went with me.</p>
               <p>How many lodgers have you? - Only one family.</p>
               <p>Did all that family go with you? - Yes, all but the lodger's husband.</p>
               <p>Where was he? - He was out.</p>
               <p>How do you know that? - I am sure of it, he is an excise-man, and goes upon duty at certain hours.</p>
               <p>Court. What room does your lodgers lodge in? - Up one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Were you up in that room shortly before you went out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was he there? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Keys. You did not push against the door to know whether it was locked? - No, I heard it latch.</p>
               <p>That is you heard a noise? - I know the noise of the staple of the door.</p>
               <p>It might be the staple striking against the door? - By frequently shutting the door, I can tell partly when the lock catches.</p>

               <p>Do you often pull that door after you? - Very often.</p>
               <p>Sometimes you have been mistaken? - No, Sir, never to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Have the lodgers of the house a key to the street door? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I was coming down Chamber's-street, and just as I got to Mr. Gameson's door, I heard him cry out several times, thieves! thieves! the prisoner came out of the door, and I followed him, and a man stopped him, and he fell down.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner come out of the door? - Yes, I did, another person came out with this man, and Mr. Gameson run after him, it was all in a moment's time, I followed this man, he was never out of my sight.</p>
               <p>Mr. Keys. When Mr. Gameson called out thieves you was walking along? - I was just going to cross, the first thing I saw was the prosecutor at the door, I did not take any notice at all; next I saw a man come out in a light coat, and the other came out in a half a minute's time.</p>

            . The prisoner was my servant. On the 20th of September, I went to Spitalfields to buy my goods, as I used to do. I bought the goods there. When I came back to my door, it was locked, with the key outside of the door. I had left the door open, and the prisoner in my house. She was gone when I went in; the first thing that I missed was a light linen gown, that I had left in the arm chair; the next thing was my bed curtains.</p>
               <p>COURT. That is not in the indictment - A. The other articles I had them set down, because I have a very bad head piece; the articles are here present. I missed shoes, petticoat, a silk handkerchief, a silk skirt, two gowns, a white cambrie skirt, besides a dimity petticoat, a shawl, a pair of white stockings, two pounds in money, and two one-pound notes each, that was in the same drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these notes marked - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know them if you were to see them again - A. I think I should. I found one upon her, under one of her arms, and the other she said, she had changed; she acknowledged that. I found the prisoner at the top of the Minories, about twenty minutes after nine. I went out at half past six, and returned about half past eight. When I took her I came by Bishopsgate Church, it was twenty minutes after nine; I found her at the top of the Minories,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181410260024"></xptr>and I found every article upon her, except one gown, petticoat, and stockings, which she had pawned for ten shillings; a flannel petticoat she had on when I took her, and my shawl, also I found a one-pound note under one of her arms, and sixteen shillings under the other. She said, she had changed one of the one-pound notes, and had the sixteen shillings about her; she had four shillings out of it. The prisoner was very much in liquor when I took her. I called her up at six o'clock; she slept in my apartment. She got drunk after she robbed me I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the two one-pound notes in the same place - A. Yes; in a little box, in the middle drawer, in the room that I slept in. It was all the money that I had in the world, and there was a sheet and one blanket, she tore in half.</p>

               <p>COURT. I cannot enquire into those things that are not in the indictment? What did the prisoner say - A. At the top of the Minories I saw the prisoner; I took hold of her by the shoulder; I said, you hussey, I have got you; she said, I will come along with you, do not hurt me. My husband came up, and he took her to Worship-street office. Mr. Armstrong searched her. I was not satisfied, and when I found the one-pound note, I took her into a room by herself. Armstrong only found the wearing apparel. I searched her; by taking her clothes off. Armstrong searched her as far as decency with propriety would admit them. I found under her arm pit, the one-pound note, and then she owned to taking the other, and having the change of it, and said she had spent four shillings; and she had sixteen shillings left.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you find any note under my arm - A. Yes, next to your skin, and found sixteen shillings under your other arm, wrapped up in a handkerchief of mine.</p>
               <p>COURT. Where did you find the duplicate - A. The officer found that in her pocket; a duplicate of a gown, stockings, and petticoat; pledged for ten shillings.</p>

            . The prisoner was brought to the office by the prosecutor, and his wife, on the 20th of September; I searched her, and in her pocket I found seven shillings in silver, and seven shillings and seven pence halfpenny in copper; I then desired the prosecutorix to search her, more narrowly, and she found that money on her.</p>
               <p>Q, Did you see her searched - A. No; I was in another room; she gave it me immediately she found it. I produce the duplicate of the gown, petticoat, and stockings, I found on the prisoner; the things are here; these are them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. These things are all mine; a pair of shoes, petticoat, shirt, and a gown, in the handkerchief; it was found in her bundle; I had it in my house before she went away.</p>
               <p>Q, What is the value of that - A. two shillings a silk petticoat nine shillings a silk skirt, five shillings, the black cotton gown, five shillings, a cambrick petticoat, two shillings; they are all mine.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had a long fit of illness; I was eight months in Bartholomew Hospital; I stated to the prosecutrix that I was very much embarressed; she said, she would do the utmost in her power for me, and then she put me off till the next morning; I was very much hurt in mind. I ask for mercy of the court.</p>

The prisoner Moor is brother to my man-cook; he returned from sea about four months since, and has been in the habit of coming to my house to see his brother. He had heard me say, that I had lost some spoons. I had information that some of my things were found in a room occupied by the prisoner Wells, in Harford-place, Drury-lane. I got a search-warrant, and was accompanied by Hutt, the officer, to the room; we found six knives and two forks, and several duplicates, some of which belonged to my property. I asked the prisonor Wells, if she had received my table-cloths from the prisoner Moore; she acknowledged that she had, and said, she had pledged one of them in Holborn, and the other in Drury-lane. I went to a pawnbroker, and saw one of my table-cloths. Hutt took the prisoner Moor into custody, searched him and found a duplicate of a silver tea-spoon in his possession.</p>

            . I am an officer. I accompanied Mrs. Knott to the apartment of the prisoner Wells. I told her I had a search-warrant; she said, she had no objection to it. I found six knives and two forks, which she said, were her property, and that they were brought by a person of the name of Moore, who made her a present of them. I asked her if she had bought any table-cloths of him; she said he had brought two for her to pawn for him, which she had done, and had given him the money. She went very willingly to shew where she had pawned them. One of the pawnbrokers had not got any; the next had one. I secured her, and went down to the prosecutor's, and took the other prisoner. As I was taking him along, he made an attempt to take something out of his pocket; I found he had got a duplicate of a spoon. I asked him how he came by it; he said it was thrown out in the street. He afterwards confessed that he had taken the things, and had taken them to the prisoner Wells.</p>

               <p>What woman was it that came up to you? - I do not know; she was a stranger to me; I went with her to the house of

            , to look at the waistcoat; immedidiately after I got into Doyle's house, the black woman (the prisoner) and another woman rushed in and threw me down and almost throttled me; they rent my breeches, and the black woman took a guinea, eight half crowns, and three shilling and sixpence out of my pocket; when they had robbed me they all ran out of the room, and I ran after them. I can only swear to the black woman. They all of them ran away.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen the prisoner before? - I had seen her two or three times in Chick-lane, but I had never seen any of the others.</p>
               <p>What did you do then? - I laid an information directly at Justice Girdler's, and the prisoner was taken up last Thursday by Roberts the constable. I gave a description of her at the justice's. I should know her from a million.</p>
               <p>You are sure the prisoner is the woman? - I am.</p>
               <p>Did you get your money or any of your things again? - I got nothing again. Somebody came to me and offered to make it up, which I refused.</p>
               <p>Who was that? - The woman of the house where the robbery was committed. I believe she was concerned in the robbery, but I cannot positively swear to it.</p>

               <p>Did you know her by that name before the robbery? - No; the constable told me that name.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was in the lane; I saw him come out of the house in a flurry; I asked him what was the matter; he said he had been robbed; we said if he had been robbed he had better go home.</p>
               <p>Hayes. She is the woman that robbed me; positively she helped to throw me down on the floor, and it was she that took the money out of my pocket.</p>

It was near one o'clock at noon when he went out; in about a quarter of an hour he came in, in a flurry; I asked him what was the matter; he was some time before he could speak; he then gave me the same account he has given the court. I live in Chick-lane. He was at my house while he was in town; he is a schoolmaster in Suffolk.</p>

               <p>I am innocent; I know nothing of the the money. He said if he could not find the women that robbed him he would take me into custody till they were found, and if they were not found he would make me pay for all. He said that before the alderman.</p>
               <p>To. the Prosecutor. Did you ever say if you could not find the other people that robbed you, that you would make this woman pay for all? - I never said such a word. I swore the truth. I told the alderman I could swear to her, but could swear to none of the others.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman, and live at 4, Nelson<lb></lb>terrace, Dalston—between 1 and 2 o'clock, on the morning of 9th July, I was at the Threadneedle-street end of Bartholomew-lane—a woman accosted me before I got there—she laid hold of my arm, and I pushed her off twice or thrice—when I got to the corner of the lane the prisoner sprang in front of me, like an apparition from the ground, and said, "The way to Shore<lb></lb>ditch"—I said, "Yonder," and immediately he snatched my watch away—I cannot tell where the man came from—I had my watch secured with a chain through my button-hole, and in my waistcoat-pocket—it cost about seven guineas—at the time he snatched it, a man behind me hit me on the back of the neck—I cannot tell where he came from or what became of</p>

               <p>him—the prisoner ran down the lane—I laid hold of him by the coat, and the coat gave way, and the man at the back of me struck me or pushed me at the back of the neck—I lost my hold, and the prisoner ran down the lane—when he got to the end of the lane he doubled himself up, and had I not thrown myself back, I should have gone over him—I cried out, "Stop thief!" as loud as I could, and the prisoner turned back and came up Bartholomew-lane again—a constable then came and took him—I had not lost sight of him for a moment.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman,</hi> 448). About half-past 1, on the morning of 9th July, I was in Threadneedle-street, and saw the prisoner running, and the prosecutor after him—the prosecutor was a little fresh, middling—I heard a cry of "Stop thief!" and I stopped the prisoner—I found on him at the station 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and old umbrella, a pair of gloves, a handkerchief, and three thimbles.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The prosecutor was middling, you say? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Of course he had had a glass or two; he was not drunk in my opinion—I have been, in the police force six months—the prosecutor spoke to me first—I had then got hold of the prisoner—I am quite sure it was not the prisoner who spoke to me first—he did not say, "That man has accused me of stealing a watch;" and I did not say, "If he has, you must come to the station"—nothing of that sort—I took him in custody before the prosecutor came up; the prosecutor was about five yards behind him—they were going at a good speed—the prosecutor said he should like to give him a good hammering; he might have said he would smash him—he might have said he should like to cut him to pieces; he did not say he would quarter him.</p>

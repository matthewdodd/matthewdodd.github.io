               <p>—it was usual to do so when any clerk went for money—it has been usual for some years—we went in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and received the money—the prisoner took it from Mr. Nicholson, and put it into a sheet of cartridge paper—I held up the blue bag, and he put it into it—we went back in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to the Dock-house—I held the bag in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> until we got to the Dock-house—I there delivered it to the prisoner, and saw him deliver it to Mr. Dixson—I afterwards accompanied him to the West India Docks, in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—on the way we called at the Fenchurch-street warehouse—the prisoner took the bag in his hand, and I believe be delivered a parcel to Mr. Williams there—he had a parcel for him—I stopped in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he was not absent two minutes—he took the bag with him—we then went on in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to the West India Docks, and the prisoner delivered the parcel to Mr. Hunter, in my presence.</p>

            . I became acquainted with the prisoner. Hanchett introduced him to me. The prisoner said</p>
               <p>"You want some mashey." Hanchett said I was a ganger. Hanchett said</p>
               <p>"I know you come the queer together." Hanchett said a ganger was a fool. I asked Clarke if he did any thing in it. He said Yes. He had been at Leightonstone, and passed nineteen bad shillings, and pulled one out and gave it to me. I gave it Mr. Wood. Next day I went to town with them. We went into two houses, and then to Petticoat-lane. Martin stood outside the Horns public-house, and asked Hanchett if he had sold all his blackberries. Some signals passed between them. We went to the Gaff. The prisoner bought twenty counterfeit shillings of Martin. He paid 3 s. 6 d. of his own money, and I lent him 1 s. 6 d. We returned to the Sun public-house at Rumford, and had some egg-hot which I paid four bad shillings for. A woman tapped at the window; they tried to escape. I secured them.</p>

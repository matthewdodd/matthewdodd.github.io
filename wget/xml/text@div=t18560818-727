                  </hi>. I am single, and live in Marsh-street, Walthastow. Last Friday three weeks, in the afternoon, I was at the corner of Leaden<lb></lb>hall-street, with two young female friends—I had a purse, containing a half crown, a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, and half of a railway ticket to Lea<lb></lb>bridge—somebody spoke to me, and I missed my purse, which was safe when I left the Eastern Counties station, about 3 or 4 o'clock.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 102). I was at St. Mary Axe, about 20 minutes to 4 o'clock, heard a cry of "Stop thief.'" and saw the prisoner running in the middle of Leadenhall-street—a gentleman attempted to stop him, but was not able, and he ran into Brown's-buildings—I ran after him, and took him into custody—close by him I saw this purse (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the pavement—I picked it up—Mrs. Haslop described it's contents to me before I showed it to her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an insurance agent, of No. 4, Albert-road, Dalston. I saw the prisoner running out of Leadenhall-street; there was nobody before him, to my knowledge—I attempted to stop him, but did not succeed, and followed him into Brown's-buildings, where I saw a pone fall, to the best of my knowledge, from the prisoner—I do not think there was anybody in front of him from whom it could have fallen.</p>

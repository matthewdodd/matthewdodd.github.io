On Sunday night, 27th October, I was on duty in Old Nichol-street—there was a quarrel among some women, and I went up to them, and advised them to go home quietly—one of them said, "You b—sod, you knocked me about the other night"—she held out her arm—I turned to look at it, and saw the prisoner Smith on the other side of the road—he crossed, and struck me a violent blow on the side of my bead with a life-preserver or a stick—it penetrated my helmet, and bent the rim—I fell from the blow—Smith ran away; I got up and followed him about twenty yards—when I had got about two yards from him, he turned round and struck me in the front of my forehead, with the same instrument, I believe—I closed with him, and in the struggle we both fell—while he was struggling on the ground, Dean came up, and struck me on the legs and body with something like a poker, while Lewis kicked me violently on the fingers, elbows, and body—I became excited from loss of blood, and they all three got away—some civilian came up, and I was assisted to the station by him and a constable, and was attended by Dr. Phillips, the divisional surgeon—I afterwards went with Sergeant Savage and other constables, to 1, New Nichol-street, Lewis's house—that is the next street to Old Nichol-street—I knew the prisoners before, and had seen them together</p>

               <p>—the assault was ten or twenty yards from that house—we found Lewis there in bed—I told him I should charge him with assaulting me—he said, "I know nothing about it, I have been in bed ever since seven o'clock"—a lad that was in bed with him, said that his father had been in bed all the afternoon as he was tipsy—Lewis was taken to the station—I knew where Dean lived—I think it is 21, Old Nichol-street, thirty or forty yards off—we went there and found him—I said that I wanted him for assaulting me that night—he said, "I know nothing about it; I was at King's Cross at eleven o'clock" I searched the room and found this poker between the bed and mattress—I made inquiries after Smith the same night, but I knew where he lived, as I had seen him go there with Lewis—a constable found him—I have seen the prisoners altogether as companions at two beer-shops in New Nichol-street, but not much in the day time.</p>

               <p>I heard Savage say that I did—this is the poker that was found under the bed—Savage did not say before the Magistrate that it was lying on the floor—Webb, 128 H, assisted me to the station—he is not here—he did not see the assault—I did not mention his name to the Magistrate or the attorney—I said, "my brother constable"—the civilian was not called before the Magistrate—I did not know that there was any private individual for me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 2, Spital-square—I saw Cowley at the station, about half-past 12, on Sunday morning—he was suffering very much from a contused wound on his forehead, another on his temple, and some more wounds on his head, a confusion on his ribs, and another on his knee-pan—a thick stick or life-preserver, or Borne blunt bludgeon, would inflict the wounds on the head—I saw a mark on his helmet Corresponding with the wound on his temple—that was the most serious injury—he is still off duty, and under my care—such wounds are often dangerous, but he is a young healthy man, and his helmet protected him—he is going on well.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surveyor, of 10, Old Nichol-street—on Sunday evening, 29th October, about half-past 11 o'clock, I was standing at my door, and saw a policeman coming down the street towards me, and three women close by his side—they said something to him, and a man crossed from the opposite side of the way, stood on the curb, struck the policeman a violent blow on his head, and ran back across the road—the policeman did not fall, his hat came off, and I went towards him and picked it up—he then ran after the man, who had struck him, across the road—he took him, and struggled with him against the side of a beerhouse—the constable</p>

               <p>halloaed out, "Police"—I saw a rattle lying on the pavement—I gave it one spring round as a signal that I had got it, and the constable said, "Spring it mate"—I sprang it again—he was all this time straggling with the man—he got the man down on the curb, and I heard the man say to the policeman, "You will kick you b——, will you?"—he got up and ran away two or three steps before the constable was aware of it—he appeared to be a slow runner—I do not recognise the man—the officer followed him, and he ran into a house four or five doors off, it seemed to me—I missed him as if ho bad gone into a house—a constable was brought by a woman—he leant on a post, and asked me for the rattle, which I was springing—that is the constable (<hi rend="italic">Cowley</hi>)—there was a civilian close to him, and I gave up the constable's arm to him to lead him along—people collected round by the sound of the rattle—nothing else was done by the policeman—I went to the station, and the surgeon asked me if I knew the man—I told him no—I heard the constable say that the man who committed the assault wore something of a light comforter, and he said something about a black moustache—they were talking together, but I did not interfere—they asked me for my name and address, and I gave it to them—I have since conversed with the constable that was assaulted, on the Sunday—I saw him on the Tuesday at the police-court—I had to take some work home that morning—opposite the station I saw a crowd, and inquired—from what I heard. I went in, and Cowley spoke to me—I asked him if he had got the right man that struck him on Sunday night—I said, "I hear you have got two others"—he said nothing, but offered me something to go and get a glass of drink, which I refused—I did not look to see what he offered me—I told him if he was going to have something to drink himself I would go with him, and we went to a house at the corner of Crispin-street, Spitalfields—I asked him if he was going to take the men up to the police-office that afternoon—he said, "Yes, in a few minutes, as soon as the cab comes"—I said, "I shall come up and have a look at them"—he said, "No, you stop away"—I then left him—I went to the police-court, but I stopped outside the door—no<lb></lb>body stopped me from going in.</p>

               <p>had some on my shirt-sleeve—when he ran after the man he was bleeding very much, but I did not notice two wounds—I walked after them after the first blow was struck—the sound of the rattle which I sprang brought several persons—some people came out of their houses—I did not see where the woman came from who brought the constable back—I did not follow them up sufficiently near to see what became of the man, but he appeared if he turned to go into a house—they ran four or five doors off—I saw no civilian knocked down—I was not knocked down.</p>

I did not like to put myself forward—I said at the station that there was only one—I did not give it a thought when I was drinking with him—I first saw the civilian, to whom I gave the constable's arm, in Nichol-row—the first thing I saw of him was after I bad started with the constable—he led him to the station—I do not know where he came from, or when he came up—I had not seen him before—my rattle may have brought up forty people—they ran up from different directions, while the policeman was struggling to keep the man who had hit him—they flocked round, and were dodging about—it all happened in a few minutes—the man did not fall from the first blow that I saw—when they were struggling together they were nearly down, but not quite—that was when I picked up the rattle—they were very low, but not quite down—the constable got the man down, and he said, "You will kick, will you?"—he did not stoop over him—he appeared to be stand<lb></lb>ing up, as if he could not see for blood, as the man got up without any struggle and ran off.</p>

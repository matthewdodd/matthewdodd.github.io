On the 21st of May, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the two prisoners at a trunkmaker's shop in Holborn—I went to ask, after they had left, what they had been for—then went after them, and asked what they had got—Williams said it was I some work her brother made, and she was taking it home—I took them to the station, and in going along I found these mats in the portmanteau which Williams was carrying—Scott said, "Don't be frightened, you have done nothing"—both of them said they hawked these mats—I then took out these nails, and asked what they were—they said they were nails they sold for clock nails, but they are mop nails—they were in the port<lb></lb>manteau.</p>

This is my property—it was taken from Broad-yard the evening before, at the prisoners' residence, where I had left it the night before—I was going home, called at a public-house, and the pri<lb></lb>soners asked me to give them a drop of gin—I left the case in their room —I came out, and sat on the stairs—I fell asleep, and they locked me out of their room—I never saw them before—I did not consider that I had left it behind—I went the day following for it, and it was gone.</p>

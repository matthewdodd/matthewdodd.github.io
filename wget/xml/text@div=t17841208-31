               <p>Was the sash open? - Yes, it was left open when we come down, there was a bolt fixed to hold up the sash that it might not fall down.</p>
               <p>Mr. James. What was this door that was left open? - A back door that leads into the passage, and then you go into the street.</p>
               <p>You say you went to bed last, do you swear positively, and are you sure that there was no door or window open when you went to bed? - Yes.</p>

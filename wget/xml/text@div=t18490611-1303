                  </hi>. I am in the service of the prosecutors—their premises have three floors. On 5th June, about a quarter-past six o'clock in the morning, I was on the stairs of the top shop, and could see into the middle shop where the prisoner was—I saw him take a sheet of metal like this pro<lb></lb>duced, and bend it once or twice—he then pulled up his trowsers, tucked it into his boot, pulled his trowsers down again, and walked down stairs—I informed Mr. Simpson—the prisoner could not see me where I stood—I had an object in placing myself there; it is tin foil.</p>

                  </hi>. I have one partner. On 5th June, Young made a communication to me—I watched, and saw the prisoner come out of the fac<lb></lb>tory, I called twice, "Churchyard, I want you"—he said, "I am coming back directly," and went on to where he lives, directly opposite, not more than fifty feet off—I was seventeen or eighteen feet from him when I first called him—I ran and got to the door almost as quick as he did—he went into his own house, and slammed the door in my face—I got hold of a bit of string, and got into the passage in about a minute—I tried the parlour-door, thinking he lived there, and he opened the back-door, and came in from the yard—I went and stopped him—he said, "What is the matter, I have got nothing; you may search me"—I had not then said a word to him—I sent for a policeman, he came, and asked what it was—the prisoner said, "My master charges me with stealing the metal"—I had not then charged him with stealing metal, or with any specific theft, I had only said, "If you had been an honest man you would have stopped when I called you"—I then said he had been robbing the premises, and there was something secreted in his boot—he said, "You may search me"—he was searched, and nothing was found—the tin-plate is worth about 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it is not easy to miss anything like that from our stock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you not say "You have been robbing the pre<lb></lb>mises." <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> After the policeman came—it was after that that he said he had taken no metal—we have nothing but metal and tools on the premises; we have fifty men or more.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had the premises been searched before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the first thing in the morning; the privy was not—there was another officer there when I got there, he did not go into the yard; he stayed with the prisoner while I went—the boots are not here; they came just to the middle of the calf—he took them off, because they were in holes, and he said he should get wet—I did not notice any marks of lead in them—they would hold the tin and the man's leg too.</p>

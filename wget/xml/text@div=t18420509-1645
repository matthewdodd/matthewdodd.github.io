                  </hi>. I live with my father, John Trinder Walters, at No. 51, Great Wild-street. On the 3rd of May, in the afternoon, I was behind my father's counter in the shop—the prisoner and another woman came in—a pair of shoes were shown to them—the prisoner went to the door, and unpinned a frock—I thought she was going to look at it—in about a minute she walked away with it—I followed her into Great Queen-street, and asked her for the frock she had taken from the door-way—she said she had not got it, and knew nothing about it—I gave her in charge—the frock was produced at the station.</p>

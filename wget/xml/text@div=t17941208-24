Did he say any thing on your telling him so? - He said he did not know how I could dislike it, for it was good enough; he said, if it was not good he had two more that he should be a great loser by, one was a fifteen pounds, and another a twenty-five pounds; he told me to take it to my master, and if he did not like it, I was to take it back.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you given him any change for that note? - No, he was to call the next day.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he keep the note? - No, he sent me back with it immediately to the prisoner; I went back and took the draft with me, but when I was got back the gentleman was gone out, I went back again to my master, and delivered the note to him again.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did your master keep it? - He gave it me the next day morning; this was on Sunday morning, and he gave it me on Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember sufficient to know that the draft you received on Monday morning, was the same you had given to your master on Sunday? - Yes, very well.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the firm of the house? - Ransom, Moreland, and Hammersley.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you a check? - Yes, we have.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you give your checks in that way? - We do.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not know whether you can recollect having paid a draft of the name<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080096"></xptr>of Thomas Exton on the 1st of September? - There was one paid of the first of September of five pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you have the book with you? - I have.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. Is that in your hand writing? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Court. What do you call the book? - A waste book.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Is that the book in which you enter them as soon as you pay them? - Yes, immediately.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. Then that book is not the book in which you minute them down immediately? - We do it as soon as we can; we put the checks in a drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not possible another clerks checks might get in that book in your hand writing? - Very possibly it may; but at that time there were no other person attending the counter but myself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. You have the draft? - I have.(Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Q. To Burton. Is that the draft that you received from Mr. Gilchrist, and gave to your master? - I believe it is the very same.</p>
               <p>Q. To Lewis. Is that the draft you received from Burton and returned to him on Monday morning? - I believe it is the very same.</p>
               <p>Q. To Burton. Is that the one that you carried and received the money for of Mr. Heslop? - I faithfully believe it is the same.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. I understood you before to say you knew this to be the same, but it appears by the draft that there is no mark at all on the draft? - No, there is not.</p>
               <p>Q. That you received a draft from Mr. Gilchrist is very true, but I want to know why you recollect that that very paper is the paper you received from Mr. Gilchrist? - From the hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. How many weeks elapsed before you saw it again? - I saw it at Bow-street three weeks or a month afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever take other drafts for your master in the course of business? - No, never took one before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say only carrying that draft from a customer to your master, that you made such observations as to be able to swear that is the same? - I swear to the best of my knowledge, I think so by the hand writing, and by the date of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you it in your possession? - I had it Sunday morning above an hour, and Monday morning nearly the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at it more than once? - Yes, I looked at it several times, because I did not think it was good; the reason I objected to Mr. Gilchrist was, because I did not understand these things, and it was not on stamped paper.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const to Heslop. I want to know whether you have discharged Mr. Exton? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. Now on the subject of this book, do I understand you right, that that waste book is made as soon after the business is done as possible? Does it happen that frequently one clerk pays the money, and another makes; the entry? - It has happened prior to this business, but not since.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you venture to swear that every thing in your hand writing is the transaction of yourself? - No, I cannot say that to the whole book; at the time of this transaction we had altered our mode.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us that Lord Kinnard, Mr. Moreland and Mr. Hammersley are partners in this house? Is Mr. Ramson alive or dead? - He is dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Have no part of Mr. Ransom's family any interest of the profit and loss<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080097"></xptr>in that banking house? - Lord Kinnard he is his son-in-law.</p>
               <p>Q. Besides my Lord Kinnard? - I believe not, I do not know that any body else has.</p>
               <p>Q. You know my Lord Kinnard of course? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What rank is he? - He is a peer of Scotland.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he Earl, Viscount or Baron? - A Baron, I understand him so in the Court Kalender.(The release from the house to Mr. Exton shewn to Mr. Heslop.)</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the gentlemens hand writing? - It is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. How does Mr. Hammersley spell his name? - Hammersley.</p>
               <p>Q. I cannot see there before they? - It is his usual way of writing.</p>

            ; I returned to town in a very short time, and the check that I gave to Mr. Lewis, was the first that was offered for payment; when I found that note was paid I did not object taking some more of them; he then gave me three more notes, I gave the one to Mr. Lewis for the payment of the goods I had from him, and he was very well satisfied; the circumstance of my going to Moreland's to enquire about them, if I knew they were forged was not like a guilty mind; when I conceived my life at stake I would naturally fly from justice for my own security. After I had been to the banker's about them, I returned to Mr. Macdonald to the coffee house, and mentioned the circumstance to him, of their having been refused; he expressed himself in a great passion, and wondered that they should have been refused; he set off from me to go to Mr. Hammersley's immediately; in about the course of half an hour he returned, and he told me that he had spoke to Mr. Hammersley, and that both him and Mr. Hammersley were decidedly of opinion that the notes were forged; he then took a note out of his pocket, from which he shewed me a letter that he had received from Mr. Exton<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080098"></xptr>that morning, which informed him that he, Mr. Exton, was at Bristol; he then took two checks from the letter and shewed me, and I was very well convinced they were not the same signature as those of the former, and as he had always behaved like a gentleman to me, I conceived the suspicions I had of him were ill grounded; he told me he was going to Bristol, and when he saw Mr. Exton he would remonstrate with him. Having occasion afterwards to pay Mr. Lewis some more, I gave him the ten pounds note to change, I supposed by his paying the former one he would not refuse the other; I owed him six pounds six shillings, and he gave me the balance of three or four shillings; and on the Saturday following in the morning I was at home at my own apartments, and Miller came and took me up.</p>

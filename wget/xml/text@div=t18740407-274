                  </hi>. I am a captain in the merchant service, and have been a captain twenty-five years—early in 1854 I was master of the <hi rend="italic">John Bibby</hi>, and was with my vessel at Rio—remember the <hi rend="italic">Bella</hi> arriving while I was there, and knew her captain very well indeed, Captain Birkett—he was a personal friend of mine—he had then been about three years in command of the <hi rend="italic">Bella</hi>—the <hi rend="italic">George Fafe</hi>, Captain Hosking, was at Rio at the same time, she is a Liverpool ship—I remained at Rio five or six weeks—I have not got the books with me, but this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is an old journal which I kept at the time—it is in my writing—I arrived in Rio on 2nd April, and left again on 12th May, 1854—I remember the <hi rend="italic">Bella sailing</hi> about 20th April—on the morning she sailed I went on board of her to see Captain Birkett, and to assist a young gentleman who was with him, whose name I have since ascertained was Roger Tichborne—I cannot recollect the name he went by at that time—I was to get him out without a passport, he had got into difficulties—he represented that his friends were very well off, but he had not the means of paying his debts in Rio, and Captain Birkett gave him a passage to New York—he promised Captain Birkett that he would pay him at some future time as his friends were <hi rend="italic">very</hi> wealthy—I managed to get him away without a passport, by leaving my own ship early in the morning with my boat's crew and going on board the <hi rend="italic">Bella</hi>, which was lying at the outer anchorage all ready to go to sea—my own ship was in the</p>

               <p>inner anchorage in the ballast ground, not more than a quarter of a mile from the nearest landing place, and a quarter of a mile from the <hi rend="italic">Bella</hi>—I slept on board my own ship, and when I got on board the <hi rend="italic">Bella</hi>, Captain Birkett was there and this young Englishman—that was about 5 a.m., and the <hi rend="italic">Bella</hi> was preparing to weigh anchor, and a steam-tug was ready to tow her out to sea—I saw the young gentleman there and Captain Birkett, and the steward arranged that he should go down into the lazarette, under the store room, under the cabin floor—it is a place where they stow provisions and light goods, and is opened with a grating hatch—the steward placed a few packages over the hatch after he was down—it is like a small hold from one side of the ship to the other—he would have plenty of room, and he would not see if the hatch was lifted up for a moment—the steward replaced the hatch and the steamer came alongside, and the ship began to move down the harbour—she was made fast and towed ahead, and when she got opposite Fort Balignan, which is a Government Fort, near the entrance of the harbour the Government officer came on board to give the ship her final clearance—he brought a true list certified by the English Consul—the <hi rend="italic">Bella's</hi> crew were mustered and each answered to their names—the officer said "No passengers!" or something of that sort, as no passengers were marked on the list—the Brazilian officer said that I must leave the ship before he did—I bade Captain Birkett good bye and got into my boat—that was a mile or a mile and a-half from the anchorage—it was in order to pass that place that we stowed him away—as soon as my boat left I saw the Brazilian officer get into his boat and I pulled directly back to the <hi rend="italic">John Bibby</hi> to breakfast, and the <hi rend="italic">Bella</hi> proceeded on her voyage in tow of the steamer—Captain Birkett was perfectly sober that morning and so were the crew, and they were all at work as far as I know—I was perfectly sober—Captain Hosking was not on board the <hi rend="italic">Bella</hi>, while I was there—I had seen the young gentleman on shore several days previous—the prisoner was not on board while I was there—it is not true that while I was there a panel was taken out of the state cabin, and the young gentleman put in there by the prisoner—Captain Hosking, and Captain Birkett, and I, did not go on board in one boat—I left the young gentleman with Captain Birkett on board the boat, and I found him there the next morning—it is an utter impossibility that the whole of the' crew were drunk, and that the hawser slipped, and that they, got it on board again and made it fast—I saw the vessel and all went on smoothly—the prisoner was not there at all during the whole time I was there—the hawser did not slip, there was no accident whatever—he did not lift me and Captain Hosking into his boat, and row us both ashore together—I never introduced the young gentleman to the prisoner at Rio, by the name of Mr. Tichborne or otherwise—the first time I saw the young gentleman at Rio, was at Fox's stores with Captain Birkett—I never played at billiards with the young gentleman at the Fairy Hotel, Rio—I could not play at that time—I did not in April sleep in a double-bedded room there, this man occupy<lb></lb>ing one of the beds, or at any hotel with him—I never had a bath in his presence in a room at Rio—I never saw him at Rio—I first saw him at Bow Street, when he was brought up on this charge—I knew very little of the hotels at Rio in 1854, but the water was not laid on to the houses then—a few days after the <hi rend="italic">Bella</hi> sailed a vessel brought in her longboat and two watercasks—it was then supposed that something had happened to the <hi rend="italic">Bella</hi>, and I heard of her loss afterwards when I got to</p>

               <p>China—I never saw any more of Captain Birkett or the crew—I saw a person on his trial in the Court of Queen's Bench, he had no resemblance to the person I stowed away—after Captain Hosking and I had been examined at Bow Street, the prisoner in my presence stated before the Court that we were not the men he had seen at Rio de Janerio, that there was another Captain Oates in command of the <hi rend="italic">John Bibby</hi>, and another Captain Hosking in command of the <hi rend="italic">George Fife</hi>—I know no other Captain Oatea in the Mercantile Marine, and there is no other <hi rend="italic">John Bibby</hi>—she was named after a member of the firm well-known in Liverpool, Old Mr. John Bibby—her tonnage was 850—the <hi rend="italic">George Fife</hi> was between 800 and 900 tons, and both were ships, not barques—as a sailor I can undertake to say that there were not two other ships of those names at Rio—the <hi rend="italic">John Bibby</hi> is the only ship of that name on the Mercantile List—I was examined about this matter at the Law Institution in 1868, and on 23rd May last I was examined at the Queen's Bench, as a witness for the prosecution as to the <hi rend="italic">Bella</hi>, and as to the stowing this young man away—I was not in the gallery with a lady on 8th October, I was in Hull—I left London on the 1st, and did not return again till the 17th or 18th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> This gentleman is not the Captain Oates I was alluding to—did I say there were two <hi rend="italic">George Fife's</hi>, at Bow Street. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I understood you so—I did not have a Custom House pass to go on board the <hi rend="italic">Bella on</hi> 21st April—any vessels plying about the harbour of Rio are liable to be asked their business, and if you give a civil answer that you are going to such a ship, it is not necessary to have a pass—you can pass from the shore to a ship without a pass, but you cannot land without being examined by the Custom House officers ashore.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a ship-broker of Hull—in 1853 I was a partner in the firm of Lundgren and Co., of Hull—Lundgren, who was tried here yesterday was in their service until I left, in October or November, 1853, and after I left I knew him at Hull in the same firm—I am quite certain he is the man I saw yesterday—I gave him orders from day to day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am secretary, and one of the examiners under the Local Marine Board, London, and was so in 1861—this is my signature to an application by a person named James Brown, to be examined for a master's certificate—he was examined and I signed this paper—in order to be examined he had to make out this list containing his entire services at sea—the last three vessels are numbered 1, 2, 3 and 4, with ticks against them, that means that he produced testimonials of good conduct corresponding with his period of service from the owners or from the master if he was mate—he came up first, being desirous to pass as master, but failed once and came up a second time, and only obtained a certificate for seamanship—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is his letter—he only got a first mate's certificate—that would be returned to him in ordinary course—in all cases where the applicant has served a period he has to make a declaration before a magistrate or before the Lord Mayor, at the Mansion House—the certificate was re<lb></lb>turned to him when he passed—these papers show the ships on board which he was—from 1853 to 1858 he returns himself as mate of the <hi rend="italic">Equity</hi>, of Boston, had his services been confined to English ports he would have to produce his discharge—I have heard of the original application made by him.</p>

What I have said is perfectly true. If they find me guilty, God Almighty will not find me guilty. The explanation about the papers is this—if I could go to Washington and get a list of the ships you would only find my name from December 1856 to 1858. That could be easily found at Washington, but it could only be got from the Secretary of State at Washington. I have no doubt the prosecution know that but they won't own it.</p>

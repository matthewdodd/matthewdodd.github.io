            . I am a Police-constable. On the 23rd of June, at five o'clock in the morning, I stopped the prisoner at the corner of Titchfield and Mortimer-street, with a bundle on his shoulder; I asked what he had in his bundle - he told me it was clothes he was bringing from his master; I am sure he said he brought them from his master - I asked where his master lived, and he said "No. 39, Holborn," and that it was Mr. Capon; I asked where he was going with the bundle - he said,"To No. 39, Devonshire-place;" I asked who to there - he said, "Mr. Curtis;" I asked if he would let me see what he had in the bundle - he said Yes; I opened it, and found some new clothes in it, and an immense quantity of plate at the bottom of it - I tied it up again, and said, "To satisfy myself, I shall see you to No. 39, Devonshire-place;" we went there - I rang the area bell; a boy came up to the gate - I asked if Mr. Curtislived there; he said Yes, but he was out of town - the house was undergoing a thorough repair, and his mother had the care of it; I went in, met a man in the passage, and asked if he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300030"></xptr>knew any thing of these clothes and plate coming to Mr. Curtis's - he said he did not; there was a woman in the passage; I asked her about it - she said, "If you will leave it with me, I will take care nobody shall meddle with it till I hear from my master;" the bundle was put into the room - the prisoner and I walked up the area steps; the prisoner went one way, and I the other - I crossed the street, and looked to see if he was looking after me; I then went as far as Tottenham-street, and met my serjeant - I told him, and then went back to the house in Devonshire-place; the woman who had the care of the house gave the bundle up to me in the same state, and about a quarter of an hour after the prisoner walked into the house in Devonshire-place, and I took him into custody - I have had the property ever since.</p>

I have known the prisoner about seven months - he was a waiter at our house about two months, and was discharged about four months ago; he had no business in the house - I did not see him there on the 23rd; I was the last person up that night, and went to bed about a quarter after two o'clock - the prisoner knew the way of the hotel; there are a great many doors to it - I got up about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, and just as I came down the Policeman came into the house; I then missed the plate stated in the indictment, which was worth about 115l. - the prisoner knew where it was kept; the linen belongs to a gentleman in the house - I left the clothes in the waiters' pantry, and the plate was in a drawer in the waiters' pantry - it is a very large house, and the thief must have secreted himself in the house, for I examined every door; there are many parts of the house in which a man could conceal himself; I swear this plate is my master's property.</p>

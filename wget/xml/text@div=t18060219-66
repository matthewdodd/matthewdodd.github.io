No, he was only to have the bed for one night, he lodged there two nights; he went into the parlour and called for a pint of porter, in a little<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180602190054"></xptr>time after he rung the bell, I went in, and he said he wanted to go to bed, I lit him up stairs, and shewed him the bed and turned the sheets down; I said my rule is to be paid before you go to bed, he said he had only gold, and he was afraid he should get some bad silver, I said very well, if you pay me in the morning it will do, he said he should breakfast with me; accordingly, in the morning he came into the kitchen to me, and said, may I have breakfast, I said no; he never offered to pay me for the pint of porter, I did not know but he had paid my son, he put in my hand a seven shilling piece, and I gave him six shillings, he said he should sleep there the following night; on the following night he came, the fire was very low in the parlour, he grumbled about that, I said we have a good fire in the kitchen, if you should like to sit down in the kitchen, he went and sat there and had a pint of beer again; my daughter went up stairs and turned the sheets down; on Tuesday morning he laid till ten o'clock, he came down stairs, I was in the yard.</p>

As he was going out of the front door he sees me, he says good morning ma'am; I thought he had paid my husband the shilling; he says to me can I have any breakfast, I says you can; he then says I have got a little business in St. John-street, I shall be back in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he return. - A. No, the minute that he was gone my daughter went up stairs to see whether the sheeting was on the bed, she made the alarm, the sheet was gone.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any thing upon the body; any dress of any sort - A. Yes; a bed-gown on the body, a hat on its head, stockings and shoes on its legs and feet.</p>
               <p>Q. Any thing else upon it - A. I did not perceive.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the body - A. I sent for Mr. Clayton, a grave-digger. I delivered the body and the dress that was upon it to Mr. Clayton.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I believe the place in which you found the body was between the enclosure called the New River head and Islington-road - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The space from the New River head to that road is about three hundred yards, is it not - A. Yes,</p>
               <p>Q. Which is a very public path-way - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. One of the most public pathways I believe near London - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And of a Sunday evening always crowded - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the body, I understand, stopped by the grating where the water enters the reservoir of the New River - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The body being stopped it could not go in on account of that grating - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You know at the part above there, at Islington, there is another grating, is there not - A. I fancy not. There is one at Goswell-street-road - another grating.</p>

               <p>Q. Therefore the body could not come through the grating - A. No.</p>

            . I am grave-digger of St. James's, Clerkenwell Parish. In consequence of being sent for by the two last witnesses, I went to where the child was. I found it laying by the path-way. I took a shell to take it to the vault of the church.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you discribe what was upon the body of the child - A. Yes; it had a bed-gown on, a handkerchief was tied tight round its neck, with the knot under the left ear.</p>
               <p>COURT. There was a knot was there - A. Yes, under the left ear; a black hat on and a small band.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a hat was it - A. It was a hat formed with a peak in the front; a black beaver hat, and likewise a piece of a band that went part of the way round; it did not go round only just in the front of it. It appeared to be sewed. I did not examine how it was fixed on. A black silk cap under the hat, immediately upon the head, and tied with a string under the chin; a handkerchief round the body with part of a brick in it, about the half of a brick. The brick is here.</p>
               <p>MR. JONES. I received the things from off the child's body. I employed a woman to wash the things. This is the half brick.</p>
               <p>Clayton. These are the things that I saw on the body. This is the brick; it was in this handkerchief, round the body, and this handkerchief was round the neck, with a knot under the left ear. These are the stockings that were upon the legs; they are worsted stockings, speckled. This petticoat was on the body, under the bed-gown. This is the bed-gown; the sleeves were cut to get it off. This is the shirt. They were all cut off. These are the stockings; they were all cut off the legs. These were the shoes on his feet, and this is the hat.</p>
               <p>JURY. We shall be happy to know what knot the handkerchief was in - Clayton. It was a knot in this manner; a single knot under the ear. These are all the things that were on the body. I took the body to the vault, and it remained there till Monday morning. On the Monday, a person was sent from the workhouse to wash the body, before it was exposed. It was not exposed till Monday morning, by ten o'clock, as near as I can guess. A vast number of people came to see it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the prisoner saw it - A. Yes; she saw it in the vault after the body was washed. It was about three o'clock in the afternoon on the Monday.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. What did she say about it - A. At first sight she remained mute for a minute or more, and then she said, that is not my George, or my child; that is too big for him. At this time the dress was upon the body; they were not taken off; they were in the situation as they were taken out of the River, except the handkerchief was loosened that was on the neck, on account of washing the body.</p>
               <p>Q. Was anything said by her about the clothes - A. She was asked the question whether she knew the clothes. She said, no; there was nothing there that belonged to her child. She was asked generally first, and one by one afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. When she was asked one by one, what answer did she give - A. She denied the whole, except when she came to the shoes she made no answer. The shoes was the last question asked her. When she came to the shoes she made no answer.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Now, the handkerchief was on the neck; you say it was tied round, and it was twisted round like a rope - A. Yes, quite twisted.</p>
               <p>Q. The neck was swelled over it, as I understand - A. Yes, under the chin. It was in the front. It had been tied tight round the neck.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the body a great deal larger than you should expect a child of four years old to be - A. Yes, it had the appearance of being larger.</p>
               <p>Q. You have bad experience of seeing bodies that have laid in the water - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A person that knew the child when alive would not easily recognize the child so well - A. I should suppose not.</p>
               <p>Q. When she was desired to look at the child, did not she say there was a mark upon my George by which I should know him - A. Yes, and she looked on the left side of the body, under the arm. The clothes were opened by her desire. We could not see a mark of the description that she gave. She spoke of it as a mark that raised on the surface. We could not find that mark.</p>
               <p>Q. The child was in a putrid state. It was leading to putrefaction. I do not know whether you know that has a tendency to obliterate a mark of that kind - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. You shewed the jury just now, a sort of knot that was tied under the left ear - A. Yes; it was only tied in one knot.</p>
               <p>COURT. How soon after the child was exposed, which you said was ten o'clock on the Monday, did any person come that recognised it was

            . Do you live at No. 18, Northampton-street, Clerkenwell - A. No. 16.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner at the bar lodge at your house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she lodged at your house - A. She lodged in the house before I took it. I took it at Midsummer. She lodged there until the 22nd of February.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she any children - A. She told me that she had three. She had two that lived with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the habit of seeing these children - A. Very frequent.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the deceased, George - A. Yes, he was with me frequent, for days together.</p>
               <p>Q.We understand he was about four years old - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the last time you saw the poor boy, the deceased A. On Sunday evening, about the 21st of February, about half past five.</p>
               <p>Q.About what time did the prisoner go out that afternoon - A. About half past six in the evening, I understood I was out at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see George and the prisoner that evening - A. At the time I have stated, at that time I saw the prisoner and George. The prisoner told me that she was going to put him in the poorhouse. I went for the purpose of taking my leave of him. I bid him good bye, and told him I would come and see him, and give him some cakes. I expected, from what I learned from her, that he would be put in St. Pancras workhouse. I gave the child some cakes, kissed him, and told him I would come and see him. He had on a black cap, a frock with red and yellow figures. I do not recollect any other-part of his dress. He used in general to wear worsted stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, excepting the black silk cap and frock, you do not particularly recollect anything else - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any bed-gown on - A. Not unless he had it under his frock. He had not one as I saw.</p>
               <p>Q.Had he any shoes on - A. He might, but I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q.You then went away out of the room, did you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see her next - A. Between nine and ten that evening. I let her in when she returned. I asked her what she had done with the boy. She said, that she left him at the beadle of St. Pancras. He was to be sent the next morning in a coach, with some other children, to Brompton, to nurse; that he was to stop there until he was six years old. That was what passed at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, when had you any other conversation with her - A. In the afternoon. I was in my own/ parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next see the prisoner - A. Not till Monday morning; but there was a conversation passed in the parlour, before I took leave of the child.</p>
               <p>Q. You should have told us that before - A. Immediately after four o'clock in the afternoon she came down stairs, and I called her into my room. I asked her what she meaned to do with the child, as the time was drawing near when the prisoner was going to her place.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you understood that before that time the prisoner was about going to some place as a servant - A. Yes. She then said she went out in the forenoon for some potatoes, and met with a person accidentally that she told her case to, and he desired her to bring the child to him in the evening, between six and seven, and he would get it in, or put it in, without any further trouble. She did not tell me who that person was with whom that conversation took place: I said, I thought it was a providence that she had met with that person. For some weeks she had talked of putting the child in Pancras workhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the poor-house of the place where you lived - A. No. I live in the parish of St. James, Clerkenwell. I have been informed since, the child was born in St. Pancras.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, I would ask you whether the conduct of the prisoner with respect to this child was of an affectionate nature, or otherwise - A. I never saw the contrary but an affectionate mother. At times she appeared very uneasy about the maintenance and and protection of the child. She expressed herself so to me.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner used she to express herself - A. She said she must get George in the house; she could not afford to keep them both.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this all the conversation that you recollect having with her previous to the time of your going to see the child - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with her on the Monday that she went away - A. I do not recollect saying anything to her.</p>
               <p>COURT. When did she go from your house - A. She went from my house on the Monday afternoon, and returned the Tuesday evening. On Tuesday I had no conversation with her about the child: on Monday before the child was found I had.</p>
               <p>Q. That was a week before the child was found - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Where was it you saw her - A. At Mr. Brookes's in Paternoster-row.</p>
               <p>Q.She was servant there, was she not - A. Yes. I merely asked her if she had heard of George. She said, no. That was all that passed about him that time. I never saw her from that time until I saw her at Clerkenwell church. I said, when she was going to put him in the workhouse, that Mrs. Polly would go and see the child.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Mrs. Polly - A. A particular acquaintance of the prisoner. She said, no, she would not. I said, why? She said, because she was so partial to him; she could not leave him if she was to see him. I said then, I would go. She said, I could not see him any time, only from ten to one, on a Friday. I said, I was in business, and confined of a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070014"></xptr>week day; I would go on a Sunday. She said, they would not let any body see him on a Sunday, unless they came a great way. I said, what do you call this but a great way. I do not recollect any other words that passed that time. We have talked several times about the child going into the house. One time she said she would go to Mrs. Hudson to ask her to take him to the poor-house. She told me she did go, and Mrs. Hudson refused her, and she did not know who to get to go with him. On Monday, in March, I saw the child in Clerkenwell church, three weeks after the child went out of the house: on the 15th, I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day did you go to the church - A. I think it was a little after one. I went where the crowd was standing, and I requested to be let in. I saw the child. I said, I thought the features were not so much altered but I thought it was the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the name of the child - A. George.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any thing been said to you that induced you to ask to see the child - A. Yes, a person came into my shop in the morning; she asked me when I saw Mrs. Evans. I told her, on the Monday before. I had heard about the black silk cap; that drew my attention, and induced me to go there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. When you went there you saw the child, and you thought it was the child - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the child, at that time it had on a black silk cap and the hat - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the black silk cap fastened - A. It was tied under the chin. It had a bed-gown on, stockings, and shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it on (that you saw) any speckled coloured frock in the way that you described - A. No, it had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it any thing round its neck - A. Yes, but I did not take notice what it was at that time. It appeared of a grey colour to me. I took notice of its cap. The handkerchief round its neck appeared tied tight.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the child the first time was it before it was washed - A. It was a little cleaned.</p>
               <p>Q. The second time you saw it did you observe the handkerchief - A. Yes. The handkerchief had been a little removed; there was the appearance on the flesh as if a knot had been tied. The handkerchief was loose. The second time, I noticed the stockings and shoes. The prisoner was there then, and I was sent for.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the stockings and the shoes before the prisoner - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your observation that you made in the prisoner's presence with respect to the deceased's cap - A. She denied the child, and said, it is not my child - it is not my George, it is larger. I said, death stretches, and the water swells. I saw she would not own it. Then I said, the cap? She said, he had not the cap on when he went away. I understood her to mean that he had not that particular cap on. I asked her what she had done with it. She said that she had destroyed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Looking at the cap, you remembering what the cap was that he had on, was it, or not, the cap - A. It was the identical cap which he wore in my house. I then said, the hat? She said, it was not the same. She took hold of the rim. She said, it was like it, but it was not the same. I said, the band?</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean the band of the hat - A. Yes. I had observed the band; the band did not go round the hat. She said, the band that was on it was a little broader. I said, I could not say as to that particular. She then said, that she had taken the band off, and had put on a black ribbon. I then said, the stockings and the shoes? I do not recollect that she answered me any more.</p>
               <p>COURT. As to the stockings and the shoes, were you certain that they were the same - A. Yes; I thought they were the same.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Was that all the conversation that you had with the prisoner - A. I was called up to her before she left the vault. I asked her if I should see her again; yes, she said, she would call upon me as she went home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she do so - A. She was confined.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she inform you ever of her circumstances - A. She frequently told me that she lived upon nothing but bread and tea: indeed that I knew to be true.</p>
               <p>Q.Was she indebted to you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that cap - A. This is the cap that was made for

             - A. I gave Mrs. Evans the silk to make it. The border is very particular, and the selvage I remember perfectly, and the strings as well.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any other part of the dress if it was shewn to you - A. The hat. This is the hat he wore at my house when he went out frequently. It was given to him by Mrs. Turner. I think the band that is on it is the same band that always was on it. The hat was given by Mrs. Turner with the band upon it; and the shoes and stockings I believe to be the same.</p>
               <p>Q.What sort of a child was it respecting its features - A. A fine boy of its age; fresh coloured.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the features able to be traced in the dead child sufficient for you to know him - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. We all know the features alter by death - A. Yes. I knew the child from its features. I have no doubt in the least of its being the child.</p>
               <p>COURT. You have no doubt of that being the child George, as being the child of Mrs. Evans - A. Not in the least.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Have you ever observed the child while it was at your house wearing a bed-gown - A. Only when he went to bed; he sometimes of a morning came into my room with a bed-gown on.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the bed-gown upon the dead body of the child - A. I did, but I did not take notice of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the stockings and shoes - A. I have not the least doubt of their being the same that he used to wear. The handkerchiefs I know nothing of them.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070015"></xptr>Mr. Bolland. You say this prisoner always held affection to this child, the boy - A. She did. She had also another little child, she was equally fond of that. At the time I went into her room she was preparing to wash it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe anything in this woman that indicated agitation and distress - A. I did not. She staid with me half an hour. I observed nothing of agitation. I thought she was satisfied with sending the child into the country.</p>

               <p>COURT. She mentioned to you that she met with somebody that would take care of the child - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Afterwards she said she left it with the beadle - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she, when she came back, mention to you of having seen the person - A. She did.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say about the person - A. She said he gave her an order to take the child to the beadle.</p>
               <p>Q. An order in writing to take the child to the beadle - A. Yes, I understood so.</p>

               <p>Q. On the evening that she took the child away, did anything pass between you and the prisoner - A. The prisoner knocked at my door about half past six.</p>
               <p>COURT. You have an apartment in the house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. Was your wife at home at the time - A. Yes, she was. I stood with the door in my hand. The child was on her right side. She brought the child to bid my wife and I good bye. The child drove near to me. I said, come hither, George, and I gave him a penny out of my right hand waistcoat pocket. The child was dressed in a red ground frock, and some kind of a speckle on it, or a flower. I cannot describe it.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the frock again if you were to see it - A. Yes, I should. It had a light coloured handkerchief, or a white, tied across his bosom, behind, neatly; and it had this black hat, and the black silk cap.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at that hat - A. That is the identical hat, and that is the cap. I never saw the child after that. I have seen the frock since, at Mr. Thisselton's, an officer of Hatton Garden office. I saw the frock there yesterday afternoon.</p>
               <p>- THISSELTON. I produce the frock. I got it out of the prisoner's box, at her situation at Mr. Brooks's.</p>

               <p>Q. to Mrs. Blakey. Do you know that frock - A. Yes, sir, well. That is the frock he had on when I took leave of the child. There is one place here the child bit out, under the arm, and there is a piece under.</p>

She came about half past seven in the evening; she was alone. I asked her what she had done with George. She said, that the child was taken to the beadle of the parish of St. Pancras, from whence it was to go with a great many more children to Brompton. She said it was gone very happy and comfortable with the rest of the children.</p>
               <p>COURT. Do you mean that it already had gone - A. Yes, in the middle of the week.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Was there anything different in her behaviour at that time to what there used to be before - A. I did not perceive it at all. She said she was going to her service, to Mr. Brooks's in Paternoster-row, on the following Monday or Tuesday, she could not say which. She called upon me to bid me good bye before she went to her place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner any time before the 21st of February - A. Yes, she called upon me on the week day before that, about a week before that, on the 21st was Sunday. About a week before that she came to my house to take tea with me; she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070016"></xptr>then asked me whether I could recommend any person to take her child to the beadle, or the parish workhouse. I am not certain which. I told her that I could not recommend her any one. The youngest child was with her at this time. She said she was in a deal of distress of mind what to do with the child; she could not get any body, to take it for her. I asked her why she did not take it herself. She answered, the people of the parish were so abusive to her that she did not like to be brow-beated by them. At the time that she was pregnant with the last child, she told me before she laid in, that her name was changed to Roberts. That was about a month before she laid in. The child was fifteen months old on the 30th of March; that she was married, and her name was Roberts. She said, the last child was by her husband, and her name was changed to Roberts.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. It was half past seven when this woman came to your house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a road by the New River that branches off into many foot paths - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That road is very much frequented - A. Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that she came to you she conversed with you without any agitation, did not she - A. She appeared as comfortable as I always saw her. I never saw any harm of her. She seemed a very industrious person. She stopped with me until ten minutes after nine. There was nothing extraordinary in her appearance.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at that hat - A. This is the hat that I gave her; it was my little daughter's and I gave her this piece of a gown that this frock is made with. I gave her one breadth of my gown to make 
               <persName id="t18130407-23-person210">George</persName>
             a frock. The shoes I likewise gave her; they were my little daughter's; the stockings I think were my son's. I gave her two or three pair. I think I recollect these to be one. The hat I gave her, and I am sure with the band. The band is very remarkable; it does not go all round the hat. The band is tinsel cord. When I bought the hat it was turned down; I did not see the band did not go all round. I turned the hat down; I said the hatter was very stinting in his band, not to afford it to go all round. I remember making the observation.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner going to Mr. Brooks's service - A. Yes. On Tuesday evening, she came to me; I think it was about the 22nd of February. I am certain it was a Tuesday evening. She said she was come to bid me good bye. I told her I was glad to see her so comfortable and clean; then I asked her where she had placed the two children. She said she had placed the younger one in the front of the road at nurse; she meaned to pay for it herself. Then I asked her how she had placed George. She said that she had taken him to the workhouse, to the sick-house, at Hackney, through the interest of Mr. Hougham he was to be farmed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say who Mr. Hougham was - A. Yes, the doctor. The child was to be farmed, and from there to be nursed at Brompton. I told her it was a very good thing, as the child previous to that had been very ill. She said the parish would pay five shillings a week with it. I told her I thought it was a very great interest to have that privilege. She said she was very glad it was so. She wished my son to write a direction for her, for the nurses to come and see her, and to bring the child (George) to her. My son wrote two directions to leave with the nurses of each of the children. I understood it was to find her out. Nothing more passed about the child.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I think you say you have known the prisoner better than twelve years - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, during part of the time she has lodged in your house - A. She has, within the last two years.</p>
               <p>Q. You have had the opportunity of seeing what her conduct has been to her children - A. Yes; she was very affectionate, and extremely clean and neat in her manners. On account of her manners I liked her; a mild, affectionate, humane woman.</p>
               <p>Q. George was a very fine boy; a fine, cheerful, playful boy - A. Yes; he was a very sensible boy; he was an acute boy. I always thought her an affectionate mother to him.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that she came to your house was not she as calm and as tranquil as a woman could be be - A. Just so.</p>
               <p>JURY. Did you give the prisoner cotton enough to make two frocks - A. Not two frocks; to make the frock and more. There was not enough to make two frocks: there was enough to make an extra body, not more. The child came frequently with the frock on.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with her respecting George - A. Yes; she told me that she was going to send George into the country, thirty miles off. She drank tea at my place. George was with her. I said to the little boy, George, shall not you cry when you go for to leave your brother Billy. The child smiled. The mother made answer, it was going where it would be taken care of, and want for nothing. The child had on a black silk cap: his hat I did not notice. He had shoes and stockings on when he played about the room with his brother. I saw the child on the Tuesday after it was taken out of the water. I saw it in the vault of Clerkenwell church.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know whether the prisoner knew you or not - A. I do not know; I was not in my beadle's dress. As soon as I found that was her, I walked inside and pushed the door too, not to stand and talk in the street. The first word that she said, before any words passed, are you come from the office, or, you are come from the office, I do not know which exactly. I said, no, I am come from the parish of Clerkenwell. Upon that, she walked away from the door, and walked along the passage. I followed after her, and as I went along the passage, I said, there was a child drowned at Clerkenwell.</p>

             to put her things on, and go along with me. She said, she would. The prisoner went up stairs to get her bonnet and shawl. I followed her out of the kitchen, and waited for her at the bottom of the stairs. She came down stairs directly with her bonnet and shawl. She was not gone two minutes up stairs, and we came out together. In Warwick-lane, a woman was coming down; we passed her. She called out, Sarah. We were in the road, and the woman was in the foot-path. Sarah turned round, and the woman crossed into the road to us; her name is Mrs. Howard, Mrs. Howard said to the prisoner, where are you going. She said I am going along with this man to Clerkenwell, to look at a child that was drowned, as they said it was her's. Mrs. Howard said, when I told you last night I thought it was, but then she was coming to her to tell her it was not George. I said to Mrs. Howard, if you know Mrs. Evans, you had better go along with us to see the child. She agreed to come, and we all three came on together to the church. I let them walk by themselves, and I followed close to their heels. We got to the church. The gravedigger was not there at that time. We went into Mr. Sheppard's, the Crown tavern, to get away from the mob. We went out the back way, and went into the vault; I, and Mrs. Howard, the prisoner, and Clayton. I took her up to the shell for her to look at the child. She stood and paused a little bit, a minute or so; at last she exclaimed, that was not her George. I told her to look at it over and over again. She still persisted it was not her George.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070018"></xptr>As she did not seem to own the child, I told her to look at the clothing, to see if she knew them. She said, no, there was not a bit of clothing upon the child that belonged to her George. I questioned her first with respect to all the clothing, generally, and then I was very particular with her to look at the hat. She stooped down towards the shell, and looked at the hat, but did not touch it. She said, that was not her George's hat. I then asked her if that was not the hat that Mrs. Turner had given her. She said, her George's hat had got a broader band than the band that was on the hat of that child. Mrs. Turner had given her 
               <persName id="t18130407-23-person220">George</persName>
             a hat, but she had taken that band off that was on that hat, and put on a broader, and therefore she knew that was not her George's hat. I asked her to examine the cap. She looked at the cap. She said, it was not her George's cap. I then asked her if that was not the cap that was made out of a piece of silk that Mrs. Blakey gave her. She said, no, that was not the cap. She said, she had made the child a black cap, but the child had more; and the child's hair began to grow, and it was going out to nurse; that she had burnt the cap. I then asked her where the child was. She said her child was at nurse at her aunt's at Brompton. I took my pencil then, and a bit of paper, to take a direction. I asked her what her aunt's name was. She said, Roberts; she lived facing of Brompton church. I wrote these particulars down in the vault, at the coffin. I asked her, whether her aunt was a lodger or a housekeeper. She said, she was a lodger. I then asked her the name of the person that kept the house. She said, she did not know. I asked her what number it was; that she did not know; she believed it was 14, 16, or 18, she could not tell what exactly, but her aunt was well known there; if I only asked for Mrs. Roberts, any body knew her. I then told her that I should go to her aunt's and see whether her child was there.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she say anything to that - A. No. After that, we went into Mr. Sheppard's again, and there Mr Jones, my partner, came in and Mr. Voyce likewise; they two came in together. I then said to Mr. Voyce, I had got a direction; where the child was, and I thought it proper to go to Brompton and see it. I asked Mr. Voyce whether it would not be proper for me to go to Brompton. He said, yes, by all means. Then I left the two women in the care of Mr. Jones, and I went to Brompton, and made the best of my way there. When I came to Brompton I found Brompton chapel, but no church. I enquired at every house where the chapel was. The doors were numbered. I think 11 or 13 is the highest number in the place. I made diligent search. I found no such person as Roberts. I was an hour and a half enquiring all over the streets. I came back again. I saw Sarah Evans next at Hatton Garden office. I told her she might have saved me the trouble of going to Brompton; she well knew I should not find her aunt there. I had been enquiring all about there, there was no such person as Roberts to be found. She said, she did not know; her aunt told her she lived there. Then I asked her directly whether ever she had been to her aunts. She said, no. I asked her how her child came at her aunt's. She said, her aunt had sent a woman for it. I asked her then how long her aunt had lived at Brompton. She said she had not been there above three or four weeks. We then went into the office before the magistrate. I was sent off to find the boy that pulled the child out. I heard no more of the conversation. When I came back again the committment was made out.</p>

            . Q. Where do you live - A. At No. 3, Westminster-road.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect, on the day the prisoner was taken before the magistrate, meeting her in company of the beadle - A. Yes, in Warwick-lane. She passed by me. I said, Mrs. Evans, are you above speaking to me. She turned round, and said, that a man came and told her that a child was drowned in the New River. I told her I had seen the child on the Sunday night.</p>
               <p>COURT. Had you seen the prisoner on the Sunday night - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. Did you go with the man and the prisoner to the church - A. Yes. I there saw the body of the child.</p>
               <p>Q. And was it shewn to the prisoner - A. Yes, and the prisoner said it was not hers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the child in its life time - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the body of the child that you saw, the prisoner's child - A. I am not positive it was the child.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the body of the child - A. No. The clothes were cut down, because she said there was a mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she desired to look at the child - A. Yes, and when she looked at it, she said it was not hers.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she desired to look at the clothes - A. Yes, she looked at the clothes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did not you hear her asked to look at the hat and the cap - A. Not distinctly. I did not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. What did the prisoner say about the clothes - A. She said, none of the clothes were the clothes that her child had on.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said about the cap - A. Yes, a gentlewoman was there that said she had given the prisoner the stuff to make the cap. Her name is Blakey. The prisoner said that she had left off the cap before she had taken the child away.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the cap shewn to the prisoner - A. Yes, at the vault, and the hat was shewn. She said, that she had left the cap off, and she had taken the gold band off the hat, and had put on a black ribbon; and the shoes and stockings were shewn to the prisoner. I don't know what she said about the shoes and stockings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. How long have you known the prisoner. Was not she a kind and affectionate mother - A. Always, what I saw of her.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew George - A. Yes, by her coming with him to see the person that I lived servant with. She had come to Mr. Brooks's house frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. You lived servant with Mr. Brooks - A. Yes, and she brought the child with her when she came.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, you told her when you met her in Warwick-lane<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070019"></xptr>that you had been to see the child - A. Yes, and it was impossible to tell the child; the child was all over dirt.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not tell her that you had seen her the night before, because you had not seen her the night before. The beadle is not correct in saying that, is he - A. I had not seen her the night before; he is not correct in that.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, you went with her to the church, you saw the body of the child - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you able to say that was the child - A. I was not indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember her looking for a mark on the left side - A. Yes; she could not see it.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see it - A. No. She said, if it is my 
               <persName id="t18130407-23-person222">George</persName>
             I shall know him by the mark on the left side.</p>
               <p>COURT. Had you ever seen that mark - A. No, nor I never heard of it before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Was the countenance of the child altered by being swelled - A. Yes, so that I could not tell the least feature in the world of her child.</p>
               <p>Q. You walked with her all the way from Warwick-lane to the church - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, I ask you, did you ever see a person more calm and tranquil in their mind than what she was - A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Where did you live at the time that you saw the child - A. I then lodged in Holborn. I was not at Mr. Brooks's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You did not see her at all on the Sunday - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you going when you met her - A. I was going over into the Borough; I met her by accident. I was not going to call upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Sunday evening, did any body mention that it was Sarah Evans's child - A. A man said, there was a child taken out of the New River, and they thought it to be a person's that lived at a chandler's shop. Mrs. Evans lived at a chandler's shop They did not mention the name of

               <p>Q. Did you ever see the child with any of the clothes on - A. I have seen him with such a hat on as the child had that was taken out of the water. I had never seen the cap before.</p>
               <p>Q. What led you to that part on Sunday night - A. I was invited to take a cup of tea in that neighbourhood, by Mrs. Webber.</p>

            , in my house, frequently. I have no doubt about the hat and the cap in the world.</p>
               <p>Q. On what day did the prisoner go into Mr. Brooks's service - A. On the 22nd of February.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner bring the child George to Mr. Brooks's - A. She had formerly.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to the vault on the 15th of March, did you see the prisoner there - A. I did. I saw the prisoner there; she seemed quite composed and calm. When she saw me she said, Mrs. Newman, they say this is my George. I replied, what do you think, Mrs. Evans. No, said she, it is not my George. She said, it was not her child; it appeared much too large. I then desired her to look at the hat and cap. She said she had taken the cap off before she had seen me. When she called at my house prior to this, she said that she was going to send this child thirty miles in the country.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that when she said she was going to send it thirty miles - A. That was a few days prior to her returning to Mr. Brook's. She went to Mr. Brook's on the Tuesday. I asked her if she had heard of the child. She said that she had; he had got down safe, and was well. When I met the prisoner in the vault, and desired her to look at the hat and the cap, then she said in the vault that she had sent him into the country, and the child's hat had a broader band; she had taken the band off and put a black ribbon round. I then said, the shoes? Her answer was, that she had not sent him thirty miles in the country; he was with his aunt at Brompton. I then asked her if she thought it likely that her aunt would come from Brompton to drown this child in the New River. She said, she could not tell, for her aunt was a very bad woman. I then said, that I would not trust a child of mine with a person that I knew to be bad.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your view of the child did you think it was the child George - A. I thought it was; I would not swear it. As to the hat and cap, I am positive. I had told Mrs. Evans that I would give her a hat of my grandson's. She said, Mrs. Turner gave her that; it would do very well, and the child was to have a new one when he got down.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. The prisoner has lived with Mr. Brooks before - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your mother takes care of Mr. Brooks's house - A. Yes, and I always thought her a kind affectionate mother.</p>
               <p>MR. BROOKS. Q. I believe you are a printer in Paternoster-row - A. I am. The prisoner, at the time she was apprehended, was in my service.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that part of your premises so situated that if she had liked she might have made her escape - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. When she was once up stairs if she had chose to evade the officer she might have done so - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Brooks, the prisoner has lived in your service before - A. Yes. My housekeeper took her in again. I had a good opinion of her during the time that she was with us.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, from your opinion of her, you are at the expence of defending her - A. Yes. I have that opinion of her that she is innocent.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the body of the child appear to you that it must have lain in water some time - A. Most assuredly. I should suppose the body must have been in water a fortnight or three weeks. The features were very much disfigured at the time I saw the child. At the time I saw the child there was a quantity of bloody serum issuing from its nose.</p>
               <p>COURT. I take it you did not know the child in its life time - A. No, I did not. The handkerchief round the child's neck had been removed when I saw it.</p>

               <p>COURT. Could you form any judgment whether the child died by suffocation or by drowning - A. The putrefaction had so far taken place, from the state of putrefaction, if the child had died of suffocation, if the handkerchief had been tied tight it would have gone through the integument. I cannot say from the appearance whether it was the one or the conjoint effect of both.</p>

She said, that she had no knowledge of them at all. She denied any knowledge of the child, or of any knowledge of the clothes.

She said, she had spoken the truth, and now I am easy. She said, she had declared all the truth, and whom she had given the child to. That the person she alluded to, as the person she met with on Sunday morning, was Mr. Aris, and that the child was to go into the country by his direction, that she was to meet him the same evening by his appointment in Gray's-inn-lane, but did not meet him, but met a person who said she came from Mr. Aris, to whom she delivered the child. The woman told her, as she returned back she would meet Aris. She told me that she did meet him some little distance off from where she parted with the child. He asked where the child was. She told him that she had delivered it up to a woman that he (Aris) had sent. He said, that was all very right; and that was all that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070021"></xptr>passed between them at that time. I asked her, why she did not make that confession at the first. I said, had you acknowledged the child at first, and made that confession, it would have taken a great deal of guilt off you. She said that Mr. Aris had desired her to say what she had. On the next day, Saturday, I fetched her from the House of Correction. She continued perfectly composed in her own mind. She said she had spoken the truth. I asked her every time in the morning I met her, how she was in her mind. She said she was perfectly composed in her mind, because she had spoken the truth.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. When you went to Hatton Garden office, the first thing done was to read the account of which the prisoner had given in your name, so that before you were asked what account you were to give you knew exactly what she charged you with - A. Not before it was read.</p>
               <p>Q. Her account was first read over to you, and then you were asked questions. - A. I think I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know it - A. I think I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know it, as certain as you stand there - A. Yes, I do. I have no doubt that was the case.</p>
               <p>Q. This young woman formerly lived in your service - A. She first was a prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. She was about the age of eighteen, and you took her into your service - A Yes, and she lived with me about a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Q.And you have since that seen her pretty frequent at different lodgings she had - A. The first lodging she had, I saw her pretty frequent. For the last several years I have seen her but seldom.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you ever know her at Mrs. Bittle's, in Kentish-town - A. Yes, that is seven or eight years ago. I have seen her seldom these last five years. In the course of the last five years I have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070023"></xptr>seen her once about six-months. I had not seen her for the last two years, only when I met her in Northampton-street, to the best of my recollection, but I cannot tell. I know nothing about dates. She lived in Vineyard-street. I believe she might have called once or twice.</p>
               <p>Q. You had hardly ever seen the child - A. Yes, I had seen it half a dozen times.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not know his name - A. I recollect his name now.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never given her anything for the support of that child before she swore it to you - A. I had given her money for a long time.</p>
               <p>Q. Since you have been discharged from Cold-bath-fields prison you have been distressed for want of money - A. Very much.</p>
               <p>Q. How many children have you had to maintain - A. Seven or eight.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you include this woman's children in the eight - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then that is eleven. Have you had the expence and burthen of maintaining any more besides these eight and this woman's three. Did not you send one to Yorkshire - A. Yes; it was sent at my expence to Yorkshire.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, do you mean to swear that you had not the burthen of maintaining any more - A. I do not call it a burthen.</p>
               <p>Q. You have had no intercourse with her to support that imputation - A. Not with the last.</p>
               <p>Q. With George - A. I will not say that.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a married man - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not reckon these three in with the eight. Now, besides this woman's children, have you been called upon to maintain more - A.There has been another child sworn. I have not paid.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember, Mr. Aris, visiting the prisoner one wet evening about two years ago - A. No, no such thing happened, not as I recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard her examination. You do not admit that she ever lent you an handkerchief. Now look at that handkerchief - A. I borrowed no handkerchief of her, nor was I ever possessed of such a handkerchief in my life. I never, in all my existence; was possessed of such a handkerchief as that.</p>
               <p>Q. You swear that - A. I will swear it five hundred times.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, sir, who washed for you in the month of January last - A. A person that slept with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Not your wife - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did no other person wash for you. You were in the King's-bench last January - A. Yes. While I was there, there was a woman washed for me. I declare I don't know her name. I left the House of Correction for two years and a half, and the last six months I do not know that ever I stepped out of the house on Sundays.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Is that child alive that you sent to Yorkshire - A. I understand it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Who pays for it - A. I don't know that any body pays for it.</p>
               <p>

            . I am a green-grocer. I formerly lived in in Brook's-market. I live now in Turnmill street, No. 8.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Mr. Aris in last February - A. Yes. I have known him a long time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you spend any Sunday with him in the course of February - A. I have been at his house every Sunday except two, in the dwelling where he is now. He went to Webber-street on Saturday, the latter end of January. I removed him there on a Saturday. The next Sunday I did not go, and the second Sunday I did not go there then.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the circumstance of Aris being sent for at the police-office, Hatton Garden - A. No. I know he has been there, because I have been there myself at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to Mr. Aris's house of a Sunday, how long did you stay - A. I did not stay much after eight o'clock, and when I was there Aris was always at home. He staid at home during the time I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. On what day was it you saw Aris at Hattont Garden office - A. I think it was Thursday that Aris was at Hatton Garden office.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect being at his house on the Sunday before the Thursday - A. I certainly was there, and I dare say he was there, but I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. Were you ever servant to Mr. Aris - A. I had a key at the House of Correction.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you with him - A. About a twelvemonth. I cannot say exactly. When Mr. Aris went into the Bench, he sent to me. He had a house for a little time facing the Bench.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me why you, a green grocer, was always with Aris of a Sunday - A. I might go two or three days of a week, and always on a Sunday I went there to make him a garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Could your shop afford you to go three times a week and always on a Sunday - A. I have gone at eight o'clock in the morning. I might have stopped there an hour; and I have gone there again in the afternoon. On Sundays in February I have been there both morning and afternoon. I have sometimes staid from five until past eight; seldom shorter.</p>
               <p>Q. Aris could not go out on a Sunday when he was in the Bench, and when he was out of the Bench, Aris could only go out on a Sunday. What took your key from you in the House of Correction - A. They were reduced because there were too many, when Mr. Newport took it. I went in afterwards.</p>
               <p>MRS. FINCHER. Q. Do you know the sister of Mr. Aris. Did you ever point out the sister of Mr. Aris to the prisoner - A. No; I never knew her at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Aris - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you know the person of the prisoner - A. I saw her once. I never pointed out the sister to her. I never saw the sister.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My first defence was false; it was through the threats of Mr. Aris that I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070024"></xptr>made it; Mr. Aris was the cause of it. He has threatened to shoot me three times. The first time he threatened me was nine years ago, when I lodged in Cook's-row; and all I have repeated about Pancras parish was by his desire. I delivered the child to a woman by his desire; the woman that he brought to me before, for the purpose of going into the country. I saw the woman that he brought to me, saying, that was the woman that was going into the country to take the child. I had some conversation with the woman concerning her going into the country. I know nothing about the death of the child. I delivered it to the woman according to his desire, on Sunday the 21st of February. I saw Mr. Aris afterwards, and when I met him, he asked me what I would say to the people that knew I was going to get the child into Pancras house. I answered, I would go by his desire. He told me to say to the people that knew I tried to get it into the house, that I had delivered him to the Pancras people, and to those that did not know, I was to say that I had sent him to my own relations in the country. He said, if ever I told any person that he had taken the child he would surely be the death of me; and so he certainly would. He had threatened me many times; that made me make that first report, and that only,</p>
               <p>COURT Q. to Thissclton. The prisoner was in custody when you found the child's frock - A. She was. I never had any communication with her about it.</p>
               <p>MRS. SIMPSON. Do you know Mr. Aris - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In the month of February last, when he was in the King's-bench-prison, did you do some washing for him - A. I did. I washed for him four pocket handkerchiefs; one was a shambray handkerchief. One of the ends of the handkerchief was pointed, and the other round. It was in the form of a half handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this handkerchief - A. This is a shambray handkerchief; it answers the description of the handkerchief I washed for Mr. Aris. I believe it to be the handkerchief. One end of this handkerchief is round, and the other pointed. The colour is a little gone, and laying in water that time it would go. I know the handkerchief by a join in the corner, not by the colour; such things as these are apt to fade, and soaking it in water for three weeks I should think would reduce it to this appearance.</p>

               <p>Salisbury-square. On 14 th Sept. I was walking along Whitechapel—I saw Cronan hopping along, apparently lame—I did not see Banden then—I then felt a catch, and saw Cronan a second time, he was then by my side—I said to him, "What are you pulling my cloak for?"—I then felt in my pocket and I had lost my purse, which I had had half an hour before—both the prisoners were then on my right side—I said to my brother-in-law, "That boy has got my purse"—Banden said something to Cronan, but I could not hear what—my brother-in-law and I went after the prisoners—they walked a short distance and saw we were pursuing them, and Cronan ran away across the street—I was running and calling, "Stop thief!" and Bandon came and said, "What has he done, Ma'am"—I said, "He has got my purse"—Bandon said, "I will catch him; I will catch him," and he ran past me—my purse had contained two half-crowns and three or four shillings—I am confident as to the identity of the prisoners.</p>

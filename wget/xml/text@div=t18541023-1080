                  </hi>. I am a tailor. In the afternoon of 14th Sept, I was with Short at the Three Castles tavern—I remember Short going out, after drinking with me, and in ten minutes or quarter of an hour after he went out of the Castles, I heard a noise—to tell you the truth, I did not know that it was outside—I went out, and saw the policeman with two persons in custody—I did not see Short there.</p>

I am a porter, and lived at No. 17, Holliday-yard, Ludgate-hill; I know the shop of Mrs. Passfield, a pork butcher past St. Andrew's-hill On 14th Sept, I saw Short and another person go past the shop between a quarter to 5 and 5 o'clock—I saw two oilier persons carry<lb></lb>ing a box down Creed-lane—Short was then in my sight—he and another were right opposite Mrs. Passfield's shop—I have no doubt that Short was one of the persons who was near Mrs. Passfield's shop.</p>

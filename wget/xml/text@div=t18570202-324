                  </hi>. On 1st Nov. the prisoner came to me—I was at that time starting a paper, the <hi rend="italic">West Middlesex Advertiser</hi>—it appeared for the first time on that day—it depended upon Pimlico, Brompton, and that neigh<lb></lb>bourhood—the prisoner came and brought one of the papers with him—he stated that he was the sole collector of advertisements for Mr. Smith, in the Strand, and that he did business for them to the amount of some thousands—he offered to purchase the first part of my paper, and give me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week for it, for the profits on all advertisements—I declined that—he then asked me if I would engage him on the percentage plan, to collect advertisements for me at 20 percent., and to pay every Saturday for the money he brought in, I agreed to that—on the 15th he called again, and asked me for a cheque in advance—he told me Messrs. Smiths owed him 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and as he could not go to town on the Friday, he asked me for a cheque on account—I gave him a cheque</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185702020089"></xptr>
               <p>for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was induced to give it him from the representation he made that Messrs. Smith owed him the money, and that it was inconvenient for him to go on Friday, in consequence of his appropriating his time to collect advertise<lb></lb>ments for my paper.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe he gave you a receipt for the cheque? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I believe my solicitor has got it—the cheque has been cashed and returned—I believe the prisoner collected advertisements for me the first week to a very trifling amount—my wife always kept the account with him—she had one book, and the prisoner had one—5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was the total amount he brought in—that was the whole amount of cash—he brought in the advertisements he had got, and they appeared on the follow<lb></lb>ing Saturday—he brought no account further than when they were paid, and they were scratched off from my wife's book, and from his book—my wife is here, and the book is here—during the five or six weeks he was with me, he only paid in 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money—the persons were desired not to pay without a printed receipt—I cannot tell the gross amount of advertisements he brought in—several of them were false—I applied to the persons, and found them false—when I had reason to doubt his correctness, I sent out bills, and then discovered this fraud altogether—there are several persons here who paid him, and he never handed the money over to us—he gave me this receipt at the time I gave him the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—(<hi rend="italic">read:</hi>"Received ten pounds on account of my commission for collecting advertisements.")</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose the money had been paid, what would you owe him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The amount of the advertisements he received was about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he had paid in 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he would have been entitled to his commission on that amount; but a great many advertisements were inserted which were not paid—a great many of them came in previous to my seeing the prisoner—all that we have received, amounts to upwards of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but some of them he did not bring—I cannot tell what was due to him for what he brought in—I saw it would be complex, and I stated that he should have his commis<lb></lb>sion weekly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But this 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was a loan; unless he had been engaged to collect adver<lb></lb>tisements, you would not have thought of giving him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I con<lb></lb>sidered that he would earn that, and I should have stopped it out of the money he gained by commission—there was not an advertisement to be inserted for twelve months, except the false ones which he brought in—on 16th Dec., he asked me for the loan of 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said that it was preposterous to make that request, he had had 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from me, and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from my wife—he did not apply to me for money due to him till after this—when he applied for the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I said, "Let the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. run out, and then we will settle every Saturday"—I would not have given him the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if he had not been collecting advertisements.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness. I heard the state<lb></lb>ment made by the prisoner when he came to our house on 1st Nov.—he said he was the sole agent for Mr. Smith, the great newsvendor in the Strand,</p>

               <p>and he should like to purchase the front of the paper for advertisements, which Mr. Loxdale declined—he then said, "I will collect advertisements for you for 20 per cent.," which was agreed to—I was not present when the cheque was given.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs. Smith, in the Strand. The prisoner did collect advertisements for them; it is not true that he was their sole agent, or sole collector—it is not true that they owed him 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they owed him no money—there would have been a small sum due to him in May next, 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there was no money due to him at that time—he had been paid in advance.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and lodge in the house of Mr. Paul Plant, in the parish of Bethnal-green—I do not know the name of the parish further than that. On Saturday night, the 6th of May, about nine o'clock, or a quarter past, I was going into the wash-house for a pail of water, and the prisoner was coming out—there is no door out of the wash-house into the open air—when I opened the wash-house door, the prisoner bad got the copper in his hands—it had been set in bricks before, and he must have loosened it—I took hold of him, and called out, "The copper, the copper"—I had a candle on the table—he pushed me back, and ran out—the witness seized him, and a policeman was sent for, who took him in charge—it was quite dark at the time—the family were all up in the parlour; Mr. Plant, his wife, a little boy, and a man-servant—the wash-house door had been bolted—it is an inner door—it is a public-house, and the street door was open—I suppose he had opened the wash-house door—it bolts inside a passage in the house—any body coming in at the street door could unbolt it—it was not locked.</p>

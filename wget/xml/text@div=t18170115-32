            . I am an officer of Tower Ward; on the 21st of December, about six o'clock in the evening, I was watching about the New Custom-house. I saw the prisoner coming towards the gate, from within the premises, and make a stop, and looked about; he stooped down, and appeared to draw something from under him; he walked off very quick: I stopped him, and asked him what he had got - He begged for mercy; I found he had got some old lead in his hand, in a bag. I secured him, with difficulty; he ran away after he was hand-cuffed. The lead weighed ten pounds. I saw his hand quite under the gate.</p>

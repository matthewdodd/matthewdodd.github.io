               <p>Q. What time might it be when you got to Scott's? - A. It was about ten minutes after one when I left Scott's.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay there? - A. From the time I went from the public-house till I went home.</p>
               <p>Q. You changed your linen, did you not? - A. Yes; I wanted to take my shirt with me, but Mrs. Scott said I had better put it on, for fear I should lose it.</p>
               <p>Q. When you put it on, you went away? - A. I left Scott at home, put a clean pair of stockings in my pocket, and put a clean shirt on, and left the dirty one there.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you going then? - A. I was going home, and when I came out of Buckle-street, round the corner, the prisoner followed me, and when I came into Red Lion-street, I saw them.</p>

               <p>Q. When you got out of the public-house what happened? - A. I went down Leman-street, and down White Lion-street, when I came to the bottom of White Lion-street, and was crossing the way over the street, there were three women standing at the corner of Well-street; I stopped there, and one of the women asked me if I would go home with her.</p>

               <p>Q.Where to? - A. To Saltpetre-bank; she wanted me to go with her, but I would not go any further with her; I only saw her to Saltpetre-bank, and wished her a good night; when I came back again, there is a small passage in Saltpetre-bank, to the right hand, and before I had hardly entered one step into the passage, the prisoner, Burne, knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know it was the same man? - A. I know it, because he had an apron on at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. You went with the woman there - they did not follow you, did they? - A. Yes; they followed me all the way there, and all the way back.</p>
               <p>Q.Close to you? - A. Yes, not out of my fight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner at the bar appear to know the three women? - A. I dare say they did.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not gather that from any circumstance? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the man knock you down with? - A. With his fists; and the little one came up and stopped my mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the before or behind when he knocked you down? - A. He came behind me.</p>
               <p>Q. When he knocked you down, what did you say the little one did? - A. He stopped my mouth; the little one came to assist him; I was afraid they would kill me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Burne do? - A. He felt in my pocket, and took every thing from me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he take out? - A. He took every thing from me, except a pocket knife he left me; he took money, and every thing.</p>
               <p>Q. What money had you? - A. I had one shilling in silver, and a shilling in copper, in penny pieces and halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel him take the money from you? - A. Yes, I cried out, for God's sake, let me alone, and I will give you what I have got; they hurt me in such a manner.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you prevented from crying out? - A. Yes; he held my mouth with great force, I snatched it away twice or three times, and then he put his hand again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they take any thing from you besides the shilling in the silver and the copper? - A. My tobacco box, and a pair of stockings besides.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of the women during this time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How far might this be from the place where the women were? - A. About ten feet from where I lest the women.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they do when they had taken, the things from you? - A. They then ran away down Saltpetre-bank as fast as they could.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect yourself so far as to say positively which it was that took your money from you? - A. Both of them were upon me, I cannot say rightly which it was; they blinded me almost with knocking me about; I was afraid they would kill me, if I did cry out; I could not cry out, because I was afraid they would kill me.</p>
               <p>Q. How much gin did you drink? - A. We had two quarterns together.</p>
               <p>Q. You drank a couple of glasses yourself? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you drink? - A. I drank one glass.</p>
               <p>Q. When they ran off, did you call to the watchman to pursue them? - A. No; I was in such a condition, I hardly knew where I was; I could hardly walk.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did they strike you? - A. In my face and in my eye.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your eye cut? - A. It was quite black the next morning all the way up.</p>
               <p>Q. As soon you found you could walk pretty well, you went home, I suppose? - A. I went straight home.</p>
               <p>Q. Who lives with you at home? - A. One Staggles; I am a lodger; he keeps the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he a wife? - A. Yes, a wife and child.</p>

               <p>Q. How far? - A. I suppose about two streets; through Wellclose-square and another long street; it may be about a quarter of a mile.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you do so when you are sober? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At that hour of the night? - A. No; they asked me to have some gin, at first I said, no, that I had had enough; they said, a drop of gin would not hurt me, and I went in.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you have never said, that you had anniseed, and that you were in a state of intoxication? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear you were sober? - A. I cannot say I was quite sober, I had drank a little; I knew what I was about, and every thing that went forward.</p>

               <p>Q. How came the watchman and Exter to come together, had he hold of Exter? - A. No; the watchman came in behind them, they came in first, and the watchman had some liquor as well as them.</p>

               <p>Q. Then the watchman had not either of them in custody, only came to drink as the others did? - A. Only came to drink as the others did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the condition that Exter appeared to be in? - A. He appeared to be, rather in liquor, and I scrupled serving them, but to get rid of them I did; they had a glass of gin, and one had a small glass of anniseed; one of the prisoners said, he could not drink gin.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the anniseed? - A. White, who is the shortest.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prosecutor stagger much? - A. He did stagger, rather.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to be dirty, as having fallen down? - A. Not the least, he appeared to have a clean shirt on at the time, as his bosom was open.</p>
               <p>Q. Like a man in a disordered state? - A. No; he told me he had been to his washerwoman, and that she wanted him to button his waistcoat up, but he would not stop, and she told me so the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. They staid but a little time, did they? - A. Not five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they all go together? - A.They all went together.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the watchman? - A. I rather think he went out first, or rather before them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The prosecutor was in such a state, that you did not like to serve him? - A. Yes; but the prisoners persisted, and said, you had better have a glass with us.</p>
               <p>Q. One of them had a glass of gin? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known the prosecutor before, or was he a stranger to you? - A. He was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any stockings? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him and the officers? - A. I went to the Police-office, where I saw him, the prisoners, and the officers.</p>
               <p>Q. Some of them are to be witnesses to day - are they not? - A. They are here.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation about the reward? - A. No, I would not wish for any of it.</p>
               <p>Q. I only wish to ascertain whether you did not hear a conversation about a reward? - A. No, I did not; they are not in the habit of using my house; I should think there is a reward, because she law speaks of it.</p>
               <p>Q. The prosecutor knew of it as well as you? - A. No doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Court Q. How do you know? - A. I doubt whether he does or not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Have you not heard him speak of it? - A. No, I never heard him, or the officers, or any body else.</p>
               <p>Court Q. You had some conversation with the prosecutor-did he talk rationally? - A. He did not talk much.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180212010038"></xptr>Q. Did he appear to have his understanding? - A. He appeared to me to conduct himself very well; I should not have served either of them, if the watchman had not come in with them.</p>

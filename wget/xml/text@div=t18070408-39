            . Do you know the prisoner. - A. Yes, she lodged with me one week. On Saturday the 14th of March I went out at nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q Did you leave the prisoner in the house. - A. No, she went out to the White Swan, in Shoreditch. I told her I was going to work at Mr. Milwards, at Hackney. I returned about seven o'clock in the evening; I called up the prisoner at the White Swan; I told her I was come home. When I went home I missed my gown, shawl and cloak; I went back to the Swan directly, and the prisoner was gone; I met with her at the Swan the next morning; she said she had not robbed me; she ran out of the house, I followed her into Shoreditch; then she struck at me, I said, Oh! Mrs. Barnes, do not be so cruel; she crossed over the way into Kingsland-road, and ran through Saunder's gardens; I met Mr. Mason, and he took her in custody. When he searched her she gave the duplicate to me, she had it in her hand; I gave it to Mr. Mason.</p>

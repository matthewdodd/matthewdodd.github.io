On Saturday night, the 27th of June, about ten o'clock, or a little later, I went up stairs to my bed-room; I had locked the bed-room door, and left the room quite safe about half an hour before - I fastened the window of that room with a drop-key at the side: it is a sash window, and opens into a lane at the side of the house - when I went up I put the key into the lock, and could not turn it one way or the other; I pushed against the door twice, and the second time it opened a little and sprang back in my face again - I found there was some one inside; I caught hold of the knob of the door, held it, and called out for my husband (the door opens inside the room); it was dark - I had left a candle in the room when I locked it; my husband came up, and just as he got on the landing the door was forced from my hold, and four men came out - I caught the first, and held him as long as my strength would permit, and then he escaped; my husband caught two of them, who are the prisoners - he kept them - I went into the bed-room, and found the light still there; I examined, and found one chest of drawers had been opened and the things, which had been in the drawers, tied up in bundles - two boxes were pulled from under the bed; I missed a small necklace from a second drawer - I had seen it that morning; the door appeared to me to have been opened by a chisel; I could tell by the marks that it had been broken open from the stair-case, and not inside - the room window was a little open at the bottom; it is one story high - the prisoners were taken away; I did not take notice of them myself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.Who had the key of the door? A. I kept it in my pocket; I was a good deal alarmed - there is a club-room on the same floor; it is seven or eight yards from the bed-room door - there was company in that room; I am sure four persons came out of the bed-room together - I have not stated that two came out first; some people came out of the club-room when the alarm was given, but not till after I had cried to my husband; I caught the knob of the door, and held it- the men forced the door from my hand just as my husband got up close to the door; it was before they came out of the room - they might have got out of the window if they had tried.</p>

Yes; I cannot say whether the prisoners were members of the club, or whether they had been in the club-room that night - I had seen them drinking in a room down stairs about an hour before I went up; I should not know the man who I caught hold of.</p>

            . I keep a public-house in Whitechapel, in the parish of St. Mary; I do not know any other name for it. On Saturday, the 27th of June, about ten o'clock, I was serving in the bar; several customers were before the bar - my wife went up stairs to fetch the candle down, which she had left on the stove when she put the children to bed; she had not been up half a minute before she called to me, and said she was sure there were thieves in the room - I immediately took a candle which stood at the end of the counter, and ran up stairs; when I got to the top she was struggling with one man just in the door way - I placed my candle on a shelf at the top of the banisters as I saw her struggling, and I saw the next one come out; that was the prisoner Grainger - I saw him come out of the room; I saw him in the room, and as he came out, there is a step of about six inches, and he fell forward; as he fell I struck him on the nose - the next that came out was Spencer; I saw him come out, and as he came out he struck at me, and I struck at him - he tumbled over the other prisoner; they were both down together - another person came out of the room directly after, and made his escape.</p>
               <p>Q.After the two prisoners were on the floor did you call for assistance? A. I called. and a young man, Henry, who lives in the house, and occasionally waits in the tap-room, came - I secured Grainger, and he secured Spencer; the candle went out during the scuffle - I cannot say whether it was before I knocked the man down or not, for a gas-light in the bar showed a light on the stairs - the light was burning when I saw the two prisoners come out of the room; I lost a gold seal from a bureau in the room - I had seen it safe two or three days before, about Wednesday; I delivered the prisoners to Brown the officer, who came - on Sunday morning, as soon as I opened the house, a man brought in a bunch of keys and a chisel; I knew him as a customer, but do not know his name - he is not here; I had not seen the prisoners in the house - neither of them were members of the club to my knowledge; I examined the door - it had been broken from the outside by a chisel or something, by the marks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.You have a club-room on the same floor? A. It is not exactly level, there is a difference of two steps - the door of one room can be seen from the other; Henry attended the club-room - he might go there every ten or five minutes; there are none of the club here - I placed the candle on a shelf at the head of the stairs - it would not cause a shadow to pass on the door; when the noise was heard the people in the club-room opened the door - I swear the prisoners did not come out of the club-room; I saw them come out of the bed-room.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.You are sure you saw four men come out of the bed-room? A. Yes; my wife caught the first - I took the prisoners, and the fourth escaped down stairs; I had got them both - the waiter came and took Spencer from me, and took him down stairs; I saw him in his custody all the time, till he was given to the constable - he was not out of my sight at all.</p>

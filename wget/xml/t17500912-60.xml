I went abroad to the East Indies in the year 1744, and came home again the 14th or 15th of June last. I live in lower Shadwell. My wife had taken the prisoner into her house, as he was in great distress, a poor ragged boy, and said he had not lain under a roo for above three months together before. So when I came home, I gave him my seafaring cloaths and cotton shirts, and I paid all the debts my wife had contracted in my absence. She said to me one day of a neighbour, here is a man, who has been a friend to me in your absence. Said I, if he has given you water, give him wine. I sent my wife home for half a guinea out of my chest. She went and brought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175009120029"></xptr> it me; and when we went home, my chest was broke open, my money in the indictment gone, and the prisoner took. I heard of him in about three weeks after. He had spent all my money but 4 l. 7 s. which he return'd me before Esq Clark, and gave me the purse it was in when he took it. It was produc'd in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.</p>

               <p>Jane Macdaniel. I am to the prosecutor. When my husband sent me home for the half guinea, the prisoner was in the house, I could not unlock the chest, I desired he would unlock it, which he did; he went down stairs again, before I had opened the chest. I took out a half guinea, and left the other gold, mentioned before, in the purse, and locked the chest again. Then I went to my husband, and when we came home again, the chest was broke open, and the prisoner and money all gone. He was taken up in the Borough, and owned the fact, and said, there were honester men than himself hang'd; but if he was to be hang'd, it was fit he should have all the money.</p>

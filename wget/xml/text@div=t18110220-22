               <p>Q. Had you ever seen the men before - A. Never, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dark - A. It was very moonlight.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the men disguised - A. They were; they were in light smock frocks.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they any thing over their faces - A. I perceived one had something under his hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they crape over their faces - A. No, they had not. They were on foot.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of observing their faces - A. I had, of one more particularly than the other.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed when they came up to you - A. A something was uttered, but what I do not know. They took from me a silver hunting watch; they stopped me as I was passing on the road; they were going the same way that I was; they separated, and as I came up they both took hold of the bridle of the poney.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember what they said - A. No, I cannot positively say what they said.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they demand your property - A. They said a something, and immediately a pistol was presented to me by the prisoner Pickmore, if he be the man, but I am not positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of the other - A. I am positive that Oldham is the other.</p>
               <p>Q. One of them presented a pistol - A. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. And demanded your money - A. They uttered something, I do not know what. I immediately begged that they would not ill use me, and told them that they should have every thing that I had; I put my hand into my pocket, and gave them three one pound notes, and some silver; I cannot positively say how much silver it was, from ten to fifteen shillings. I will not say what, but some silver I am positive; I believe there were some shillings, a half crown, and a crown piece, but I am not positive whether there was a dollar or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give them any thing else - A. There was a bill that I had taken up at Masterman's, White Hart Court. I gave them nothing else. The prisoner Oldham drew my watch from my fob.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the chair out or not - A. The chain was out, and the seal and key.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they take any thing else from you - A. No, excepting a pocket handkerchief, but I am not positive, probably I might have lost it that afternoon; whether it was taken by the prisoners I cannot say; I have not seen it again since.</p>

               <p>Q. When they had taken that did they leave you - A. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. They did not use you ill - A. No, they did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were they with you in the whole - A. I cannot positively say, but a very short time; I think not scarce a minute; a very short time indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you frightened - A. A little alarmed, not so much as I was afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you see them again - A. I saw them at Bow-street office on the Saturday following, as they stopped me on the Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of your own knowledge whether any of your property was found upon them - A. None I believe whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw them on the Saturday at Bow-street did you know either of them - A. Yes, I knew the prisoner Oldham the moment I saw him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. I think you tell us it was about seven o'clock - A. No, about six.</p>
               <p>Q. Two men were going the same way as you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Their faces then were not towards you, you had therefore no opportunity, though it was moon-light, of observing their features untill you came up - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came up to them they separated, and each seized both sides of your bridle - A. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. Which very much surprised you - A. Not so much at first. It did surprise me. I at first thought it was some of my friends.</p>
               <p>Q. They had their hats on - A. They had.</p>
               <p>Q. You sitting upon your horse, I take it you were above them - A. Very little.</p>
               <p>Q. The sight that you had of their faces must be a downward sight - A. No, I had a straight forward view, they were close when my watch was drawn.</p>
               <p>Q. It was scarcely a minute - A. I cannot say what time.</p>
               <p>Q. You were somewhat alarmed, though not much - A. Somewhat.</p>
               <p>Q. One of the men had something under his hat - which was that - A. The prisoner Oldham.</p>
               <p>Q. Whatever that was contributed to shade the face - A. Very little.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, having asked you these questions, I put this to you, can you venture to swear positively to any man that you had never seen before in your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181102200015"></xptr>life can you swear positively to this man - A. I have sworn positively, my conscience will not allow me to say otherwise.</p>
               <p>Q.When you went to Bow-street I believe you went there for the purpose of seeing some persons that were apprehended for robbing, were you not - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. You went there expecting to see them - A.I went there with an idea of seeing some prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. That had robbed you - A. I could not tell.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the object that you went for - A It was.</p>
               <p>Q. You said it was quite moon-light, were there no clouds intervening at all - A There were some clouds I believe. I can venture to swear that I could see a man one hundred and fifty yards before me at least.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was this - A. Monday January the 7th.</p>
               <p>Q. A fortnight afterwards you saw them - A. No, on Saturday.</p>
               <p>COURT. When you saw them do you remember whether the moon was shining in their faces - A. It was; the moon was behind me; it shone into their faces.</p>
               <p>JOHN UPTON. I am one of the Bow-street patrols. I was in company with Cross, Avery, and Lloyd, on Tuesday the 8th of January, passing by the Shepherd and Shepherdess public-house, going to the Shepherd and Shepherdess Fields, I met the prisoners Oldham and Pickmore coming before me. I saw Oldham pull his hat over his eyes. I seized Oldham, I asked him whether he had any pistols about him, he replied he had not; Cross said that Pickmore had thrown it over the sence.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from Old Ford were they - A. This was near the City road, it might be two miles from Old Ford, I cannot exactly speak to that distance, Cross told Avery to go over, he did not find it then. We took the prisoner to the Shepherd and Shepherdess public-house, they got a light and went to look for the pistol; after they came back I saw the pistol in Cross's hands; I searched Oldham, I found a silver watch on him, a dollar, a few halfpence, and a box like a tobacco box, containing some gunpowder, and four pieces of lead, a flannel night cap, and an old silk handkerchief; I asked Oldham where he spent his afternoon, he informed me that he had been at the Angel, smoking his pipe along with Pickmore; I took them up to the Angel, I asked the waiter, I found they had. We took them to the public-office, where they were examined, and committed for further hearing.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On Tuesday the 8th of January I was with Upton and Avery, I saw the two prisoners coming towards us, Upton took hold of Oldham, and I took hold of Pickmore. As soon as I took hold of him, to the best of my belief, he put his hand into his breeches, and throwed something over the fence; I called to Avery, he went over, he did not find it then; then I said I should take them to the Shepherd and Shepherdess. Upon my searching of Pickmore I took from him a silver hunting-watch, and this pocket-book, containing some shop bills, memorandums, and duplicates.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know whose watch it is - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Has Mr. Cooper seen it - A. I believe he has.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cooper. That is not my watch.</p>
               <p>Cross At the Shepherd and Shepherdess I asked the landlord to lend me a lanthorn and candle. Avery and I went, and in searching I found a pistol about six yards from where he throwed it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp You found nothing upon them belonging to Mr. Cooper - A. No.</p>
               <p>Oldham left his defence to his counsel; called five witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Pickmore was not put on his defence.</p>

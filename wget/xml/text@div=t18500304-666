                  </hi>. I live at Wandsworth, and had charge of a farm for Mr. Beaumont. I occupied and slept in the farm-house alone—on Tuesday, 12th Feb., between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, I went out to work leaving the house securely fastened—I returned at a quarter past twelve, and on opening the front-door, I noticed a key lying in the passage—it was the key of the kitchen-door, which I had left in it—the kitchen-door was closed to, but the lock had been forced back—I noticed a square of glass in the window broken, opposite the fastening, so as to enable a person to remove the fastening, and by that means the window might he opened to admit a person; there were marks on the kitchen-door—I found a knife and fork of mine bent, as if they had been used for some purpose—I missed a black and a red silk handkerchief from my bed-room, a German-silver spoon, and a chimney ornament—there were footmarks on the ground outside the kitchen window—I afterwards saw the police-sergeant compare the marks with the marks made by a pair of boots, and the boots appeared capable of making such marks as those I had observed.</p>

On the morning of 12th Feb., about half-past twelve o'clock, I was in Wimbledon-park, and met the three pri<lb></lb>soners together, about 300 or 400 yards from the prosecutor's premises—I stopped Cooley, and the other two ran away into the underwood—I searched Cooley, and let him go—I afterwards assisted in apprehending the prisoners—I got Thomas Hill's boots—Walter Hill said that Thomas Hill was rather <hi rend="italic">soft</hi> yet—Cooley said, "I never have been to Brixton yet, but I suppose we shall get off with twelve months for this"—they were all then in the same cell—the two Hills are cousins.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, V</hi> 21). I went to Dunneford Farm, and found two footmarks outside the kitchen window, and another impression about a dozen paces off—I covered them over, to preserve them from the wet—the house is about fifty yards from the high-road, and enclosed by a fence—I assisted in apprehending the prisoners—I took Thomas Hill at his father's house—he said, if I wasted till he came out of the house, he would tell me all about it—I brought him out, and cautioned him, that what he did say I should have to use either for or against him—he said he would tell the truth, that he had been to Salter's, the match manufacturers; from thence he went to the farm-house, where Walter got a piece of wood, broke a square of glass, and Walter Hill and Cooley got inside, while he remained outside; on coming out, Cooley gave him a black handkerchief, which was in his possession when they were stopped in the park; and on Cooley returning, after being stopped by the policeman, he had made him give him the handkerchief back, and told him he would be d—d if he should have any part of it—Walter Hill and Cooley denied having gone nearer the farm than Castle's house—there is a person named Castle lives down the lane—I took possession of their boots, and made a comparison in the prosecutor's and Hodder's presence—I made fresh indentations with the boots close to the marks in the ground, and they appeared to me to make marks precisely the same as the others—I have the boots, they are very remarkable—Walter Hill's and Cooley's boots fitted the marks close under the window, and Thomas Hill's fitted the marks about eleven or twelve paces from the house—I have not the least doubt that the marks were made by the prisoners' boots—Walter goes by the name of <hi rend="italic">Tig</hi> Hill—that was what Thomas called him—when they were in the cell, I heard Cooley say he supposed they should get off with twelve months at Brixton;</p>

                  </hi>. I am with Mr. Butcher, a pawnbroker, in High-street, Wandsworth. On Tuesday, 12th Feb., Cooley offered to pledge a black silk handkerchief—being very much worn, I refused to take it, and he took it away—the prosecutor made inquiry about it in the evening, and I told him.</p>

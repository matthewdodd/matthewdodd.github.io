I live in Husband-street; I was at Mrs. Christian's on the 27th of May in the evening; she desired me to come to put a bedstead up; just as I came in, the prisoner came in for a halfpenny-worth of cartouch paper; Mrs. Christian desired me to light a candle, which I did; while she was serving her, I saw the prisoner take this book from the window; I could not tell then what it was, but I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177206030018"></xptr> her take it; I asked Mrs. Christian to look in that window to see if she missed any thing; then she said, God bless me! yes; run after her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say what she missed?</p>
               <p>Baker. No; I run out of the door; I had my eye on the girl; she was running across Piccadilly, about forty yards on the other side Bond-street, towards the Hay-market; I laid hold of her, and said pray give me what you took out of that window just now; I put my hand under her cloak, and took the pocket-book from her; I brought her back to the shop; there she fell a crying, and desired to be let go for that time; she said she never did such a thing before.</p>

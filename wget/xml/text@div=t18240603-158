In consequence of suspicion, I went to his house with Simmons, we did not find him at home, but he came in soon after. We searched the premises, and found some plates of tin, horse-nails, two files, a knife, and other articles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had he left your father's employment - A. Yes. He was not an excellent workman, he was used to the place, and knew the customers. He lives at Twickenham.</p>

            . The prisoner had lived with me for three or four years. He had left me about a week before I took out a search warrant. I took it out because I had missed some things. I did not go to his house with my son and the constable the first time, but I did afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What sort of a workman was he? A. He was not a very good workman, but suited my purpose very well. He went away, I did not discharge him; I offered him 3 s. a week more to stay, and work an hour longer each day; he gave me a week's notice, and then went away; I expected he would have come on the following week, but he did not.</p>

               <p>"Do you want any thing more of me." There were a few other tools besides those taken by Chapman. Mr. Chapman only took the knife at first, but then said, "We will go back and take the files, for I think they are mine;" and two days following there was a second search.</p>

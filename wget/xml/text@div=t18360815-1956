                  </hi>. I am the wife of Richard Stone, who keeps a beer-shop in Shadwell. The prisoner lodged at our house for two or three months before this affair—other people slept in the same room with him, sometimes one and sometimes two—a lodger whom the prisoner recommended left us without notice, and on his going I missed two sheets belonging to other lodgers—I told the prisoner I suspected his partner had taken those things which I had lost, and I should go and look after him—he said, "Do, mistress, go down to the West India Docks, and you will find him at the wood-side of the dock"—this was at about two o'clock in the afternoon—I went away at about three o'clock—the prisoner was out then—I left a box, with some money in it, on a chest of drawers in my bed room—I locked my room door, and put the key on the next room table—when I went out of the room about three o'clock the box was safely locked, and I had the key with me—there was a sovereign and 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver and copper in it—I had seen it five minutes before—I came back at about five o'clock or later, and went into the room about three minutes after—I found the box moved up to the two-pair of stairs, broken open, and a carving-fork laid by it—it was not in the room the prisoner lodged in—the lock was forced, and the money all gone—the prisoner was not there—I went to look after him, and gave information to a policeman, who brought the prisoner to our house in about half an hour—I told him I considered his partner and him were agreed, and that I was sent away on purpose, while this was com<lb></lb>mitted—he said he knew nothing about it, that he was innocent—he was detained—he said he received his week's pay at the West India Docks at two o'clock that afternoon; and before I went away he said he had been paid at two o'clock, but had not time to settle with me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutrix's sister. I remember her going, about three o'clock, to look for the lodger who had gone away—the pri<lb></lb>soner came in about four o'clock, or after—it was before she returned; he asked me where my sister was gone—I said I believed down to Wapping—he</p>

               <p>said no, he thought she was gone down to the West India Docks, to look after his mate—I said, if she was, I knew she would find it out—he asked me for a pint beer, which I drew for him—he said his leg was very bad, and he was very tired, and he should sit down and rest—this was at the bar—he sat down outside the bar about five minutes, and then tole me he was going up-stairs to rub his leg—he went through the tap-room, and opened the door to go up—he was out of my sight about ten minutes—he then came down and stood at the bar two or three minutes, talking—he then went out, and said he was going to his sister's to have a cup of tea—he was gone when my sister came back—no one went up-stairs but him, I am quite positive—two or three men went into the tap-room but they did not stop above two or three minutes—I saw them come in and go out—a sailor lodged there, and he came in as the prisoner was going cut, and sat down in the bar till my sister returned—I never lost sight of him—I had not been out of the bar at all—I am sure the men who came in could not have gone up-stairs—they were north country sailors—I am quite sure there was no one in the house while my sister was away but the sailors, and the man who came and sat in the bar—the lodger came in after the prisoner came down, I am certain.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> According to the place where she sat, there is a chimney which projects and hides part of the door, and during my sitting by the fire, rubbing my leg, William the lodger went up-stairs and did not return before I left. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> The chimney does not hide the door in the least—William did not go up-stairs at all—I am positive he never went up till my sister returned—he was sitting by me all the time—he has gone to sea now.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman.

                  </hi>. I keep a broker's shop in Ball-alley, Shore<lb></lb>ditch On the 12th of November I missed two chairs from the basement of the shutters—they were safe at six o'clock, and gone at seven—I went to the station the next night, and saw them—those now produced are them—I know them by the marks of some old brass furniture which I took off them.</p>

I was in High-street, Shore<lb></lb>ditch, in plain clothes, between seven and eight o'clock, on the night of the 12th of November—I saw the prisoner with these two chairs and this cushion—he saw me, and turned down a dark place—he began to run—I ran, and caught him in Swan-yard—I asked what he had got—he said "Two chairs," which a man in Whitechapel-road gave him as a pattern to get half a dozen, that he did not know the man, but he was outside a public-house door—this cushion belongs to the prosecutor also.</p>

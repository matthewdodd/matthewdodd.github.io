The prisoner occupied my first floor room for a fortnight, and had the use of this blanket - her husband is engine-keeper at the Norwich Union; on the 20th of June I missed this blanket - she was continually intoxicated - I suspected her, and told her she must get another lodging, and every thing must be made right previous to her leaving; I charged her with taking a blanket and other things - she did not deny it; her husband had told me to take the rest of the things out of the room, or they would all be gone - I have lost a variety of things, which she confessed to taking.</p>
               <p>LEONARD MATTHEWS. I am a pawnbroker. I have a blanket, pawned by a female named Green, on the 9th of June - I did not take it in, and do not know who did; I was present at the time, and believe the prisoner to be the person - I frequently took this blanket from her, but will not positively swear that she pawned it on that particular day; the duplicate is in the hand-writing of my foreman, Perry, who is not here, because I have another case here - I am sure I have taken this blanket from her before.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BILBROUGH. I have the fellow blanket to it here.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Why did you enter the room with a false key while I was out? A. I deny it - she came home intoxicated, and was found sleeping in the privy, with her two children; she had lost her key - all the lodgers tried their keys, and one opened her door, which I was not aware of before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was not intoxicated - is it possible he could know what was gone without entering the room? I pawned the blanket to support my husband, who was ill with an accident.</p>

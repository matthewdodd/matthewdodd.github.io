            . I live in Birchin-lane; I am an insurance-broker. On the 27th of March, about a quarter or half-past six o'clock in the afternoon, I was in an omnibus, going down <placeName id="t18330411-67-crimeloc381">Skinner-street</placeName>

               <p>GEORGE CHIDZEY. I am one of the City Police. Tucker came and asked me if I saw these three boys coming down the street; he told me to take two, and he would take one - I did so; I saw the gentleman whom the handkerchief was taken from at the station-house, but he went away - I have not the least knowledge who he was, or where he lives; I found this silk handkerchief on Smith, and a cotton one on Atkinson, and a black silk one on Lloyd - they said the handkerchiefs were their own.</p>
               <p>MR. TUCKER. This silk handkerchief is the same colour as the one which they took from the gentleman, who described the handkerchief to me before he saw it, as being red and yellow, wet and snuffy, and on being produced he claimed it.</p>

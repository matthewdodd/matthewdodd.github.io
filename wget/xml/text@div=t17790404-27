On the 26th of February at night, my house and shop were fastened up; the next morning about five o'clock, my servant came up and told me the shop was broke open, and the meat gone. I got up and found my shop window had been burst open, and four joints of meat gone, with a linen cloth, which was marked; the meat was in a cloth in a tray, near the window; soon after the beadle of the parish came and told me that a boy had been stopped with a parcel of meat, which they thought had been stolen. I went and saw the boy, who is the prisoner Thorpe, and the meat, and knew the meat and cloth both to be mine.</p>

I suspected they had stolen it; I went up to them and secured Thorpe with the meat, the other got off; I took him to the watch-house, he acknowledged he took the meat out of Mr. Gibbs's shop; he said, as he was passing by Mr. Gibbs's shop, his foot slipped, and endeavouring to save himself, his hand pressed against the window shutter, and burst it open, and pulled the meat out. He said Mantz was concerned with him.</p>

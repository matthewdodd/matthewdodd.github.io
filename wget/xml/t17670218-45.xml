I followed him cross the way. I stopt him before he got two hundred yards, and said, where are you going with this bread; said he, I am going to serve my customers; very well said I, you had better come back to the baker, and he will give you intelligence where to carry them; he would not come back; I said, the first customer you go to, I'll charge you; when he got to the upper end of Chancery-lane, he went thro' some courts that I did not know; said I, I'll get at the first baker's shop a man to go along with you, because I know you are a very bad man; upon that he set out a running with the four quartern loaves under his arm; I cried, stop thief; nobody stopt him, till a baker's man stopt him in Red-lion-square; we brought him back to the place where he took the bread, then to Guildhall; there was a baker said he had lost four quartern loaves, he lives in Clare-market.</p>

             in Clare-market. On Monday was se'nnight I carried bread out, and left my basket at the corner of a silversmith's shop the corner of Salisbury-court, Fleet-street; I went to serve some customers, so did not see the bread taken; but I have heard the prisoner say since, he took four quartern loaves out of a basket that stood at that place: I counted my bread when I went into Shoe-lane, and when I came back again, and I missed four quartern loaves.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason did the prisoner give for taking them?</p>
               <p>Steel. The reason he gave was, that he wanted both bread and money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>It was mere necessity; I had had neither victuals nor drink for two days, and had no money to pay for my lodging; I am a baker by trade.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and live at Tottenham—the prisoner was my farm-servant generally, and salesman as well—he attended my horses, and drove a wagon. On Wednesday night, the 28th of Jan., I gave out a sack of oats, which was the usual allowance, from that period till Friday night or Saturday morning—the men use it according to their own discretion, with this understanding, that when they go out they have a nose-bag full of mixed victuals for each horse, consisting of corn and chaff—anything beyond the nose-bag of mixed food is contrary to my instructions—a nose-bag of clear corn would be quite contrary to my orders—in consequence of some suspicion, I put some small pieces of paper into that sack of corn which I gave out, under the direction of one of the police—I afterwards recog<lb></lb>nized</p>

On Friday, the 30th of Jan., in consequence of information, I stopped the prisoner with his wagon, by the Seven Sisters, which is about three quar<lb></lb>ters of a mile from his master's—he was going towards London with a load of hay on his wagon—he had a nose-bag full of mixed chaff and corn on the near-side shaft, and on the other side a nose-bag containing half a bushel of clear oats, without any chaff—I found some bits of paper in the clear oats—I showed the oats and the bits of paper to Mr. Warmington—the prisoner had two horses—I found a sack on the top of the hay, containing about a bushel and a half of chaff and corn—I suppose there was three-quarters of a peek of corn in it.</p>

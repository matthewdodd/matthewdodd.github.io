            . I am an extra weigher at the Custom House. On the 26th of February, I was in Water-lane; that is a street leading from the Custom House; I saw the prisoner coming down the lane; he had this ticket on him. I searched him; in his left hand waistcoat pocket I took the silver forks which I produce; they are partly melted; and in his right hand waistcoat pocket I took these silver bowls of spoons; in his hat I found these melted pieces of silver. I asked him where he picked them up; he said, off the ruins. He said he was going to Mr. Piper for a wheelbarrow; it was his duty to have given them to an officer. There is thirty-two ounces in all.</p>

               <p>Do you know where he was the 7th of December? - He was with me the 7th, in my shop, in the Bear-dock, Tooley-street; I brought him up to the business these ten years; he went to work on the afternoon of that day; he came about a quarter before twelve; he said, father will you go any where to drink, and we went and had two or three-penny-worth of crank, and we staid till near one, and he went home and dined with me, and went to work afterwards; he continued with me at work till he was taken; we had had some words, and he went to work for some gentleman for two or three months, but he frequently came on a Sunday to dine with me, and of a Sunday evening to see me; he had been at my house the Sunday before.</p>
               <p>How came you to be positive as to the time of his coming to your house, as to the time of day, you say it was a little before twelve? - Yes, I am positive it was that time; it was before twelve; I cannot say to a quarter of an hour; I can take my oath it was before twelve, because it is the time we generally go to get a drop of drink; I asked him to go and dine with me; and I asked him to go to work with me, I had a job in a hurry; and he did; we dined at one, and went to work at half after one.</p>
               <p>What distance is the Hartshorn brewhouse from Tooley-street? - The one is on the one side of the water, and the other on the other; I dare say from my shop, to walk round, it is a mile or more.</p>
               <p>Are they directly opposite one another on the river? - No, not opposite; the brewhouse is a good way lower down on the other side.</p>
               <p>Is that young man a relation of yours? - Son-in-law; I married his mother.</p>
               <p>How long did he continue to work with you after that? - Till the evening he was taken.</p>
               <p>Did he talk of going to Lynn? - Yes, he sent several letters to a relation of mine; he was to go the next morning after he was taken; he was going over Moorfields to the pump maker's; the ship was to sail the next morning.</p>
               <p>Did you expect him to come on the 7th of December? - No, I did not expect him at all.</p>
               <p>Then on the Sunday before he had not told you that he was then out of work? - No, he never said any thing of the sort, only he came and told me three or four times he was going to Lynn; I did not expect him on the 7th of December; he brought nothing with him, no tools, or leather or any thing.</p>
               <p>What time did he come on the Sunday before? - He came every Sunday to dine with me; he came about twelve o'clock; I always asked him to dine with me every<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130156"></xptr> Sunday, or any spare time when he had an opportunity.</p>
               <p>You had parted upon some little quarrel, what had you for dinner that day? - We had some cold ham from a shop; that was all we had, and some bread and beer.</p>

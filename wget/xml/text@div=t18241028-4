            . I am cook to Mr. Holland. On Wednesday night, the 8th of September, between eight and nine o'clock, I was sitting in the kitchen with my fellow servant, and heard a noise, which appeared like somebody trying the area door; I spoke to my fellow servant about it, but we did not move - sometime afterwards there was a ring at the bell: I went to the door, thinking my fellow servant was up stairs, but I found she had answered the door. I had a candle, and the wind blowing very strong I took it into the parlour, and set it upon the secretary, and then went to the door, and upon returning saw that the secretary had been forced open - the bolts of the lock were standing out, and the top of the drawer splintered. I informed my master on his return. I had swept the area on the morning of the 8th, and on the morning of the 9th, between eight and nine o'clock, when I went to unlock the area gate I found the top of a button at the bottom of the area steps. I picked it up, and gave it to Cork, the housemaid.</p>

            . I am housemaid to Mr. Holland. I was in the kitchen with Weston, and heard a noise - it is my business to fasten the house: I shut the parlour shutters at nine o'clock that evening - after I had heard the noise - the sash was shut down all day, but not fastened with a catch. I did not notice the sash, but I shut the shutters. We found the secretary open about a quarter past nine - I then opened the shutters, and found the lower sash about an inch open. I have heard Weston's evidence; it is correct. I found dirt on the window cill, and on the wainscoat under the window, as if a person's heel had rubbed against it in getting in. Weston gave me a button, which I gave to my mistress.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could a person standing on the area steps jump up to the cill of the window - A. Yes, my Lord, by going up the steps; there is a short curtain to the window, which was drawn as usual.</p>

            . I am an officer. I received the top of a button from Mr. Holland, and in consequence of information about three o'clock in the afternoon of the 9th of September, I went to Mrs. Brown's; the prisoner stood at the looking glass, shaving, his coat was off - I asked if his name was Henry; he said Yes; I asked where his coat was; he said,</p>
               <p>"My coat?" and looked round as if surprised, and pointed to it: it hung over a chair; I asked if he had any other coat; he said No - I took it up, looked at it, and told him to put it on, and come with me (I observed the shank of the button on the left hip sticking up) he did so. Mrs. Brown said,</p>
               <p>"Are you going to be taken away" - I said Yes. Another female in the room said</p>
               <p>"What have you done" - he said nothing. One of them (the prisoner's mother I believe) said.</p>
               <p>"If you had kissed your mistress this would not have transpired." I took him to the office close by. I first asked where he was on the previous evening; he said that from six to eight o'clock he was at Mrs. Brown's, and from eight till nearly eleven he was in Hanover-street, Hanover-square - that he did not know what number, but that he went there to take home an umbrella to a young woman, or to fetch one. I then asked what he had done with the top of the button, which was off his coat; he said he had lost it at Tottenham-court Theatre the night before, in the pressure of the crowd; I said I had found it in the Regent's-park - he said that was devilish odd that I should find it such a long way off. I produce it; it fits the shank, and corresponds with the other buttons - the inscription in the inside is the same as on the others - it is not a livery button. About an hour or two after his apprehension I asked how he had heard of the robbery - he said he had heard it from Mrs. Hicks's girl, the washerwoman's daughter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He seemed surprised at your asking for his coat - there was only one coat there - A. No.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Williams, button-maker, St. Martin's-lane. I have compared this button with those on the coat - it is of the same manufacture, same size, appearance and wear, and fits the shank - it is very remarkable, for there is a little bit torn off the button, and that hangs to the shank - it would not have fallen off if it had been properly soldered, which appears to be the case.</p>

               <p>MR. HOLLAND. I had his character from his uncle, a grocer, whom he had lived six years with.</p>

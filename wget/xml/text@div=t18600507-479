                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Walter Hodsoll, an auctioneer—Mary Ann Gouge was in my service three weeks or a month—she left on Saturday fortnight, my husband discharged her—I missed a silver spoon, two pieces of cotton print, some artificial flowers, and three lace collars—I cannot exactly say when I last saw them safe—it was about three weeks or a month before she left—one of the collars I had worn—this printed cotton is mine—it is now in children's dresses, but they were not made up when I lost them—what I lost was like this pink and this lilac—the pink was four yards and a quarter, and the lilac two yards and a quarter—I have some like these with me now—I am certain these three collars are mine—they were made a present to me—I had had them about twelve months, and had worn them constantly—these flowers are mine, I can swear to them—I have no doubt of them—this teaspoon is one that has been in my house a long while—I have brought another spoon like it—it is one of a set we have had long in the family—there are initials on the one I produce, and on the one the policeman produces there is a slight mark of erasure—I have noticed that the stamps are the same—I had them before I was married—I have the remaining parts of these prints—they</p>

               <p>are the same pattern as these two children's frocks—I did not cut the pieces off—this lilac was fourteen yards and a quarter, and two yards and a quarter of that are gone; and the other was twelve yards and a quarter, and four yards and a quarter of that are gone—I did not cut off either of these, nor did any one by my direction—my husband has measured them in my presence, and four yards and a quarter and two yards and a quarter are gone; the quantity in these little frocks corresponds with the quantity I missed—I gave the prisoner one collar, but neither of these—I never gave her, or authorised her to take any of these things.</p>

I am a dressmaker, and live at New Cross—on the Tuesday after Good-Friday I received some cotton print from Elizabeth Gouge to make up into dresses—these are the two frocks I made up—the pink one was torn up into lengths to make the skirt, and a piece left for the body—the pink was from three to four yards—the other, I think, over two yards—when I took the pink frock home she said, "I don't want any one to see them while you are making them up"—I told her there was no one coming into my room to see them—I don't know how long the prisoner's husband has been in service.</p>

                  </hi>. I am employed at a soap factory. I knew the deceased, William Poole, he was nearly seventy years old—on Thursday, the 27th of January, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I was near the station-house, at Old Brentford, and saw a chaise coming along with two persons in it—it was rather a moonlight night, but cloudy—I saw Poole step into the road to cross—I and two or three more hal<lb></lb>looed to him directly we saw the chaise coming—it was going, as near as I can tell, at the rate of sixteen miles an hour—it was galloping at times—I saw the horse knock Poole down, and the wheel went over him—one of the persons in the chaise looked back, and the other who was driving whipped the horse two or three times—I cannot say which was driving—I should think he could see what had happened, by the light that was there—he whipped the horse two or three times after Poole fell—we hallooed to him to stop—he did not make any attempt to stop, but went on—I ran to Poole's assistance, and helped to carry him nearer the path—I took him to Mr. Ralph's, the surgeon, and left him in his care—he died on the Sun<lb></lb>day following—I saw him when he was dead—it was a one-horse open</p>

On the night in question I was standing on this side of the Cannon public-house, and saw the deceased cross off the path to go across the road—he walked steadily—I saw the chaise coming in the direction of the deceased, and saw the horse or the end of the shaft knock him down—it was nearly in the middle of the road—I did not hear any body call out to him before he was knocked down—I hallooed for the chaise to stop several times, but it wen: on, and one of them beat the horse—I afterwards saw some persons at the station-house, but did not know either of them again—I knew the horse and gig again—it was not a very dark night—there was a gas light very near, and lights in the shops—the person who was driving the chaise was not exactly sitting, he was a little on the rise—he could not stand upright—he was neither standing nor sitting—he was off the seat before the accident, and after it too—at the time it happened I was about fifteen yards in front of the chaise—the horse was galloping very fast at the time it knocked the de<lb></lb>ceased down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, in partnership with Mr. Boddy, and live at Old Brentford, On the evening of the 27th of December, the deceased was brought to my house—I continued to attend him till he died—the prisoner called at my house with a friend, and gave me direc<lb></lb>tions to attend on the deceased, and to do every thing in my power for his service, not only in the way of medical assistance, but nourishment, and any thing that could be to his advantage—he only called once—he has paid me since—I asked the old man, shortly before his death, if he was aware how the accident occurred—he said he was, he was run over by a gig—I asked him if he attached any blame to the person—he said, "None whatever, it was altogether an accident," he attributed no blame to any person—I had known the old man for twenty years, and had attended him—he was very feeble—he was lame in both feet, quite a cripple—I believe his hearing was very acute—I do not know that there was any imperfection in that—the prisoner has been very kind and generous to the widow, and she has said that she prays to God that nothing may happen to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer at Old Brentford. On the evening in question I saw the gig come by me at a very rapid rate—I did not see the man fall down—it was instantaneous—I never saw him till he was right under the wheel—it appeared to me as if somebody had fallen out of the gig—I ran up with others, and laid hold of him, and we held up our hands to stop the omnibus from coming over him—we dragged him on one side, and then took him away on a stretcher—just where this happened there it a dark strike right across the road, and the man's dress was very brown and dirty, like the colour of the road, so that nobody could see whether there was a man in the road or not—it was moonlight, but there was a dark strike right across just there, so that any body might not see the man—the horse was going very rapidly—I cannot say whether it was a gallop or a trot, it was going very fast, the same as I have driven myself many a time—the gentleman was trying to stop it as hard as he could with both hands—I was not examined before the Coroner—I asked the constable next morning if I should go, and he said it was no use, there were 10 many against the gentleman.</p>
               <p>— <hi rend="smallCaps">ALLEN</hi>. I am a surveyor at Old Brentford. I have made very particular observation of the spot in question, and have a plan of the town—the road is twenty-nine feet four inches wide where the acci<lb></lb>dent happened—the right hand side of the road coming to town is lighted, but the middle and other side of the road is decidedly dark—there are very few shops there, and they have scarcely any light—I believe they have candles—it is seventy-nine yards from the One Ton to the Cannon public-house, and thirty-eight yards from the One Ton to the first gas-light, which is on the other side of the road—the nearest lamp to where the accident happened is about ten yards, and is on the other side of the way—I knew Poole perfectly well—he was very infirm indeed, and crippled in his feet—I believe his faculties were generally giving way—I have seen his widow—her impression is, that this was an accident, that no malice was connected with the occurrence, and she expressed her sincere regret at the unfortunate situation of the prisoner, who has behaved very generously and kindly to her—I understand he has agreed to allow her 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day for life, and he has paid all her expenses—the deceased was not capable of earning that, I un<lb></lb>derstand.</p>

I was nurse to the deceased—the prisoner called to see him three times, and gave directions that he should want for nothing, and he would pay every thing—he paid me all I charged for nursing—I was with the deceased up to the time of his death—I saw the prisoner shake hands with him shortly before his death, and ask how he was—he said, "As well as can be expected"—I told him it was the gentleman he met the accident with—he put his hand out of bed, and said, "God bless you, sir," and the prisoner said, "God bless you and restore you, I hope."</p>

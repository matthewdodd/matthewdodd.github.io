On the 25th of July, at half-past nine o'clock at night, I was on duty in King William-street, and saw the prisoners both together, watched them, and saw Lawrence put his hand into seve<lb></lb>ral gentlemen's pockets—Jones was behind him—I followed them up to New-gate-street, and they then changed their coats—one had a blouse on—he put on a jacket—I followed them to Ludgate-hill, met another officer, and told him to come with me—I then saw Lawrence attempts a gentleman's pocket on Ludgate-hill, and further on he took a handkerchief out of a gentleman's pocket and put it into his jacket—Jones was with him—we followed the pri<lb></lb>soners to Fleet-street and took them both—there were two handkerchiefs found on Lawrence and one on Jones—I do not know who the gentleman was from whom they took the handkerchief—if we had gone after him the pri<lb></lb>soners would have made their escape.</p>

I was with the last witness, and saw Lawrence draw this handkerchief from a gentleman's pocket on Ludgate-hill—Jones was directly behind him—directly the pocket was picked the pri<lb></lb>soners turned and separated—they went down Fleet-street, and we missed the gentleman—I took this handkerchief from the seat of Jones's trowsers—this white handkerchief came from Lawrence—this third handkerchief I be<lb></lb>lieve they said belonged to themselves.</p>

             followed him and insisted upon the same Demand, and said, they would have it before I went out of the House. I was afraid, and thought my Life was in danger, or that they would rob me of my Goods, for I had ten Pounds worth about me; and therefore I offer'd Cox a Guinea to let me go away peaceably. She took the Money and went up Stairs. But the other two still insisted upon their first Demand of thirty five Shillings. I told them it was very hard, when they knew I had given Cox a Guinea. But Kendenell swore that he did not see me give her any thing; and she coming down again, denied that she had received the Guinea. And with that they fell upon me, knock'd me down and beat me, and Kendenell wrenched open my Hand and took out a Guinea and a half and some Silver. I cry'd for help, and I believe they would have murder'd me, if Mason had not desired 'em for God's sake to beat me no more. I had seven or eight Yards of Kenting Linnen under my Coat. Kendenell took it from me, and said, Damn him, What has he got more in his Budget? At the same time I heard a Voice above Stairs, say, Beat the Dog! I cry'd Murder, and call'd for Tom Smith who lived next Door. At last I got away, and went to Tom Smith, and told him how I had been abused, and had called for him to help me. He said, he did not hear me, but if he had heard, he would not have ventur'd in for 100 l. for they would have sworn his Life away - And Justice Mitford, who committed them, advised me not to let them know where I lived, for they were vile Creatures, and would swear any thing.</p>

            . On the twenty sixth of December, the Prisoner Mrs. Cox sent for me to Breakfast with her. And her Brother, Mr, Uffard. being out of Town, I staid with her all Day. About nine at Night, the Prosecutor came in with an ordinary mean-drest Creature, and drank a Pint or two of Wine with her at the Bar, and then they went up Stairs together. She went away in about half an Hour, and then Kendenell, the Drawer told me, that the Gentleman above, which was the Prosecutor, desired to speak with me. I went up and met him on the Stairs. He asked me to drink a Glass of Punch, and so I went in, and he and I drank four or five Bowls of Arrack Punch, which came to 20 s. and three Pints of Wine.</p>
               <p>Court. What! did you two drink all that?</p>

He called for the Reckoning: The Drawer came up and said, there was thirty one Shillings to pay, and asked him if he would have a Bill. He said, no, it was time enough for he was not going yet - The Supper was cold Victuals that was left on Christmass-Day. There was only two Shillings for eating, and twenty nine Shillings for Punch and Wine.

            , a Jew. A Gentleman in Pall-mall employed me to cut some Diamonds for him. I was going to carry my Work home between six and seven at Night, but by the way, I called in at Mrs. Cox's, and there was she and Mrs. Mason, and the last Witness, Mrs. Harris in the Bar. I called for a Bottle of Wine to drink with them. At three Quarters past eight, the Prosecutor came in with a Woman. They drank Wine at the Bar, and then went up and called for another Pint. In half an Hour the Woman came down. and Mrs. Harris went up. They had two or three Bowls of Arrack Punch while I was there; I staid till half an Hour past ten, and then went with my Work to Pall-mall. The Gentleman paid me 5 l. I returned to Cox's at one o'Clock, and called for another Bottle. Mrs. Harris came down. I asked her if she had staid above with the Gentleman all that time: and she said, yes. And after that, there came down two or three Women together; and the Prosecutor called for one and two Bowls at a time. I was then going home, but Mrs. Cox desired me to stay, because her Brother was out of Town, and she had no body to take care of the House: and so I staid till five o'Clock. The Prosecutor rung the Bell, the Drawer went up. and coming down again to the Bar, he asked what was to pay, Mrs. Cox told him 2 l. 12 s. 6 d. He went again, but presently returned, and said, the Gentleman had used him ill, and struck him. The Bell ringing again, he went up again, and when he came down he complained as before of being beat and abused. Upon which, Mrs. Cox desired me to go up with her. I consented, and she and I, -and Mrs. Mason, and the Drawer, all went up together. As soon as the Door was opened, the Prosecutor fell upon the Drawer, and gave him several Blows, and then the Drawer fell upon him, and beat him, and tore his Shirt - The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173501160010"></xptr> Prosecutor asked what was to pay. Mrs. Cox told him 2 l. 12 s. 6 d. He gave her two Guineas and a half, and then went down to the Bar, called for a Gill of Brandy, drank and paid her fix Pence for it.

            . I am Servant to Mrs. Cox. At nine o'Clock the Prosecutor came in with a dirty ordinary Creature. They drank a Bottle of Wine at the Bar, and then went up Stairs. They staid a considerable time together, I believe it might be half an Hour, and then the Creature came down, and went away. And the Drawer desired this Lady, Mrs. Harris to go up to the Gentleman, and she did so. They had several Bowls of Arrack Punch, and three Bottles of Wine. I was called up several times to drink with them. I went to bed before they parted. My Bed is in the next Room to that they were in, so that I could hear what was doing - I heard her go down Stairs, and several Women come up. Between four and five in the Morning he called for a Bill. The Drawer brought it; and he would not pay the Drawer, but assaulted him. I hearing this, got up, went into the Room and there they were fighting, and the Drawer tore his Shirt. They parted, and the Drawer went down, but soon came up again with Mrs. Cox, Mrs. Mason, and Moses Levi: And then the Prosecutor made no more scruple, but put two Guineas and a half into Mrs. Cox's Hands. They all went together; he drank a Gill of Brandy at the Bar, and said, Good Morrow Landlady.</p>

            . No, not in the least.</p>
               <p>Court. Levi, swore otherwise. - Here Levi - You said that when you went up with Cox and Mason, the Prosecutor fell upon the Drawer, and they fought together.</p>
               <p>Levi. There was a Skirmish, the Prosecutor struck the Drawer, but I parted 'em.</p>

               <p>Eleanor Sutton. When the Prosecutor and Drawer quarrelled, there was no body else present, for as soon as I heard the Noise I got up and went into the Room. But when the Drawer came up with Levi, and the Prisoners, there was no Quarrel, for the Prosecutor paid the Reckoning in a very good Humour - The Quarrel was between four and five in the Morning.</p>
               <p>Elizabeth Smith, again. That is impossible, for it was but three o'Clock, or at most, a Quarter past three, when the Prosecutor came crying to my House.</p>

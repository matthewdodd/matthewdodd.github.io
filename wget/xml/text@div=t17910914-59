               <p>I am a labouring man. I met the prisoner about four o'clock in the morning in Doyle-street; I live in Bloomsbury; I am a <rs id="t17910914-59-viclabel367" type="occupation">bricklayer's labourer</rs>

On Sunday morning, the 7th of August, she asked me where I was going; I told her, home; she said, as her husband was not at home I might lay in his bed; she brought me into the lodging, and I asked her what she would have for me to stretch on the bed; she asked me one shilling; I said, I thought sixpence was enough. I gave it her, and laid down on the bed; and the prisoner at the bar came to me, and took my money out of my pocket; I felt her taking the last, and caught hold her of her hand; she cut my pocket through my breeches, and drew my money out of the hole she cut. While I had hold of her, a man stepped into the room, and got hold of me by the collar, and gave her liberty to go off; I kept hold of my money as long as I could, till this man came in, and shoved me out.</p>
               <p>Was you sober? - Yes, I was perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>When she got away, this man pushed me back again, and went out and locked the door; and in about ten minutes he and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179109140084"></xptr>another woman came and pushed me out. I returned about six in the morning with some other men, and seized the prisoner in bed.</p>
               <p>Are you sure this was the woman? - I am perfectly sure.</p>

               <p>I never saw this man till he came about six o'clock in the morning, when he and four Irishmen came and jumpt into the window, and took and dragged me out of bed naked, and dragged me to the watch-house all naked, and they searched me, and found only one six-pence in my pocket, and that was all.</p>

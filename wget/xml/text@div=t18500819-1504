(<hi rend="italic">produced,</hi>) dated 17th July, at four months, was first brought to me by Goldsworthy—it is drawn by him—I know his writing well—the whole of the body is his writing, except the acceptance—he asked me to discount it; I did—I gave him money and paper for it—I gave him a bill, which was ten or eleven days from being due, and which I had pre<lb></lb>viously discounted for him, and 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in money—I paid this 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-bill to Mr. Renshaw—since discounting this bill Goldsworthy again applied to me on the subject of this bill for 170<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—that was in Sept., before the other became due—I discounted this for him—this is dated Aug. 27th, at four months—I know Mr. Lee well and his family—I have known him several years by sight—I had one money transaction with him; that was at the Euston station.</p>

               <p>that money by speculating—racing: I mean on the turf—the next bankruptcy was in 1842—I have paid those debts—they amounted perhaps to 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I do not know which—I paid the creditors, and got my discharge—I paid 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound to the greater portion—I am prepared to swear the amount was not more than 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I will not swear it was not 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I can<lb></lb>not state it was not 5,000, or 6,000, or 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I will swear it was not 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I believe it was not 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have no memorandum before me, but I believe it was not 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I will swear it was not 10,000 or 9,000 or 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have been an insolvent debtor once; that was in 1846 I think, or 1847, I do not know—my liabilities, and so on, perhaps, might be 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have no memorandum—I will swear they were not twice as much—I cannot re<lb></lb>member the amount—I had no idea I should be asked these questions, and am not prepared—I was only once in the Insolvent Court, and for defending an action I was remanded for five months—it was an action for railway shares—I was not remanded for fraud, it was for a vexatious defence.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185008190111"></xptr>
               <p>he never gave such a bill—I gave that bill back to Mr. Lee after it became due—I got another bill for it, and gave the difference, and gave the bill back to Mr. Lee, not to Goldsworthy—Mr. Lee did not pay the money—Golds<lb></lb>worthy brought me a bill for 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., out of which I gave him the difference of the money, and took the bill for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. back, but it happened to be in the hands of the acceptor at that time, and when I received it back I gave it to Mr. Lee, and he made no comment on the subject—I should not have taken these bills if he had said that was a forgery—he received the bill back not as a forgery, but as a genuine bill, and afterwards swore it was a forgery—that is my explanation—that is as true as that Mr. Lee gave me an acceptance at Euston-square in blank for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How could it be in blank, if it was for 60<hi rend="italic">l.? A.</hi> I met Mr. Lee at Webb's Hotel, where I was stopping; he said he wanted to borrow some money: from his high position in society, his father being so wealthy a man, I could scarcely credit that he wanted money; however, I saw him again in the afternoon, and he said, "I want 50<hi rend="italic">l;"</hi> I said, "What will you give for it?" he said, "I will give you 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., draw a bill at two months;" I said, "I will go and get you the money:" I went to a friend of mine, a monied man; he was at dinner; I said, "Have you got 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in your pocket? I have got the best man in England," for I considered Mr. Lee the richest man in Liverpool; when I got back to Webb's Hotel, he had gone to the station, I got into a <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and followed him there, and he wrote, "60" not in the place where it is generally written, but in that place; and he wrote his name across the bill, in blank; I gave him the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on the bargain that he was to give 60<hi rend="italic">l.:</hi> he asked that himself, I should have let him have it for less if he had asked me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That bill you negotiated, I suppose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never had it in my hand afterwards—Renshaw had it—he found the money, and I had a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note as my share of it, and Renshaw had a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note—when Inspector Field told me that this was a bill for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., accepted in Mr. Lee's name, which was a forgery, I said, "No, it is not; it is all stuff; it is Lee's handwriting, I know it very well"—that was my sincere belief—I applied to Inspector Field to find Goldsworthy for me—I called several times on Mr. Davis, the tailor, in Regent-street, to get Mr. Lee to give this gentleman in charge, that I would pay him the bills, and settle the matter at once—I do not remember Inspector Field asking me where he could find Goldsworthy; I do not believe he did: I do not whether he did or not, but I told him I wished to find him—I did not tell him that Goldsworthy was in the habit of going to a house in South Moulton-street—I do not remember whether I afterwards learnt from Mr. Field that he had seen Goldsworthy on two occasions, once in Burlington-mews, and that he had seen and talked to him about it—I do not remember such a thing—it might or might not have passed—he never told me that he knew where to find Goldsworthy, nor offer to take him if I would authorize him—I was always anxious to find him—Mr. Field never did, to my knowledge, tell me that he knew where to find him, and offer to take him into custody if I would authorize him—that is my belief—Mr. Field will tell you in the box to-day, as I suppose you will call him, that I never did, that I was always anxious to find him, and would give him in charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he make that particular offer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not recollect anything of the sort—I do not believe he ever mentioned such a thing to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>custody if I could find him, and I offered Langley 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to find him—I do not remember his making such an offer as you state: I do not believe he did, I will not positively swear it—I do not recollect sufficiently.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>this is Mr. Lee's writing—I kept the 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-bill in my possession till it was due—I never parted with it—it was to be paid at Mr. Salisbury's, Webb's Hotel, Piccadilly; and when the bill became due, I called on Mr. Salisbury with it, and asked him if Mr. Lee was there—he said, "No;" I said, "Has he left any message for me?" he said, "No," and I went back and wrote to Mr. Lee, down at Luton Hoo, and I believe I had an answer from Mr. Lee, (I can<lb></lb>not be positive,) that I was to call at Mr. Salisbury's for the money—that was a few days after it was due—I did call at Mr. Salisbury's, and received the money for the bill.

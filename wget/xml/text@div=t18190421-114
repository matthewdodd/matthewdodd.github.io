On the 31st of December I received a 100 l. and two 5 l. notes of my brother. I went to bed about twelve o'clock at night, having upwards of 200 l. in bank notes in my pocket, among which was this 100 l. note. The servant came in, and took away the candle, I saw her go out. My notes were in an inside coat-pocket, which I put on a chair by the bedside - they were in a pocket-book. I got up about eight o'clock, and in about half an hour I found I had lost my money. I immediately made it known at the inn. I have since seen the 100 l. note which I lost.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What time did you receive it - A. About four o'clock. I did not pay it away, and I am certain that my pocket-book was in my pocket when I went to bed, as I particularly noticed it - the girl shut the door.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know the prisoner before - A. No. I showed him into the room, and turned the bed down while he was there.

               <p>JAMES EGINGTON. I am porter at the inn. On the night in question I attended the prisoner, and took off his boots - I am sure he is the man. He went by the name of Colonel Best.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Burge, who is an optician, and lives in Piccadilly. On the 1st of January the prisoner came to the shop, and purchased a sextant, which came to sixteen guineas. I told him it was necessary to adjust it before he took it away, which I said would take about an hour. He gave me a 100 l. note, and I gave him the change, which I got from Mr. Burge - there was a 40 l. note among the change. I directly gave Mr. Burge the 100 l. note that the prisoner gave me. I asked his name and address, he said it was Capt. Wishead, Hatchett's hotel. He left the sextant, called in about three hours after in a hackney-coach for it, and took it away. I told him I wished to keep it a little longer. He said he was going off immediately, and could not wait. It was perfect.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have no doubt whatever of his being the man.</p>

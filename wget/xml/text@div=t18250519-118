My house and the next are both in a yard, enclosed by one gate, but there is an inner gate, which leads to no house but mine; after passing that gate there is a yard leading to the scullery and the front kitchen. About ten minutes or a quarter past nine o'clock in the morning of the 4th of April, I heard that my plate was stolen; I then missed it - the plate is always counted up at night, and brought into my bed-room in a basket - it is a flat open basket; the servant fetched it about eight o'clock that morning. I have seen none of it since - the tea-pot was worth 9 l. or 10 l. an old silver. My house is in the liberty of Norton Falgate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Are you sure it is in that liberty? A. I understand so. I pay the taxes to a surveyor, who collects the rent. I am certain it is in that liberty; I saw the tea-pot in the basket when the servant fetched it; the spoons were covered with green baize - the basket has no cover.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Samuda. I am called Elizabeth. On the morning of Easter Monday, after getting breakfast ready, I went down to the kitchen. I had not noticed the plate basket; I was sitting in the back kitchen at breakfast, with my fellow-servants, a little after nine o'clock; the up-stairs bell rang and Maria Ward left the kitchen, and in two or three minutes I heard a kind of rattling noise at the back door - it appeared as if a basket was scraping against a brick wall; I called out "Who is there?" Maria had not left the kitchen more than two or three minutes; I ran to the back door, and saw the prisoner going out of the yard door with a great basket across his shoulder; the yard door only leads to master's premises; I knew the prisoner by having seen him four times before in master's yard; he had never asked if I wanted any thing, but if I asked what he wanted he said "I have come to see if you want any lemons." I had told him twice never to come there, for we never bought any thing at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him with the basket on his back what did you say? A. I was so alarmed I could not speak, but Hannah, another servant, called out "What do you want?" he turned, and looking very confused and pale, said, "I have come to see if you want any lemons;" at the same time pulling a lemon out of his jacket pocket; the basket he had was large enough to contain master's plate basket; it is a large one, such as carpenters carry; my fellow servant said "You know we don't want any, and you have been told never to come here again," and, before he could be out of hearing, she called out "Elizabeth where is the plate?" she ran and looked in at the door of the front kitchen, and said, "It is not there!" that did not take her a moment; the prisoner was then gone from the yard. I instantly ran after him, as quick as possible, but could not catch sight of him; I had steps to go up and to come down before I could get into the square - there are forty-four or forty-five houses in the square, and several turnings each way; I must have turned down the wrong street. If a person was selling lemons there were plenty of houses in the square where he would be likely to find customers; I have never seen the plate since - I had put all the plate (stated in the indictment), into the basket the night before (enumerating the articles); I carried them into master's bed-room at half-past eleven o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you been in the service? A. Seven months. I was in the back kitchen when I first saw him - he was going out at the yard door, just stepping his foot up to go from the house; he had his foot on the step of the gate. I am house-maid, and had been employed up stairs that morning; some tradespeople had been there - the last person went out about half-past eight - my fellow servant could see a person coming down the yard as she sat at the window. He had a basket such<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182505190041"></xptr>as I always saw him with - it was hung across his shoulder with a strap or string.</p>
               <p>Q. Must you not have seen him run across the square? A. I had several steps to go up, and a long yard to go through - he was full eight yards from me when I saw him - I was at the back door of the scullery - the nearest turning is forty or fifty yards from the outer gate.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did the other servant go another way? A. Yes - his basket bulged out a great deal</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Samuda. I took the plate basket from his room at eight o'clock on this morning, and put it on the dresser, in the front kitchen, at a quarter past eight o'clock, and then got breakfast ready, and was sometimes in the front and sometimes in the back kitchen; the basket was always on the dresser; I had seen it there as late as five minutes past nine o'clock; a person could go by the back kitchen and get the plate; we were at breakfast, and the bell rang about ten minutes past nine o'clock - I had been up stairs about ten minutes, when I heard the plate was gone - my fellow servants had then returned from pursuing. I saw the tea-pot at the top of the basket - the rest was covered over with a baize. I took out nine tea-spoons and the sugar tongs about a quarter to nine o'clock - the rest was all safe then - I had been in the two kitchens all the morning, and had seen nobody come to the house to go into the kitchens.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is there a window in the front kitchen? A. Yes - when you are at the back kitchen window, you can see a person pass to go to the front kitchen. I have been twelve months in my place; a person might come without my knowledge, when I was up stairs, but I do not think they could.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You saw the plate safe five minutes before you went to breakfast? A. Yes - the milk had been brought before that; while we sat at breakfast we could hear a person come down the steps, though we could not see them.</p>

            . I have been nine years in Mr. Samuda's service. I was at breakfast with Elizabeth on the morning of Easter Monday; something was said about a noise - I went to the kitchen door and saw the prisoner; I am convinced he is the man - I had seen him four times before, and had told him never to come again - because I once found him half-way into the scullery when I had shut the door, and he said he came to see if we wanted lemons - I said "No, we never buy at the door - never come again." On this morning, when I got to the kitchen door, I saw the prisoner going out of the yard door, with his basket across his shoulder - I said</p>
               <p>"What do you want?" he said "I am come to see if you want any lemons;" he was going from the house then - his foot was on the step, and his back towards me - he turned half round towards me, in a confused manner, when I spoke to him - his basket was very bulky, and I saw the handle of another basket pointing out of his basket; I turned round and said "Elizabeth, where is the plate?" I turned round to the kitchen door and said, "It is not there, run;" we both run out but could see nothing of him or any body else; I only ran through the square, and looked down Norton Falgate, then returned and told the family. The house belongs to the liberty of Norton Falgate. I saw the prisoner again that day three weeks at Worship-street - master had given information there; I had no doubt whatever of his being the man - I knew him the moment I saw his face - he was with other people, and his face was sideways to me at first, but I knew him again in a moment.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You had seen him before - did you ever miss any thing before? A. Never - I never saw him with more than one lemon. I had seen the plate in the basket on the dresser ten minutes before - nobody could have gone into the kitchen in that time because I was sitting at breakfast. When he must have come in I was reading a cookery book, or I must have seen him through the window - nobody could have passed before I took up the book, which I had done the moment before my fellow servant left the kitchen, or I should have seen him - I had been sitting there more than ten minutes. Hunt went after him rather before me - she was nearer to him than me. Vann took me to the office to see him - all the prisoners were let out into a yard - we were asked if it was either of them - four came out first - the prisoner was the fifth - he was not pointed out to me.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is there more than one window to the back kitchen? A. No - I sat near that window reading at the time Elizabeth said she heard the noise; we went to the door together - I turned back to the front kitchen door, to look for the plate - Elizabeth was then nearer to the street than I - we were both equally near to him when I saw the handle of the basket in his basket.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. On Monday, the 4th of April, I received instructions, and in consequence of the description the servants gave me I apprehended the prisoner three weeks after, and told him at the office that it was on suspicion of robbing Mr. Samuda, in Spital-square, of a quantity of plate - he said "I don't know the house, and know nothing about it;" I found nothing but money and a new great coat on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had he any lemons? A. No; he was dressed like a gentleman.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you afterwards take the two servants to see him? A. Yes, with five other prisoners - they were all put out together, and they selected the prisoner - I had known him for two or three years - he is a farrier.</p>

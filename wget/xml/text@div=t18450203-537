                  </hi>. I carried on business as a grocer, in Narrow<lb></lb>I street, Limehouse, last year—I gave up my business, and am at present residing with my son, who is a grocer, in Cannon-street-road—in Feb. last year I was acquainted with a person named William Sprigging, of Water<lb></lb>loo-terrace, Commercial-road—I have known him some time—he applied to me about raising the sum of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I suggested that I could obtain it from the St. Pancras Loan Society—he proposed that I should apply for it, and he become security, as he was in better circumstances—I went to the King's Arms, in John-street, Bedford-row, and made application—I saw Mr. Tyhverly there, in the office up stairs—he belongs to the Society—I saw Mr. Potter—I have seen another party there—I was there on the 20th of Feb.—I did not see the note in question on that occasion, not till the 21st—the sureties had all signed, the last signed on the 20th, but I did not—Tuesday the 20th was the regular day of meeting—they told me I was too late then, and it was suggested I should go on the following night, sign the note, and receive the money—I went and signed it on the evening of the 21st, in the bar parlour, at the back of the bar, in the King's Arms, not in the office—Mr. Tyhverly and Mr. Potter only were present when I signed it—20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was advanced to me on that occasion—something was said about ray coming down there specially, and having something to drink at my expense, and I handed 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to Mr. Tyhverly, one of which he banded over to Potter—a few days after I received the balance, after deducting the common interest and expenses—I think that was rather less than 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the money was to be repaid by weekly instalments—that was the understand<lb></lb>ing—the half of it was paid so.</p>
               <p>

I brought, and 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. after—I think I received rather more than 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I ceased to carry on business in Narrow-street in Sept. last—the business is carried on in the same name as it used to be there, save the "junior"—that was put up when my son took the house, which was in Sept.—he bought the stock himself—I sold the whole of my stock and fixtures and everything I had in Narrow-street to Mr. Perry, who took the house, and the money I received from him I paid my tradespeople with—I do not carry on my business in Cannon-street-road—I am attend<lb></lb>ing to it for my son—I attend every day for him—it is not my business—have no interest in it, except what my son allows me, which is 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—we have an agreement—I have not got it here—Mr. Perry, who took the house in Narrow-street, came from Larkhall-lane—he is a grocer cheesemonger—he is carrying on the business there—from Narrow-street</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184502030120"></xptr>
               <p>I went to Cannon-street-road with my son—lie is about twenty-five years of age—he was not apprenticed to me, but to a Mr. Jones, a dentist at Canterbury—he gave up his apprenticeship in his twenty-first year—he staid his time—he then came to London—he did not set up for himself—he came to my shop in Narrow-street soon afterwards—he was in practice in his own business occasionally before that—he used to do part of his work at home—I do not know exactly where he did the other part, at different workshops of mechanical business—he continued to carry on his profession of a dentist up to the time I left Narrow-street—he had no fortune left him—I was in bad circumstances—he was to pay 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year for the house in Cannon-street-road—he purchased the stock of different tradespeople—one was Broorme and Co., grocers, of Lawrence Pountney-hill—they gave him credit, not me—I did not go for the goods—I will swear that, or apply for them—their traveller called on my son, and he gave the order—it was the traveller from that house—it was not the traveller I had employed when in Narrow-street—I knew nothing at all about it—Mr. Dean, of Tower-street, was another—I knew him—he supplied me, when in Narrow-street, in two instances, not the whole time—there were several others—there was Mr. Hopkinson, the tallow<lb></lb>maker—I was an old customer of his.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Tell me anybody else with whom you or your son dealt that you were not an old customer of? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was Mr. Wing, of East-street, I never dealt with—I think that is the only one besides Broome's—my son purchased several of his household things—one part of my furniture he was obliged to buy under an execution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where did he get the money from? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh money he has always had from his boyhood up—his mother, from his early youth, saved money for him, up to the time of his apprenticeship—she had 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year of her own—she died six or seven years ago—my son did not take this business till Sept. last—he did not keep the money at any bankers—some was in the Savings' Bank—his mother made no will.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, how did this money come not to be yours? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The money came to the sister after her death—it was not left to my son, only what my wife had saved for him, about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But that was your money, not his? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, I did not have it; it was perfectly understood it was to be saved for him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did your creditors say to that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh, I paid them all in full.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Therefore you are not indebted to anybody at all at present? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I an indebted to one or two, or it may be two or three—it is not many—I cannot swear how many—I did not make out any memorandum or list, or else I would have brought it—I should say I owe, perhaps, 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—I do not think it is more—I will swear I do not owe in the whole above 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this money that my son was enabled to purchase the business with was in the hands of his aunt, and also of his uncle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now you say you borrowed this money as a principal? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—cannot say whether I told the society it was for Spriggins—I think I said the money was for myself, and that Spriggins, my former security, would be my security again; I do not recollect exactly; I dare say it was so; I rather think I told the secretary that I was borrowing the money for Spriggins—I do not know that I told anybody but him at that time—I did not pay back the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; Spriggins did—it was paid back on my ac<lb></lb>count,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184502030121"></xptr>
               <p>and then I did not pay any more—an action was then brought against me—that went on to execution—I pleaded the general issue—when the execution came to the house in Cannon-street-road, my son gave notice to the sheriff that the goods were his, not mine, and the execution was withdrawn—nothing has been paid since, I believe—my son set up in Cannon-street-road in Sept.—it was in the early part of Sept. that he took the house—he set up business on the 25th—Spriggins is not here, to my knowledge, nor Adams; White is here I believe—the society objected to Adams as a security in the first instance, and required a third, namely, White—they would not advance the money without another security—I carried on business in Narrow-street up to the end of Sept., or the early part of Oct.—I think it was in the early part of Oct. that I disposed of the business to Mr. Perry—I did not remain till the end of Oct—it must have been the end of Sept, or the beginning of Oct., that I left, that would be it—my son had not set up at the new place before I had done with the old—he set up about the 25th of Sept—he was there before me—I think I finished at Narrow-street in Sept.—I gave up my business to Mr. Perry, and then went and lived with my son—I am wrong about Oct.; it was in Sept., not in Oct., that I left Narrow-street—I then went to Cannon-street-road, where 1 acted in the business similarly to what I had been acting in the business in Narrow-street—my son printed 4000 bills—I did not send out circulars to my customers, announcing that I had given up business, and that my son had began—I did not employ any attorney in the action; I pleaded in my own name and person—I pleaded that 1 did not make the promissory note set out in the declaration, and that I was not indebted to the society—I pleaded that I did not owe; that is similar—it was true that I had signed the note, though I pleaded 1 had not—it was not true that I was indebted to them the balance of the money—I did not owe the money myself; Mr. Spriggins owed the money—I knew I was liable for it—Spriggins said he would pay the money, but he would wait the end of the action—Spriggins is still in the Commercial-road—I had borrowed the money, and Spriggins had paid half of it back—the society has received only half—I believed Spriggins to be in better credit than myself—he is very well off—I have not sued him for this money—I ex<lb></lb>pected the society would have sued him, but they did not; they never called upon him—it is the sureties generally they look to—Spriggins said he would be here—he is a tobacconist—he had all the money—I paid it to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did not you call upon him to defend the action when it was brought? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said the action was brought against me, and I had better attend to it myself, but he said if he was applied to in the matter, if they commenced with him, be would settle the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. balance, but he would not pay any costs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did I understand you to say just now, that Mr. Watt came and said the money would be very useful to him next morn<lb></lb>ing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said he would like to have it then, most decidedly—after he was too late he stood a few minutes, and said to Mr. Tyhverly it would be very useful to him in the morning, as he had to make a purchase; and Mr. Tyhverly said, "If you will come to-morrow night at seven o'clock," (<hi rend="italic">which he very often did, to oblige certain parties</hi>,) "you shall have the money"—Mr. Kennett used to put his name sometimes—he sometimes witnessed the signatures of parties—he is the brother of Mr. Kennett, the partner to Mr. Gregory—I was discharged from the society on the 1st of Oct., I believe—it has happened, that when there was business to be done at the society, I was not there, but was drunk elsewhere, but not so that I could not do the business—sometimes it was done the better for that—it has not haopened a good many times, I will swear that—I do not know how many you mean—it has happened a good many times—it has hap<lb></lb>pened, perhaps, a dozen times within six years—I do not know whether it has happened twenty times—I never kept any account of it—I should say it has not happened twenty times in 1844—I have kept no account of it—I will not swear it has not—I was insured in the Sun office—I took my policy to get money advanced on it—I did not get an advance of 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it—I got 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., at least I borrowed 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that was left as part security—I did not afterwards go to the Sun Fire-office, and represent that I had lost the policy—I never wrote them word so to my knowledge—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a letter</hi>)—this is mine—after I had got 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and had depo<lb></lb>sited my policy with the Sun Fire-office as security, I represented to them in writing that I had lost the policy—I got another, and got more money advanced upon that—allow me to explain it—I borrowed 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of a Mr. Hodge, a postman, which I was to pay him back by instalments of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—in the first place, he took a per centage of 30 per cent., and out of that 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I have paid him 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which, if I had known I was going to be asked the question, I would bring his signature, when I paid him back 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. besides, after the 30 per cent, to make 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that policy was out in a week or two—I was very unfortunate, and went to Hodge, and said the policy was out such and such a day, I had the. letter from the office, and asked whether he would take it and pay it, for it was impossible I could, and it was a pity it should be lost—he said he should not do anything of the sort, that it was no use to him—I then asked Mr. Elliott if it was any use to him; and after considering two or three days, he gave me, I believe, about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, and I had paid two years—now that is the history of that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But you have not explained the only part that wanted ex<lb></lb>planation, whether you made a false representation to the office that you had lost it, and applied for another? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Why it was lost.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you represent that you could not find the policy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No more I could find it—I went down to Mr. Hodge for it—Mr. Elliott is the party that had it, because it should not be lost—I told Mr. Elliott that Mr. Hodge had it—I told him I left it with him—I do not know that I told him that Hodge had it—I told him I had depo<lb></lb>sited it, and the party would not pay for it, and whether it would be any use to him—that was what I told him—I think I got 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Mr. Elliott, and he went and paid the policy himself—there was 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay for the policy for the year—I was not discharged from the society for having taken money of theirs that I had given no account of—allow me to hand you this letter—(<hi rend="italic">producing one</hi>)—that will tell you different to that—that will speak to character for six years from the treasurer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why was not the business of signing this note, by the party who appeared to be the principal in it, conducted in the office up stairs, instead of the bar-parlour? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was an extra night, and we never went up stairs on any business then, only on the two nights we had the room up stairs to conduct the business in—it was not occupied the whole of the week, only two nights, Monday and Tuesday, from seven till nine o'clock—we always get the sureties on a note before the principal—when a person applies for money, he puts down 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., if it is for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the same as Mr. Watt did—he does not bring the note executed by the sureties—the note is detained by the treasurer, till he is quite satisfied that the securities are responsible persons—he would get all the sureties' names to the note, before the borrower's—(<hi rend="italic">The letter shown to the witness was here read; it was addressed to the managers of the Sun Life Insurance<lb></lb>office, informing them that he had assigned his policy, for</hi> 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">to William Eltiott, and stating, in a postscript, "the policy at present cannot be found; as soon as found, it will be forwarded to Mr. Elliott forthwith"</hi>)—the bar-par<lb></lb>lour is not the office for conducting the business on extra nights, only the treasurer and myself were in the habit of going in to sit down—there is business done there—the same two officers attend to conduct the business there, that ought to be conducted up stairs—for the pur<lb></lb>poses of the transaction it was the office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DOANE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Hodge refused to make the payment on this policy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, so that it would have been lost—when I went to Mr. Elliott I wrote that letter—that was the form I was to go through—Mr. Elliott told me, and therefore I did not scruple to do so—I was dismissed the service of the society on the 1st of Oct.—I have brought an action against Mr. Tyhverly, the treasurer, for remuneration for my services—he is the treasurer, and everything else—he is the proprietor—no charge was made against me of malversation in the accounts, embezzling the money, or anything of the kind—solely for inattention, as it appears lately.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the evening you saw this one of your drunken even<lb></lb>ings? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am sure I cannot tell—I will undertake to swear I was not drunk, for I had been to Brompton-square, and left a gentleman there it twenty minutes past six—I came home by the omnibus, and ran home on purpose to oblige the man—I was not drunk before I went there—we do not do it that way—I went to wait on the gentleman—I got no refresh-ment there, nor on my way home—the omnibus did not stop any where—the gentleman I went to wait on was Mr. Frederick Metcalf, No. 58, Brompton-square—I believe it was on the 21st—it was the same evening, the Wednesday evening—Mr. Watt attended on the Tuesday evening in</p>

               <p>the hope of getting the money—he was very pressing to get it, and as<lb></lb>signed as a reason that he wanted it the following morning—he did not sign the note then—they do not often sign till they are going to have the money—the bill was in the office—he could not sign without it was taken out and given to him—Adams signed on the Tuesday, but not Mr. Watt, because he was not going to be paid that night—the bill was not presented to him at all to sign his name, as he was not going to be paid that night—that would be quite an unusual way of doing business—I am sure he did not have the money that night—there is no attesting wit<lb></lb>ness to Mr. Watt's signature—that is the case with a great many of these notes that my name is not to them, for some come from the country—I should not, if I had been sober, have put my name to it, not when there is one name—Mr. Kennett is the attesting witness to Mr. Adams—you might say he is the attesting witness to all these notes, when they were signed miles off from him—according to that he is the attesting witness to all the signatures on the note—I never saw marks pot on them before, not the marks that say which ones he attested—I never saw that before—they were not there when I saw the note—there was no mark to denote when he signs his name at the bottom, which of these he was witness to—I never saw them before—I never saw a bill done so—I never saw any on the bills in the office, where there is a line marked or drawn to say which was attested—I never saw these marks on this bill before to-day—I never looked at it, only the night Mr. Watt signed it, and they were not there then—if you look over fifty bills you will tee that Mr. Tyhverly has thought proper to go himself without my knowing I have attested, without seeing the signatures—I can swear which I did see signed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean you were in the habit of putting your signature as attesting witness to things you had never seen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When the notes were finished—you might see hundreds—I usually put ray name at the corner—that was not one of the reasons of my being dismissed—I do not know why I am dismissed—I am very glad it is a dismissal—I did not know it before.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Great Russell-street, and am one of the proprietors and treasurer of the St. Pancras Loan Society. I remem<lb></lb>ber Mr. Watt applying for a loan of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. about the 12th of Feb. last year—he proposed two sureties, Adams, who is here in Court, and Spriggins—our society meets on Monday and Tuesday evenings—he proposed the sureties through the late secretary, Potte—Potter proposed them in the week—on sureties being proposed, we institute some inquiries into their responsibility—I went with Potter to inquire into the respectibility of these sureties—at the meeting in the following week, Tuesday, the 20th, I remember Mr. Watt coming to ask for the money—Adams was with him—(Spriggins</p>

               <p>had signed the note before)—the business was conducted in the office, up stairs, on that occasion—I do not remember who was present when Adams and Watt came in—there were a great number her of persons there, perhaps—I was there—Mr. Watt asked for the money—I said no, we could not advance the money on those securities, that we must have another person—he said he could give me another, and he gave me the name of White—I then said to him, "As you have Mr. Adams here, you and Adams can join on the note; put your names on the note, to prevent Adams coming again;" and it was done—they both signed, and I desired Mr. Kennett to witness their signatures—he was in the office at the time, which he always was—occasionally he was absent—I am quite certain that Mr. Watt, as well as Mr. Adams, signed the note that night—Mr. Kennett was employed in the office—it was the usual course for Potter to witness the signatures—that was departed from, because he was not in the room, I suppose, or being intoxicated, which he often was, or some other thing—I requested Mr. Kennett to witness these signatures, or it would not have been done—I saw him witness them.</p>

               <p>time I called on him, since Christmas, I believe—I did not call on Adams or Spriggins, nor give directions that they should be sent to about Mr. Watt's signature, only to White—I swear I have not been to anybody but White before the action was tried, and after it was brought, to endeavour to prove Mr. Watt's signature—the money was paid to Mr. Watt, I be<lb></lb>lieve, on the 21st—I was there—he signed the bill on the Tuesday—I kept the bill after he had signed it—he had nothing to show then, and no money—that is usual—it happens so occasionally that the principal signs without getting the money, and leaves the bill in my hands, having nothing to show, when we want another security—we do so when we know who we are dealing with—I believe 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was paid to Mr. Watt—that sum was handed over to him at one time—I gave it to Mr. Potter, which I always did—he was to hand it over to Mr. Watt—I gave Potter 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on Wednesday evening, the 21st—I do not know how many persons were present when Mr. Watt signed the bill—there are generally a great many persons present, sometimes a dozen, and sometimes two or three, as it happens—it is impossible for me to state whether there was a dozen on this occasion—I have no doubt there were some there—I was there, and two or three more persons might be there—I cannot recollect how many there might be in the room.</p>

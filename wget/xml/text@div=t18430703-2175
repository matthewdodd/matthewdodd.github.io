                  </hi>. I live in Redcross-square. Between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, on the 4th of July, I met the prisoner in Gray's Inn-lane—I went with her to a public-house and gave her some beer—I gave her some rum at another house—we then went to Bartholomew-close and had a talk for about an hour—I gave her 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and when I was coming away I missed a half-sovereign and a half-crown from my left trowsers pocket—I know I had them safe when I first met her—there were a few persons at the bar of the first public-house, but I know I had it safe when I paid for the beer there—I could not be sure that I had it when I paid for the rum—the policeman came up and I gave her in charge.</p>

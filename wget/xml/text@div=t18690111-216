                  </hi>. I live at 12, Russell Court, St. George's—on Friday night, 10th December, I was at the Bell public-house, Ratcliffe Highway between 12 and 1 o'clock—the deceased was not with me; he was standing a few yards away from me—I was standing talking to the potman—I saw the prisoner and a girl walk past—Buckley walked after them; they stopped against the Hoop and Grapes, and had some words—Buckle put up his hands in a sparring way—I ran up, and saw the prisoner hit him in the belly; I did not see anything in his hand—Buckley halloaed out that he was stabbed, and the prisoner ran away—I went and fetched a policeman—I afterwards saw Buckley at the station, bleeding from the belly; I knew him by sight.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman K</hi> 439). On this morning I was on duty in St. George's Street, Ratcliffe Highway—I heard cries of "Police!"—I went up, and saw the deceased being carried by four men towards the station, bleeding—in consequence of information I went to 12, Palmer's Folly, about two hundred yards off, and saw the prisoner—I said "I want you for stabbing a man in the Highway"—he said "I know nothing about it"—I then took him into custody—in going to the station he said "He attempted to rob me, and I used the knife in self-defence"—I searched him, and found on him this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in his outside coat pocket; there was wet blood on the blade at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I was house surgeon at the London Hospital on the morning of 11th October, when Buckley was brought in he had been pre<lb></lb>viously seen by a surgeon, and his wound dressed—I did not see the wound for a day or two afterwards; it was an incised wound, about two and a half inches in length—it was such a wound as this knife would make—it was on</p>

               <p>the left side, just at the point of the cartilage of the eighth rib—I did the best I could for him—he died on Saturday, 19th December—I made a <hi rend="italic">port-mortem</hi> examination on the Monday following—the cause of death was in-flammation of the lining membrane of the abdominal cavity, caused by the wound—it penetrated the abdominal wall—I heard from the surgeon that some of the intestines were protruding at the time—the intestine itself was not wounded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

On Saturday morning, the 10th instant, I was in the Hoop and Grapes public-house; the prisoner was in the music-room; I saw him go in and come out again. I was out in the street; the prisoner pulled off his coat and said to me, 'Feel my muscle; can you fight? Put up your hands, if I hit you it will be sudden death.' I burst out laughing, and he squared over right at me; and he had a knife in his hand, but I did not see it then, and he struck me on the left side, below the ribs, and I felt I was stabbed. I followed him a little way, and then I fell; then he ran away in the direction of Shadwell Church. I knew the prisoner before; I am sure he is the man.—(<hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi>) I never saw you before last Thursday week. I did not strike you, you were not on the ground at all.

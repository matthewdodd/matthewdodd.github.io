On the 18th of June, I spent the evening at Lord Roseberry's (who is my master's brother), in Portman-square. I left there about half-past one, or a little before two o'clock in the morning. I met a friend in South Audley-street, talked a few minutes with him, and then came direct home. When I got under <placeName id="t18170702-53-crimeloc304">Temple-bar</placeName>

They came up to me-two of them collared me, and the third drew my watch out of my fob; I felt it go. I can swear that the prisoners, Swainson and Drummond, are two of them. I do not know who took the watch - They surrounded and pinioned me before they took it. Swainson got hold of my arm, which I had put round Drummond's neck at the time I was trying to secure my watch. I called out, "you have robbed me!" and"watch!" I saw them hand it from one to the other, and heard the seals jibgle. Drummond's hat fell off-he picked it up, and ran away round the Bar into the Strand. I followed Swainson, who went the same way - I never lost sight of him. I came up to him before he got through the Bar. He turned into the road - I secured him, and said, "you have stolen my watch!" - He said he had not. I said he was one of the party, and gave him in charge of Allden, the watchman, who came up at my cry; we took him to St. Dunstan's watch-house-nothing was found on him. I went out with the constable into Fleet-street, Wainwright was given in charge by some person, I do not know who. I only recollect the persons of two of them. I have not recovered my watch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. I never saw them before. It was about five minutes after three o'clock, quite daylight. I was not the least intoxicated.</p>
               <p>THOMAS LEFEVRE. I am a collector of the City tolls. On the morning of the 19th of June, I was walking backward and forward, between Chancery-lane and Templebar, to collect the tolls; I knew all the prisoners by sight - I have known Swainson and Drummond particularly well for a fortnight. I had seen Wainwright one or two nights before. I suppose I saw him pass me, in the course of the night of the robbery, about twenty times, in company with Swainson, between Temple-bar and Chancery-lane-another person was with them, it was not Drummond. About one o'clock in the morning, I had occasion to look at a book, and went under the gas-light to look at it; the prisoners, Swainson and Wainwright, came, and stooped and looked down under my hat. Knowing them, I put the book into my pocket; they went away-this drew my attention to them. I saw them walk backward and forward several times after. About three o'clock I saw all the prisoners standing together at the end of Shire-lane, on the City side of the Bar-they were talking together, and walked backward and forward. I got very near to them at one time, and heard a voice say, "Come along over!" I do not know who spoke. They went into the road, under the archway, and on the pavement on the opposite side, on the Middlesex side of Temple-bar. I crossed over to observe them, and placed myself on the City side of the Bar, next door to Messrs. Child's banking-house. In a minute or two, I saw the prisoners, Drummond, come along directly after Mr. Taylor, who was coming towards the Bar-all the prisoners were on the Middlesex side. Drummond came under the Bar first, walking very slowly, Mr. Taylor came next, and the prisoners, Swainson and Wainwright, came behind him-Mr. Taylor was between the three. I saw Swainson and Wainwright seize him by the collar.</p>
               <p>Q. In what situation was he at that time - A. About a foot, or a foot and a half, within the City, the farthest side of the Bar is in the City. Directly as they seized him, Drummond turned round, his back was then towards me. I saw him, just at that moment, lift his arm up, as if he had made a snatch in a hurry-that moment Mr. Taylor put his arm round Drummond's neck, and said, you have robbed me, and called out watch! While he was calling out, the prisoners, Swainson and Wainwright, laid hold of his arm, lifted it up, and Drummond got away. As soon as he got his head from under Mr. Taylor's arm, I saw him stoop down and pick his hat up which fell off in the scuffle - He picked it up with his right hand. I looked down, and saw a watch in his left hand; he ran under Temple-bar, and turned into the carriage-road, into the City again, and started up Shire-lane - I saw no more of him. I kept my eye upon the others, and heard Mr. Taylor say, "you are one of them." He laid hold of Swainson. Swainson said,"I have not got your watch." Allden took him in charge. When I found the prosecutor had not given charge of Wainwright, I kept my eye upon him - He was never out of my sight. He stood, and appeared very much alarmed. When he found he was not noticed, he walked gently up towards the watch-house-by that time Swainston had gone up the court to the watch-house. I walked by the side of Wainwright, counting some halfpence. Just as I got to the end of the watch-house court, he said to me,"Do you know what they are going to do with that poor man?" - I made no answer. He said, "Do you know whether he has taken a pocket handkerchief?" I told him I did not know, as I had my business to mind. I staid<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181707020023"></xptr>by his side a few minutes, and the first watchman that I saw, I told that he was one of them - He was secured; a man named Turner took him. The next day I described Drummond to Gimber and Turner.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Wainwright did not attempt to get away. Drummond held my place formerly. I never said right or wrong he should not have it again.</p>

            . I am constable of the night. On the 19th of June, about ten minutes after three o'clock, the prisoner, Swainson, was brought to the watch-house by Allden, and Taylor, the prosecutor. Nothing was found on him. He said he had not seen Taylor before. He said, that having been in trouble before, he saw the bustle, and endeavoured to avoid it, but Mr. Taylor came forward and gave him in charge. Wainwright was brought in soon after, and called himself Thomas Leonard-Mr. Taylor did not know him. Lefevre described Drummond to me, and told me his name was Drummond. I apprehended him at Waterloo. Fair on the same day. I took him into a public-house and searched him. He said,"What do you want with me? I know nothing about the matter; I know nothing about the watch - I have been in Shire-lane this morning at seven o'clock; and is it likely, that if I had got the watch that I should be without money?" This was before I searched him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When you first saw him, did you tell him what you took him for - A. Not a word of the kind - I never told him what I took him for. He said he knew nothing of the watch, without having any thing said to him about it.</p>

               <p>Court to THOMAS TAYLOR. Q. At the time the three prisoners assaulted you, did you perceive any other persons near - A. I did not. It was not in my power to see any but the three who assaulted me.</p>
               <p>DRUMMOND'S Defence. Lefevre saw me about the Bar. I go there to see what money he takes, as I was going to buy the toll. He said I was no better than a thief, and that he would do for me in some way or other.</p>
               <p>SWAINSON'S Defence. Unfortunately for me, Mr. Taylor has mistaken me for the right man. I was coming by, saw the scuffle, and tried to avoid it. Lefevre has sworn falsely - I was not about the Bar before.</p>

I only know the prisoner by his coming into my shop, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, on the 11th of October; I was in the shop at the time he came in, I was at my writing desk, and my young man shewed him some silk handkerchiefs; I don't believe he bought any; he staid in the shop from six to eight minutes. Immediately after he went away, my young man observed to me, that there was a piece of silk handkerchiefs missing. I told him he had better go to Mr. Thrickley's, the haberdasher; for perhaps the prisoner might be trying to sell<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181510250011"></xptr>them there. On his telling me that a piece of silk handkerchiefs was missing, I missed them myself. I afterwards went to the watchhouse, and saw the prisoner; the watchhouse-keeper had the handkerchiefs then.</p>

            . I am shopman to the last witness. The prisoner came into his shop on the 11th of this month, for some silk handkerchiefs; I shewed him several patterns, and at last, he pulled a handkerchief out of his pocket, and said that that was the patterns which he wished; he said, unless we had the same pattern it would not do. I could not come to an agreement with him; he staid in the shop from five to eight minutes; he then went away. As soon as he was gone, I missed a piece of silk handkerchiefs, containing four. I told Mr. Stevenson, and he told me to go to Mr. Thrickley's. I found the prisoner coming out of Mr. Jones's; Mr. Jones is a haberdasher. I stepped into Mr. Jones's, and asked him if a person had been looking at some silk handkerchiefs. I did not find the handkerchiefs at Mr. Jones's. I then crossed over into Mortimer-market, and saw the prisoner pull the piece of handkerchiefs out of his pocket; I stepped up to him; I laid hold of him with one hand, and took the handkerchiefs from him with the other; he got away from me, and ran as hard as he could; I cried stop thief, and he was stopped in the street. The watch-house-keeper has got the piece of handkerchiefs. The prisoner was taken to the watchhouse.</p>

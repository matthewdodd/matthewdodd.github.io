At 20 minntes past 7 o'clock on 14th June, I was watching the prosecutor's wharf in Upper Thames-street—the prisoner Avery drew his cart under the granary at Rutland Wharf—he received twenty-four sacks of oats—I counted them there he drove them away to Bridge-street, Blackfriars—when he reached there he was joined by another man—they drove through Fleet-street, to Dean-street, Soho—Avery then left the cart in charge of the other man, who had joined him in Bridge-street, and that man drove on to Newman<lb></lb>mews, Castle-street, Oxford-street—I followed the cart all the way, and when it reached Newman-mews, the prisoner Avery was there; and I saw him take sacks containing oats off the cart and place them in a stable in Newman-mews—another officr was with me, and we went into the</p>

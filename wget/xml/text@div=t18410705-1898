                  </hi>. I am a wine and beer merchant, living in Lime-street. I have one partner—the prisoner was our cellar-man and carman—he had been in our service four or five years—I found my stock was diminishing, and got an officer to watch the prisoner when he left my premises—on the 25th of June he went out with goods—after he had gone Forrester re<lb></lb>turned, and communicated something to me—when the prisoner returned I called him into the counting-house—my brother asked what places he had been to—he mentioned each place that he should have gone to, but did not name Berkley-street—Forrester, who was present, said, "Are you certain you have not been any where else?"—after a little hesitation, he said he had taken a dozen to Berkley-street, and he intended to pay for them—I do not know that he had ever bought any of us but once; but never, under any circumstances, was he allowed to take it without our knowledge—I went to Berkley-street, and found a dozen bottles of porter in a cupboard, which his wife led us to—there were some other bottles there, some empty, and some with things in them—the corks had our names on them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of the City of London. On the 25th of June I watched at Messrs. Cramer's premises, and saw the prisoner leave—I followed him in a gig—he went to No. 12, Berkley-street, and I saw him in the act of getting out of the cart with a basket which contained a dozen bottles, which appeared to be full—the door of No. 12 was opened—he handed in the bottles, and the basket was returned to him empty—he returned to the cart with it—he returned to the house again with an um<lb></lb>brella, then got into the cart, and went on to his other places—I commu<lb></lb>nicated this to the prosecutors, and what has been stated is correct—I went to the house, and found a dozen bottles of porter there.</p>

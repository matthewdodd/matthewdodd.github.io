               <p>On Friday last the fifth of April, about a quarter before six o'clock I was sitting in the counting house by myself, I heard a disturbance in the warehouse, and I looked and I saw the prisoner taking something out of a box, which from the noise and situation I supposed to be nutmegs; the box was in the warehouse on the shelf; I saw him through the window out of the counting house, by which we have an opportunity of looking all over the warehouse; I opened the counting house door, and he immediately came from the place, and he took up an old bag, and I asked him what he wanted? he said, he wanted an apron; I immediately charged him with the theft of taking these nutmegs, and the acknowledged it, and I brought him to the counting house, and I took out of his right hand coat pocket fifty-nine nutmegs; this is all that passed at that time; I was at his apartment the same evening, (the prisoner was then in the Poultry Compter,) the prisoner's wife was there, we found some black lead pencils, cocoa, and several other articles; to the best of my recollection thirty-two black lead pencils and twenty-three others, we found some cocoa, the box had our label on it; we gave these things into the custody of the officer, his name is Hickens. I have no more to observe, except the manner in which he got into the house; I was told how he got in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you told that in the prisoner's presence? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. The place in which you sat, and in which you saw this was a place separated from the warehouse commanding a full view of it? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course the prisoner must know that? - He must; when I charged him with taking the nutmegs he acknowledged that he had taken them illegally.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say that Mr. Hodgson? did not he say that your porter had given him leave to take some at the usual price? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>THOMAS DICKENS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the constable that took the man, he was delivered to me about six o'clock last Friday evening, the day of the robbery.</p>

(Produced and deposed to by Mr. Blakey, the pencils as having the maker's name on them, who lives in Cumberland, and serving none but him, and the cocoa having his label on them.)</p>

               <p>Dickens. The wife unlocked the box and gave the things out of the box.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I bought the cocoa and paid for it to Mr. Porter the other partner, I bought two quarters of a pound and paid 16 d. for it, and every article that they found in my room, I honestly paid for as ever I did any thing in the world; as for the pencils I bought them of a Jew in November last, and as for the nutmegs Mr. Hodgson was in the house; I met Mr. Porter in Budge row and told him what I wanted; he told me to go and have them; our master's servant was at the door and desired me to walk in. I was taken bad last Saturday three weeks and was obliged to go to bed till Thursday following; I went again to my place the Monday after, and Mr. Porter called me into the counting house and said, he and I had better settle; says he, I don't understand your being off a week; I told him I was ill; then he said, I had better rest then come to do nothing; then says I, we met friends and I hope we shall part friends.</p>

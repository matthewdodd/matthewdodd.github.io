                  </hi>. I am a licensed retailer of beer, and live in Villier's-street, Walworth Common, in the parish of St. Mary, Newington. I keep the house—on Saturday, the 30th of March, I locked up my house—between two and three in the morning I was aroused by the police, I came down, and saw the prisoner in custody at the foot of the stairs near the bar—I found the tap room window facing the street, wide open, and my till on the table, which I had left underneath the bar counter over night—I missed two six<lb></lb>pences—a bag was taken from a cupboard in the bar, which was found in an adjoining room—the house had been entered by the tap room window which was shut down close over night, and the shutters were shut, but not fastened—I had seen the prisoner in the tap room the evening before—he was not in the tap room when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was in the house playing at cards; I was intoxicated; I fell asleep, and got under the seat, and was locked in; I could not make any body hear; I pulled down the shutters, and the policeman was standing out<lb></lb>side. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> It is a very small tap room—alter all the customers were gone I went and took the glasses off the table—the gas was burning strong, and if he had been in the room I must have seen him.</p>

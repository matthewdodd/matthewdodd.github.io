                  </hi>. I am shopman to Joseph Allison, of Regent-street. About six o'clock in the evening of the 10th of Feb., the prisoners came to our shop to look at some shawls—they were shown a good many, but did not like any—the young man who was showing them went to another part of the shop for another shawl, and Heffren concealed one shawl under another shawl on the counter—then the young man went to another part of the shop for another shawl, and I saw Adams take that shawl and put it under her own—they then bought one, and paid half-a-crown on it—a young man came up and said that was not the way we did business, they roust pay for it or give their address—they declined that, and Heffren said she would come with her aunt on Monday and pay the remainder—I then told him what had happened, and he sent for an officer, who came, and in the mean time the shawl was found lying on the floor two or three yards from where the prisoners sat.</p>

I was talking to a man in the same box; as soon as I missed her and the bundle I went to the landlord, I asked him if he saw a woman with a bundle, he said he did, he knew the woman; the landlord sent for Mr. Sheppard, I gave him the description of the bundle, and in the course of an hour the constable returned with the bundle, he took me to the watchhouse, and there was the woman; I knew the woman, I am sure that is the woman.</p>

            . On this night week I received information of the sailor being robbed. I apprehended the prisoner in a lodging-house in Spitalfields. I asked her if that bundle belonged to her, she said it did. I took the prisoner to the watchhouse, I took the sailor, he identified the prisoner, and said the bundle was his.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she sober or drunk - A. I do not think she was perfectly sober, she knew what she was about; she went down on her knees and asked the sailor pardon in the watchhouse.</p>

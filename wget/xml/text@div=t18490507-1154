                  </hi> I am a labourer, of 15, Snow's-rents, Westminster, and keep the house next door as well; the prisoner is a lodger of mine there. On 7th March, about two o'clock, I heard something, went to her room, and found her quarrelling with her husband, and breaking up my furniture—I said there was plenty broken without her breaking any more—she said nothing, but took up a hammer and struck me deliberately on the head—I sank on a chair, she pulled me off it, and I sunk on the floor, she then kicked me about the head—my little boy came in—I became insensible—when I <hi rend="italic">came to</hi>, I was being <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> down-stairs by somebody—my wife, who went in before me, had gone for a policeman—I went to a doctor's and had my head dressed, but the blood did not stop, and I went to the hospital—I did not remain there then, but was obliged to go in the next' week, and kept my bed there—the prisoner's husband told her not to strike me—before she struck me she said I had no business there—I said I had, to protect my property.</p>

                  </hi> I went with my husband—the prisoner was very tipsy, and had broken the table, looking-glass, and other things, which were strewed about the floor—I knew her by the name of Mrs. Lucy—she ordered me out of the place; saying, "It is my apartment; I pay for it, I shall do as I please"—my husband said he would not go out till she ceased breaking the things—she struck him on the head with a hammer which was on a table, be fell on a chair, bleeding furiously—she was cursing and going on most terribly—her husband begged her to be quiet, but she would not—my husband fell on the floor—she kicked him dreadfully—her husband laid down by the side of him; and said, "Rebecca, pray don't do it any more," and picked him up, and got him to the stairs—the prisoner took a large saucepan and beat him dread<lb></lb>fully over the head—Mr. Lucy begged me to get a policeman, and the struck him, and split his lip—my husband was insensible; and caught hold of her by the gown, she fell on him, and he fell down the whole flight of stairs, and his head went against the wall—while he was in the hospital the policeman took the prisoner, as we heard she was going to Bristol.</p>

                  </hi> I am house-surgeon at the Westminster Hospital. Crawley was first brought on 7th March, he had three or four small scalp-wounds on the back of his head by the ear—they had not gone to the bone, and were not dangerous—there was not much blood—a hammer or a saucepan would have inflicted them—he came next day again—in about a week he came very ill, erysipelas was coming on; he was put to bed, and did not leave for about three weeks.</p>

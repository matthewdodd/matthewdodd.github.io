            . I live in Fox's-lane, Shadwell. On the 23rd of November, I received my wages, and went to a public-house with a friend; my wages were tied up in a bit of rag; there was half a sovereign, and three half-crowns, and I put them in my left-hand trowsers pocket; we drank there, and I went to pay for it, the prisoner came in; she knew my acquaintance, and we went and had some beer in her house; my friend then went to the door, and the light was blown out, and five or six women came in and began to beat me; my pocket was torn out and the money fell on the floor; they picked up the three half-crowns, but the officer got the half-sovereign - I caught hold of the prisoner, and kept her, and sung out, "murder;" the policeman came in; I went up stairs with the prisoner but nothing passed between us; I gave her 6d.; the officer asked me who I accused; I said, "This woman, and the old woman of the house."</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He asked me the expence of the house; I told him the price and 6d. for the servant; he then took me up stairs, and I put out the candle, and his expressions were dreadful. Witness. I gave her 6d.; she asked for no more.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did she make any demand for money which you refused to give her? A. No; she took the light in her hand up-stairs, and blew it out directly the door was shut; we were sitting on the bed-side together; she seized my pocket, and called for the old woman, and five or six came in.</p>

             (police-constable K 160). I was called about two o'clock in the morning, by a female who appeared to come from the house; I went up-stairs with three females; I found the prisoner, the woman who keeps the brothel, and the prosecutor there; he said, he had been robbed of a half-sovereign, and three half-crowns; I asked him to pick out the person; he picked out the prisoner and the landlady; I searched the prisoner and found on her two sixpences and some half-pence; I then heard something chink on the floor, the prisoner stooped, picked it up and put it into her mouth; I seized her mouth, opened it, and she dropped this half-sovereign on the floor, which my brother officer took up; there was blood on the prisoner, and the prosecutor; the prisoner had a tremendous blow over her eye, and the prosecutor had a blow on his face, and his trowsers were torn.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. If I had not sent for the officer, he would have killed me; he gave me this cut over my eye. Witness. The woman who came to me appeared to come from the house.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw the prisoner take the candle and look for the half-sovereign, and put it into her mouth; my brother officer seized her, she dropped it and I took it up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I turned everything off the bedstead, and found the half-sovereign. I thought it might belong to my friend.</p>

                  </hi>. My husband keeps a bookseller's shop, 55, Church Street, Camberwell—on October 1st, about 7 o'clock, the prisoner brought in a book marked 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which had been outside on the stall—he did not speak, but gave me a florin; I put it to my teeth and found it was bad—I said "You have given me a bad florin; you gave me one on 20th Sep<lb></lb>tember; I believe you are like the man"—I was showing it to a lady and he took it from me, but I took it from him again and sent for a policeman—he then said that he got it from a tobacconist—he offered me a good half-crown, but I would not take it—he said that he got the florin from a boy outside, and would go outside and fetch him, but I took him by the collar and said "You shall not leave till the policeman comes"—he twisted my hand and got away—I went outside, saw him running, called "Stop thief!" and Preston brought him back, and I gave him in charge with the florin.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a leather case maker, of 10, Benhill Road, Camberwell—on the evening of 1st October I was passing Mrs. Clark's shop, and she called me in and said, "This man has passed a bad two-shilling piece, will you be kind enough to see if you can see a constable?"—I went down the street about 200 yards, and then heard a cry of "Stop thief," turned round, and saw the same man running whom I had seen in the shop—when he got close to me I went to lay hold of him, but missed my aim, and he turned up Grove Lane, which is no thoroughfare—I went after him; he turned round: and faced me; I laid hold of him, and took him back to the shop and handed him over to a constable—I recognised him as the man I had seen in the shop.</p>

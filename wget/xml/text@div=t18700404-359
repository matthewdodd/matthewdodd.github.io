                  </hi>. I was in the service of Messrs. King, in October—I remember delivering some bricks—I believe it was on the 8th I delivered 500 stock bricks—my brother, John Asser, was there on the same day—I went with the first load of 500—I went between 9.0 and 10.0 with my load, and I believe he went between 1.0 and 2.0—I did not take a ticket with my load, because I knew another 500 bricks were going—I delivered them to Charles Cooper, who was there—I was first asked about this in February, when Mr. Porter said he had not bad the bricks.</p>

I am the man who was tried yesterday—on 8th October, I took a load of bricks to Mr. Porter—my brother took the first load in the morning, and I delivered the second load, between 1 and 2 o'clock—I was examined in the County Court—I said there that Cooper assisted in un<lb></lb>loading the bricks, and I say so now—he had often helped me to unload on previous occasions—I can't say how many times—I have been there dozens of times—I know the little boy, John Cooper—I gave him the ticket to take to Mr. Porter, and he said Mr. Porter was engaged, and I was to call again, and I went several times after—I went back without the receipt—I went again two or three times that day and in the evening—I should think I went seven or eight times altogether—I saw the little boy and the girl—I never got the ticket, and came away without it.</p>

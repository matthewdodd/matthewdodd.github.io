I went and got a gentleman and his footman to search about; they found nobody; but I missed the things mentioned in the indictment; some from out of a closet in my bedchamber, and some out of a bureau, which was broke open.

When Collins was before Sir John, he declared that Bird was under the bed when my maid put the children to bed; that Bird went into the house and flung the things out over the park-wall to him; and that they carried them to the woman to fell them. The woman described all things. Bird had a little before cleaned all my windows.</p>

We have a customer of the name of Charles Wilson, 65, Basinghall-street—for some reason I did not pay the cheque, and I communicated with the first cashier, Mr. Robinson—we asked the prisoner to take a seat, which he did, and we sent for Mr. Wilson—I did not know the prisoner at all.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Somerville's Defence.</hi> About a week prior to 29th, I met a man named John Watts, a total stranger to me; he asked me if I was out of employ<lb></lb>ment, and that he could put a pound or two in my pocket. I said, "How?" He said, "Will you present a cheque for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the Union Bank?"—I said I would.

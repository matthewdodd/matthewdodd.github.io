               <p>nobody wore scarves, and that the satin, being creased, was of no use for dresses—I did say, "Our dressers, Messrs.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Messrs. Taylor and Stokes, of Friday Street—they are large manufacturers of moire antiques, satins, and silks—I examined the stock when the robbery was found out—between the 1st of January and the 31st of December, 1866, when I took the stock, there was a deficiency of about 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—I missed forty-one moire antique dresses, value 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; also forty-four dozen and a half of satin handkerchiefs, value 149<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., trade prices—this moire antique was manufactured by Taylor and Stokes—it is worth about nine guineas, trade price—a West End house, I dare say, would charge twelve guineas for it—there were dresses missing from my employer's stock corresponding to this.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">continued</hi>). This piece, received from Temple, was manufactured by Taylor and Stokes—I know it by a mark—I have got the fellow piece in my pocket, marked the same—the mark would have been 3098, but the dress has taken the first number away, and therefore it is 098—I produce this piece from Messrs. Taylor's stock—I have exa<lb></lb>mined the piece from Messrs. Taylor's stock, and it is the fellow piece to this produced to-day—the trade price would be 120<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I cannot give the retail price, because it is only used for old gentlemen—it is rich enough for dresses, but not made for that—the trade price of this piece, received from Dodd, is 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it is my employer's manufacture—the number is 707—it is a number put on the dresses to let us know our goods from other people's—it is a number missing from the stock, and so is the other.</p>

                  </hi>. I am housekeeper to Messrs. Taylor and Stokes, and live on the premises—during my management Morrell came eight or nine times to the warehouse before nine; sometimes at half-past eight, sometimes at twenty minutes to nine, before Mr. Cushway came—he sometimes stayed in, and sometimes went out before nine, making excuses for doing so—that was before any of the rest of the establishment came.</p>

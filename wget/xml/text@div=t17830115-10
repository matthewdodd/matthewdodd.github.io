               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. This happened between eight and nine at night? - Yes, nine.</p>
               <p>A very dark night I think, was not it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was on the near side of the cart, and the man jumped down from off the other side? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you never saw who that man was, till you overtook a person and brought him back; how do you know that the man you overtook, was that man that jumped off? - He was, the man was never out of my sight.</p>

               <p>On Sunday morning my man going round to see the sheep, came to me about twelve, and told me we had lost six sheep; I saw the sheep in the stable at Mr. Errington's, at Kilburn Wells, they were my sheep, I knew them by their marks.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you yourself count over the number of sheep that you ought to have had in your field? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Then all that you know of this matter is, that the sheep that you saw had the same mark that your sheep had? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Many other people may have the same mark as well as you? - Yes they may, but they have not, every farmer has his own mark.</p>
               <p>Then you could not have sworn to them to be your sheep? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What, merely by the sheep? - Yes, and by the countenance of the sheep, and the colour of them.</p>
               <p>That is another thing? - It is very clear that they were my sheep.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. I think you say of your own knowledge you did not know how many sheep you had? - It is impossible, if you doubt any thing ask my servant who did tell them.</p>
               <p>I shall ask him likewise.</p>
               <p>Court to Hemmings. You have no doubt they were your sheep? - None in the world.</p>

               <p>What did you do in consequence of missing these sheep? - I missed six, out of sixty-two, I searched round the field; there are more sheep just by, I went to see there for them, I searched in the lanes, I saw the track of a cart into another man's ground, in and out again, the cart might have stood there for a couple of hours by the look of it, that was about 200 yards from my master's, the field belonged to one Mr. Millett.</p>
               <p>Was there any track of a cart in your grounds? - No, there was the track of a horse, the cart came just by the gate; it was some distance by the seem of it, where they landed the sheep.</p>
               <p>Where did you first see these sheep? - At Mr. Errington's, at Kilburn Wells, I saw the sheep when they were brought back again, I did not see them till I had sent to my master, I saw them after, I knew them by the marks, and by the countenance of the sheep.</p>
               <p>Should you have known these sheep if you had seen them in any other place? - Yes, I should.</p>
               <p>Can you swear they are your master's property? - I can.</p>
               <p>How long have you looked after these sheep? - Ever since just the beginning of hay time.</p>

               <p>Do you mean to say that you know they are Dorsetshire sheep? - Yes, I know by the countenance they are Dorsetshire sheep, and by the mark, that they are my master's sheep.</p>

             came to my room in Portpool-lane, and he called me up about half past six, he said will you go and have any beer Tom, says I must have a pint with my breakfast, and I got up and went down to the Green Man, there was Phillimore and Jennings, the butcher and Oakley, and they asked me to drink, and I drank along with them, we had four or five pots or more, and Phillimore said to me, says he, Tom will you walk, says I, I do not care if I do; the butcher went home he did not go along with us, Phillimore and Oakley and I went round the fields and came to Padington, we went to to the Coach and Horses, and they got some victuals and drink; Phillimore came out of the house and said,</p>
               <p>"Damn me says he, I will go into London and fetch a cart and horse, if you will go along with Oakley and take a walk and come back," said he would go to London and fetch a cart if we would go and steal some sheep, he left us, and just as we came up to the turnpike gate, we saw Phillimore and the butcher; the butcher was driving the cart, they took the horse to the watering trough at Padington, we went into the house and called for a quartern of gin, we drank it and Phillimore came in, and he had a glass of gin, he paid for it, we went out directly, the butcher drove the cart along the Harrow on the Hill road, Phillimore said, get up into the cart, and he drove it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178301150020"></xptr> as far as the sign of the Plow, up the Harrow on the Hill road, and he turned the corner round the lane, away for Kilbourn, before we came to Kilbourn, he stopped and drove into a field on the opposite side of these sheep, and tied the horse to the hedge; we went into the field and brought the sheep into a corner, and caught six sheep and tied their legs, Phillimore went and fetched the cart, and Jennings and Oakley lifted them upon the rail, and I carried them to the cart, and Phillimore put them in the cart and drove away; I went into a Chandler's shop to get some small beer, the butcher and Oakley came running by and by God, the cart is stopped and Phillimore is taken; Oakley said, says he, I will go back and see what is become of him, they do know me; we went and staid at a public house, and in about half an hour Oakley came to us, and we agreed to meet at the Cock in Tottenham Court Road, on Sunday morning at seven o'clock, but we could hear no tidings of him; I went home till about ten at night, I was gone to bed, and there came three men and took me from my wife and three children; they told me that the other men were evidence against me, and would hang me.</p>


               <p>Prisoner Phillimore. I leave it to my counsel.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner Phillimore brought two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. With respect to Oakley, I have not called on him to make any defence, there being no evidence against him, but that of Compton alone, who is the accomplice; there is no one circumstance proved by any witnesses except Compton, which connects Oakley at all with his business. The evidence of an accomplice alone, the wisdom and justice of the law will not permit to convict any man, an accomplice not being in contemplation of law, or of common sense, so deserving of credit, that for his sake the life of any person should be taken away; and therefore, though the law does not wholly reject such evidence, yet it takes a middle course, and will not suffer that to be the only evidence on which a man is to be convicted; but only to explain or connect circumstances which are left to the jury.</p>

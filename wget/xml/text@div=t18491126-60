                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, in the service of Messrs. Pontifex, coppersmiths, of Shoe-lane—they have also a factory at Millwall, where I have been employed between five and six years—Joseph Riddell was the manager of that factory—I do not know what William Riddell was; he was employed there—in March, 1848, I was employed with Harrison, at a house in Birnie-street, Greenwich, where the prisoners resided—I made a cupboard for the kitchen there—I received directions about it at different times, from both the prisoners—those directions were given at the factory at Millwall—the cupboard was made of battens, which I got from the factory at Millwall—William Riddell told me to take them—there was a stock of battens there, for the purposes of the factory—I took perhaps about fifty feet; it was certainly thirty feet, but I cannot say any further—that wood was used for the cupboard—Harrison assisted me in making it—we made it up at Millwall, and afterwards took it to Greenwich to fix—the prisoners saw us fixing it—I cannot say whether they saw us preparing it—I do not recollect when it was that Joseph Riddell first spoke to me about the cupboard; it was at Greenwich—I do not remember the precise words William Riddell used when he told me to take the wood—he said I was to go into the lead-works, and take some of those inch-and-a-quarter battens—the stock of deals that we had on the premises belonged to Messrs. Pontifex—there were four shelves to the cupboard—I also made some rough kind of shelves, of the same kind of material, for the wine-cellar, at the same time—William Riddell ordered me to make them—Mr. Joseph saw them after they were done, while we were fixing them—the value of both the cupboard and shelves might be about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., including labour; the materials might be about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—while I was working on the cupboard and shelves I received my wages in the usual way, as we did every Saturday at the factory—Mr. Jones paid us; he always paid the wages—I</p>

Pontifex—the officer Hedington has since shown me some flannel, and the materials of which the cupboard and shelves were made—I went with him to Greenwich, and pointed them out—they were the same I had made by the prisoners' directions—I was not with Hedington when the flannel was found; I saw it afterwards; it was the same sort of flannel as that in which the furniture had been.</p>

Pontifex please—if we lose time we are not paid for it; our time is counted by hours; sometimes we do over-work, make more than six days a week—we do not account to Mr. Jones for our hours when we are paid our wages; it is not Mr. Jones's duty to inquire, but Mr. Riddell's—I never made known to Mr. Jones where I had been at work—he was not on the premises all the week; he was at Shoe-lane; he merely came down on Saturday evening to pay the men—I do not remember seeing either of the Messrs. Pontifex in the carpenters' shop while I was making the cupboard—they did sometimes come into the carpenters' shop—I never went off the premises to work, except on this occasion, and once when I went to Mr. Pontifex's.</p>

Pontifex to do so—I do not think any of the battens or shelves were taken away when Messrs. Pontifex were there—I believe they did not see me making either of the articles—I have no means of knowing whether or not they knew of their being made—the gate-keeper, like the other servants, was under Joseph Riddell's control—we got the things to take to Birnie-street; when we went at six o'clock in the morning, and went direct there after getting what we wanted—I did not mention anything of this to either of the Messrs.

                  </hi>. I have been clerk to Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother William; about five or six years since, we took Joseph Riddell into our employment, as superintendent and manager of the works we were then taking at Millwall—some time after, he asked permission for his brother to come and assist him—I consented to that—I think when Joseph first came, he received 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—we afterwards added other branches to the business, which was a chemical one, and white-lead factory—at first it was only a business for making extracts of logwood; we added other things to it, and we then gave him 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year for some time—in 1846 the returns were not satisfactory, in consequence of which we reduced his salary to 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—I had an explanation with him on the subject; the agreement was not the result of a written correspondence—I told him that the concern turned out very different when we made up the stock account to what he represented, and that as the concern did not pay, I could not give him the same amount of salary that I had done under the idea that it was paying—he said he could not expect it; that I had been exceedingly liberal and kind to him, and whatever I thought was a proper equivalent for his services he should be happy to accept—I said I had talked the matter over with my brother, and that we would give him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per week, but that if he managed the concern so as to make it a profitable one, we would then increase accordingly—he said he was quite willing to accept it—I had long previous to that given instructions to him that not a thing should go from Millwall without an order from our couuting-house—we</p>

               <p>gave William 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week as assistant to his brother—it was his duty generally to assist his brother in the management of the concern—it was Joseph's duty to see that the time charged by the men was properly charged, and remit it to Shoe-lane to be paid—I received some information with reference to Joseph in 1846, in consequence of which 1 told him I had heard many rumours prejudicial to his integrity in carrying on the concern—he said he had many enemies, but he was ready to meet any accusation, and he hoped I should not give credit to anything to his prejudice unless it was proved—I told him that if there was no truth in these things, a course of integrity on his part would give the lie to these reports, and that I would not, unless I could bring something home to him, think of dismissing him, when I knew it would be so prejudicial to his character—he had authority as manager to make such alterations or repairs at Mill wall as were necessary for carrying on our business—when I say alterations, I mean minor things; of course nothing would be done on any scale without my giving him directions—he had no authority to sell anything from Millwall without an order from Shoe-lane; we had expressly prohibited it—I told him repeatedly that it was only a manufactory, and not a commercial place—he never asked my permission to work up any battens of ours on premises of his own—he never had any such authority—I received an anonymous letter about July; I did not speak to Joseph Riddell about it—I had suspicions about July in the present year, that our property had been used by the prisoners—I had no knowledge of our battens being worked up for the purpose of making either shelves for wine cellars or cupboards, at the prisoner's house in Birnie-street—I had never authorized him to do such a thing—I bad not expressly prohibited him from doing so; it did not occur to me to do so—I only gave him a general prohibition, that no property was to be removed without an express order—in March, 1848, I was dissatisfied with the wages account, and communicated that repeatedly to Joseph Riddell—I pointed out to him the number of carpenters employed, which I thought perfectly unnecessary for the repairs of the place—I told him the expenses were much greater than any business could afford to the extent that was being carried on—I mean carpenters and those kind of men, who were not employed in manufacturing any of the articles, but on in the general repairs of the premises—he made a great many excuses, and said they were necessary, and I insisted, and sometimes had some of them dis<lb></lb>charged—there was a stock taking at Millwall in July; in consequence of which, on 15th Sept., I caused a general inquiry to be made of the state of the business and premises there—in consequence of that I learnt something with reference to the prisoner's premises at Birnie-street, and the property that had been at the factory, and in consequence of that I consulted my solicitor, and went down with him and a policeman to Millwall—I do not think I had learnt anything from Spriggs or Harrison at that time—I called some of the men into the counting-house, and put questions to them; the prisoner Joseph was outside—after I had their answers, I called Joseph in and accused him of having falsified the stock accounts to a large amount—I said, "You have weighed refuse of sulphate of lime as tartrate of lime, and taken it into stock, making a difference of about 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I am not sure whether I men<lb></lb>tioned the amount at that time, or subsequently; I think I mentioned the amount in the course of that conversation—he said, "I am very sorry I I have done so; I have been very wrong there"—I said, "But that is not all, Mr. Riddell; I fear that the reports that I have so long heard to your prejudice are true, and that you have been robbing us to a large amount;</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILKINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe, previous to the works at Millwall being started, you had done nothing in the chemical way? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; neither I or my brother had any chemical knowledge—Joseph Riddell had the entire management of the works, under our direction—we were not able to direct the workmen; it was left to him—the general commercial account he had nothing to do with—he had the employing of the men—he has always professed a great deal more knowledge than he has had credit for—he was always a very sanguine man—it was not in consequence of some alleged secret that he possessed, that he insisted on having the employment of the men—I do not recollect that there was any written correspondence between us on the subject—there had been a vast number of letters, of course, written as our manager—there was some correspondence before I engaged him in March, 1843—his engagement was the result of written and personal cor<lb></lb>respondence together—I cannot recollect whether he told me that it was in consequence of his having some secrets which he did not chose to disclose to the world, that he insisted on choosing his own labourers, or his telling me that the more ignorant these labourers were, the better they would suit his purpose—I cannot charge my memory with it—I do not recollect whether he did or not—the number of men employed varied according to the business—there were a great many men and women employed in the white-lead works; seventy or eighty sometimes—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a letter handed in by Mr. Serjeant Wilkins</hi>)—I do not recollect his saying he had any secret, but seeing this letter, I presume that he had written to that effect—I hope I always behaved liberally to him; he always expressed it—he never said in my presence, and the presence of others, that I had treated him more like a partner than a servant; he said more like a father—I generally visited the works two or three times a week—I took a more active part there than my brother—I went to ascertain how things were going on—I generally went over a portion of the premises—I very seldom went into the carpenters' shop—it was not at all times accessible to me, because there were casks sometimes put against it, and when I wanted sometimes to get in, I found some difficulty—I believe there were often people working there when the things were so placed—I might have removed them, of course; and, I did, on one occasion, knock at the window, and insist on having some things removed; they were removed, and I went in—I think it was in June, 1847, that I reduced his salary—I then told him if he increased the profits of the business, his salary should be increased—I am afraid the profits were nothing; as near as we could balance, it was a loss—I never said I found it did not yield above 10 per cent., I wish it had done so—the business increased, but that depended on our com<lb></lb>mercial transactions in Shoe-lane; this was our manufactory—I cannot tell what business was done the first year—all the money transactions were con<lb></lb>ducted in Shoe-lane, and were not separate from the other; therefore, I cannot tell the amount—the raw material went by order from Shoe-lane, and the manufactured articles were either brought to Shoe-lane, or by an order from Shoe-lane taken to the different inns and wharfs, and so on, where they were</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I take it that the prisoners paid no rent for the premises they occupied at the manufactory? No; I think they had four or five rooms—they represented that it was necessary they should be on the premises early in the morning and late at night, but I understand they have not been so—it was necessary that some superintendent should be always on the premises when workmen were there—there were processes that commenced on Friday or Saturday, that went on through Sunday, that required the superintendance of somebody, as evaporation which could not be suspended was going on—there were two workmen there at night, and on the Sunday; that was actually necessary.</p>

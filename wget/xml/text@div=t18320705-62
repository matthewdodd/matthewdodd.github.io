On the 31st of May a little girl named Taylor came to offer a counterpane and a shirt - I placed them on the counter, and went to the other side, to attend to a customer; soon after the little girl left the spot - the prisoner came in, and went to where the parcels were; she went out in two or three minutes, and I missed the shirt; the prisoner returned in five minutes, and I charged her with having taken the shirt - she denied it, and said she was a very honest woman, and seemed surprised that I should suspect her; I asked where she had been - she said to purchase a penny worth of tea, and afterwards a penny worth of gin; I asked if she would object to be searched - she said No: the servant then searched her, but did not find it. On the Saturday after, I was sent for by Mr. Russell, a pawnbroker, and found the prisoner there, with this shirt; I told her this was the shirt she had stolen from my counter - she denied it, and said it was her husband's; I gave her into custody - I do not positively identify the shirt, but this is the one I found there; Mr. Cotton is answerable for the shirt, and has paid for it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not her husband attend at the office? A. Yes, and produced a shirt there, but it was seven inches wider than this - there was only the little girl in the shop when the prisoner came in - I saw her leave the shop, and did not see her take any thing; I might be three or four yards from her - I had seen her come to our shop.</p>

            . I shall be sixteen years old in September - I lived with William Hart and his wife. On the 31st of May I went by Mrs. Hart's direction to Mr. Cotton's, with a shirt and a counterpane which she gave me; the pawnbroker placed them on the counter - the prisoner came in while I was there: I did not see her do any thing, but she went away, and the shirt was missing in three or four minutes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean to swear you were servant to Mr. Hart? A. I was at that time - I was a yard or two from the prisoner while she was in the shop, but there were two or three persons between us - there was a girl and two women.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Russell, a pawnbroker, in Shoreditch. On Saturday night, the 2nd of June, between eight and nine o'clock, the prisoner came and offered a shirt to pawn - in consequence of what we had heard, Mr. Cotton's shopman was sent for, and she was detained - this is the shirt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean you looked at it? A. Yes - here is a red mark on it, which I should think is not often put on shirts; the prisoner is a customer at our shop.</p>

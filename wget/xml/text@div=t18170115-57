On the 16th of December, the prisoner came to our house to see us; we had known him four or five years: he asked if we would let him set up in our house for the night. We had no lodgers in the house, I gave him leave. My husband went to bed before me; I went to bed between twelve and one o'clock, locked the door, and left the key in the door, and the prisoner in the next room to us; my husband spoke to him, at five o'clock in the morning, and he was answered. I did not hear any body go out; my husband got up about half an hour afterwards, and said that the prisoner was gone out; this was before six o'clock. I am sure it was quite dark. I got up; I missed the articles mentioned in the indictment.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PENFOLD. My wife has spoken quite correct; it was quite dark when I got up.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the 29th of December, on board the Helder frigate, off the Tower. I told him what I wanted him for; he said, he was very sorry for it, and that he had sold the boots to a man at Rag-fair. He had a pair of stockings on which Mrs. Penfold claimed, and he did not contradict her.</p>

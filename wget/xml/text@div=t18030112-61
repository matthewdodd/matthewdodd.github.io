               <p>Q. Previous to October last, had there been any money transactions between you and him? - A. There had; I had lent him 10l. he owed me, with the law expences, near 15l. I had taken out a writ against him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you happen to meet him in October? - A. Yes, upon Snow-hill; I asked him how he could serve me in that manner, by not having the bill which he had given me for thirteen guineas, drawn upon Mr. M'Connell, honoured.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the bill? (Shewing it to the witness.) - A. This is the bill. (It is read.)</p>

No, he sent me the bill in a letter; he told me Mr. M'Connell was a man of very considerable property; that the schedule of his property when taken amounted to 40,000l. he said he had been in the King's Bench, but was then out.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that (shewing the witness a letter), is that the letter that enclosed the bill? - A. Yes, the thirteen-guinea bill.(A letter addressed to Mr.

            , Sherborne-lane, Lombard-street, read.)</p>
               <p>"Mr. Hogg, Sir, I have enclosed the bill as mentioned; Mr. M'Connell had it drawn to a certainty of its being honoured, so that you may rely on the punctuality of it; I am sorry I could not get it at a shorter date, but hope it will answer your purpose. There must be a mistake as to the costs, as your attorney told a gentleman who called, that the costs were 2l. 10s. returning the writ 10s. three letters 10s. 6d. amounting to 3l. 10s. 6d. As I shall see you in a day or two, will arrange that matter to the satisfaction of both parties. The amount of the enclosed was the balance of one account between me and Mr. M'Connell, which was the reason of its being the sum of thirteen guineas.</p>

               <p>Q. That bill has the acceptance of 
               <persName id="t18030112-61-person437">James</persName>
             M'Connell? - A. Yes; when I met the prisoner upon Snow-hill, he told me the reason of the bill of thirteen guineas not being honoured was, that Mr. M'Connell had gone into the country, and that he had left my account and some others with a Mr. Bateman to settle during his absence; he promised to call at my office in a day or two to settle it, but did not; he was employed by a person in Billiter-square, I think of the name of Bozeur, a foreign merchant. On the 26th of October he called at my accompting-house, and left a note, which has been lost; I have taken every pains, but cannot find it; he wrote me word, that he was in possession of a bill for 450l. drawn upon a person of the name of Dickason, which he would endeavour to get cashed, and he would then call and pay me what he was in my debt. On the 29th of October he called, and said, he had not been able to get the bill discounted; but if I would discount it, he would pay me; I told him if he would leave the bill with me for an hour, I would enquire if it was a good house; I took the bill to Mr. Dickason's, the acceptor's, and asked them if it was their acceptance; one of the clerks told me it was a very good one; I then took it to my banker's, and the prisoner called immediately afterwards at my accompting-house, and I gave him a draft upon my banker for 411l. which was deducting the thirteen guineas and the discount; he said, if it would be of any use to me he would draw a bill upon me for 20l. at a month or two months; I told him it would not make much matter, but I would accept a bill; he then 
               <persName id="t18030112-61-person438">drew</persName>
             a bill at a month, and I accepted it; that 20l. with the draft upon my banker, the money that he owed me, and the discount, made the amount of 450l.(The Bill of Exchange stated in the indictment, with the acceptance and endrosement, read.)</p>

               <p>Q. Did the bill for 20l. which you accepted, afterwards come to you for payment? - A. Yes, I paid it to a person of the name of Proctor; I heard no more of it till Mr. Parkin and Mr. M'Connell called at my accompting-house the letter end of November.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This bill of 450l. was brought to you in consequence of your first having received a letter from him, and then his coming himself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He made no difficulty of acceding to your request that it might be left with you for the purpose of making any enquiry you thought proper? - A. None; it was left with me about two hours.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it upon the faith of the name of Dickason, and finding those enquiries satisfactory, that you paid him the money? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing in his conduct at the time that could justify a suspicion in you that he was doing wrong? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. You know enough of the world to know, that a schedule means the schedule of a person in insolvent circumstances? - A. I did not understand that it meant a schedule of a man in insolvent circumstances; I understood it to be an account of what he was worth.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Have you known the prisoner long? - A. About five years; I knew him when he was a Captain in the Manchester Fencibles, and he was a Captain in the St. George's Corps.</p>
               <p>Q. What has been his general character during the time you have known him? - A.

               <p>Prisoner's defence. On the 25th of October I called at the King's Bench Prison; M'Connell told me he had got a bill which his brother had remitted by Post from his correspondent at Dover. I told him it was too late that evening to do any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180301120035"></xptr>thing with it, but I would call the next day. I called the next day, and carried it for acceptance. I got it accepted, and then I called upon Mr. Hogg, and he told me Mr. M'Connell had used him very ill not to pay his acceptance of 13l. I told him not to make himself uneasy, for he had received a remittance from abroad, and shewed him the bill. He told me it was a very good bill, and he would cash it for me. I told him I would inform Mr. M'Connell of it. I went to M'Connell, and he said he had got the promise of it from another gentleman, and desired me to call again the next day. The next day I went to M'Connell again (there was an account between us at that time); he desired me to get it cashed. I went to Mr. Hogg, and got it discounted. I wrote my name upon it, Oxford-street, where I then resided. I took the whole of it to the King's Bench, and gave it to M'Connell, in the presence of Mrs. M'Connell and my son. He gave me 2l. on account, which I have accounted for in my books, and then he said, he would settle the balance in a few days, and I heard no more of the business till I was taken up. I only acted as an agent. I was requested to take the bill for acceptance, which I did. I understood he had very great property, and I knew his schedule was 40,000l. when he wanted to take advantage of the Insolvent Act. I heard from a number of persons that he was a man of property; I knew he had recovered 2 or 3000l. upon the ship Hope, and I had no doubt of the bill, especially as he said it was a remittance from his brother. I did not observe the name of John, nor Mr. Hogg either.</p>

It was too late that day; he came again the next day, and took the bill for acceptance; I was present when he returned in the evening; he gave Mr. M'Connell the bill, which was accepted, and said, if he wished to have it cashed, a friend of his in the City, of the name of Hogg, had offered to do it; and Mr. M'Connell said, he would consider of it.</p>

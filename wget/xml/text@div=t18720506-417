                  </hi>.—I am a constable in the service of the London and St. Katherine Dock Company—on Saturday, 22nd April, about 20 minutes before 12, in consequence of something that came to my knowledge, I was watching in the C jetty tobacco warehouse—I was behind a partition—I made a small hole through the partition, so that I could see between the tubs—Ashmore worked up stairs—Summers had charge of the tobacco department on the ground floor of the C warehouse—as I was looking through the hole I saw Summers go to a bag of tobacco—Ashmore was present—they both took the bag together and put it on the floor—Ashmore sat down, unbuttoned his waistcoat, and put this tobacco (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in the waistband of his trowsers—Summers stood looking at him—they both took down the bag—it was betwixt some tubs on some more bags—I went round from behind the partition and came into the tobacco warehouse, went up to Ashmore, and asked him what he had got there, touching him on the breast—he said "Only a little piece of tobacco for a smoke"—Summers was still in the warehouse, about three yards from Ashmore, but he turned his back to me when I spoke to Ashmore—I took the tobacco from Ashmore's waist<lb></lb>band, took him to the Victoria Dock Police Station, and then went back to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187205060030"></xptr>
               <p>Summers—I asked Summers if he knew anything about this tobacco—he said he knew nothing at all about it—I took him also to the station, and charged them both—the tobacco weighs 1 1b. 6 oz.—I was eight yards from them when I saw this—I have known Summers seven years, as long as I have been in the employ—there was no one but the prisoners in the C warehouse at the time except the Custom House officer, who was against the door in his office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This was not a dark place; T could read a newspaper there—I could see the prisoners perfectly well between the rows of casks—Summers made no remark when I spoke to Ashmore, and I did not say anything to him then, because he had charge of the floor—I intended to take him after giving notice to the foreman to put someone else in charge of the place—I don't think Ashmore could have concealed the tobacco without Summers seeing him; I think he must have seen him—Ashmore had no business in that part of the building.</p>

I am foreman of the C warehouse—on 27th April the two prisoners were employed by the Company—Summers was in charge of the C warehouse to repack damaged tobacco—his duty was on the ground-floor, which is about 30 feet by 43 feet—he was alone there—there was a Custom House officer in his box at the door—Ashmore was employed on the top floor—he had no business on the ground floor by the tubs—it was his duty to leave at 12 o'clock.</p>

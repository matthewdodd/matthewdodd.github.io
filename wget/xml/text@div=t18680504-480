                  </hi>. I am a nurse in the infirmary attached to Lambeth Workhouse—on the 3rd of April I received the deceased George Bagley as a patient in the infirmary—I knew him previously; he was in a paralysed state, not insensible—the prisoner was in the infirmary as an assistant—it was his duty to wash and prepare the patients, and put them into bed, when we received them—he attended on the patients—he had nothing to do with administering the medicine, that was my duty—there was another nurse who assisted in the act—I was present at the death of the deceased, on the 6th of April—I was present when the medical officer attended upon him when he was brought in—I received medicine from the doctor for him, and administered portions of it on Saturday—the deceased was rather trouble<lb></lb>some and annoying on Saturday, such as getting out of bed and putting down the bed-clothes—I think it was from uneasiness, not being conscious of what he was doing, his mind was slightly affected—I saw him on Sunday—he was in much the same state—the doctor saw him—he did not order him any further medicine—I did not see him again till 8 o'clock on Monday morning; he was then asleep and insensible, very poorly—I tried to rouse him but could not—he died in that state—Dr. Bullen, the medical officer, saw him before he died—I heard the witness Smith say to the doctor, in the prisoner's presence, that he had a heavy charge to make against the warder (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner</hi>)—that he had given Bagley an over-dose of morphia the previous night—the man was then dying—Dr. Buller told the prisoner he could make what statement he thought proper—he asked him if he had given the man an over-dose of morphia, or now much he had given—he said he had given him more than a tablespoonful, because he was restless—the morphia was in a bottle on a shelf—it is not a thing that is administered without the doctor's order—I did not hear the doctor give any direction to the prisoner to administer it—it is usual to keep morphia on the shelf—the prisoner had nothing to do with providing it or placing it there—we never Administer it without the doctor's orders—it is given for a composing draught—the doctor had ordered n special mixture for the deceased that day—I do not know what it was—I have never given morphia to patients without an order from the doctor—we have no medicine chest or cupboard in which to keep medicines—they are all placed upon the shelf—I should think there are as many as twenty-five bottles there; some are six ounce bottles, some eight ounce—this bottle was labelled "Morphia," not "Poison"—the prisoner has seen morphia given for a composing draught—the doctor is not always by when it is given—it is given out of an apothecary's glass—we have one glass which holds four ounces, and we can measure a very small quan<lb></lb>tity in it—it is then poured into small medicine cups, and given to the patients—I never knew the prisoner to give morphia before, nor anyone else—no medicine is given of any kind without the doctor's orders, not even castor oil—the order is given by word of mouth—we have twenty-seven patients</p>

               <p>in that ward I have the superintendence of; eighty or ninety altogether, convalescent and sick—the prisoner, I believe, can read a little; he could read the label on a bottle—I think the morphia was a 12 ounce or 14 ounce bottle—it was in a clean glass bottle.</p>

                  </hi>. I was an inmate of the infirmary—I am an engine-fitter—I saw the deceased in bed in the ward on Friday—the prisoner was a warder there—he had to assist in giving out meals and medicines—on the Sunday afternoon, at 2 o'clock, the deceased was a little troublesome getting in and out of bed—the prisoner came and forced him down in bed with both hands—he put one hand on his neck and raised the other, clenched, in the air—the deceased said, "Oh, don't strike me"—he said, "I will give you something to-night that will make you quiet, you won't be so troublesome getting up to-morrow—he said that very angrily—it caused both me and the rest of the patients to watch his movements all that day—when he gave out the medicine he reached the morphia bottle from the shelf—I knew it was the morphia bottle, because it was labelled so, and one tablespoonful one dose—I had been convalescent about the ward, and knew almost every bottle about the place—I am underrating it when I say the prisoner poured out half a cupful—it would be four tablespoonfulls—I was within a few inches of the man's mouth when he had it, for I reached my head over to look into the cup to see the quantity, because I was suspicious on account of his threat that afternoon—when the prisoner offered it to him, he said, "Here is a nice drop of port wine for you"—morphia is very unpalatable—the man seemed to be almost stifled as he took it, it almost choked him—he seemed to be suffocated in his throat in swallowing—as the prisoner walked away from his bedside he said, "You have got it in your guts now"—after the deceased had taken it he became very jocular, and then fell asleep—he never woke again—I was conversing with him up to about 10.30 he had had the medicine about 7—between 3 and 4 in the morning the night nurse was at his bedside—she was trying to rouse him—she said, "I cannot make this out, this patient snores so loudly"—the prisoner was then in bed in the ward—the deceased appeared to be sleeping like a man who was heavy in drink—his breathing was laborious and painful—my bed was about eighteen inches from his—when the prisoner gave the medicine his face was towards me—I looked over to look into the cup at the time I saw the prisoner pour it out from the bottle first—I did not interfere—I left it to the other patients—I could not tell it would poison him—I thought it would merely make him sleep—on this occasion he gave it in the nurse's absence—I believe it was her Sunday out—I cannot say how long she would be away—I do not recollect having seen the prisoner give anyone else medicine—the bottle was a pint bottle, and I should think there was a good half-pint in it at the time—there is a certain place for the morphia bottle on the shelf—I had had a dose of it myself on the Friday by the nurse's directions—there are six or eight medicine cups in the ward like this produced—I had only been three days in the ward on that occasion, but before that I had been there three weeks—the prisoner had only been left on one Sunday before this to give medicine, to my knowledge: he did not give it in the nurse's absence—I believe Mr. Burton should be present to give out the medicines in the nurse's absence—I had taken the morphia on the Friday out of a cup similar to this—I was very ill, and I asked the nurse to give me a composing draught; and she gave me a dose of morphia, I think somewhere about a tablespoonfull and a half—I did not at that</p>

               <p>time know what a dose was—we are under some restraint about the warder—if a patient makes a report he feels a little afterwards, on account of the officers over him; I mean generally; I do not mean particularly with regard to this man—when the nurse gave me the morphia she put it in the cup and left it on my chair, and told me not to take it unless I was very ill in the night—she had given me a Dovey's powder.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been dispenser at the Lambeth Work-house: I have been there about ten months—I made up the mixture of which the deceased had a dose—it is a pint bottle, and contained ten grains of acetate of morphia, two and a half drachms of Batley's sedative solution of opium, and water to fill up—it is a dangerous agent, and requires care in administering—in most cases it is given by order of the medical man, but if a patient is restless I believe the nurse has power to administer the dose—the usual dose is a tablespoonfull—it is kept in the ward, so that the nurse can make use of it at any time—the prisoner had no authority what<lb></lb>ever to administer it that I am aware of, only the nurse—it is sometimes given in larger doses—two tablespoonfulls may be given with safety—in severe cases, if she is out of the way, I do it—I am always there, and if not the house-surgeon is—the warder gives the medicine in the afternoon, I believe—it is given to the warder by the nurse, to give to the patients—I do not know why this medicine was not marked poison—we mark laudanum poison—this is a poison if given in large doses, not in small doses—I should think it would take three or four ounces to kill.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Upper Kennington Lane, Lambeth, and am senior medical officer at the Poor House—I was in the ward when the deceased was brought there on the Friday—he was labouring under paralysis; it was an aggravated attack—I prescribed for him—I saw him again on the Sunday, between 11 and 12—he was much in the same con<lb></lb>dition: he had not improved, and he was certainly not worse—I had not the slightest notion that he was even in danger—he was able to walk about and to converse—I saw him on Monday, between 10 and 11 a.m., on going my usual rounds—he was then insensible, with sterterous respiration, the pupils extremely contracted, the pulse feeble, the whole body relaxed, and the skin cold and covered with perspiration—I believed him to be in a fit; that a new accession of his disease had taken place—the prisoner was in the ward at the time—just as I was leaving the ward Smith called me to him, and stated that on the previous afternoon the deceased Bagley had become restless, and that the prisoner had used threatening language to him—I think it was, "I will give you something to quiet you," and that the prisoner then gave him a large dose of morphia mixture, as near as possible half a cupful—I asked the prisoner if that was true, and if he had any authority to give it him—he said, no; he gave it of his own will, but he did not give so much as Smith stated: he only gave about a tablespoonfull—he said the patient was restless and rather delirious, and he gave it him to quiet him—the man died almost in my presence, about half-an-hour afterwards—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—the dura mater was congested with blood—there was slight congestion on the surface of the brain, and when it was cut in two, its substance was rather soft, especially in the anterior lobe of the left hemisphere, where there was a small abscess, containing about half an ounce of softened brain, of a purulent character there was about an ounce of bloody-coloured serum in the ventricles of the brain—the right lung healthy, free, and crepitant—the left was consolidated, tubercular,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186805040088"></xptr>
               <p>and adherent to the left side in its whole extent—the heart was tolerably healthy; rather flabby—the aorta was sacculated, the valves empty, the chambers entirely empty—in the cavity of the pericardium there was about an ounce of discoloured serum—the intestines were healthy—they contained about half an ounce of liquid, and partly digested food, in which there was no odour of opium or any drug—there was just a small patch of congestion on the inner surface—the post-mortem examination was made on the 10th—the man had died on the 6th—there being no trace of opium in the stomach, I concluded it had been absorbed into the blood—my con<lb></lb>clusion certainly was, that death was caused, if not accelerated, by an over<lb></lb>dose of opium—I formed that opinion upon the state in which I saw him—no communication was made to me, or to the house surgeon, about his state—I first learnt his condition in going my rounds—had I not heard Smith's evidence, I should certainly have concluded that the man died from a new access of paralysis—the abscess I found had evidently existed for some time—there was an unusually serious condition of brain—there was a softening of the brain, not of long standing—the man was in that condition that he might have died at any moment—what I say about the morphia having accelerated his death, is entirely from the account given by Smith—morphia acts differently upon different persons—there is a case on record of a young man, a medical student, in a fit of despair, taking sixteen grains; but upon the application of the stomach-pump, and other remedies, he was recovered—the ordinary dose is a quarter of a grain.</p>

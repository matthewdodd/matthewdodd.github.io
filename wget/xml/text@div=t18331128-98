             - I went with Mr. Davies to Spithead last month, and saw that person who went by the name of James Smith on board the ship Fairley, with a convict's dress on; I knew him to be the man whom I took on board the Providence on the 24th of July - as soon as he and this prisoner came on board the Providence; the prisoner said to the boatman, "You have no reason to complain, you are well paid, I have given you fourteen sovereigns" - I then said to the prisoner and his companion, "Why did you pay fourteen sovereigns for a boat, when you might have got on board for 6d.?" - the prisoner said, he could dispose of his own money as he thought fit - I had seen that ship leave the harbour about ten o'clock, and they came on board about two hours and a half afterwards - I saw their boat come from Cross Haven, which is a little to the right of the Cove of Cork; as you come out the vessel lay to the right of the Cove of Cork, and their boat came from the same side - I also asked the prisoner, why he had cut off his whiskers, and he said, he might dispose of his own person as he thought fit, and he might cut all the hair off his head if he liked - I said, he was there under very suspicious circumstances, and from the nature of his answers, I did not think right to permit him to go to America - I searched him, and found one hundred and thirty one sovereigns upon him, and four sovereigns were found in the other man's boot - I then took them on shore, and they were examined before Major Miller, the magistrate for four counties - the prisoner was examined; this is his deposition in the magistrate's own hand-writing, and the prisoner signed it - I took him for no crime, but only under suspicious circumstances; I was on board the ship looking for some murderers - after the prisoner had signed this deposition, the magistrate remanded him to make inquiries, and he was afterwards dismissed - I think in about a fortnight; I afterwards saw him on board the Julius Caesar, a barque bound for New York; this was on the 28th of September - I desired him to get out of his bed, which he was in, in his clothes, and I took him on a charge of forging a cheque for Â£300 in London, and told him that his comrade, who had given himself the name of James Smith had been already taken - I desired the prisoner to get up in the name of

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you? A. A police-constable - Cross Haven is a little bay in the sea; there are plenty of houses there; if a person had slept there, or gone there, he might take a boat to go after a ship; the ship was sailing when I went on board, but she laid too for me; she then kept sailing on, and laid too again<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280084"></xptr>for their boat; if she had not, I do not suppose they would ever have overtaken her; they could not tell how far the boat would have to go before they overtook the ship - they might have stepped from the quay the night before for 6d. - when I took the prisoner before the magistrate, I stated that I had been on board to look for murderers; and it was afterwards that the prisoner made his statement - too many of our countrymen go to America, and it is usual when they go to sell all they have and take the money with them - I should think Major Miller made every inquiry respecting the prisoner's statement, but he was set at large in about a fortnight.</p>

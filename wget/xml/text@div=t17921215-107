               <p>Sunday was a week, Mr. Watts, and his man, Stanly, came to me, and asked my husband and me, whether we would be so kind as to come to see him at their house, as his wife had made an elopement for a fortnight before we went there; and when we were there, this boy came in, and asked Mr. Watts to buy a watch: Mr. Watts, knowing the boy, asked him where his father and mother were. He then asked him the price of it. - He asked a guinea and an half. Mr. Watts bought the watch for 25 s. if his father was agreeable to take the money. On that Mr. Watts asked the prisoner Hollwell to go with the lad to see if his father was agreeable. We sat in the house just the same; and that gentleman came to me, and said, he wanted Mr. Watts. He then stepped out with the watch, to ask somebody, whether it was worth the money or not; and he brought it back - and when he brought it back, he gave it to Mr. Stanley to take it to the boy. The boy delivered the watch to Mr. Watts for 1 l. 5 s. if his father had been agreeable to take the money. Hollwell never had the watch. She went out, and the boy and Watts soon followed.</p>

             came to my house Sunday was a week, and enquired of me, for my wife and me to go over and see to make matters up between him and his wife. While we were there, in came the boy with the watch, and said he would sell it; and offered it to Mr. Watts for sale. Mr. Watts asked him, what he would take for it: he said a guinea and an half. - They came to an agreement for 1 l. 5 s. if in case his father was willing to take the money. - His father lived in Union-street, Shadwell. So, by that means, the woman and he went out both together, to see if his father was agreeable or not. There was a man's voice called into the boy while he was in there; they thought it was his father. - He said it was. They went out, and I heard no more.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did Watts go out? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he follow the woman immediately? - I don't think he did, I suppose it might be a quarter of an hour for what I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the watch that time? - The last time I saw the watch, it was laying on the table, the woman went out with the boy, and took the watch with her.</p>
               <p>Q. When she took the watch from the boy's hand, what did she do with it? - She looked at it, and it was laid down on the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that? - I am certain it was laid on the table.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hollwell. Mr. Morgan, my brother and sister invited me to come down to Mr. Watt's, this boy came in between five and seven o'clock, and offered this watch for 1 l. 10 s. for he said, it cost his father that, Mr. Watts said, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150153"></xptr>had only a guinea, but he would give 1 l. 5 s. and if his father would come he would give him that money; he had lived twice with Mr. Watts, as they say, the lad shewed the watch about to all the house, the boy said, to me Mr. Hollwell, what do you think of it, I said, I don't know, the boy sold it to this man for 1 l. 5 s. Mr. Watts went to the public house to borrow the remainder of the money; the boy said, my father is sick in bed. Mrs. Hollwell said, Mr. Watts will you step to his father and see? I heard somebody call Will to that boy, Jack says he, you must say the watch is your's, for they have stopped it; I took hold of the lad, and says, I believe you have stole the watch, he had a little wand, and struck me twice, I ran after him into the Virginia Planter, and I said to some man are you an officer, if you are, take hold of this body, I never denied that Mr. Watts bought the watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Watts. On Sunday morning this man and me went over to Mrs. Morgan's to ask them to come over, they came and this gentlewoman came over too, we made shift with a bit of cold leg of mutton for dinner, and it passed on till between five and six getting a little drop of drink, this boy came in and stood dangling his chain, so says I, Will you have got a watch is it your own? he comes and whispers to me I will sell it to you, if you will buy it; my father has been out of work this week or fortnight, and I want to give him a few shillings; what do you ask for it, says I, I don't know, whether he told me 1 l. 10 s. or 1 l. 11 s. 6 d. I will not be positive, he came to 1 l. 5 s. I said, I would buy it, if his father was agreeable; the watch was laid down on the top of my table, every body was looking at it, now thinks I, I have not the money, I will whip over to the chandler's shop, and at the same time, I will shew it somebody, I heard there was a disturbance about this watch, I went in again, and I says to the man, you run up with the watch that is all I know about it. I never wronged a man of a farthing ever since I was born.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Watts called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

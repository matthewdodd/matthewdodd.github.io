                  </hi>. I keep the Builders' Arms beer shop, in Merton-road. There is a bar and a tap, which is lower than the house—it is one story high, and has a flat roof, covered with zinc—there are two windows over the roof—one window is fastened with a drop catch—any person on that bar top could get to that window, and put an instrument in, raise the catch, and open the window—on Saturday week I was in the tap room, about 7 o'clock in the evening—my wife was in the sitting room, close by—in consequence of something my servant, Elston, said to me, I listened, and heard a person walking on the zinc flat on the roof—I called my son out of the stable, went out into the road, and saw a man on the roof—there was a gas light at the toll gate, which throws a light over my premises—it was the prisoner, Hunter, who was on the roof—he was at my bed room window—I placed my son in the gateway, and Payne at the tap room door—I stood in the road, and saw Hunter drop off the roof, within a yard of where I stood—I laid hold of him momently—he tried to get away—while he was doing so, Lane came up, and said, "Let him go, and I will see that he don't get away"—I told him "No," not as long as life lasted, I would not give him up—Lane walked away about ten yards; he then deliberately turned round, and said to Hunter, "Trip him up"—I was still struggling with Hunter, getting him towards home—a screw driver and a pocket handkerchief fell from him—we forced him into the tap room, and sent for an officer, and gave him in charge—he took a crow bar from his pocket, and used it over my head—he struck me with it five times, but there were only three wounds—they bled—some other persons came up, he was taken into the house—I went in—Lane followed us in, and I told him he was one of the party—I collared him, and held him till a policeman came and took him into cus<lb></lb>tody—I had hold of Hunter and him too—Lane said he did not belong to the party, and he did not know anything of him at all—the policeman came and took Hunter—we gave the crow bar in charge of the policeman—I afterwards examined the bed room window, and saw the marks where a screw driver had been in, trying to lift the sash up; and there was some candle grease under the bottom sash—a person with that screw driver might lift up the window, and get into the house—I had my wounds dressed, first by my wife, and afterwards by a surgeon—there were articles of property in that bed room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness. On Saturday week, between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening, I was in the bar—Lane came in, and I served him with a glass of half-and-half, and a screw of tobacco—he drank it, and stood a little while—he then went out, and came in again, and asked for a crust of bread and cheese—after I had fetched him the bread and cheese I observed a horse and cart in front of the window—I had not seen it before he came in the second time—when he called for the bread and cheese I asked him to walk into the tap room, as there was a nice fire—he said, "No," he would stand there—he stood, I should say, a quarter of an hour nearly—after that my husband came out of the tap room, and asked if any one was on the roof—my husband went in the front of the house—my son was called, and he came round to the other side of the house—there was a cry that there was some man on the roof—on that Lane went out—he had not been standing still all the time he was at the bar; he went in and out two or three different times—after my husband had gone out I went out—I saw my husband and Hunter scuffling together in the road—Lane went across to them, and he asked my husband to release the other prisoner—Lane came over into the footpath, and said, "Trip him up! throw him up!"—I cannot say who that was said to—the man was a stranger to me—some other persons came up, and Hunter was brought into the house—Lane stood out in front—the cart was there all his time—I went up to Lane, tapped him on the shoulder, and said he belonged to the other prisoner—he said he did not—I spoke to a neighbour next door, not to let the horse, and cart go till he gave it into the hands of a policeman, and it was detained—I afterwards examined my husband's head—there were three cut wounds on it.</p>

On Sunday afternoon, the 25th of August, at church time, I was in front of my house; Miss Howard's house, appeared at first, to be perfectly safe; but shortly after, I heard a noise in her house, and, as soon as I possibly could, I went to the front of the house and saw her street door open; I saw nobody come out - I saw the prisoner Smith, coming from the end of her house, to cross the field; he was a very few paces from Miss Howard's palings; her's is a corner house - I gave an alarm; Smith walked very fast across the fields - I pursued him myself, calling out, "Stop thief," and then, I cried, "Murder;" I was within a few yards of him at one time - he heard my cries, but went on - Forster, the constable, came up to me and went after him - some boys took him and brought him to the constable - I am sure he is the man I saw going from Miss Howard's house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you known him before? A I never saw him before; no property was found on him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you keep pursuing him for some time, calling, "Stop thief?" A. I did; he never slackened his pace, but hastened it.</p>

            , at Tottenham, about four o'clock on Sunday, the 25th of August - we were in the field next to Miss Howard's house - I saw the two prisoners together, going towards the church; that would lead in a direction to Miss Howard's house; they parted - Salter came back and waited on the wooden bridge, between the fields, about two hundred yards from Miss Howard's house - I could see her house from the bridge; I saw Smith shortly after coming across the fields, from Miss Howard's palings, as fast as he could walk; he went to the wooden bridge and joined Salter - I heard Mrs. Dale cry out; Smith was then coming across the same fields as she was; Salter was nearer than me to Mrs. Dale, and I heard her cry out; Smith was nearer than me to Mrs. Dale; she was running after him; he must have heard her cry out - Salter was at that time on the wooden bridge - Smith joined him; they waited on the bridge two or three minutes, then Salter ran up towards Mr. Wright's moat, from Mrs. Dale and Smith - and Smith walked up towards the main path - I ran to him directly Mrs. Dale hallooed, and he walked the faster; and I said,"You are wanted," he then stopped, came back, and said, "It is not me that is wanted, it is somebody else," he came back after that.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was Mrs. Dale in view of Smith when he turned back? A. Yes; but she could not see him turn back, as it was down in a hollow; this was after he had joined Salter and left him - then he came back towards Mrs. Dale, and me, and the beadle - the beadle was in view of Smith; and the beadle called, "Stop thief," as well, he was dressed as the beadle; he turned round at my speaking to him, and came towards the beadle, and was then taken into custody - I had been to church, and came out again, before the service was over - my father sent me to church; he has been in the habit of sending me to church and punishing me for not going; I had been that day at three o'clock, and came out at four o'clock, it was not over; my father has found fault with me for not going to church, when he sent me, but I always do go - I had not known either of the prisoners before; the wooden bridge is about two hundred yards from the prosecutrix's house - Salter had a black coat on - I will swear that, I cannot be mistaken - I was at the office before the magistrate when Salter was brought there; he was let out on bail, promising to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050059"></xptr>come there on the following Wednesday, and he came and was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. When you saw Salter at the magistrates, did you know him again? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>CHARLES SAITCH. I am fourteen years old; I was in company with England on Sunday, the 25th of August; I saw the two prisoners near Miss Howard's house that afternoon; I know them both - I am sure they are the persons; I first saw them up towards the church, going in a direction towards Miss Howard's house; I saw them return and go back towards Mr. Wright's moat; when I first saw them in the field, they kept together a very few minutes, then parted - Salter went down towards Wright's moat, and stopped at the wooden bridge; Smith went towards the church, and when we saw Smith again, he was against Miss Howard's palings - we had lost sight of him; I heard Mrs. Dale cry out; Smith then walked quite fast across the fields; Mrs. Dale followed him crying "Stop thief," and"Murder;" he took no notice of it, but kept going on; he went to Salter at the wooden bridge - he remained with him a few minutes, and when us boys were after him, Salter ran towards the moat; Smith was running up towards the path, he turned back and said were we calling after him; we said, "Yes;" he turned back and asked Forster if he wanted him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not he walk towards the beadle? A. Yes; I saw Smith all the time he was on the wooden bridge - he was talking - he did nothing but talk; he gave nothing to the person who was standing on the bridge; I was at Salter's house shortly after this, and he was produced to me; I said that he was not the man I saw on the bridge; there was an officer with me at the time - that was on the Tuesday after the robbery; he was not dressed then the same as when I saw him - he is not now dressed as he was on the day of the robbery; none of the officers or the prosecutrix have been speaking to me since.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Why did you then say he was not the same man? A. On Sunday he had a black coat on, and on Tuesday a brown one.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He has a brown coat on now; why swear to him now? A. He had whiskers under his chin on the Sunday, and he had none on the Tuesday - he has no whiskers under his chin now; I said the person had bandy legs, and the magistrate took up his apron to look at his legs, and after that let him out on bail.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Before the magistrate did you say he was not the man, or what? A. I did not go in before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where did Salter live? A. I saw him at his brother's house in Union-street, Shoreditch.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At what time did you see Salter? A.

            . I am a constable of Tottenham. In consequence of an alarm I went in pursuit with Forster - he had secured Smith when I came up to him; I afterwards went with him for Salter, and after some conversation between him and Fosrter, accompanied Salter to his lodgings - the door of the room was secured by a padlock; Salter pulled the staple out with the padlock; he took it into the room, and laid it on the table - Forster asked what he had done with the key; he said he had lost it - Forster pulled out a key and unlocked it immediately.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you heard Forster ask Salter if he knew Smith? A. Yes, he did; and he said, "Do you know Sargood?" he said no - I found two duplicates in a cupboard in the lodging in the name of Sargood - Salter was asked if any person lodged with him - he said no.</p>

            . Q. What property did you lose? A. A silver watch, a pair of garnet hoop ear-rings, a pair of cornelian drops, a gold pin, and two silver ones, two necklaces, a gold ring, two chimney ornaments of our Saviour on the Cross, and the Virgin and Child - they were not much larger than my finger.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence. On the Sunday the robbery was committed, Salter left me at home at half-past eight or nine o'clock - I never saw him any more; I got up and had breakfast at a coffee-shop in Church-street, Bethnalgreen, and went to take a walk - having no money and nothing to eat, I walked round Hornsey way, passing the day away, till I came to where the lady lives, and passed it - I was walking on, and did not hear Mrs. Dale cry out "Stop thief" - I was walking in the footpath; when I came to the wooden bridge, I heard the boys hallooing; I asked them what they were hallooing for - they said I was wanted; I immediately stepped down to ask the officer if he wanted me; he said yes, and I gave myself into his custody; the officer says he saw me within three minutes of the robbery - it is impossible I could have committed the robbery within that time - I am positive your Lordship's opinion must be that I am innocent.</p>
               <p>Salter's Defence. I left him at home at half-past eight o'clock and went to Mr. Cash's, and had a pint of porter - I left there at eleven o'clock, and went from there to the Victory in Whitechapel, and stopped till near two o'clock; I went and got my dinner, and was seen to go into my own door, by a respectable witness.</p>

             public-house, Shoreditch. I have known Salter above six years; I saw him on Sunday, the 25th of August - he left my house about ten minutes before eleven o'clock, it being service time - I always close my house; I did so on that day - he returned to my house about half-past two o'clock, or a little more, and went out - it might be a quarter before three o'clock, when I closed my house for the afternoon service, and I saw him about half-past eight o'clock at night; he had on the same coat that day as he has on now - I am confident of it, because Mrs. Cash laughed at him about throwing off his black coat on the Sunday.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. He was in the habit of wearing a black coat before, was he? A. He was; I have seen him in a brown coat before - I had known him well, but only by sight; he said he lived at No. 1, Mount-street - I have seen Sargood at my house; I have seen them together, but not frequently - Salter was there more times than Sargood - I never knew Sargood go by the name of Smith - Sargood was in my house that morning about half-past eight o'clock - I cannot answer whether Salter was there then - Salter came about half-past nine o'clock; Sargood was not there then - I know this was the 25th of August, because I heard he was in trouble on the Tuesday following - he gets his living by industry; he has been in the military line - he worked for his brother at the horse-hair business - he belonged to the musicians in the Tower Hamlets; he has not left that long - Sargood and he did not to my knowledge live together; they were friends, they drank together at different times - I did not see Sargood at all except just after breakfast-time that Sunday - my house is about five miles from Tottenham - the latest time I saw Salter in the afternoon was a quarter to three o'clock.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you go to Edmonton? A. Yes, and bailed Sargood - I have kept the public-house eight years.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were any of your family at home that day? A. I have only a wife and servants; my wife was at home - she is not here, nor the servants.</p>
               <p>- CONGDEN. I kept the Victory public-house - I left it on the 24th of July, but I was in the house on the 25th of August - I have seen Salter several times; I saw him on the 25th of August, in the parlour of the Victory, Friar's-mount, Bethnal-green, by Shoreditch church; I saw him from half-past eleven to twelve o'clock, and I left him at twelve o'clock - to the best of my knowledge he had on the same coat he has on now.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Will you swear it was not a black coat? A. It was certainly not black, that I will swear - the Tottenham coaches go from the Basing-house, about a quarter of a mile from the church - I don't know whether it would take a man long to get to Tottenham from there - I have not known him long; I had seen him six or eight times in the house - I don't know Sargood; I have seen him at my house, but not with Salter.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did you go to the public-house? A. I am there every day - I know it was on that day, because I had a collector who used to collect for me; he ran away with part of the property, and I was obliged to go down on Sunday to receive my money, and I saw this man there - I was there at half-past eleven, and he was there when I went in; I left about twelve o'clock - the house shuts up during Divine service, but my collector<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050061"></xptr>pays me my rents there, having several houses in the neighbourhood, and several tenants of mine had come there to pay my rents; one of them is here, a man named Smith, who paid me rent at the time - Smith lives in Mount-court, Friar's-mount, No. 4, some call it Mount-place - neither of the prisoner are my tenants - I don't hold the house Salter lives in.</p>

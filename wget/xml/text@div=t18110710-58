The prisoner asked why she had not her rails up, the deceased said, what does she want with her rails up to come into the dock, boy, the prisoner said, if you call me boy any more, I'll give you a punch of the head.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the deceased call him boy again. - A. Yes, and then the prisoner struck him, the deceased struck again; they had four or five rounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Now while the fight was going on, did the prisoner do any thing besides striking with his fist. - A. Yes, he took hold of his collar with his left hand, and kicked him with his right foot, in his private parts.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the deceased fight any after that. - A. Yes, he fought two rounds after, then he said he must leave off, then he walked about twenty minutes, and then he leaned with his head against the wall, unbuttoned his trowsers, and looked at his private parts, he sat down on the grass, then fell upon his back, I halloed out for assistance, he died in a few minutes afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the man. - A. Yes, I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Which was the strongest man. - A. The man that is dead, if he had not kicked him, would have beat the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a seaman, I was in the Britannia at the time of this fight, I saw the deceased and the prisoner fighting together.</p>
               <p>Q. While they were fighting did you see the prisoner kick the deceased. - A. Yes, I did, he kicked him in his privates, I jumped out of the ship for assistance, I got to them while the fight was, a little while after the kick, the deceased went to the wall, and unbuttoned his trowsers, his privates were swelled, and blood came out of his mouth, the prisoner ran away, I pursued him, and brought him back.</p>
               <p>- I am a surgeon, I examined the body of the deceased.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find an injury done by such an act as described. - A. I did, I found a rupture near the part on opening the abdomen, there was about a quart of blood, the artery had been ruptured by violence, and such a kick as I have heard described might occasion it, I firmly believe he died of that injury.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As I was going down the dock with intention to look for a ship, I spoke to myself that cannot be a running ship, the deceased was behind me, he said she is a running ship, I said how is that she is without rails, he said what does she want with rails boy, I tapped him on the shoulder and said go away, he struck me and I struck him, we did not make any agreement to fight, this young man came to help him, he told him he had no occasion, he said he would not fight any more, after fighting we spoke together ten minutes. I did not know the man was dead. I ran away thinking they wanted to stop me, when I was stopped they said I had killed the man, I said my God he was not dead when I left him, he was very pale. I do not know whether it was the kick or the blows. I am very sorry for it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employment of Mr. Baker, a linen-draper at Greensend, Woolwich. I saw the prisoner on Tuesday, 7th inst, at about 7 o'clock in the evening—I was at one corner of my master's shop, and the prisoner was at the other corner, and somebody with her—I saw her take a piece of print and put it in her shawl, and run across the road—I was outside the shop—I was looking at her through the window—I and another boy ran after her—the other boy got hold of her first, and I ran up afterwards—she saw us running after her, and she dropped the cotton—it was picked up by a little girl—I and the other boy brought the prisoner back to my master's shop, and he sent for a policeman—she said, "Let me go, there's good boys, it was not me that took it, it was another woman"—I have no doubt as to the woman that took it.</p>

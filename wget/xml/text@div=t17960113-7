               <p>JAMES KENWARD sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a weekly carrier from London to Lewes: I bought a black mare of the prisoner, on the 8th of August, at Lewes, 50 miles from London, about one or two o'clock in the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at him again? - A. That is the person that I bought the mare of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you show that mare afterwards to Mr. Dent? - A. No; I kept her about a month; she went too fast for me, and I sold her again to Mr. Ellis, who keeps the King's-head in the Borough, the inn where I have come with my team these seventeen years; I gave 16l. for her, and sold her for sixteen guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. The same mare you bought of the prisoner, you sold to Ellis. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. What are you? - A. A carrier.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live? - A. At Lewes.</p>
               <p>Q. How did it happen that you were at this place on that day? - A. That is our unloading day, Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you frequently go there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a market there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a market there that day? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not you before the magistrate when this man was committed. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where have you come from now? - A. From home.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been at home ever since you was before the magistrate? - A. Yes; only going backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not remained in town any time? - A. Yes; from Wednesday to Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you stay in town? - At the King's-head inn.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath were you not committed to goal on account of this mare? - A. I don't know what you mean.</p>
               <p>Court. Were you or not taken up and committed to goal? answer the question. - A. I bought the mare fairly.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not been in goal for stealing this mare? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath were you not in goal yourself since that man has been committed? - A. I have never been in goal in my life; I never was taken up in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. I should be glad to ask you, when you went before the magistrate, did not he ask you if you had any body that could prove that you bought the mare of this man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of not being able to produce some person as a witness for you, what did the magistrate do with you? - A. I cannot say any thing about that.</p>
               <p>Q. But you must; what did the magistrate do with you? - A. I could bring a witness up.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not to shuffle with me; upon your oath what did the magistrate do with you when you were unable to produce any person to prove it. (The witness hesitated).</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, don't you know you are yourself liable to be prosecuted if you don't swear to this man. - A. No; I think not.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know you are liable to be prosecuted as well as that man? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have plenty of witnesses you say, and yet you bring up no witnesses to the fact; upon your oath, what did the magistrate do with you? answer the question.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130020"></xptr>Jury. When you came before the magistrate, did he not take you into custody? - No; he did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Were you taken before the magistrate to account how you came by the mare? - A. I took him up in Spital-fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever yourself charged with stealing this mare? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Not when you were before the magistrate? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who desired you to come here to-day; were you not bound over? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who bound you over? - A. The Justices.</p>
               <p>Q. The mare was in your possession at one time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then don't you think you were as likely to be prosecuted as the prisoner, if you did not find a witness to prove how you came by her? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do you not think you were liable to be prosecuted? - A. I don't think so.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it you say you first met this man when you took him into custody? - A. At a public house in Spital-fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body along with you when you went into the room where the prisoner was drinking? - A. Yes; there were two men, one Mr. Cook, belonging to Shadwell-office.</p>
               <p>Q. You took him into custody? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he was the man that sold the horse to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you took him before the magistrate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened at the magistrate's? - A. I brought up a man from Lewes, and he told them, as well as myself, that that was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the magistrate ask, if you had any body that could prove you bought that mare of the man? - A. To be sure he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon his saying that, what did you do? - A. I brought a person up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you bring up any person before you went to the magistrate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now the magistrate told you, did not he, that you must produce somebody to shew you bought the mare of the man? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say, if you did not, he would commit you till you did? - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he say, he would keep you in custody till you did? - A. No; I told him I would bring one up next week, and so I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he come for? - A. To prove that he was the man I bought it of.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not bound over to appear here to day? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How many miles from town was this? - A. Fifty.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it? - A. On Saturday the 8th of August.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did the mare appear to be much rode? - A. She went very fresh, but rather stiff with her legs; she was a very nimble walked mare.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she appear as if she had come fifty miles in a day? - A. She might.</p>
               <p>Q. After it was buzzed about that the mare was stolen, you have not told us how you came to find out the prisoner? - A. There was a gentleman told us, (I dare say that was a quarter of a year after), that he was sworn in for a soldier.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. But how did you find out where to find the prisoner? - A. The Runner took me there.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did you ever see the man from the time you bought the mare to the time you apprehended him? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You never saw him from the time you bought the mare, till he was taken up? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. And that was three months, you say? - A. Yes; I described the man to Mr. Cook, at the Public-office; and he said, he thought he knew where to find him; by telling him how he walked, and how he looked; he walks rather stooping.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are you able, from the observation you made, and the conversation you had with him at Lewes, to be positive and certain, upon your oath, that that is the man? - A. I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know him; what was there particular about him? - A. I took particular notice of him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you in his company, at Lewes? - A. Four or five hours; he helped me unload the waggon.</p>
               <p>Q. And this was in the bustle of a race-day, I believe? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>I live at the King's Head, in the Borough: I bought a mare of James Kenward, the carrier.</p>
               <p>Q. When? - A. I did not take particular notice of the time; Mr. Dent came and claimed it afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the same mare you bought of Kenward? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Kenward? - A. A great many years.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his character? - A. A very good character.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he the master of the waggon? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does he live? - A. A little on this side of Lewes; but he goes from my inn to Lewes every week; and did before I kept the inn.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130021"></xptr>Q. He had a good deal of property coming from Lewes, in his cart? - A. Yes; he had sometimes a nine-inch wheel, and sometimes a four-inch wheel.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How long ago is this, think you? - A. I cannot say; the mare was taken away, and Mr. Dent swore to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you cannot swear how many months it is since you bought the mare? - A. I cannot say, I found the carrier that I bought her of, and he found his man; it is within these six months.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was it in the summer, or winter? - A. It was in the Summer; I had her about ten days, or a fortnight, before Mr. Dent took her away; it was above a week, I know.</p>

               <p>Q. You have told us about this man's character? - A. I have known him these eleven years coming to my yard; he came there before I had it; I bought her in my own yard; I gave sixteen guineas for her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dent. It is near seven months since I lost her.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Dent.) Are you certain as to the mare; are you sure that it is your mare? - A. Very certain.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no doubt about it? - A. Not the least.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. How long was it after you found the mare, before you saw the prisoner? - A. I cannot exactly say; I was sent for before the Magistrate, at Shadwell, to produce the mare; and it was a little while before he was committed; I cannot say the time; here is an officer, he can ascertain the time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ally. Q. That was about seven weeks after you lost your mare, that you recovered it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a fortnight this man had her in his possession? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You stated of course, that you would prosecute the person who had the mare? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You found your mare? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore supposed yourself entitled to recover her? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable, belonging to the Public-office, Shadwell: On the 5th of November last, Kenward came to me, and asked, if there was a man in custody for horse-stealing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner by? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He had some conversation with you, which led you to go to some public-house? - A. Yes, to the Weavers' Arms, Baker's-row, Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q. He applied to you, and not you to him? - A. He applied to me; I desired him to stand on one side; I did not go immediately into the house, and according to the description he gave me, I apprehended the prisoner, and then sent for Kenward.</p>
               <p>Q. By his description you knew the man? - A. I did; and as soon as Kenward saw him, he shook hand with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say? - A. He said, how do you do.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to shake hands with him; was that a signal you had agreed upon? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he charge him with? - A. Horse-stealing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. You are an officer belonging to the Public-office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Kenward went up and said, you are the man I bought the horse of? - A. Yes; but I cannot particularly swear.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner say any thing in reply? - A. He did not say any thing to it; he did not deny it.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, do you not expect a reward? - A. I do not; I know there is a ticket, but whether it goes to the man or not I cannot say, though I have been in the office so long.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do you not know that it is to be participated? - A. Upon my oath, I do not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. And he is right, for, in horse-stealing there is no reward, there is a ticket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. He said, by Wednesday week, he would bring forward a witness from Lewes, that was in company with the man he bought it of all the day before; and he was sure that man would swear I was the man; the Justice told him, we ought to be both committed; and he brought the man forward; he took the book in his hand, and said, please your Worship, I cannot swear this is the man; if this is the man, he is greatly altered; and I don't think he is the man: says he, the man that sold the horse was in company with me all the evening; says he, this is not the man that bought the horse; I never went out of the way; I have lived in the parish of Bethnal-Green many years; I went to Mr. Dent, and asked him, if he suspected me, and he said, he did not.</p>

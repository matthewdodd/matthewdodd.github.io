               <p>Was Mr. Conner one of the pawnbrokers that you went to when you lost your things, did the prisoner go with you to that shop? - We did not go to that shop, it did not fall in my way; we went from ten o'clock till night.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect saying after you lost your things, that you wished that if they were pledged any where, that the person who pawned them would put the duplicate under the mat? - I said, if I got them again, I would forgive them; Mrs. Blake said to me, should not you wish to have the duplicate put under the mat where the key is put? yes, says I, I should.</p>

               <p>At the distance of a month used your clothes to be kept in the same box? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Might not it happen very well that a person having got that duplicate intending to restore it to you, might put it into these breeches, supposing them to be yours? - I do not know that.</p>

               <p>What time did he go from his work? - Twelve o'clock; I had no further conversation with him then; in the course of the next week, the prisoner had wrote to his brother-in-law, informing him he had lost his clothes; he had lost his clothes as well as the prosecutor; his brother came to town; I had a trifle to make up, and I asked a man to lend me half a guinea; he said it was not convenient; the prisoner put his hand in his pocket, and pulled out some money; there was gold and silver, I cannot tell how much, and pitched half a guinea into my lap as I was at work.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. So that from six to twelve he continued working with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long had the prisoner worked for Mr. Fell? - I do not know; he was out of town some time, he worked there before I came.</p>

               <p>Then Chambers wished to be his successor in your affections? - Chambers did every thing in his power to make himself agreeable, but I could not find him so; I let the prosecutor come and see me at times as an acquaintance of Mr. Bingham's; before I dropped acquaintance with the prosecutor, he told me, if ever I was going to be married to any person, let him be whomsoever he would, that he would prevent it for a little, if not for a constancy.</p>
               <p>Upon your turning off Chambers the prisoner came into favour? - Yes; on the 20th of last February, I left my place and went down to North Shields to my sister, who is here, I returned last Wednesday was a week; I went down with a promise of marrying the prisoner upon my return, and Chambers told me when I returned again the day after the prisoner was taken up, he was taken up after I came to town, Chambers knowing I was to be married to him on my return last Tuesday; when the prisoner was taken up the Monday before; on the Tuesday night at seven o'clock, the prosecutor came with Mr. Dexter, who is here, to me.</p>
               <p>What business did you follow? - I have been a nursery maid from twelve years old.</p>
               <p>Are you in service now? - No, I was down in the country seeing my friends, and when I came up, I took a room with intent of being married to the prisoner; Chambers told me, he came to inform me out of friendship what the prisoner was taken for; that he had taken up the prisoner; he asked me if I was married to him, but I did not answer him, he said, he pittied me; then he told me he always respected me, and was glad for my sake that I was not married to him, he certainly would prosecute the prisoner as far as he could, and for my sake he would not wish to see him hung, but would prosecute him as far as he could, and transport him, if in his power; he said, if I was not married, he was glad, if so he should be sorry; one of the witnesses here, gave him a letter to bring to me; the prisoner had given another person a letter, and the prisoner had desired Dexter to come and tell me, Chambers chose to come with him, and Dexter had not leave to speak.</p>

               <p>I am a taylor; I know the prosecutor and the prisoner; I work at Mr. Fell's; upon the prisoner's being taken up, he desired me to go to Miss Payne to inform her; I did not desire Chambers to go with me, Mr. Chambers being with me at the Bear when the prisoner was committed, desired I would learn where Miss Payne lived; when we came there, the account Miss Payne gave, is strictly true; I have known the prisoner four years.</p>
               <p>What has been his general character as to honesty? - I never heard any thing amiss of his character; on the 28th of April last, from six in the morning or a few minutes after, I saw Mr. Bingham till twelve; he returned to work at one, and continued there till eight; I went out with him from Mr. Fell's at half past eight, and we went across the way to a publick house, then he went on his master's business, and carried<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310112"></xptr> some clothes to the Rev. Mr. Smith's, by Portland-chapel, and to another place in Oxford-road, and we both returned to the publick house, and supped together, he stopped with me till half past ten, and then went home.</p>

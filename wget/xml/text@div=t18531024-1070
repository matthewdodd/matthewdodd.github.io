                  </hi>. My husband keeps the Chaise and Horses, at Heston. Last Friday night the prisoner came and asked for half a pint <hi rend="italic">of</hi> porter—I served him, and he offered me a shilling—I told him it was bad, and I should not take it—I gave it to the ostler, Atkins, and either he gave it to the prisoner or the prisoner took it up—he paid me in coppers, and he went out of my house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am ostler at the Chaise and Horses, at Smallbury-green, Heston. Last Friday the prisoner came, between 11 and 12 o'clock—I stood inside the door—he called for the beer—I did not see him served, nor did I see him give my mistress anything, but my mistress called me to see a shilling; it was a bad one—she gave it into my hand—I am quite positive it was bad—I told the prisoner it was bad—he said he believed it was a good one—he went away, and I gave information at the police station—I saw the prisoner apprehended in the road, after I came from the police station—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185310240018"></xptr>
               <p>threw something away; I think it was rather before the constable took him—I did not see him throw it, but I heard something jingle—I saw him searched at the station—I afterwards went back with the officer and a light to where I heard the jingle—I found one counterfeit shilling, and the con-stable found another—I noticed the reign of the shilling the prisoner offered to my mistress; it was William IV., and the one I found was one of William <hi rend="largeCaps">IV</hi>.—I had told the constable the reign of the shilling before we found either of them.</p>
               <p>

I was on duty that night—I went outside the station, and stood under a wall till the prisoner came oppo<lb></lb>site me—he appeared to come from the Chaise and Horses—when he came opposite me, I said I wanted to speak to him—he said, "Yes;" and away he ran in the road; I caught him; but before J could secure his arm, he threw something out of his left hand which appeared to be money, because it made a noise—I took him to the station—I then went to the spot with the last witness, and a lantern—we found two shillings—Atkins saw one on the ground, I picked it op, and I found another—before I picked them up, Atkins said it was a William <hi rend="largeCaps">IV</hi>. shilling that he had offered at their place—there was nothing else found on the prisoner.</p>

               <p>FIVE OTHER COUNTS, varying the manner of laying the charge.</p>
               <p>CHARLES KENDALL. I am a Custom-house agent, and live at York-terrace, Stepney. The prisoner was introduced to me about the 27th of April, by Mr. William Hallett, who said he was captain of the Othello, or words to that effect, and that he had some cokernuts to sell; I told him if he had coker-nuts to sell, I would give him the best price for them, and I would go on board the following morning or the morning after, and look at them - I went the next morning but one, and saw the prisoner, who appeared in treaty with another person; I agreed to purchase the coker-nuts at 17s. a hundred - I came round to the baggage-warehouse with him, where I saw my clerk, and I left him to close the transaction.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Is Mr. Hallett here? A. Not that I am aware of; he introduced the prisoner as master or captain - we have but one meaning for those words in the merchant service; Mr. Hallett is a Custom-house agent - I saw him some days ago; the prisoner speaks English, but I observed he was a foreigner; I think I saw Mr. Hallett at the Police-office.</p>

            . I am a merchant, and live in Nicholas-lane. I have the bills of lading; the prisoner was acquainted with the captain, who is not here - he was employed by the captain to sell those coker-nuts; I believe, on my oath, that he has acted as an innocent man, under the authority of the captain.</p>

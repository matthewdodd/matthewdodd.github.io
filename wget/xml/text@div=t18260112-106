            . I saw the prisoner in Cable-street, Whitechapel, a little before seven o'clock on the evening of the 6th of January, with those two hats - I asked whose they were - he said his master's; I asked who his master was - he said, "Oh, never mind;" as I was taking him to the office he said that he found them on Tower-hill.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

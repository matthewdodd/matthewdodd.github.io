                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Rowell, we keep an Alton ale-house in Cheapside. The prisoner called on me on 12th July and wanted to borrow 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he was a Sheriffs-officer, and he had taken a man into custody—I lent him the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he had a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. country bank-note, he wanted to get change for it, and he would pay me the money in an hour or two—he appeared to bave a person outside—when he got half-way across the bar, he waved his hand, and said, "It is all right you can go on now"—he had before said he had left the person in charge of another man—he did not call again in an hour—he came on the following day and went into a little room adjoining the bar—he polled some papers out of his pocket, and sat down and wrote—there were several persons there, and when they were gone he came and put down 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said, "I wish you to take that"—I said, "You remember you owe me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he said, "I know that, but I want you to take this"—I asked him if he had got the note changed—he said, "No"—I asked him if it were a genuine one—he said that was very doubt<lb></lb>ful—I should not have lent him this money if I had not believed him to be a Sheriffs-officer, and that what he represented was true—he had a small piece of paper in his hand at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Secondary's office. I have seen the prisoner about Guildhall—he is not an officer in the employ of the Sheriff; if he had been 1 should have known it—I have seen him employed as a porter waiting about the Court—I think he has served copies of writs—he could not take a person into custody to my knowledge in London.</p>

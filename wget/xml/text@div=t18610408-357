                  </hi>. I am an iron trimmer, of 4, Wharf-road, Paddington-green—on 18th March, about twenty minutes past 1 in the morning, I saw the prisoners walking together—when I was about three yards from them the female prisoner said, "How do you do, young man?"—I made no answer, and the male prisoner came up, took hold of my right arm, and said, "I want to get away from this woman"—I said, "Well, I don't want you along with me," and tried to get loose from him—he struck me on the forehead with his fist, and on the nose, and the female came up and struck me on the eye and cut me—it appeared to be something harder than a fist, and sharper—I bled a great deal from my nose and eye—I have got two marks now—I was struck a good many times by both of them—they did not get me on the ground—I lost a black silk handkerchief off my neck—I called," Police!—a constable came and saw them both assaulting me—I gave them in charge.</p>

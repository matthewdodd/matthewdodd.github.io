About half past 4 o'clock in the morning of 15th March, I was in King's-row, Pentonville; I met the pri<lb></lb>soner, she had nineteen shirts, and some other articles, wrapped round in the skirt of her frock, under her arm—I asked what she had got—she said she had got some shirts she was going to iron, as she was a laundress—I asked where she brought them from, she said from Whitechapel—I said I should take her to the station, and she said, "O! I brought them from No. 6, Hermes-street; they are my mother's!"—I went to No. 6, Hermes-street, and found the parlour window had been forced open—I informed the person in the house, and she came and identified the property.</p>

               <p>window of this room was shut when I went to bed, and fastened with a catch inside—when I left the room I locked it, and took the key with me to the back parlour, where I sleep—I was knocked up, and found the door of the parlour locked, as I had left it—the window was open, top and bottom—I missed nineteen shirts, which were in a basket the night before, covered over with a towel and a petticoat—I have seen all the shirts, except one—one is lost—some of them have marks on them—I have one of them here—the Magistrate said it did not matter which I kept—I saw the articles at the station—I am quite certain they were the same that I had put into the basket on the overnight—the prisoner's mother has lodged in my house nearly three years—none of the property belonged to her mother.</p>

                  </hi>. I am waiter at Reeves' coffee-house, Coven<lb></lb>try-street. The prisoner came there on the 24th of March, and had a cup of coffee—he gave me a half-crown, which I put in my pocket, where I had no other—I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. change, and he went away—when I paid Mr. Reeves in the evening when the shop was closed, I found the half-crown was bad—he gave it me back—I put it into my box, which was locked, and to which no one had access but myself—I took it out on the 8th of April, and Mr. Reeves marked it.</p>

I kept the half-crown which my wife gave me, and sent her for a policeman—as soon as he came, I said to the prisoner, "We have been watching for you this fortnight; I knew what I was going to take of you"—he said, "It is sixteen days since I was here"—I said, "You acknowledge you have been here"—I gave the half-crown to the policeman.</p>

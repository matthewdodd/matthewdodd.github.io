On Wednesday, 4th Nov., about half past 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I saw Springfield and another man who is not in custody in Little Queen Street, and from information I followed them—they went away together, and, when opposite Day and Martin's, Sheppard joined them, and the other man passed something to Sheppard; I could not see what—they walked together down Holborn Hill until they came to a baker's shop—Sheppard went in first and spoke to Mrs. Hooper; the other two stopped at the door—the other man followed into the shop immediately—Springfield was about a yard from the door at the time—I was on the other side of the way—Sheppard and the other man remained in the shop about a minute and a half—the other came out first, and then Sheppard came out with a bundle—he touched Springfield on the left arm, and they both ran away together in the direction of Leather Lane—the other man went down Snow Hill—I went into the shop and spoke to Mrs. Hooper, who found the crown was bad—I then went to Leather Lane—I saw Sheppard walking on the left hand side, and Springfield on the right—I followed them till I saw Sheppard cross and join Springfield—they just entered into conversation, and I went up and took one in one hand, and the other in the other—I told them I charged them with passing bad money—Springfield said, "Me? I never saw that man before"—Sheppard said he knew nothing of the other man—I took them both to the baker's, and then to the station—Springfield gave his address correctly—he had lived there three or four weeks—Sheppard said he had been living at Gravesend—I found on him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the change from the bread—I found 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on Springfield—the man who went down Snow Hill I have not seen since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Running Horse, in Little Queen Street. On Wednesday, 4th Nov., Springfield and a man who is not in custody came to my house about half past 4 o'clock—the man not in custody called for a half quartern of gin, and put down a half crown—I took it up, rung it on the counter, and said, "This won't do"—Springfield said, "I thought not by the sound of it," and he pulled out 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and paid for the gin—the half crown was bad; I bent it—they wished me not to bend it—I said, "It is a bad one; you don't want to try to pass it; it won't matter whether it is bent or straight"—the other man said, "I can take it back to where I took it"—I said, "You can show it as well as if it was straight"—he and Springfield left, and a man in my house told a policeman, and he followed them.</p>

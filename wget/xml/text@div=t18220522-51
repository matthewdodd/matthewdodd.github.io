On Saturday the 4th of May, I was sitting at the back part of the house, and heard a noise behind the house - I then heard two men in my employ cry Stop thief! I ran to the gate, and saw two lads in blue coats running. The cruets were missing - the prisoner was brought back five minutes after, and he had a blue coat on; a neighbour brought the castors in. The thieves had got in at the parlour window; there were the marks of their feet in a chair. Another man was brought back with the prisoner, but he escaped.</p>

            . I am the son of the prosecutor. On the 4th of May, I was coming out of a field into the road, and saw one of the men get out of our window - he then handed the frame out, and put it under his coat. I called for assistance, and saw them brought back without losing sight of them. The prisoner was one. The other got out of the window.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went with a boy to Highgate, he left me, returned in a quarter of an hour, and called to another boy who was with us - they ran away and I after them.</p>

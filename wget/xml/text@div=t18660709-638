                  </hi>. I am a stevedore, and live at 3, Prince's Square, St. George's—on Friday evening, 15th June, I went into the "Swedish Flag" public-house—when I went in the prisoner and another person were quar<lb></lb>relling—I know the party he was quarrelling with—I did not take any share in it—I did not speak to the prisoner—I saw him take a knife out of his pocket—I said to the party he was quarrelling with, "You had better mind. He has got a knife in his hand. Perhaps he will do some mischief."—I was rather frightened and went out—as I went out I knocked against the prisoner's arm—the woman Cowling tried to shove him out, that he should not do any mischief—he then stabbed me.</p>

               <p>with him, and his mate released his arm and he stabbed me—when I found I was stabbed I ran away, and he ran after me—he was swearing and call<lb></lb>ing out—I don't know what he said, but if he had got hold of me a second time I shouldn't have been here—the girl stopped him, and then I got away altogether—I was taken to the London Hospital, where I remained till the 28th.</p>

I live at 35, Prescott Street, St. George's—I was in the "Swedish Flag" with two or three other young women on the evening of Friday, 15th June—the prisoner came in afterwards and joined us there—he began quarrelling with another man, and I saw him take hold of the man's waistcoat and tear it down—then the man struck him—during this time the prosecutor came in—the prisoner pulled out a knife—I said, "Don't do that"—he said he would stab him—I pushed him out of doors—the prosecutor was on the steps at the time, and I pushed them both out—I saw the prosecutor go to take the knife out of his hand, and I saw the prisoner hit a blow—the prosecutor ran away, and the prisoner after him—I ran after the prisoner, and caught him, and held him—I took him to his board<lb></lb>ing-house, and said, "Where's the knife?" and he opened his hand, and the knife was in three pieces in his hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at the London Hospital. The prosecutor was brought there on 15th June, bleeding freely from a punctured wound in the right side. It was midway between the hip bone and the lower rib, I cannot say how deep, for I never probed it—it could not have been very deep, from the symptoms that followed—a knife would have produced the wound—he went on quite well and left on 28th—he is perfectly well now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner in his defence stated through an interpreter that he had slept three nights with the witness Cowling, and that she had robbed him of his money and clothes, that he went into the "Swedish Flag" with a shipmate, and was struck in the face by a man, which made his mouth bleed; his coat was torn off, and he ran after a man who he thought had got it; he could not catch the man; that he then went back to his shipmate, and found he had got his jacket, and then went home to his boarding house</hi>.</p>

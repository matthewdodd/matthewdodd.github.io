             sworn. - I am the wife of the last witness: On the 24th of July Mr. Lock brought the prisoner to the bar; I had laid down in the bar two one-pound notes, a guinea, and three shillings; my husband went out into the coffee-room; when he came back; I asked him if he had taken up the money, and he said, no.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. There were other persons about your bar? - A. No other person came into the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no person going by? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your attention so particular as to observe that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the numbers of the notes? - A. No.(The constable produced the property.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Lock. These are very much like the notes, but I did not take the numbers.</p>
               <p>Court. Nor was it necessary after what has passed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lock. I have made enquiry, my Lord, and I find he has been a very respectable man.(The Court thought it unnecessary to examine a great number of witnesses, who appeared to the prisoner's character.)</p>

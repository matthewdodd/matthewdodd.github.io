                  </hi>. I am a coal-merchant and live in Cambridge-terrace—on 23d November, about 5 o'clock in the evening, I was in the Wiltshire beer-house and saw the prisoner there—I did not notice whether he was there when I went in—I took up a newspaper and began to talk to some persons there—the prisoner accosted me and asked me about the probability of a war between France and England—I asked him what country he came from—he said he was a German—I asked him how long he had been in Eng<lb></lb>land; he said many years—I asked him whether he liked this country better than Germany; he said "Yes; Germany is a low unhealthy country"—he asked me what religion I was, I said a Protestant—he said he was a Catholic, and he extended his hand to an old gentleman, Mr. Stoner—he asked me to drink, and asked me to read the paper—I said I could not—it was getting rather dark—he said if I could not read it he would give it to some one that could, and went back to the party he was drinking with—I then bid him good night—he said "No, don't go yet"—he backed himself against the door, and said, "Don't go yet, have another glass of ale"—I said "No, I won't take any more"—I looked at him and went and sat down in front of the window—nothing more passed between us—I saw the newspaper at my feet; I took it up and found it was the Telegraph—I was holding it up before me, and the prisoner deliberately stepped from the door and stabbed me in the abdomen and in the chest—I was not aware that I was stabbed—I thought I was struck, but he left the knife sticking in my chest—I got up and said, "You old villain, what do you mean by striking me like thist"—he made no answer but went away—this is the knife—it went through the newspaper and through my trousers and shirt—I had not given him the slightest provocation—I spoke to my friend, and was taken to the London Hospital.</p>

I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital—I was there on 23d November—Mr. Chaplin was brought there between 7 and 8 o'clock in the evening—he had a wound in the abdomen about half an inch long—it was not probed, as that might have been an injury—it is impossible to say how deep it was—it was likely to have been produced by this knife—he was also stabbed in the breast, but the weapon had been stopped by the breast-bone—he has recovered from the wounds.</p>

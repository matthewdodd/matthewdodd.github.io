I was in company with a girl named Beale on the night of the 2nd of December, between twelve and one o'clock, and saw the prosecutor coming from Stoney-lane towards London-bridge—I saw both the prisoners coming from a public-house—they were on the opposite side of the road to the prosecutor, they crossed and met him—I saw Sullivan push up against the old man, and push him against the shutters of a shop—Roach was with him—the prosecutor put up his arms to defend himself—Sullivan took him by the arm and threw him into the road—be helped him up, stood him on his legs, gave him his stick in his hand, and told him to go on—I had seen the prosecutor coming along the pavement before with the stick in his hand, leaning on it, before they came up to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Thomas Wilder—we live in Elizabeth-place, Woolwich. On the 4th of Dec. the prisoner quitted the occupation of a furnished room, which I had previously let to her for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week, without warning—I missed two pillows and a blanket—she had been living there with a man whom she passed as her husband—she had paid her rent up to that time, and had been two months with me—she was absent the whole night, but she had been absent several times for a night, and came back again.</p>

I produce two pillows, one of them pawned on the 23rd of Oct., and the other on the 9th of Nov., both by the prisoner, one in the name of Pocock, and the other Shepherd—I knew her by coming to the shop—she had redeemed things before, and I rather think she had redeemed these.</p>

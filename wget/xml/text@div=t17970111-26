             sworn. - I know the prisoner perfectly well; I knew him when I saw him at Bow-street; he came between twelve and one o'clock, and ordered a bason of soup, which he paid for; we had a dinner ordered in the one-pair of stairs floor; this young gentleman ordered his dinner at about a quarter past three, not to exceed twenty minutes; he came about a quarter of an hour before the dinner was to be sent up; my master ordered me to shew him up stairs; he asked me if we had a little boy in the house that he could send of a message; I asked him how far; he said, only over to the Stock-Exchange coffee-house, to fetch a parcel for him, directed to Mr. Smith; I said, he should go; my master and I had our dinner; after I had served the people in the one-pair of stairs, I went up into the room, and came down again to the bar; the boy was at the bar, just returned from the Stock-Exchange coffee-house; I asked him what he had done with the plate, if he had brought it down; I had seen it in the room a little before; he said, no; I said then he had let the man run away with the plate; he went out with the boy to shew him the way to the Stock-Exchange coffee-house.</p>

               <p>Q. You saw the plate in the room three or four minutes before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Was the prisoner in the room when you saw the plate there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was the plate in the room when you shewed the prisoner in? - A. It was.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110043"></xptr>FRANCIS HAGGARD sworn. - I am waiter at Antwerp tavern.</p>
               <p>Q. See if you know the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him before this? - A. At the Antwerp tavern, on the 30th of December, the sore part of the day; he ordered a dinner, and then he went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him when he returned the second time? - A. Yes, about three o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any plate in the room at the time? - A. Yes; I carried the plate into the room myself just before; there were six table-spoons, two salts, a pepper-castor, and a soup-ladle; the waiter sent me up stairs to go of an errand for him; I went up, and he asked me if I could go to the Stock-Exchange for him; I said, yes; he asked me if I had got the wafer he ordered the waiter to send up; I said, no, I have not got the wafer, but I will go and fetch it; he said, no; never mind the wafer, do you go down and wait a minute or two for me, I want you to go to the Stock-Exchange coffee-house to fetch a parcel for me; I waited a minute or two down stairs, and he came down stairs, and I went to the bottom of the stairs at the Stock-Exchange with him; he then said to me, do you go up stairs, and ask for a parcel left in the name of Smith; I went up stairs to the bar of the Stock-Exchange, and asked for a parcel in the name of Smith; they said, there was no such thing there; I went back to the Antwerp tavern door; he said, he should go back there and wait for me; I waited at the door to see if I could see him, but I could see nothing of him.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it he said he should be at the Antwerp tavern? - A. In the way as I went with him to the Stock-Exchange; the other waiter went up into the room to see if I had set all the things right for dinner; he came down, and said, I had not set the plate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go up to see for the plate? - A. Yes, and there was none there; I said, I had set every thing in its place; he said, then the man had gone away with it; and he went to the Stock-Exchange, to see if he could see any thing of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever come back? - A. No</p>

               <p>Q. Was the plate in the room when he came the first time, and ordered the dinner? - A. He did not go into that room when he came the first time.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know the value of this plate? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Has any part of the plate been recovered? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mr. Durham). What is the value of this plate? - A. It is worth a good deal more than I have valued it in the indictment.</p>

               <p>Q. When had you last seen the plate yourself? - A. In the morning, or over-night; it was in the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. The six table-spoons are valued at 40s. are they worth that? - A. Yes: the two salts, 20s. the pepper-castor, 5s. and the ladle, 42s.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think they would sell for that? - A. Yes, more.</p>
               <p>Q. No part of the plate has been found? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find the prisoner? - A. Hearing of some other business, I went to Bow-street, and saw the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after you were robbed? - A. About a week.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The plate was in the room when I left the room; I have no witnesses.</p>

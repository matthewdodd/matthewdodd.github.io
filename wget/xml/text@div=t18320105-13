On Saturday, the 3rd of December, about twelve o'clock at night, I was in the street in Uxbridge town, waiting for two of my father's waggonsfrom London; they did not come at twelve, and I walked towards home - I was in the footway - it was dark; the prisoner came out of the middle of the high road, and jostled against me - he was alone then; I said, "Halloo! my friend! what are you up to?" he said, "Ax my **!" I said, "That is Watford," meaning that was a word used at Watford - nothing more passed then; I walked on about thirty yards - he kept just behind me, and when I came to the George gateway, (that road leads on Uxbridge-common,) there were two men standing in the gateway, and as I went across the gateway I received a very heavy blow from the prisoner, which knocked me down - he was behind me, and gave me a heavy blow, which cut my eye-lid open; I hallooed Murder! and called Hitchin, knowing the watchman, who was going before me; I fell with the blow - my hat was knocked off; I saw the prisoner pick it up, and when I called Murder! Hitchin! they all three ran away together - I had seen the prisoner before; he belonged to lockenden two miles from Uxbridge - I never had any acquaintance with him; my handkerchief was in my hat; I ran after them about thirty yards, calling Murder! and picked my handkerchief up, but have never got my hat - I could not overtake them; the prisoner was taken next evening.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was it not rather dark? A. It was; it all took place in a very short time; Uxbridge is a large town - I never spoke to the prisoner before; I was knocked nearly six yards - he was behind me when he struck the blow, but there was a good gaslamp over the gateway; he was behind me, or rather on one side when he gave me the blow - I knew where he lived; I did not go to his house - he had no home but his father's, and I did not expect to find him there; I expected he would be denied - he was found at a public-house a mile and a half from where he lived; I had been looking for him all day.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Uxbridge. About twelve o'clock at night I heard a cry of Murder! I had seen the prisoner at Uxbridge that night, and tried to persuade him to go out of the street; when I heard the alarm I found it was the prosecutor - I could see the shadow of the prisoner's back as he passed the gate, on hearing the cry, and to the best of my knowledge it was the prisoner; there were two short men with him - he was the tallest; I tried to catch them, but could not - I took up the handkerchief in the way they ran, and gave it to Johnson; he was just getting up when I got up to him, and his eye was bleeding; I was about forty yards off when I heard the cry.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. His back was towards you, and you caught a glimpse of a man who you thought was tall? A. Yes; the prisoner appeared sober when I saw him -I had been sent for to get him out of the Bell about twenty minutes to twelve o'clock; I did not see the face of the man who ran from Johnson, but there was a strong lamp just by - I had my lantern in my hand; to the best of my knowledge he is the man - I did not see his face; I had got him and others out of the Bell, and they refused to go away, as they said they were on the King's highway.</p>

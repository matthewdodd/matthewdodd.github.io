On 28th Nov. the prisoners were in my service—I have a barge called the <hi rend="italic">London</hi>—Scott was the captain of it, and Fance was the mate—on 28th Nov. I sent that barge from South Purfleet to Chelsea, with about eighteen loads of straw and two loads of hay—I directed the captain to deliver the freight to Johnson and Rhodes, at Chelsea—I had previously contracted to sell that quantity to Messrs. Rhodes—I believe the prisoners started on 28th Nov.—when they returned I asked the mate if he delivered the whole of the freight to Johnson and Rhodes—he said, "Yes, every</p>

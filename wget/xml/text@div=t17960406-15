            : On Monday morning, the 7th of March, about a quarter before eight,(on Friday the 4th, a gentleman called upon me, and asked me if I had been robbed by any body belonging to me; I told him, not to my knowledge); I <rs id="t17960406-15-viclabel86" type="occupation">have a warehouse in Milk-street</rs>

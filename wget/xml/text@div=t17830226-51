               <p>Was there any thing to induce her to confess? - I did not hear it, if there was it was before I came there, they were found in a part of the house, over a corner cupboard, there were three pieces of board, which apparently were nailed up, I got up into the chair, and I put my hand on one of the boards, and I found it would take out, and put in, and there I found the pots, and the metal I mentioned.</p>

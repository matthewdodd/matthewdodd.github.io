I keep the Mansion House public-house, Lower-road, Deptford—in the latter part of the first week in December, between 2 and 3 o'clock, the prisoner came; it might have been 6th December—he asked for a glass of ale—I served him—he tendered a shilling, and I gave him the change—in consequence of some suspicions I had about the shilling I put it by itself in the till, where there were some sixpences, but no shillings—immediately he left, I looked at the shilling, and found it bad on a</p>

I am an umbrella manufacturer, of Monkwell Street, City, in partnership with Mr. Earl—prior to July, 1869, I knew the pri<lb></lb>soner, not intimately, I had business and money transactions with him; if he brought a Manchester cheque, I have given him my cheque in exchange, nothing beyond that—a day or two previous to 10th July, 1869, he came to me, and said he had got a quantity of goods in pawn at Messrs. Harris &amp; Sweeting's, about 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth, that he owed them 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he wanted to redeem them, and had not the means, and would I let him have the money to redeem them, as he had sold a portion of them to Messrs. Ward &amp; Sturt, of Wood Street, enough to pay me the money back, which he would do in three days—I refused, for several days, to let him have it; he came repeatedly about it, and pressed me very hard to lend him the money; he said he did not know what he should do if I did not, that he was ruined if he did not get them out—I ultimately consented to go and pay the money</p>

               <p>myself to redeem them, which I did; I went with him, and paid the cheque—I went twice; the first time Mr. Harris or Mr. Sweeting were not in—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the cheque I gave, it is for 262<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was for expenses—at first I was to hold the goods as security—afterwards he said they had better not go to my place, as he had got to my place, as he had got to re-box them before they went to Messrs. Sturt—Harris &amp; Sweeting gave me a receipt for the money—the defendant handed me a list of the goods, but he had it back again to see that they were correct; I have never seen it since—he did not give me any memorandum, or any security for the advance—I did not have a halfpenny as discount—after two or three days I called at the defendant's premises—I don't think I saw him the first time, I called again and saw him—he said he had not sent the goods in yet, he had not got the boxes—I took his word—I saw him repeatedly afterwards; he kept on making excuses; at last he said he had sent the money to his father, that he had received from Ward &amp; Sturt—I said he ought to have known better, he ought to have paid me—he made no reply to that—he said he was going down to Manchester, he had got some money there, and he would bring me the money up—I met him with his father, in Falcon Square, three or four weeks after the money ought to have been paid, and the father thanked me very much for my kindness to him, and told me I should not lose a penny, if it was the lost stick he had to sell he would pay me—I called afterwards at the defendant's premises from time to time—sometimes I saw him, sometimes I saw his clerk—I asked him every time for my money—I did not get it—on one occasion he said he was going to Man<lb></lb>chester, to sell his stock there, which he did—he did not give me the money out of that—he was taken and put into Whitecross Street, with the money in his pocket, directly he came from Manchester—about Sep-tember or October I heard of his having executed a bill of sale to his father, and went to Messrs. Weeks, my solicitors—a letter or two was subsequently received from the prisoner's father, in consequence of which I waited some time longer—the letters were before I heard of the bill of sale—on 22nd September I went to the premises in Castle Street, and found the whole of the stock had been removed—I made inquiries, and traced the goods to Messrs. Honey &amp; Hum<lb></lb>phrey, accountants, in King Street—I went there with my solicitor, and ascertained that the goods were to be sold on the following Saturday, by tender—I subsequently saw the prisoner's father, with my solicitor—I did not see a bill of sale of these goods—there was a bill of sale shown at his father's house when I saw his father—that was on the furniture—I never saw the bill of sale—I gave my solicitor instructions to take proceedings against the prisoner in bankruptcy, when we found he had filed his own petition—I was appointed assignee in the bankruptcy—there were no assets—I received nothing—I have never received a shilling of my advance.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he in liquor - A. He was rather in liquor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I acknowledge that I was at the house. I believe, to the best of my knowledge, I was very much in liquor, I had been out all night; the night before I was at that house and had some beer, but what quantity I do not exactly know. I acknowledge I gave the boy a note, that which I supposed to be a note, I do not know that it was a note. I had money about me, I changed a five pound note the night before. I got into bad company.</p>

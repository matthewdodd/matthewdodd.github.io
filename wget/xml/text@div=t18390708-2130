                  </hi>. I am a plumber, and live in Tooley-street, Borough. The prisoner was in my service about twelve months—my shop and the place adjoining are undergoing alterations—on the night of the 3rd of July there were no doors up in front, and a watchman was employed to watch—I know this piece of lead (<hi rend="italic">looking at a piece</hi>)—it is a deep-sea lead, and was cast in a mould of my own—I know this roll of lead—it was in my premises at six o'clock in the evening of the 3rd of July—on the morning of the 4th of July a watchman came to me—I went to the police-station, and saw this lead.</p>

               <p>one larger than usual—I never had but one more run so high in the mould, and the other I have now on my premises—I saw this one safe on my premises on the 2nd of July—sometimes I employ a good many men—at that time I think I had fifteen—I can swear to this roll of lead—I had my attention directed to it on my premises about six o'clock on the evening of the 3rd—I do not owe the prisoner any thing, except for his watching, which may be a sovereign, not more—he had never asked me to pay him that—I had given him half-a-sovereign to go to the theatre, because he had been watchman for me two or three nights.</p>

                  </hi>. I was employed as watchman at the prosecutor's. On the 3rd of July, at a little past twelve o'clock, the prisoner came to me—he said he had been to the play, and his wife was comings and he did not want to see her—he stepped into Mr. Brighton's premises—I knew him as one of the workmen there, and did not object to his going in—while he was in the premises he asked me to go for a pot of porter—I refused—he then went in the direction of London-bridge.</p>

About one o'clock in the morning of the 4th of July I saw the prisoner by the rail-road, about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's—he had this roll of lead on his shoulder—I stopped him, and asked him where he was going—he said to Parish-street, to do a job for himself—I asked him where he got the lead—he said he had just bought it in the Broadway, and given 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for, it, and it weighed 2lbs.—I called a constable, and left him with the prisoner, while I went to the shop in the Broadway which he had described—I knocked at the door, and a female answered me that they had been in bed for some hours—I went back to the constable who had the prisoner, and told him to come on with the prisoner, it was all wrong—the pri<lb></lb>soner scuffled, and I laid down the lead and secured him—I took him to the station-house, and found this other lead his pocket—this weighs 16lbs. and the roll 50lbs.</p>

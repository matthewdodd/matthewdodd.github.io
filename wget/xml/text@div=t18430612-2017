                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 84.) On Wednesday evening, the 7th of June, between seven and eight o'clock, I was in King-street, Green<lb></lb>wich, and saw the two prisoners following two gentlemen, who were arm-in-arm—Simmonds went up behind one of the gentlemen, followed by Kitchen, who spread open his round smock-frock close behind Simmonds, covering him, to hide what he was doing—I looked over Simmonds's shoulder, and saw his left hand go into the gentleman's left pocket—it was a Chesterfield wrapper—he took out a handkerchief and gave it to Kitchen, who put it inside his round frock—I afterwards found it in his breeches pocket—I found this other handkerchief in the back of Kitchen's breeches, which had a hole in them, and this other handkerchief I found round his neck—I spoke to the gentle<lb></lb>man at the time—he said he had lost his handkerchief, and would follow me to the station, but he did not—I have not been able to find him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Kitchen.</hi> I gave half-a-crown for that handkerchief in Rosemary-lane on Wednesday morning—I never saw any thing of Simmonds till I got to the fair. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> The one I found in his breeches he said he bought in Petticoat-lane on Sunday morning, and that he gave half-a-crown for the other on Wed<lb></lb>nesday morning—I asked him if there was any mark on this handkerchief—he said there was not, and there is a very large "T K" on it—I had followed them for about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, and saw Simmonds on one occasion lift up a gentleman's pocket to feel if there was any thing in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Simmonds's Defence.</hi> He did not say any thing about the handkerchief being marked till he was at the police-court next morning, and then he said he spoke to the gentleman, and he had said it was marked.</p>

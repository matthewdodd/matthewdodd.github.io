               <p>Had you ever seen her before that time? - No, I had not; I felt my watch go out of my pocket and caught her by the right hand directly; I told her that she had my watch; before I had uttered the words I saw her left hand held out at full length, and she was endeavouring to deliver the watch to a man with a black patch over one of his eyes, and the man was endeavouring to receive it, but I never saw the watch in his hand; I saw the chain hang out of her hand as she was endeavouring to deliver it; upon this I quitted her and seized the man by the collar; a constable was ready that instant, who was very<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177702190037"></xptr> attentive indeed, we secured them both and carried them into an alehouse, close by the playhouse door, where they were searched, but nothing found upon them; I went the next morning before the justice.</p>
               <p>How long do you suppose you had the woman by the arm before you quitted her and seized the man? - Not a minute; I immediately quitted her, and seized him; she was then endeavouring to make her escape; I committed the man to the care of my brother who was close to me; and I myself retook the prisoner.</p>
               <p>How long was it from the time of your taking the man by the collar to your retaking the prisoner? - I don't know; I believe it was about 4 minutes.</p>
               <p>Will you take upon you to swear the woman you retook was the same woman? - Yes; the whole was within the space of three yards; I could swear to her dress; she had a little black bonnet and black gown on; I swear she is the same woman; the moment the constable came up, he said, O Sir! don't you know her? it is the famous Miss West: there was not another woman there that I saw at all; I have not got my watch again; it was a watchmaker's watch; it was good for nothing; there was a gold chain and five seals to it.</p>

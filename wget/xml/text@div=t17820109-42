               <p>Court. At six o'clock in the evening, at such a season of the year, it must be after dark, and that is necessary, in point of law, to constitute a burglary. The window was found open, and the blind torn, that was in point of law a breaking; though the things are not carried out of a house, a burglary may be committed, if a person breaks into the house in the night, and commits a felony, or breaks in with intent to commit a felony. If a person is indicted only for a larceny, if the things were proved to have been in a room above stairs, and he takes them from the room they are in, and brings them down stairs, that is a taking that would constitute a larceny; therefore in point of law, their being so removed by the person breaking into the house, would be committing a burglary in the house.</p>

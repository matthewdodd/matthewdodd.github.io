I know she would come and see me often, but you keep her away, and she is very submissive, and you do not care how hard she slaves, like some poor drudge of a servant. If you loved her you would not allow it, in her declining state of health. Since you have had her you have broke her spirit. If the dinner is not ready to a minute, look at the agitated state she is in, frightened almost to death. As I told you last Sunday, I am the woman for spirit, and you held my arms till they were black and blue the other day. Sir, I am still inclined to come to terms, to save any more bother or further trouble, as you know what I mean—the affair between you and me that has taken place at Bow. The best thing you can do is to supply me with a few pounds, and I will go to New Zealand, and then you will be rid of those you have acted so wrong to. I must have an answer to this. Tell Caroline to bring or send me a few shillings. I will pay her again. This is not her fault, but yours, sir. Remember. P. S.—Sir, I want the answer" (<hi rend="italic">no signature</hi>)—In consequence of this I instructed my solicitor to write a letter to her—this letter, written by the prisoner to my foreman, was given to me on Saturday 24th June—<hi rend="italic">Read.</hi> "June 23rd, 1865. Respected sir,—I hope you will furnish me with the information I require, that is to tell me the exact road or place where Mr. Giles takes his evening walk, and the time that he can be seen or met on such place, as I want to know particular; hoping, sir, you are quite" well and all at home. Please to write an answer by return of post, and I shall feel obliged. Direct Miss S. Geals, 38, Grafton-street, Mile End"—On 17th July, about a quarter or twenty minutes to eight in the evening, the prisoner came to the first loop hole, when I was seeing my work-people—it is where we give work out—she asked my foreman for me in my hearing—I went from the door leading from the first shop into the passage, and found the prisoner at the second door—I was partly inside and partly out—I said, "Well Sarah, what is your pleasure with me?"—she made no reply, but presented a pistol in my face, and said, "That"—I heard the explosion of the cap, and felt a slight concussion on my left cheek bone—she threw the pistol through the first loop hole, where she had applied for me, and ran out—my foreman</p>

                  </hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do I understand you to say you pulled out the paper first? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, with an awl—I put it in and drew out three pieces of paper, and then I turned the pistol up and the contents came out, powder and four shots—they all came out together—it would be very difficult for any gentleman to say which came out first—I went to the station and preferred this charge at a quarter to twelve the same night.</p>

Q.</hi> Do you know how long the prisoner has been passing to the world as a man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not of my own knowledge, but from what I have heard 17 or 18 years; five or six years before I knew her—I always found her strictly honest—Caroline is the woman who she represented as her wife; she is now my wife—she was living with the prisoner at the time, but I very seldom saw her—they lived in a small house, not in lodgings—I never went there and saw them together, but I have met them in the street—it was generally believed that they were man and wife—I knew nothing of their private affairs, or whether they lived comfortably together—I never heard anything to the contrary—I always found the prisoner honest, but she was of an excitable temper—she had been with me a few weeks when my wife was taken ill—my wife died in the beginning of January—Caroline was not in the habit of coming to the house till my wife wanted further assistance—I then asked the prisoner to allow Caroline to come to my wife—I very seldom saw Caroline before that, but I proposed for her to wait on my wife, because it was handy and she could come at once—she waited on my wife two or three days—it was three months after my wife's death that Caroline communicated to me the prisoner's sex—Caroline remained with me in the day time after my wife's death, but went home at night—I do not know how she came to communicate the prisoner's sex—I married her four months afterwards, this time twelve months—I communicated with the prisoner before I married Caroline—Caroline had told the prisoner that she had revealed the secret—I have heard two or three reasons for the prisoner's extraordinary conduct—she placed a paper in my hands stating that she really was a female.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it stated to you by others that the cause of this extraordinary conduct was a disappointment in marriage in early life? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is just what I was going <hi rend="italic">to</hi> explain—I have no reason to suspect that her mind is affected, but she is of an excitable disposition—she changed her attire about six weeks before our marriage—she and her brother were the only two persons present at our marriage—I took a place for her in September, 1863—I had been married a very short time then—I have been married thirteen months now—my wife and I visited her on Sundays, and I have been there on Sun<lb></lb>day mornings to make the books up—we continued to visit her—the busi<lb></lb>ness did not prosper—I gave her 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in different sums—she very seldom drank after separating from Caroline—the least drink she bad made her eccentric in her conduct—I supplied her with this pistol (<hi rend="italic">producing another</hi>) for her protection when she lived in that house alone, and when the shop was let I took it away—I brought it here in my waistcoat pocket, as I did not know whether it might be required—she kept it loaded at times—I do not know whether she used it constantly; she has been in the habit of using fire-arms, I understand, from a child—my wife was standing by my side</p>

               <p>when the pistol was discharged—the prisoner had never left off visiting us; she was there on Sunday, and used to dine with us, and remain all day—I think June 10th was the last time she visited at our place, when she stayed three or four hours, and went away early in the afternoon—she did not dine with us that day; there was a little disturbance between her and my wife that morn<lb></lb>ing, but I was out—the affair of the pistol happened as quickly as I describe it—there is no doubt the cap exploded; and it is in this paper now—I think the lock was out of order—she was living at 38, Grafton-street, Mile-end—I paid her the whole of the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and lent her money afterwards—I do not know whether she had been drinking more frequently than site had been in the habit of doing—I once reprimanded her for drinking, knowing that it excited her—I do not know whether my wife has written to her since she has been in prison—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is not my wife's, but the prisoner's brother's writing.</p>

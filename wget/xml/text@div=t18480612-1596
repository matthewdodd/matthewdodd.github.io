                  </hi>. I am a japanner and table-cover printer, in partnershipwith Charles Walden, at 2, Neate-street, Camberwell. The prisoner was inour service about five years—on 22nd May, I was informed by one of myboys that the prisoner had taken a table-cover from one of the shops I wentand found him at a public-house—I asked him if he had taken the table-cover—he said, "No, he had a table-cover, but he had it from a hawker inthe Albany-road"—I asked him to go with me to the factory—in going along, he said the table-cover he had was a draft-board pattern, and when he pro<lb></lb>ducedit it was a different pattern—I knew it to be mine, and gave him incharge—he was taken to the station, and another table-cover was taken fromhis hat, which was also mine—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

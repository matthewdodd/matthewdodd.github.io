                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. William Thomas Marsh, a grocer, in Lambeth-walk. On Saturday, 6th April, when he went to his tea, he said something to me; in consequence of which I watched the prisoner, who was in his service—Mr. Marsh's brother, and a shopman, and a porter, were there—I watched the prisoner when he gave change to a customer—he served a quarter of a pound of 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. tea, and a pound of 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. sugar—the customer gave him half-a-crown—the prisoner threw it into the till—he took out 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—he then put his hand into the bowl where the silver was, and took out two shillings—he gave one shilling to the customer, and the other he kept in his hand; I could see the rim of it—he walked halfway down the counter, and put his hand behind his coat—I went up to him, and said, "John, you have got a shilling; I saw you take it"—he made no answer—I drew his hand out, and his hand was open—I then searched two pockets on the right of his coat, and could not find it—Mr. Marsh's brother then said, "Here is another pocket you have not searched"—that was an inside coat-pocket on the left—in that I found one shilling, and nothing else—it was a pocket in which he could have put it by putting his hand behind him—when I put my hand into the pocket where it was, he said, in a whisper, "Don't, don't; get away!"—he was in the shop when I made this search—he afterwards went up-stairs, and as he was going up I heard him say it was a bad job—we called Mr. Marsh upstairs by stamping our feet, and he gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor, I carry on business in Lambeth-walk. The prisoner was in my service since Jan.—on this Saturday I gave directions to the last witness and went away—in about twenty minutes I was called by a stamp on the stairs, and the witness said, "John has a shilling belonging to you"—the prisoner said nothing—he was being searched—the shilling was not found at that time—two pockets were searched, and it was not found, then a third was searched and it was found—just before the shilling was found he said, "Don't, don't"—he did not like them to go to that pocket—he made a remark to Newton when he said, "I have not done with you yet"—after the shilling was found, he said it was a bad job—the policeman took him up-stairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose you had a good character with him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he was fourteen months there—I had watched the prisoner—I was never near enough to see him take any money, but I had seen his hand go to his pocket sometimes, immediately after serving a customer.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Paragon-mews, Blackheath; I am a horse-dipper. On Friday, 19th Sept., I was at the George public-house, at Black-heath; I saw the prisoner and two others outside the door—the prisoner asked me to go and procure a pot of beer for him, for the landlady said the would not serve such a set as them—he was not drunk—I said, "I am going to have a pint of porter, if you like to come and partake of part of it you</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coachman, and live at Blackheath-hill. On 19th Sept. I was at the Green Dragon tap, about 7 o'clock in the evening—I saw the prisoner, and the women, and Hall, all drinking together—Hall proposed that he would clip a horse against any man for a sovereign—he pulled out a sovereign, and put it on the table—the prisoner sat close along-side of him, and he picked it up and put it into his mouth, and as soon as be had got an opportunity he and his man who was with him, made off with it—I heard Hall ask him for it several times, and he said, "It is all right"—Hall—went out after them—I remember Hall going for a policeman before the prisoner started—Hall went outside the door, he did not leave the house—I did not see the prisoner after he and the other man left—I afterwards went with Hall in search of the prisoner, and found him at the Coach and Horses.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman S</hi> 14). I was on duty at Regent's Park Vilias about 12 o'clock on the night of Oct 5th, and heard an alarm at No. 7—a lady opened the door, and I examined the premises—the drawing-room window had been forced—Mrs. Wickstead picked up this hat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in the basement, and gave it into my charge.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Inspector H</hi>). On Saturday, 5th October, I received information of this burglary—I made inquiries, and about 4 o'clock on the Monday morning I went with other police officers to the Red House, Lower Keat Street, Spitalfields—in the front room on the top floor I found Burt and Ralph in bed together, Coaffee sitting in a chair, and Shean lying on the ground—Shean became somewhat violent—I told him I should take him in cus<lb></lb>tody for committing a burglary at Regent's Park, and stabbing a gentleman, and Coaffee also for committing a burglary at Islington—on 16th ult. I searched Coaf<lb></lb>fee, and found four keys, 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a metal chain, and a garden knife—Ralph had</p>

               <p>then dressed, and I told her to turn out her pockets—she produced the purse, and Burt said "You must be a b——fool"—she said the purse was lying on the mantel-piece, she took it up, Burt told her to put it down, she said she should not, and put it in her pocket—on the mantel-piece I found the live coins (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and 22 pawn-tickets, two of which relate to umbrellas, and one to a black bag, which had been shown to Mrs. Welsh, and one to a coat, and another to a part of a butter-knife, identified by Mr. Beardshaw, and one to a hat, spoken to by a gentleman who lodged with Mrs. Welsh.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Burt</hi>. I did not say to any one on the stairs "Come back, or I will shoot you"—I did not meet a man coming downstairs as I was going up.</p>

I went with the last witness, and saw Ralph produce the purse—Burt said "You must be a b——fool"—at the police-station Coaffee said to Burt "You had better clear your old woman"—I said it might turn out to be a serious matter; the man might die—I found a green memorandum-book upon Burt</p>

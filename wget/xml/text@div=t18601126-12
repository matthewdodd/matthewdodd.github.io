                  </hi>. I am a boot-maker—on Sunday night, 28th October, I think, about a quarter before 8, I was going towards London-bridge, with my wife—we were on the City side—the prisoner followed ma down King William-street, till we got to London-bridge, and then he took my handkerchief—I had seen him behind and before me all the way from King William-street, but I did not think he was after anything—he put his hand into my side coat pocket, and took my handkerchief—I turned round and saw him go away—I did not see the handkerchief in hit hand—I followed him, and saw him attempt to take handkerchiefs from two other persona—I saw him put his hand into their pockets—he crossed the road, and then I went again and took him—I said, "You are the young man I want, you have taken my handkerchief"—a policeman came up and took him into custody—I saw my handkerchief at the station, it was found on the prisoner—he said that I was mistaken, that it was not he.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 412). The prosecutor described the prisoner to me on Sunday night, 28th October—I first saw the prosecutor and his wife together in the middle of King William-street, and I saw him a second time at the corner of Cornhill, and he charged the prisoner with stealing his pocket handkerchief—the prisoner denied the charge—he said the property he had got in his pocket was his own—I induced him to pull out what handkerchiefs he had got in his pocket, and out of three pocket handker-chiefs the prosecutor identified this one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) as his—there is no particular mark on it—it is a common cotton pocket handkerchief—I took the prisoner into custody, searched him, and found on him sixpence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live in Swan-street, Great Dover-road. The prisoner was in my employ as a journeyman—he car<lb></lb>ried out bread to customers, and received money from them—I have a customer named Sarah Pavior—I gave the prisoner a bill for her every Monday morning—he brought the money to me at different times, but not regularly—the sum he brought home did not always agree with the bill—Mrs. Pavior, according to my books, is indebted to me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she owed me for one week's bill 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoner has not paid me that sum, which he should have done the day he received it.</p>

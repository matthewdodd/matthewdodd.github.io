Before I begin with my evidence, I would wish just to observe, that with regard to the prisoner White, I never sought the prosecution against him, he was brought before the magistrate, and from the circumstances which I related to him, it was the only way that he was committed; I am a very innocent prosecutor against White; I had no thought against him, only what I related before justice Addington.

            , was on my right side, then he catched fast hold of me on my right side, the moment the others fastened on me on my left side, they are not here, there was several of them; the prisoner catched hold of me by my coat, it is a great coat; there is a post the corner of the street, the others on my left side jammed me up against the post, the post was right at my back, and they were on each side of me; there were some women who were in the front of me, but they never molested me; this Paterson at the bar, he put his hand into my great coat pocket, I had two handkerchiefs in that pocket which he drew out; I catched hold of his arm with the handkerchiefs in his hand at the same time; the others on my left side was searching this here pocket, and another put his hand into my waistcoat pocket; I called for the watch as soon as ever I was attacked, and at the very moment of time I saw a lanthorn spring from the side of the houses, at the corner of the street; when I saw the lanthorn spring I observed it and I saw it was going the wrong way; I immediately catched hold of Paterson when he had the handkerchiefs, and held him in my arms; he struggled to get away from me, I seeing the lanthorn I still held him, as he was struggling, it was right under a lamp, I had a full view of his face; in his struggling to get away from me he pulled me two or three yards into Lukener's-lane; when I was there I perceived the lanthorn to stand, but it never came up to me at all, it stood at some very short distance, and as I held him a blow came on my head, which seemed to be from a bludgeon, that blow was still repeated, I did not fall at the first, second, or third blow, I received a great many blows before I fell to the ground, the blows cut my head right into wounds, I received a great many blows, some under my ear, whereby my hearing is so much hurt that I cannot hear no more than if I put my finger into my ears, my hearing was never bad before; when I was on the ground I was bleeding very much, and as I laid I remember a person, I believe it was the person of the public house, came out first and the watchman came up to me, and several other people, and I was taken into the public house and I had blood pouring from me in two strong streams, my eyes and every part of me was covered with blood; my head was washed with some brandy there, and I believe a table cloth, or something of that kind put on my head to stop the blood; then the watchman White came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290111"></xptr>into the room where I was, and I then naturally looked at him, and supposed him to be the watchman that I had seen before with the lanthorn, and I said, if you had done your duty, I should not have been cut in this way.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the other prisoner in the public house at that time? - No, he escaped, I said so to White, meaning that I thought he should have given me some assistance. They asked me in the public house whether I knew any of them that had robbed me? I told them I did, as near as I can recollect, I said, I know some of them or one of them; I was rather afraid in the house; I was then taken to a surgeon in Queen-street; the surgeon did not open the door, but he said this, I must be taken to an hospital; as I was coming back again down Drury-lane to go home I was so ill I could not stand; I remember falling down in Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Who attended you to the surgeon? - I cannot be certain; I had two with me at least, if not more. I believe I lay on the ground for a quarter of an hour; I fainted there, whether these people stopped with me or not that took me to the surgeon, I cannot positively tell; I recollect as I lay there, begging of somebody to go and get a coach, and I recollect somebody returning and saying they could not get a coach, but whether it was the same people as went with me to the surgeon's, or somebody going by I cannot say, but I remember that some that stood by helped me up and led me home.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of night was it you got home? - It must be between twelve and one I think; when I was taken home I remember being brought into the parlour, and I remember somebody saying they found me in Drury lane; a coach was sent for and I was immediately taken to the Middlesex Hospital; when I came to the Middlesex Hospital I remember the surgeon opening of my head, and examining the wounds; he said he could not tell whether my skull was fractured or not; I was in the hospital four days; I enquired at home who brought me home, and I was informed that there was no watchman had seen me home; on the next day somebody called at my house and asked how I did.</p>
               <p>Q. I wish to know what was the name of the woman that was with you? - She is here; she will tell herself.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was this woman that was with you? - I have known her a great many years; she did keep the house where I now live; she works at the upholstery line.</p>
               <p>Q. From the best recollection you have, what length of time might the prisoner be in your presence? - In that situation a minute is a good while.</p>
               <p>Q. Now considering all the wounds you received, and the state in which you received them, have you a perfect recollection that the prisoner Paterson was the man? - Certainly, because I saw him before ever I received any wound at all, I had seen him once in the street before, which I told him when I held him; the lamp shone right in his face as he struggled to get away, and I said I know you.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see him after this happened? - I believe a fortnight after.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see him? - In New Prison, Clerkenwell. One of the men belonging to Marlborough street office had got an order from the magistrate for me to see the prisoner, one or two before that had been shewn to me to see if I knew them; there was one brought up to Bow-street, and another at Marlborough-street for me to see.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other persons in the room at Clerkenwell when you saw him? - I saw him through a chequer gate, and there was twenty or thirty in the yard, or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290112"></xptr>more for what I know; I pointed to the man though he was in a very different dress; I saw him through the grate at the door, before he came through the gate, I said to the officer that is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that he is the man? - I am confident of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any hat on? - He had on a round hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his face? - I did perfectly.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any part of his dress? - His dress appeared to me a lightish coat; the description I gave before ever he was taken at all at Bow-street was in this way, a youngish man, a very remarkable nose, sandy hair and pock marked.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen. The first you saw of White was that he was one of the watchmen assisting you in the public house, and you thought he was the watchman whom you had seen before with the lanthorn in the street, and on that the magistrate thought proper to commit him for the felony? - I never thought or intended any prosecution against White and I never said any thing more against White then I have now; I told the magistrate that I could not take on me to say that it was White that was in the street with the lanthorn I was in such a bloody condition.</p>
               <p>Jury. You say you had known this man Paterson some time before? - I had seen him in Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever had any thing to do with him before? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you by that light, and in that situation know he was pock marked, and that he had sandy hair? - This was before I was struck.</p>
               <p>Court. You had observed you say, that this man was pock marked, and that he had sandy hair, was it from the light you had at that time that you distinguished he had pock marks and sandy hair? - I am sure it was, for I held him in my two arms.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it by only previous knowledge of him that you knew he had sandy hair and was pock marked, or was it from the light then? - It was from the light then. I mentioned I believe that it was the people on my left hand that took the three shillings out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How happens it that you only put one handkerchief in the indictment, and you say he took two? - I took one out of his hand, and I did not charge him with that, because I got it again.</p>

               <p>I was with the prosecutor the day he describes; he has a house in Compton-street and a shop in Drury-lane, I called on him in Drury-lane, I am not certain whether it was nine or ten in the evening. Mr. Gordon was going to see me home into St. James's; I live there now; coming down Drury-lane the corner of Lukener's-lane there were several people, they seemed to be very riotous; Mr. Gordon dropped his arm, I had hold of his arm, and I immediately went across the way, I thought that Mr. Gordon was following me, but hearing his voice call out watch almost immediately I turned back, but could not see him; on missing him I turned back again and hearing him still call out watch, with that his voice appeared over the way, I looked up Lukener's-lane and could see the light of the publican's candle, who stood at the door, the watch stood on the other side with his lanthorn in his hand, and Mr. Gordon stood before the door of the house bleeding, I immediately crossed and begged of the people to let him come in, and I went in with him, and had some brandy to bathe his head; I was very much frightened and was afraid he would bleed to death, a gentleman who was there scraped some hat and put it to his wounds to stop the blood, he still bled violently; I asked if a doctor could not be sent for? they said there was a surgeon in Queen-street and he had better be taken there; we tied up his head and two men held him up, and Mr. Gordon and the watchmen, then walked out to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether these men are here? - No, they were total strangers to me; they came in I believe by the alarm; Mr. Gordon asked me if I had a shilling to pay for the brandy? I gave the shilling to the publican, and he rather disputed that it was not good, he took me into the bar to try whether it was good, in this time Mr. Gordon was taken<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290115"></xptr>away to the surgeon, and I lost him for that night; I went away and enquired of a watchman where I could find them; he told me they were gone to a surgeon Cooper's in Queen-street; I went up and down Queen-street and could not find him, I then went and enquired of a watchman where surgeon Cooper lived; he said he could not tell me; I then went home and saw him no more till I saw him in Middlesex Hospital on the Friday following, as this happened on the Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prosecutor at any time after that happened give any account of the man that did it? - He always described him as he has done now.</p>
               <p>Jury. Pray where does Mr. Gordon live? - He keeps a house in Compton-street, but he keeps a shop in Drury-lane within a few doors of the spot where this happened, it is almost opposite Brown-street.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you said you called on him in Drury-lane, I called on him first at his house in Compton-street and he was not at home.</p>
               <p>Court. When did you say you called upon him? - On Tuesday the 19th of April, at night between nine and ten.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to be accurate as to the time? - I am not positive.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the time that you think this business happened? - I think it was past eleven, but I am not very clear to the time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you stay at his house? - I might stay an hour.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I heard of this robbery being done a short time afterwards; I heard it was done on Mr. White's the watchman's beat, in consequence of which I went to him and I found him in bed, after they have been on duty they commonly sleep in the day, I believe this was about ten or eleven o'clock, this was a day or two after the robbery was done, I asked him if such a circumstance had not taken place? he said it had, I asked him to go along with me after some of the people to see if we could apprehend some of them; he signified that then he was rather tired, but he would meet me at five o'clock in the evening; I met him at that time, and he seemed to go very readily with me in search of some of these men, and I make no doubt but if I had met with any of them he would have assisted me to have taken them. In consequence of the information of this robbery from Mr. Gordon, I shewed him a man at Marlborough-street office, a man we know by the name of Old Hyke, I asked him if he could swear to him? he said he could not, but he could swear to one was he to see him; he gave me an exact description of the prisoner at the bar; the moment he gave me the description I said it was Paterson, and I obtained an order from the magistrate to take the prosecutor to see Paterson in Clerkenwell New Prison; I went with the prosecutor to the prison, Paterson was called forwards and the prosecutor looked through the grating of the bars, and see him and knew him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he see the prisoner as he happened to be with the rest in the gaol, or was he brought forward by himself? - There was a good many in the gaol.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he separated from the other prisoners? - He was after that.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you when he saw him first? - The keeper called him by his name, and he was walking forward.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that your duty as an officer; you always have particular orders in such cases that the prisoners should never be separated? - We had no such orders at that time; Paterson was called to, I saw him come forward from the rest, and the prosecutor see him come out from the rest on the call; I would wish you to understand that before he came from the rest the prosecutor said that is the man, and then desired them to let him out that he might take a full look at him; he said this before he was called.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290116"></xptr>Q. Are you sure that the gentleman before the prisoner was called pointed out to him as the man? - Not before they hollooed the name of Paterson, then they were all together, Paterson was advancing.</p>
               <p>Jury. What was done as soon as he came to the grate? - The name of Paterson was called by one of the keepers, and the prosecutor was looking through the grating of the gate at the prisoner; the same time, he kept looking through the gate and he saw Paterson among the rest, and he signalized him out and said, that was the man, and when he said that was the man, I asked the keeper to let him through that he might have a perfect look at him; he said he need not look any longer at him for he was sure he was the man; the prosecutor pointed him out before he came from the others.</p>
               <p>Court to Gordon Was your handkerchief ever recovered? - No, I never saw it more.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Paterson. I wish to know first how that man can swear to me that hour of the night? - I held him sufficiently long enough under the lamp, I held him a minute.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My hair does not answer the description he gives; it is a dark auborn hair; I would be glad to know whether he was perfectly sober? - Perfectly sober and never otherwise.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Sanders called me up to the gate, and that gentleman came and looked at me directly.</p>
               <p>Sanders. I am sure he pointed him out first, and then I desired him to come between the gates that he might look at him more fully.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish you to examine the Prosecutor's character to know what house he keeps.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. What sort of a house is it you keep? - It is a large house of forty pounds a year, it is let ready furnished, it is let to women of the town.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a single man? - I am not a married man; I have a person that has lived with me this many years; I have carried on the business of a taylor a number of years, I have a shop in Drury-lane where my men work as well as my house in Compton-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Paterson's name called at the gaol? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first saw him, was he advancing from the rest, or along with the rest? - He was along with them; I looked through the grating, and there was a great number of prisoners, and I said there he is.</p>

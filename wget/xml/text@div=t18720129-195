                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, at 41, Acton Street, Gray's Inn Road—on 3rd January, between 5 and 6 o'clock in the evening, I served the prisoner with a pennyworth of rum—I noticed him very particularly, he drank it and left—next evening he came again about the same time—the barmaid served him with a pennyworth of rum and I saw him pay her with a penny, he sat about twenty minutes drinking the rum and then left—shortly afterwards a little boy came in for three-pennyworth of pale brandy in a bottle, for which he had to pay a penny deposit—I saw him put a half-crown on the counter, the barmaid took it up and passed it to me, it was bad and I broke a piece out of it—I spoke to the boy and gave him an empty bottle, he went out and came back with his father and the prisoner—I asked the prisoner what he meant by this—he could not give me any answer—I said "We have caught-you at last" and gave him in charge with the half-crown.</p>

                  </hi>. I am steward of the Lunatic Asylum at Hoxton. The property alleged to have been stolen was in the legal pos<lb></lb>session of Edward Langdon Bryan, who is the superintendent of the asylum under the proprietors—he is appointed by the Lord Chancellor—the prisoner has been employed as needle-woman in the asylum nearly two years—she slept at the asylum—she had private lodgings—on the 16th of Feb. I went to the police-station—two pairs of sheets were shown to me there—they were the property of the asylum—I went to No. 1, Henry place, Hoxton old-town—I saw the officer open a door with a key—I found a considerable quantity of property there, but these four sheets, the subject of this indict<lb></lb>ment, were found upon the prisoner by the constable.</p>

I must see it, and take you back"—I found these sheets in her possession—she was carrying them away from the asylum—she said, "For God's sake forgive me this time!

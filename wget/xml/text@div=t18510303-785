                  </hi>. I am a baker at 15, High-street, Whitechapel, and am the freeholder of the premises, 12, Church-street, Greenwich. When I bought the premises they were let to Robert Stanford, the father of the prisoners, and he continued my tenant till he died, in Jan. last—at Christmas he was indebted to me 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for a year and a half's rent—he was buried on 3rd Feb., and I put in a distress on 4th Feb.—Mr. Garret, the executor, put me in possession—Mary Ann Stanford, daughter of the deceased, was present—Garret wished me not to shut up the shop, and I said I would send in some flour, and make Mary Ann Stanford my servant, and she was to hand over the money she took every day to Mr. Wickes, a broker who I left in possession, on my account—I went again on the 8th,</p>

               <p>and in consequence of an arrangement with Mr. Garret, I paid 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for quiet possession, without any disturbance, as Mary Ann Stanford was the only one who had any sort of interest—Edward and Henry were there, and Mr. Garret ordered them out—they walked out, I walked in for a little while, and Mr. Garret gave me formal possession—I then went home—on the 10th, at four o'clock, I went again, for the purpose of meeting some one to whom I wished to let the premises, and found a large mob round the windows, extending half across the street—the shutters were down, and the house, garden and yard were literally full of people—I asked Edwin Stanford, who I found behind the counter, what all this was about, and he said he had taken possession for his brother, and meant to keep it—there were a great many people in the bakehouse—there were two coal-porters, who I noticed particularly, with fantail hats—I asked them what they did there, and they said, they were invited there by Mr. Robert Stanford, and they meant to have a good <hi rend="italic">lark</hi>—there were twenty or thirty people in the house, who had principally got sticks in their hands—they were all <hi rend="italic">larking</hi>—there was no drinking till about six—I saw a good deal of beer come in—there was smoking, quarrelling, and fighting—I saw all the defendants there in the course of the evening—I called a policeman, and asked him to take Edwin in cus<lb></lb>tody—he said he could not unless he came outside the door, and he saw the peace broken—they were singing up to one in the morning, when they could not get any more beer—when I left there then were four or five there—I asked them to go, and they laughed at me—before I put in the distress, the three defendants, another brother, and Mr. Garret were there, and Mr. Garret said, "I am executor, but I shall not act; here are the sons, I shall not administer"—I asked Robert if he was in a position to take his father's business, as I only wanted the 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. rent which was owing, and he said he most decline as he had no money—I offered it to the two others, and they each declined—I then told the broker to take an account of the goods.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an appraiser, at Sussex-place, Old Kent-road. On Monday, 3rd Feb., I met Mr. Hussey at 12, Church-street, which is in the parish of Greenwich—Henry Stanford and his sister were there, and a few minutes after Mr. Garret and Robert and Edwin Stanford came—I heard Mr. Hussey ask Robert if be thought he could carry on the business; he said he could not, he had got no money—he put the same question to Edwin and Henry; they declined it—Mr. Hussey asked Garret whether he would have anything to do with it—he said, decidedly not; there was too much money owing on the estate, and Mr. Hussey had better take possession—there was an arrangement made when Henry was present, that we should send in flour, and Mary Ann was to carry on the business and pay the wages, which was done every day—I then, with Mr. Garret's consent, ordered Henry off the premises—Mr. Garret left, and Mr. Hussey, myself, my man, and Mary Ann Stanford, as our servant, were left in possession—I left my brother in possession—I went on the 8th to condemn the goods—they were offered to Mary Ann and one of the defendants, I believe Edwin, who came in at the time, and they declined to have any<lb></lb>thing to do with it—Mr. Hussey paid Mr. Garret and Mary Ann Stan<lb></lb>ford 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a check and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver—Mr. Garret handed the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Mary Ann—Mr. Garret then ordered two of the defendants and Mary Ann to walk out—they did so—Mr. Garret then went out, and said to Mr. Hussey, "Now you can take possession," and left me and Mr. Hussey there alone—on the 10th I went at nine o'clock at night, found the house full of people, eating, drinking, and smoking, and a mob of about 100 to 250 people outside, shouting out to turn our people out of pos<lb></lb>session—I saw the three defendants there, and asked Robert what he was doing there—he said he had got an invitation to a tea-party, and it would be a good while before we should turn him out again—I cannot swear to the precise words he used—Edwin said presently they would turn us out—there were twenty or thirty people inside the house, having gin and beer, with cans and pots—I asked the three defendants to go out, and told them if they had any claim, there was a legal way to obtain it, and they had no right to force their way in—when I first went, the parties outside said, "Here comes the b—Jew broker; leave him to us, we will <hi rend="italic">settle</hi> him."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a house agent, 14, Canterbury-place, Old Kent-road. On 3rd Feb., I went with my brother to 12, Church-street, Greenwich—a distress was put in for rent, and I remained in possession under the distress till the 8th, when the goods were valued—I saw Mr. Hussey pay Mr. Garret, and Mary Ann Stanford 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver, and a 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. check, and Garret gave Mr. Hussey possession, and they all left—my assistant, Mr. Hussey, a gentleman of the name of White, and myself were then left in the house—I returned the same night, and remained in possession partially with the man Naylor all Sunday, till the Monday, on which day between one and two o'clock, a gentleman came, knocked, and said he came from Mr. Hussey to look at the premises—I showed him over the house, let him out, and he went right away, and while I was at the door Edwin Stanford came up, and said, "How are you getting on?"—I said, "I do not know; after the old sort"—I was going to turn to go in when he was coming in as well, and I said, "What do you want?"—he said, "I am coming in"—I said, "No; you are not coming in here; you have no right here," and I took hold of the door to shut ft, and he pushed against me—Henry came up directly, and they forced me into the house—when Henry came up, I told him not to come in at all, he had no right there—I tried to prevent their getting in by putting one hand up against them, and I had hold of the door with, the other, and they forced their way past me by putting their hands against me—they pushed me away altogether—they said they had taken possession for their brother, Robert, and should remain there—I tried to shut the door, but could not for the mob outside forcing against the door—Edwin called out to the mob, "Come in here and assist me, I am turned out of possession; the broker has taken all the goods away from us on Saturday, and we mean to keep pos<lb></lb>session till my brother Robert comes," and twenty or thirty people came in to all parts of the house, and Edwin said they should certainly retain pos<lb></lb>session—after the mob came in he said he would turn me out directly his brother Robert came—he said if they were turned out at the front they should certainly break in at the back, they had a right to be there—he said that a great many times—Robert came in the evening and remained there all night—Mr. Hussey came between four and five in the afternoon, and I told him what had happened—the parties inside were drinking, smoking, and quarrelling—there were 200 or 300 outside on both sides of the way, calling to those inside that they would come in, saying, "Turn the b—out; we will do for him."</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 14, Thomas-street, Greenwich—I gave evidence before the Magistrate—on 10th Feb. I went with Edwin Stan<lb></lb>ford to the shop in Church-street, there was no one with us—Peter Wickes, the man in possession, was standing there, and Edwin said to him "How are you getting on?"—he said, "Oh! very well"—Edwin said, "I have come to look at the old shop once more"—he stood on one side; Edwin walked in, and I followed him; there was no violence used towards Wickes—Wickes did not at all resist our going in; Edwin walked round the counter and said he had come to take possession by order of his brother Robert—Wickes said, I shall acquaint Mr. Hussey as soon as he comes—in about five minutes, Edwin told me to take the shutters down—they had been up some days, but the shop had been kept open by the father some years—there might have been ten or twelve people outside—there was no disturbance made by them or violent language used—bread was brought into the house and sold—Mr. Hussey came about five; a great number of people got in in the evening; but I did not see any vio<lb></lb>lence or fighting, only when Callaghan asked Mr. Wickes for his money—I remained there by the treaty, and did not leave till next morning.</p>

I was in Church-street, at Stanford's door, and saw Edwin and Acton come up and go into the house—there was no violence used towards Wickes, they seemed on friendly terms—Stanford said, "How are you getting on old man?"—he said "All right," Stanford said, "We are coming to look at the old shop once more," and Mr. Wickes followed them in—there were not above three or four persons congregated then, more came after the police came.</p>

On the 10th of Feb., between twelve and one o'clock at night, I was at the Globe and Friends, in Morgan-street, Com<lb></lb>mercial-road—I was sober—as I was coming out, Wilmot struck me with his fist—I did not know him before—I had seen him in the tap-room pre<lb></lb>viously—he came in about a little before twelve—we had had no dispute—I never exchanged a word with him—I was not knocked down by that blow—the landlord ordered the prisoners to be turned out for using bad language, after striking me—Hind, the potman, was turning them out, and as soon as they were outside they struck him—I did not see that—he came in and told me—about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after, I went to go outside to the watering-place, and I saw the prisoners standing at the door—I went up to Wilmot to ask him the reason why he struck me—I had not got the words quite out of my mouth before White struck me on the forehead with some weapon, but I cannot say what it was exactly—it was not his fist—I fell to the ground—I got up again, and laid hold of White, to try to see for the weapon—I was looking round to see if any assistance</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. Bridges wae brought to the hospital a little before two o'clock on the Monday morning—he was bleeding profusely from a wound above the left brow, about an inch in extent—at the bottom of the wound in the scalp, a portion of the bone was depressed to about the extent of one-sixth of an inch—there was a fracture of the bone—a portion of it was driven in—there was another wound superficial at the top of the forehead—it was not a cut, merely a bruise; he was perfectly sensible, with the exception of being apparently slightly drowsy—he did not appear to me in liquor—it is difficult in these cases to judge accurately, but he answered rationally to every question that was put to him—he has not quite recovered yet—there is a slight portion of the bone to come away—none has yet come away—I did not consider him in danger, or suppose it would terminate fatally, but in the progress of these cases there always may be danger—this was rather an extraordinary case, there was hardly any symptom indicative of injury to the bone, which generally characterises such injuries—he was in the hospital I think about four or five weeks.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Cross-street, Morgan-street. The Globe and Friends is a corner house in both streets—I never use it, and have no connection with either of the parties—between one and two o'clock I was in bed, and heard a noise, which caused me to open my window and look out—I saw Lyons, the policeman, and the pot-boy, having a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> together—the pot-boy said that either White or Wilmot had struck him in the mouth with a stone in a handkerchief—Lyons said, "I saw nothing of it, I will have nothing to do with it"—Hinds said directly, "I will make you, I will force you"—they got nearly to high words—the policeman then left—all was quiet for three quarters of an hour after that—I laid down again—I heard a noise down the streets, "Here the b—s are! here the b—s are!"—I heard Hinds whistling, and Bridges was singing, "<hi rend="italic">Tol de rol lol</hi>," and with them about twelve or fourteen wh—, or more—I saw them run right down the street—Hinds had a poker in his hand, and Bridges was on the right side of him—Wilmot and White at that time were at the door of Mr. Whitfield's house, I believe—I do not know whe<lb></lb>ther they live there—they were all strangers to me—I saw Bridges rush up against the door as if to burst it open—it was nearly closed—he got in between the door as it was closing—the pot-boy came up with the poker, and struck three or four heavy blows at the door, and I heard Bridges halloo out, "I am cut"—with that the pot-boy ran away with the poker to the Globe and Friends—Bridges came staggering out into the road, and one of the girls caught him in her arms, and dragged him opposite my house—he cried, "I am faint, go fetch a doctor"—they then took him round the corner, leaving four or five girls in the road—the prisoners tried to escape into the house—they got as far as the passage, and the mob rushed up together into the house—it appeared to me as if the prisoners were trying to close the door against the people outside—the pot-boy was near to Bridges when he made the blows at the door with the poker, and I am sure some of the blows hit Bridges, for the blood was on the outside of the door, which shows it was done from the outside—a person named Lazarus, who lives next door to me, put his foot to the door to try to stop it from being closed—he cried, "Police," and sprung a rattle, which caused the policeman to come.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. After I was paid that day, I drank more than I should have done; I know nothing about the boots; I found myself the next morning in jail all over dirt; I have served his Majesty fourteen years.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three serjeants, and a corporal, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Swift.) Q. Did the prisoner run like a drunken man? - A. No; he ran very fast, and very strait, and if he had not slipped, I don't think I should have overtaken him; after he was taken he pretended to be drunk.</p>

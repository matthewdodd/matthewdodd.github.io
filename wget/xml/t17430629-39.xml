            . I live in the New-Change in Rag-Fair; on the 30th of May, I got up between three and four in the Morning, and saw the three Prisoners bringing this Pot to Sarah Green's Door; they went by Nick-Names then; one was called Doctor, another Blueskin, and the other Cock-Eye: I stepped over to them; says Hudson, we have been moving Mrs Green's Goods, and as you are a Bricklayer, if you can get her a Chap for this Pot she will be obliged to you; I asked the Price, and he said 17 s. said I 17 s. is too dear; on Thursday sen'night, I went to Mr Rowe's, and Mrs Rowe said, she wished they were hanged that had stole her Copper; and wanted to buy one; I told her I had seen such a Thing, which is to be sold; I went with Mrs Rowe to Mrs Green's, and asked her if she had such a Thing to dispose of? yes, said she, I have; she took 8 s. to the Pawnbroker's, and fetched it out, and paid 2 d. for the Use; Mrs Rowe, as she was founding it, said, this is my Kettle, it cost me a Golden Guinea; they agreed for 12 s. and my Mistress gave 6 d. Earnest: I went to Justice Jones, and got a Warrant against the Prisoners, and against Sarah Green; she was charged with an Officer, and it is thought he had a Bribe to let her go.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say that is the Pot you saw between three and four in the Morning, in the Prisoners Custody ?</p>
               <p>Butler. Yes, I can safely take my Oath of it, with a clear Conscience; here is a particular Mark upon it; here is a Bulge in the Side, and a Flaw in the Rim; there is not one Pot in five Thousand more remarkable; I examined it, when they asked me the 17 s. for it; I saw it upon Hudson's Head that Morning; he went then by the Name of Cock Eye; Hudson was the Person who offered it to Sale, and the rest were officious in saying it was worth so much; I saw it in all their Hands.</p>
               <p>Hudson. I never saw the Man in my Life.</p>
               <p>Butler. I have seen him a great many Times; there are so many of them, that a Man cannot come along Day or Night, but he is liable to be knock'd down; I have seen Hudson frequently picking of Pockets.</p>

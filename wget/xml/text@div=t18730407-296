                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner.</hi>) I have pleaded guilty to this charge of stealing 600 ostrich feathers from Messrs. Blundell &amp; Son, my employers—I was with them about twelve months—I first began to take these ostrich feathers about last August—I know the prisoner Green, she carries on business at Granada-Terrace, Commercial Road, as an ostrich feather manufacturer—after having inquired of Mr. Watson, I went to the prisoners' place with ten ostrich feathers; I believe I saw her; I offered them for sale—she asked if they were my own, I said they were; she asked whether it was all right, I said "Yes"—she said she would buy them of me—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187304070048"></xptr>
               <p>she did not ask me how I got them, she simply asked if they were my own; she gave 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—she asked me how much they were; she gave me half what I asked—she said "What do you want for them?"—I told her I wanted 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; she said she could not give so much for them, they were not worth it, she could not give more than 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I consented to take that and she gave it me—she asked if I should have any more; I said "No"—I then left—I went there again about a fortnight afterwards, and took her some more feathers, I don't recollect how many; she did not seem at all surprised at seeing me again—I told her I had some more feathers for sale, and I offered them to her at a price—I don't recollect how much, she did not pay me near what I asked; I sold them to her—she told me, on one or two occasions, that whenever I had any others she would be most happy to buy them—I went, then, about a dozen times altogether between August and March, I sold her some on each occasion; I sold her 500 or 600 altogether, between August and March; she gave me about one-fifth of the value—I repeatedly went there in a cab; on one occasion she asked me not to have the cab driven up to the door, because she did not like it—on the first occasion she said they were not fresh feathers, and I owned that—she asked me for my address, and I wrote down an address; it was not my true one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> That was on the first occasion—I gave "Johnson, Nelson Square, Peckham"—that was a lie; I did not wish her to know where I really, came from—I did not wish her to know I was a thief—I don't recollect telling her I had come from New York—I would not swear I did not—she told me the feathers were damaged—I don't recollect telling her they were damaged by sea-water on my coming from New York—I will not swear I did not—I believe it is very common for sailors to bring ostrich feathers from abroad, and sell them in small parcels—I generally saw her daughter in the shop—the first time I went must have been earlier than December, it might not be so early as August—I did not go anywhere else—I did not sell feathers to anybody else—I went to Mr. Watson; he is a feather-dealer—I asked him if he would buy those feathers—he said he was not accustomed to buy these sort of things—Mr. Watson lives in John Street, Sidney Square, Commercial Road, that is very close to Mrs. Green's—I told him they were my own property—that was a lie—I was dressed respectably, as I am now—I took ten the first time—I can't recollect the greatest number of feathers I took to Mrs. Green at one time; at a rough guess it should say about seventy—I used to take them out of the warehouse, taking care that nobody should see me; I took them from the general stock—I used to put them in different parts of my person, sometimes in my hat, sometimes in my pocket, and some<lb></lb>times about my body, in my waistcoat—that would not improve the feathers, it would take the curl out of them; that would in one respect destroy their value, but not particularly, not to the extent of a shilling each, not more than sixpence; some of them would require to be cleaned and recurled, they were always in the same condition—I am 19 years old—I have been a thief since last August; I have been a liar on these occasions—I should say I sold her about 600 feathers—I have heard my master say he has lost 600; that is what I am charged with—every one I took I sold to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I was not always dressed in the same clothes, but in the same style—I was never dressed as a sailor—I did not take the feathers to her in my hat, I always took them in a parcel.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Messrs. Blundell and Co., of 35, St. Paul's Churchyard—Burchett was in our employ—we have missed ostrich feathers from our stock, we began to miss them about twelve months since—on 15th March he was taken into custody, and he made a communication about Mrs. Green—in consequence of that a search warrant was obtained at the Thames Police Court, and I went with Potts and another officer to Green's house; we saw the daughter first, and saw the prisoner a few minutes afterwards—Potts asked her if she had been buying some feathers of a young man, describing Burchett—she at first hesitated and considered, and then she said she thought she had, once or twice; it is impossible for me to detail all she said—one of the statements was that she bought them of a young man who said they were damaged in coming from New York; another was that she had his name and address—she said she had only bought one or two lots; I don't think she named the numbers in the lots—I stayed in the shop while the officers went up stairs, they brought down a box containing between 200 and 300 feathers—I had some doubt about them and sent for Mr. Watson—there must have been 2,000 feathers in the house altogether, about 600 of those were similar to those we had lost—they were not damaged at all; some of them were not in very good condition, not in a saleable condition, it would require a slight outlay before they were fit for sale; they could be recurled for about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a dozen, 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a piece would make them saleable again—we missed 179 feathers from one particular line—I found 117 at Mrs. Green's, identical in appearance with those—she men<lb></lb>tioned twenty or twenty-one feathers that she had bought a fortnight or three weeks previously—she said she thought she had given about 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them; they cost us about 41.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I sent for Mr. Watson because I have no practical knowledge of feathers myself, and I wanted someone conversant with the trade—when I say they are our property, I am speaking in a great measure from his opinion—I should have been able to give a decided opinion if I had compared them with those I had in the warehouse—I don't know whether Mr. Watson buys his feathers of Mr. Gougenheim; very likely he does—Mr. Gougenheim is a large merchant—the prisoner appeared very ill when I spoke to her—Burchett had stated in a general way that he had sold them considerably under their value—it was from her that I first learnt the price she had given him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs.

Blundell in February—I had my atten<lb></lb>tion particularly called to 21—the whole line they were taken from cost me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a feather—that was what I paid for them—14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. would not be anything like a fair price for them—they appeared as if they had been</p>

               <p>through some process to take the curl out—the stems had been cut, but by what process I am not able to state—they might be worth about 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. less per feather—I don't know whether the 117 feathers were the average of the line, but the line of 648 feathers cost me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and I sold them to Messrs.

I said "I should think any respectable milliner in the Commercial Road would buy them, such as Mrs. Sheils, Mr. Young, or Mrs. Green;" I think I referred him to four—he said "I will go and see"—I have not been to Mrs. Sheil's or Mr. Young's since.</p>

On 17th March I went with a search warrant to Green's house, with Mr. Ridley and Holliday, another officer—I saw the prisoner's daughter, and inquired for Mrs. Green—she said she was up stairs—I asked the prisoner if she had bought any ostrich feathers of a young man named Burchett, describing the prisoner—she said "No!"—I said "Do you remember a circumstance occurring, that he drove up in a cab on one occasion, and your requesting him not to do so again, because you did not like anyone to come up in a cab?"—she said "No!"—after a little hesitation she said she remembered buying some once or twice—I asked her when the last time was that she bought any—she said "About a fortnight or three weeks last Thursday or Friday"—I asked how many he brought, and what she gave for them—she said he brought about twenty or twenty-one, and she gave 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., she could not say which—she had not mentioned any others before that—I told her I should search her place; I believed she had more feathers than that, and I pro<lb></lb>ceeded to search her place—after searching a portion of the shop, she said to her daughter, "Annie, they are up stairs in a box!"—I and the daughter went up stairs into the front room, first floor, a bedroom—I found a box containing a large quantity of feathers, and among them I found these, which Mr. Watson identified as a portion of those he had sold—I think over 200—the daughter pointed the box out to me—it was a paper box, wrapped up in a handkerchief—I took possession of the feathers that were identified, and left, as the prisoner seemed ill—she was making a lot of statements all the time we were there, an hour and three-quarters; she was talk ing all the time, and making different statements about the young man com ing there and saying they were damaged by sea water; that she did not think he was so wicked as to steal the things, and so on—next morning I went there again—I told her she would have to go to the station, as she was charged with receiving these feathers and others—she then said "I do remember the young man coming in a cab, and I told him not to come up"—I asked her if she had any books or invoices, and one was produced, I think, of November, 1872, and one of January, this year—those were all—I asked if she had any books—she said No, she never kept any looks—she said she had asked the young man for his address, and he gave</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I was obliged to come on shore, and were the captain and the people here they would say so; it was from the last ship. I was taken off the coach box of the Exeter coach; I was coming to surrender myself to the Justice, in hopes of finding mercy; when I was taken they found nothing on me: my Lord, I plead guilty.</p>
               <p>Court. If this man was not active I would report him accordingly; let a letter be written to the Captain, who is now at Exeter, to enquire into his behaviour.</p>

               <p>Court to Prisoner. I will take your plea, and enquire into the circumstances of your case before I report you to the King.</p>

               <p>John Phipp. I came from Baldock in Hertfordshire, and being at my Inn, in St. John-street, I was told that the Prisoner wanted to speak with me, and that he was a vast rich Man, and kept a matter of three hundred Horses. I spoke to him, and he appointed to meet me next Morning, about nine a Clock, at the Leg-Tavern in Fleet-street: But he did no great matters there, for he had a Mind to go somewhere else. So coming along Fleetstreet, he called to a Man, You, you, I want to speak with ye: I must have a hundred Pound of you on Monday Morning. Sir, said the Man, you shall have it. So we came to the <placeName id="t17340227-54-crimeloc239">Crown Tavern in Smithfield</placeName>

There was three other Men with him, though I don't know whether they went in with him, or came to him soon after. But before he went in, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173402270019"></xptr> sent a Man with a Letter to his House in Fleet-Lane. And these three Men pretended to be the Prisoner's Servants. And one of them said to him; Sir, I must have six score Pounds to pay your Workmen. And said the Prisoner, I han't so much about me, but here's a bill of fourscore Pounds. Then another of the Men laid down nine or ten Guineas. But the first Man said that would not do. And upon that the Prisoner desired me to lend him some Money to make it up, and he said I should have it again by six a Clock that Night. So I lent him ten Guineas; but his head Man said that was not enough. I had seven Guineas and ten Shilings more in my hand; and the Prisoner sitting next to me he claw'd the Money from me.</p>
               <p>Court. Now you are come to the Point. Tell us in what Manner he took it ? You say he claw'd the Money from you. Explain what you mean by that.</p>
               <p>Phipp. I held the Money in my Hand, thus, and he pulled it out.</p>
               <p>Court. You saw him take it?</p>
               <p>Phipp. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he take it by violence, whether you would or no, or did you consent to it?</p>
               <p>Phipp. I can't say there was Violence neither; nor I can't say that I rightly consented : But he took it out of my hand, that he did.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you complain to any Body that he had robb'd you ?</p>
               <p>Phipp. No, I can't say that.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you think you were robbed?</p>
               <p>Phipp. I can't say rightly that I did; for I thought he would have paid me again; because I had heard he was such a vast rich Man.</p>
               <p>Court. How long did he stay after he had got your Money?</p>
               <p>Phipp. They all slipt away presently, in three or four Minutes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What did you about this when you came to your Inn?</p>
               <p>Phipp. Nothing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Had you any Note for the Money, or for any part of it?</p>
               <p>Phipp. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you go again to the same Tavern, that Night.</p>
               <p>Phipp. Indeed I can't tell if I were to die.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was you drunk?</p>
               <p>Phipp. No, I was not drunk. - When the Prisoner was at the Leg, he sent a Porter for his Comrades.</p>

            . I am Porter at the Leg-Tavern. A Man who was drinking there with the Prosecutor sent me with a Note to a Brandy-Shop in Fleet-Lane; and the Woman at the Brandy-Shop sent me to an Inn in St. John Street. The Landlady there said the Gentleman was not there, but if he came, she would send him to the Leg. In my way back, I called again at the Brandy-shop, where I heard that the Person had been there, and was gone to our House. I went directly home, and presently a Man came in and went to the Room where the Prosecutor was. There was then four in Company; I think the Prisoner was one of them, and they all went away together.</p>
               <p>Phipp. You would know him better, if he pulled off his Gown and his Wig, and put on the dress he was in at your House.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never saw Phipp in my life, 'till I was carried before Alderman Brocas; and there a Man said to him, Do as I bid you, or you'll never get your Money.</p>

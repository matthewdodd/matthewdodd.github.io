I am a commission-agent, of 3, William-street, North, Stepney—on 25th March, about 2 o'clock in the night, I was passing through Lincoln's-inn-fields towards home—the prisoner spoke to me about thirty yards from Turnstile—I had never seen him before to my knowledge—he said, "I want some money?"—I took no notice—he followed me, and said, "I want some money, and I must have it"—I turned round, and said, "If you annoy me, I will give you in charge"—he said, "I shall stick to you; I want two shillings, and I must have it"—he did not touch me, nor did I touch him at all—he said several times, "I shall stick to you," and followed me some distance into Holborn—I said, "Now mind, I shall give you in charge as soon as I meet a policeman"—I met one, and gave him in charge—he made no statement in my hearing—I was quite sober—the prisoner appeared intoxicated when I said I should give him in charge—he charged me at the station-house with having used an expression about a girl.</p>

On the morning of 25th March, I was on duty at twenty minutes to 2 o'clock in High Holborn, and met the prosecutor and prisoner walking together—the prosecutor said he wished to give the prisoner in charge for attempting to extort two shillings from him coming through Lincoln's-inn-fields—I took the prisoner—the prose<lb></lb>cutor was quite sober—the prisoner was slightly the worse for drink, but understood what he was about—when we got to the station, the prisoner said that he was going home to Gray's-inn-lane, and was stopped by the prosecutor, who put his hand under the crutch of his leg, and wanted to take indecent liberties with him—as he was leaving the dock he said, that he wished the prosecutor paralized before morning—the prosecutor was there at the time, he went with us to the station.</p>

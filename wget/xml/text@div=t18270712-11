On the 30th of April I was at Newgate-market, and had Newton, my servant, with me there; I passed the City toll-bar at Barbican, with my cart that morning, and saw Payne, the toll-gatherer, there; he knew me very well; I pay him my toll once a week. When I got to the market I left my cart, with the mare in it, in <placeName id="t18270712-11-crimeloc74">Newgate-street</placeName>

My name and address were on the cart, and the number; it was drawn by a bay mare, a very good one, and worth 40l. - value of the meat was 10l., and the cart 20l. I went to the Green-yard, to see for it, but it was not there; I then advertized it, offering 10l. reward - I saw it again in five weeks all but two days afterwards, at Somers' livery-stable, Lambeth. I do not know the prisoner, and never authorized him to take the mare and cart any where - he was a perfect stranger. I afterwards attended at Guildhall, with the same mare and cart, which was shown to the different witnesses.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Have you any partner? A. No. I left home before six o'clock, and arrived at the market a quarter past six; the market was not very full; there were several carts there, but not so many as usual; business was very slack just at that time; it was on Monday morning, the 30th of April; I had left Newton, my lad, in the cart, but he left it to come to me, by my order. I pay my City toll once a week, on a Saturday generally.</p>

            . On the 30th of April I went to market with my master, and while he was in the shop, paying for some meat, he sent me to Mr. Hailes, which was about two minutes walk; I left the cart alone, and when I came back it was gone.

            . I am collector of City toll at the corner of Barbican. I know Francis' cart and mare well; he passed me with them on the 30th of April, between five and six o'clock: I saw the cart and mare come back about a quarter past nine o'clock; the prisoner was in the cart. I ran up to take my toll, but seeing the name on the cart I went back, as I take that toll once a week; I am sure the prisoner is the man. I heard of the robbery afterwards, and told Francis - I knew the cart and mare well' I used to drive her once a week myself, and am certain it is the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you always said you knew the prisoner? A. Yes; he stood upright in the cart. The man and the master usually drive it.</p>

            , who is a labouring man. On the 30th of April we lived at Mr. Heath's, No.4, Coronation-place, Borough-road; on that day, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner drove a cart and horse to our door - I took notice of the cart and the horse also; I did not see the name on the cart. The prisoner brought some meat in, and asked me to let him leave it there - I gave him leave; I cannot say how much there was; it was mutton, beef, and veal; there was a great quantity of it: the prisoner went away with the cart and mare. Mrs. Heath afterwards saw the meat. The meat was afterwards taken away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is your husband? A. He is not right in his head now, and is in Newington poorhouse - I also live there. I do not rightly know the day of the month when this happened. I was subpoenaed to come here about three weeks ago; I had one room at Heath's - my husband was not there. I am sure the prisoner is the man; I saw letters outside the cart, but cannot read, and cannot tell the name. I have seen the cart twice since, and have rode in it once; I am sure it is the same cart by the make of it and the gilt letters. I do not swear to it from having rode in it.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Who had the meat away? A. John Judson. I was called on to give evidence about him the next day or day after that. I saw the cart and mare at Guildhall, and am certain they are the same.</p>

             - he is a horse-dealer. Cox lodged at our house; I remember on the 30th of April the prisoner came to the door with a cart and mare; I saw G. F. on the back of the cart, in yellow letters, but I did not see what was in front - I only saw it from my first floor window; I saw the meat taken into the house, by the prisoner and other persons, but who I cannot say. There was a crock and steak piece of beef, a leg of mutton, and two hind quarters and a leg of veal.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you a butcher's wife? A. My first husband was a butcher. I was standing at the window; I do not think I saw Cox. I saw the prisoner giving the meat out of the cart. I have been examined seven times in all about this. The officer came to me the same day as it was brought. I was examined at Union-hall - that was before the cart was found. The mare and cart were produced at Guildhall.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you know the mare at Guildhall? A. Yes; I have no doubt of the mare, the cart, or the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a porter. On Monday, the last day in April, I saw a cart against the pin manufactory in the London-road - it stood there about twenty minutes. I saw the name of "George Francis, Wells-row, Islington" on it, and there was G. F. in a cypher, behind, in yellow letters; there was a mare in it. I did not see what was inside the cart; it was moved from there, and I saw it again in the Borough-road; I had not seen any body drive it away. I saw the prisoner get into it at the pin manufactory, and am certain of him. I had seen him once or twice before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where had you seen him? A. At the Dog and Still public-house, close against where the cart and horse stood. I had not heard of any robbery; it stood there so long different people were noting. I went round to see the name on it, but did not look inside.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you see the same cart and mare at Guildhall? A. Yes, about a month ago.</p>

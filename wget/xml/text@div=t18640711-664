                  </hi>. I am a solicitor in Rood-lane, and am a London Com<lb></lb>missioner for taking affidavits—previously to the present year I had known the prisoner—I knew him when he was a clerk at Mr. Holloway's, who was a client of the firm in which I was a partner—he used to bring letters from Mr. Holloway and take answers back—on 20th May he called upon me with Mr. Sack, and produced this deed and an affidavit, and he asked me as a London Commissioner to swear Mr. Sack to the affidavit—he asked me at the same time if I would have any objection to attest Mr. Sack's signature to this deed as an attorney—I asked him if Mr. Sack had any other solicitor—he said that there was no other solicitor employed, and knowing something of him, I did not object to attest the execution of the deed by Mr. Sack—the deed was not then in the same condition as it is now with reference to the word Becker, Mr. Becker had not then executed the deed, and the words, "Philip Becker and," were struck out of the attesting clause in my office, and I attested the name of Sack—the initials here A. C. are not in my handwriting—I did not give the prisoner or any other person any authority to affix those initials—the name here, "Anthony Carr," is not my handwriting—my name appears here in two places in which it has not been written by me—this is not my handwriting (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Deed or instrument referred to in the affidavit marked with the letter A made before me, this 30th day of May, 1864, Anthony Carr, Commissioner for administering affidavits in Courts of Chancery,"—this writing on the back is not mine either—from the day I attested the deed I never saw it again till now, and I did not see the defendant again until the Registrar of the Court of Bankruptcy made an official communication to me—the signature "Anthony Carr," to this affidavit marked B, is not my handwriting, nor has it been affixed with my authority—this signature to the certificate underneath the schedule is not my handwriting (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Bankruptcy Act of 1861, Philip Becker and Her<lb></lb>manu Sack, carrying on business at 38, Endell-street, Bloomsbury, provision merchants, make oath and say as follows," <hi rend="italic">it purported to be signed by Philip Becker and Hermann Sack, and the attesting clause was as follows:</hi> "Sworn by both the deponents at my office, 25, Rood-lane, in the City of London, this 2d day of June, 1864, before me, Anthony Carr, a Commissioner for administering oaths in Chancery.")</p>

Q.</hi> That which has just been read is not the affidavit which the prisoner brought when he brought this deed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is not—I only swore one of the parties to the deed; it would be altered accordingly—it is a short form of deed in compliance with the provisions of the 192d sec. of the Act—I compared it with the copy—the prisoner read the original, and I took the copy—I made the alterations in the copy—I think the prisoner altered the attesting clause—he struck out Becker's name in the deed, and I did it in the copy—it is not an ordinary thing for a person to bring another to swear to a composition deed—I only know of one case before this in my experience—I was appointed just after 1861—composition deeds are very common now—there were a great many signatures attached to this deed when it was brought to me—I could not say whether these names were all there then—the majority of them were certainly, if not all—such affidavits as these require to state the amount of assets; if the prisoner had made a mistake, and not set out the assets, and had come back and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186407110014"></xptr>
               <p>altered it, I should, probably, not have charged him, if it had been on the same day, I should have excused the fee—the fee is very small, one shilling and sixpence for each oath administered—the signature to this affidavit is very unlike mine—they are both very unlike my signatures—I think it re<lb></lb>sembles the writing of the body of the document—it is desirable to have the creditors' names on the face of the deed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registrar in the Court of Bankruptcy, and am at the bar—I remember the prisoner coming to my office in Quality-court—I believe it was on 27th May—he brought me a deed, which I believe to be this one, but I had not occasion to look at it—he brought me this one again on a subsequent occasion—I find here, "Philip Becker," struck out, and subsequently "Philip Becker" added—there is a seal opposite each name—it would appear as the deed now stands, that it had been executed by Becker and Sack—the initials A. C. are immediately over the P in Philip—I returned the deed on 27th May, and subsequently kept it—on that day the prisoner brought to me a registration-stamp of ten shillings, and an affidavit verifying a deed which I believe to be this deed; immediately on his presenting to me the papers, I noticed that there was a blank where the amount of property distributable under the deed ought to have been inserted, and I drew his attention to that fact, and told him that I could not take the papers, that it would be necessary for him to have the amount filled in, and that the debtor should be taken to the commissioner, and the affidavit re-sworn—he took the papers away, and brought them to me again about ten minutes afterwards—I asked him whether that affidavit had been re-sworn, and he told me that it had—I asked him whether he had taken it to Mr. Carr, and, I believe, he first told me that he had done so—I reminded him that Mr. Carr resided at 25, Rood-lane, and that having regard to the distance between Quality-court and Rood-lane he would not have had time to have gone there and returned, and I also brought to his notice the fact that the ink was not dry—he then said that he had by accident met Mr. Carr at the law stationer's in Quality-court—that the amount had been inserted in the affidavit, and that the insertion had been initialled by Mr. Carr—I noticed that the initials A.C. were placed in the margin immediately opposite the alteration—as there was no evidence on the face of the affidavit that it had been re-sworn I returned it to the prisoner for the purpose of having it re-sworn—I gave him back the deed, and he took all the papers that he had brought—he came again to me a day or two afterwards, and brought the affidavit, which is the subject of this indictment, marked B—I believe this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this contains the statement as to the the amount of composition—I looked through all the papers which he brought with this, and found that they had the appearance of being correct—I noticed that the certificate, which appeared upon the copy deed, appeared to have been signed by Mr. Carr himself—this is it—"I hereby certify that the above is a true copy of the composition-deed, made by Philip Becker and Hermann Sack, of Endell-street, Blooms<lb></lb>bury, provision merchants, and I further attested the said deed as their</p>

               <p>solicitor. Anthony Carr." The copy corresponds with the original—it would appear to have been executed by Becker as well as by Sack—the documents the prisoner brought were technically correct—I compared the signature to the exhibit, which appeared on the copy-deed, with the signature of Mr. Carr at the foot of this certificate, and they appeared to be in the same handwriting—I then asked the defendant whether the name of Anthony Carr, which purported to be only a copy of his signature to the exhibit on the original deed, was in Mr. Carr's handwriting, and he told me that it was—I then asked him if he understood my question, as I told him it was most unusual for the solicitor signing the certificate to sign also the copy exhibit—then he told me that they were all in the handwriting of Mr. Carr—I believe I then showed him every signature, and asked him whether he was certain that all of them were in Mr. Carr's handwriting, pointing to them one by one, and he told me they were—I then impounded the deeds—I saw the defendant five or six times altogether.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The affidavit that was presented on the first occasion was returned to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the informality was, not having the amount of the composition—previous to 20th May, there was an order of the Court of Bankruptcy that the signature of the debtor should be attested by the solicitor—that was under the Act of Parliament—the recent order is, that deeds should be presented by a solicitor to the chief registrar—before that order, a great many deeds were presented by persons who were not solicitors, the debtors themselves occasionally—on an average from twelve to four<lb></lb>teen deeds a day are registered.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, in partnership with my father—some years ago, when the firm was Miller and Carr, the defendant was in the habit of coming to our office frequently; nearly every day—he was in the employment of Mr. Holloway, who was a client of ours—I became acquainted with the defendant's handwriting, and I know Mr. Carr's handwriting—the initials, A. C, on this deed are not in the handwriting of Mr. Carr, but they are in the handwriting of the prisoner—the words, "Anthony Carr," on this part of the document are not in the hand<lb></lb>writing of Mr. Carr, but they are in the handwriting of the prisoner—this, "Anthony Carr, a commissioner for administering oath in the High Court of Chancery," is not in the handwriting of Mr. Carr, but it is in the handwriting of the prisoner—the whole of these others are in the handwriting of the prisoner.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

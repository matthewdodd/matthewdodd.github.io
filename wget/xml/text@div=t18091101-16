My dwelling house is over the shop; there is a communication with the shop and house. On Saturday the 3d of September, about five o'clock, I missed the iron axle tree from under the stairs, I had seen it there a few days before.

               <p>- THOMAS. On the 30th of September, in the evening, the prisoner came and asked me if I would buy an axletree; I told him I did not know, untill I saw it; he went and fetched it; I examined it, I said it was a good one; he asked half a guinea for it; I told the prisoner the axletree was worth more; if he would call upon me on Monday morning there was not the least doubt I could get him a pound for it; he left it. I made enquiries; Mr. Lane came to my house, he saw the axletree and claimed it. The prisoner came on the Monday morning, he asked me if I had sold it, I told him it was all right; I told him we would go and have something to drink. The constable was behind my counter ready to take him when he went out. On going into the public house the constable took him. I have had the axletree ever since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The box and the axletree cost fifty shillings, Common boxes are worth fourteen shillings; that is a patent one, I should think they are worth more.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Do you mean that the axletree in that state cost fifty shillings - A. No; with the boxes. I suppose it is worth forty shillings as it is without the boxes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

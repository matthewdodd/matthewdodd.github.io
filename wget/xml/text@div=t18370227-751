                  </hi>. I am in partnership with three other persons—we are importers and general dealers in Adelaide-street, Strand—the prisoner was in my service—he had rather more than 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I missed a great quantity of goods that could not be accounted for, and sent for the prisoner into the office—I said I had a strong suspicion he was robbing me, and desired him to shew what he had in his pocket—he produced a few needles—I was not satisfied—I sent to Bow-street and got an officer.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 26, Church-street, Soho. I received these bracelets from a person of the name of Miller—he came to my house with the prisoner, and asked me to have these three pairs of bracelets—I said, "I Don't want them at all"—the prisoner asked me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them, and then they wanted 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I knew Miller some time—we went to a public-house</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>In the month of June I was in London, on the 9th or 10th, the day when the blue children were shewn in St. Paul's Church-yard; I was walking up <placeName id="t17841020-80-crimeloc368">Ludgate-hill</placeName>

               <p>What reason have you for believing that the prisoner was the person that took your watch? - Because he was the only person that bore against me, and the most likely person I could think of.</p>
               <p>You did not see him have your watch? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor his hand at your pocket? - I felt a hand, and laid hold of it; I did not see it, I only felt it as he was working at me.</p>
               <p>Was that the prisoner's hand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Can you be sure it was the same hand that picked your pocket? - I am very clear it was.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He denied it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming through the mob, there were many people round him as well as me; I was not nigh him; he said he had lost his watch, I know nothing of it, I had no watch upon me.</p>

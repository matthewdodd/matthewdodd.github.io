            . I am a soldier in the Aberdeen militia. On the 31st of March, I saw the prisoner in Hay's room, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon; she sat down on Hay's bed. I saw the prisoner rise from Hay's bed, she put her feet on the bed to look out of the window; she said, it was rainy. Her hand then was near enough to the watch to take it, if she had been so disposed; I did not suspect it at the time that she had taken it.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MORRISON. I am a servant to Mr. Murray, pawnbroker, No. 99, East Smithfield. On the 31st of March, between six and seven in the evening, the prisoner pledged this watch; I had seen her person before; I knew her. On the next day it was claimed by Hay. This is the watch.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my watch.</p>

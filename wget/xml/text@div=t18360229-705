                  </hi>. I am a fishmonger, and live in the parish of St. Mary Cray, in Kent. I had a little cart and a pony mare for better than two years—she was a bay mare—on Friday, the 5th of February, I left the cart and mare in Thames-street, about seven o'clock in the morning, in the care of Sarah Manins, whom I had known of some years, and have been in the habit of leaving my cart and horse with before—I was absent nearly two hours—I returned about nine o'clock—I found the cart, and part of the harness there, but the pony was gone—I made inquiries about it, and on the next Tuesday fortnight I saw it at the office, after the policeman had taken it and the prisoner—I have known her well for four</p>

                  </hi>. I get my living by minding carts in the parish of St. Magnus the Martyr. I have known Venus eleven or twelve years—on the 5th of February he gave me the pony-cart to take care of in Thames-street it stood on the stand with many more—when he came back the pony was gone—the prisoner had come from Lower Thames-street, with a lad about twelve years old, at twenty minutes before nine—the lad had two parcels of broccoli—the prisoner went and lightened the boy of these two bundles, and put them on the window-still just where the cart and mare stood—the prisoner took the horse out of the cart—I asked him what he was going—to do with it—he said the horse was his—he unharness<lb></lb>ed the horse—, and then gave it to another person to hold while he went and put the broccoli on the boy again—I did not hear him call the horse by any name.</p>

No, he did not—he mounted on the horse, and made away—I thought that Mr. Venus might have brought him up along with him, and that it was his, he went so directly up to it—he took the harness off in a hurry.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Friday, the 5th of Febru<lb></lb>ary, about ten o'clock, I was told that Hawkins was about the neigh<lb></lb>bourhood with a horse that was supposed to be stolen—I made inquiry, and found it to be correct—about eleven o'clock I saw him riding the horse, and stopped him—I had known him before—this was at North-end Fulham—I questioned him about it to know how he came by it—he said that it was his own—I told him it was no such thing—he said it was the one his wife sold while he was in prison—I told him I knew better—I knew his pony was two inches higher than this one was—he had a pony somewhat resembling this—that was a mare, but it had one of its legs swollen—his wife sold it while he was in prison—he goes round about collecting bones and rags, and lives at North-end, Fulham.</p>

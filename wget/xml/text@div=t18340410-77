             (police-constable G 57). I took the prisoner - the prosecutor accused her of robbing him of 4l. - she denied it - I said she must go to the station-house, and when she got half-way up the street, I saw her put her hand into her bosom - I took her hand, and found in it these two sovereigns, this half-sovereign, and two quarter rupees, and in the scuffle of taking them from her hand I thought I heard something fall - I took her to the station-house, and came back to the spot, but could find nothing there - I went again at daylight, and found this other quarter of a rupee - the prisoner said, "You have lagged my Jem, and now I will go after him."</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It was not this officer who took me - it was Mr. Davis - he told me to ding the money into his hand - I was with the prosecutor a quarter of an hour, and he gave them to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Coroner for the City of London—I held an inquest on the body of Robert Atkins at Guy's Hospital—the prisoner attended there and gave evidence—I took down in writing the statement that he made—he gave it on oath voluntarily; he was put forward as a witness by the solicitor who represented him—(<hi rend="italic">Read.</hi> "<hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN BUTLER</hi>, cap<lb></lb>tain of the 'Confidence' billy-boy, of Boston,—Atkins was mate of that vessel; his name was Robert Atkins, his age from 40 to 50 years; being cautioned, says: 'I am willing to tell the Jury all I know about this. I left the vessel at Blackwall on Friday morning, December 6th; the water pilot was to bring the vessel up at the next flood tide, and she would get to London Bridge next morning about 5 o'clock. My wife was on board, Atkins, and Gilbert, and the pilot. I went on board the same evening, and the pilot left, &amp;c. At low water, about 1 or 2 in the morning, I saw Atkins again, when the vessel swung, his head was not hurt. We had then to haul in the ropes again; Atkins had not then got on deck; Gilbert was down below. I knocked Atkins up; he had not come up when I ran for<lb></lb>ward. As I ran forward I accidentally catched my foot against something and knocked it down the forecastle. The hatch was off; I kicked a piece of iron; it was not the poker. Atkins then sung out to me; he said 'You have hove a winch handle at me.' I had not done it. He came up out of the forecastle; he went down again. He said his head was bleeding. I went down and looked at it; it was bleeding. Gilbert was then in bed; I think he was asleep; he never spoke. I told my wife that his head was cut, and she went to him. I did not heave anything at Atkins at all; when I stumbled over the iron I did not see Atkins, he was in the forecastle. I did not throw anything down the forecastle to wake Atkins; he remained in the forecastle, and left next morning. I did all the work myself; then I went into the forecastle. I found a piece of iron that had been a marling<lb></lb>spike that had been on deck, and that, I think was what I kicked. <hi rend="italic">By the Jury.</hi>—There is a combing about 5 inches deep. The piece of iron weighed, perhaps, 2 lbs."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The verdict was that the deceased died from the injury, but that there was not sufficient evidence to enable the Jury to say how that injury was occasioned.</p>

                  </hi>. I was house-surgeon at Guy's Hospital on 13th December, when the deceased was brought there—he had a suppurating wound on the left parietal bone, an inch and a half in length and half an inch in width—the bone itself was contused and inflamed—the skull was not fractured—the scalp was raised towards the middle line of the skull—in the evening he became delirious, and, on the following Tuesday, he was trephined—if he could be said to have a chance at all, that was the only chance—he afterwards died—the cause of death was inflammation of the membranes of the brain, the result of a blow with a blunt instrument—I think it must have been a blow either with an instrument held in the hand,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187302030096"></xptr>
               <p>Or shortly after it left the hand; from the position and character of the wound—it was on the left side of the top of the head—it must have been a blow of considerable force.</p>

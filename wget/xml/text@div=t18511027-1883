                  </hi>. My brother is a beer-seller, in Meadow-street. On 14th Oct., about 4 o'clock, the prisoner came for half-a-pint of beer, which came to 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he gave me a half-crown in payment, which I put into the till; I gave him the change, and he left—I put no other half-crown in the till that evening, or any one else; there was no one but me attending to the shop—next morning, my brother went to the till, and said something to me about the half-crown—that day the prisoner came again for half an ounce of tobacco, which came to 13/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he gave me a shilling in payment, which I put into the till—there were no other shillings there—about two hours after.</p>

               <p>my brother drew my attention to the shilling—I had not put in any other shilling in the meantime—I then put the shilling with the half-crown on the mantel-piece—on the 18th, the prisoner came again for half an ounce of tobacco, and gave me a shilling in payment, which was bad—my brother took it up, and bent it, went after the prisoner who had left the shop, and brought him back, when he snatched the shilling from the counter—my brother let him go, followed him down the road, and gave him in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a beer-seller. On 15th Oct., about 7 o'clock in the morning, I went to the till, and took out a bad half-crown—I showed it to my sister, and she took it up to my room, where it remained till I gave it to the officer—I had not been at home the day before—on the evening of 15th, I went to the till, and found a bad shilling there, which I put with the half-crown—on 18th, the prisoner came to the shop, and I watched him lay down a shilling on the counter; I took it up, and found it was bad—he went outside the shop, and I went and brought him back—I threw the shilling down on the counter, to show him it was bad, and he snatched it up—I told him to lay down the change he had had, and the tobacco, and he did, and said be would have a pennyworth of tobacco—I followed him a quarter of a mile, when he joined another man—I then met a policeman, and gave them both in charge—I have not seen the last shilling again; I gave the other one and the half-crown to Holmes.</p>

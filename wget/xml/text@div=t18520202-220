I was in St. John-street about mid-day—in consequence of a communication from Mr. Clark I watched the White Hart yard—a few minutes afterwards I saw the prisoner enter the yard, and saw him come down again with a firkin of butter on his shoulder (I had previously seen the prisoner lift up the tilt of a cart in St. John-street, opposite Mr. Clark's door)—I went to Mr. Clark's and gave an alarm—Taylor, a policeman, ran after him; I also followed—I saw the prisoner drop the butter—I took possession of it, and took it into Mr. Clark's shop.</p>

                  </hi>. My father keeps the White Horse, in Saffron-hill; Bishop was his bar-maid. On Friday, 16th Jan., about half-past 11 o'clock in the morning, I was at the bar—the prisoner came in—I knew him as a customer—he had some bread and cheese, and did not go till half-past 12—I was there the whole time—I did not leave the bar or go up stairs—Mary Ann Bishop was there all the time—I am confident it was full half-past 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you know St. John-street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it would take from five to ten minutes to walk there from Saffron-hill—I have seen the prisoner's wife three or four times, and know her by sight—she is a customer of ours—I have seen her at the bar, but not very often—that has been within the last three weeks or a month, not before—I am quite sure of that—I am confident it was Friday the prisoner was at the bar, because my father was out—he went to Bermondsey to one of our houses, to collect the rent—I know it was half-past 11 o'clock because I looked at the clock to tell my mother the time—I am fourteen years old, and live at home—my father's christian name is David—I know the prisoner left at half-past 12 because my cousin came in—she left at 25 minutes past 12, and left the prisoner there—he staid a goodish bit longer—I cannot say whether it was an hour.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COCKLE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have been asked the distance to St. John-street; has the place where this is alleged to have occurred been pointed out to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No.</p>

               <p>and I heard her—the prisoner was standing by the beer-engine—during the time he was there he was by himself, I think—I knew him as a customer—I do not know whether I first heard of the butter being stolen the same day or the day after, on the Friday or Saturday—I do not know whether I spoke to Mary Ann Bishop about it or to my mother—it was spoken about in our house that day or the next—I think it was Mary Ann Bishop from whom I heard that the prisoner was accused, but I cannot say—I said directly, "He was here"—I think I heard of his being in custody on Monday evening or night—yesterday was the first time I was asked to be a witness—a gentleman came round to our place yesterday—I recollect now that it was not Mary Ann Bishop who told me the prisoner was taken—I had not told anybody before yesterday what I could tell—that is the gentleman who came to me (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner's solicitor</hi>)—I did not know him before yesterday—I do not know how he came to come to me—when he came yesterday, I was up stairs, and my mother sent for me down, and the gentleman asked me what I knew about them atter.</p>

                  </hi>. Mr. Wells, who keeps the White Horse, Saffron-hill, is a relation of mine—Mrs. Wells is my husband's cousin—I was there on 16th Jan.—I went into the bar about half-past 11 o'clock—the prisoner was there—I had seen him before by coming in and out of my cousin's—I staid there till half-past 12—he was there all the time I was there—he did not leave at all—I left him at the bar.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What took you there so early? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was going by for my dinner—that made me stay there an hour—I was going up into Leather-lane—I stopped because my cousin, Mrs. Ralphs, said she was going that way—she went with me—it was turned half-past 12 o'clock then—I looked at the clock, and am quite sure it had turned the half hour—I said to my cousin, "I shall be late with my dinner to-day; I shall get something to fry"—I have been out of Court during the examination of the last two witnesses—there were not such a great many people in and out of the bar while I was there—the prisoner was standing, eating some bread and cheese—one or two persons passed in, but not more—I have known the prisoner four or five years, but no more than passing the time of day to him—I have seen him frequently at the White Horse, and also Wells and Bishop—I saw Mrs. Clements the week before last, and last Thursday—I did not speak to her about this—I have not told anybody all I have told you to-day—I have mentioned it now for the first time.</p>

                  </hi>. On Friday, Kith Jan., I was potman at the White Horse, Saffron-hill. I was cleaning the window that morning when the pri<lb></lb>soner came in; I can hardly say what time it was; it was before dinner—I was on the steps, cleaning the inside of the window nearest the bar, in front of the bar, and saw him having bread and cheese—he was there some time—I cannot tell exactly what time he left.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a commission-broker, of 47, Turnmill-street, about eight minutes' walk from the White Horse. I know the prisoner—he is cooper—I have dealt with him respecting casks—it was about a month ago; it was before 16th Jan.—on 16th Jan. I went to the White Horse, just after 12 o'clock—different persons were in front of the bar, and among them was the prisoner—I think he was eating—he made some remark about having an early dinner—I stopped and read the paper till very nigh 1 o'clock, and went away, leafing him there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you of the Jewish persuasion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I did not sell the prisoner any casks; I inquired about some brewers' casks—I only asked him what he could afford to give—he did not buy them—we could not agree about the price—it was about two months ago—I was subpoenaed last week to Middlesex Sessions as a witness, but was not called; it was in an assault case; it was not to prove an <hi rend="italic">alibi.</hi>

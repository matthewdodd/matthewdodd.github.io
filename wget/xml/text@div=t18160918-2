Between eleven and twelve o'clock, hearing some men walking in my master's lime-yard; I went out; it was near the public street; it is now a private yard; it used to be a public road. I had been lying down on a sack, and I went into the yard, and saw five men there standing up. I asked them what they were doing there, and what was their business. I told them, there was no road there; and one of them said, d-n your eyes, where is your money; then he looked over his shoulder, and said to the others, I am not sure it is he. Then

            , another man, who were about a rod from me, said, it is he. I knew Warren and Dee; I had worked with them before, better than two years. It was not dark at this time; it was very light. I knew them both very well, both by tongue and person. Dee said, it is he, is it not; and Warren said he was certain sure of it. Warren told the man next to me to sieze me, and they would be after as soon as possible, and so they were. Then the fourth man said, I will soon let you know something about it, and then they seized hold of me; he took hold of my throat, and the others took me by the arms, and they shoved me in at the door; there were two fires; it was quite as light there as it is here; you might see to pick a pin up; it was fight from the fires that came from the kiln; the kiln door was open. They catched me up by the legs, and threw me down on the lime, and two of them were on my throat, and three across my legs and thighs. Then they cut my trowsers all off my back, and cut my pockets off where the money was in; they were nankeen breeches. They cut off the watch-pocket, where the watch was, and the breeches pockets. I saw them take a thirty-pound note, a twenty-pound note, and a one-pound note out of my tobacco box. They opened the notes and looked at them. These notes were in my tobacco box in my left hand breeches pocket. They cut off my right hand breeches pocket also; there were seven ten-pound notes, and a thirty-pound note there, in a protection box, which I bought five years ago at Greenwich, and gave three-pence for it, in my right hand breeches pocket. In my left hand waitcoat pocket there were two one-pound notes; the money was in three boxes in all.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to carry so much money about you - A. I was never in constant work. I had been engaged for three months, and only worked one, and I thought I might as well go home. After that, I always kept it in my pocket, as I thought it safer than any where else.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you come by all this money - A. I had worked nearly seventeen years day and night to get it up. They took my watch also; it was a silver watch; there was one seal with a dog on it; they continued on me about twenty minutes altogether. They beat my head into the lime before they started<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180004"></xptr>to go off, and when they were going out of the door they turned back to kill me, and one of them said d-n his bloody eyes, let us kill him; pull out your knife, and cut his head clean off, and we will throw it away, and I looked every moment for it to have come off too.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any knife taken out - A. No; I did not see any knife; but one held my head, and another my legs, while the others beat me, and kicked me; four of them came back, and the other staid at the door; Dee and Warren came back; Warren was for killing of me at the last moment. Warren said it would serve him right if we were to kill him, for what he did to me, and I never did any thing to him, any more than working with him; I am certain he said that. Then they tied me cross-legged tight over the tendon, with a handkerchief not my own, one of theirs; then they were standing altogether at the door, and Mr.

             hallooed out what is the matter, Coker, and I could not hardly speak; I was scarcely able to speak; I told him I was robbed, as well as I could; but he could scarcely understand me. Then William Dee said to the others come let us go, and then they went off, and they answered to Mr. Cranch there is not much the matter, it is all right enough, and then I saw no more of them that night after that; it was the man that caught hold of me first that said that; and away they went over the wall. Wheh they had cut my pockets off, Warren, the prisoner, said, I told you where the money was, I had such a sight of the prisoner as to be sure he was one of the persons; I knew four of them by sight, and Dee and Warren by name; Dee and Warren had been in the yard that day. I had thirty shillings a week; I used to have more than that at Mill-wall; I had two guineas and three pounds a week when I was there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I had been at work all day; I was burning coke; that kept me at wok night and day.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you go in search of the men - A. I could not go; the runners went within an hour afterwards. The watchman came, and I informed him what had happened; there were two watchmen came; but I don't know that they are here.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any one here to whom you told what had happened to you - A. Yes; there is Mr. Cranch, I told him what was the matter; I was at the lime kiln door. This yard stand upon three quarters of an acre; there was a wall and pales all round; there is valuable property there. There are two gates; those gates open close upon the door. There is a little street which covers about two rods of ground, and which comes down by the gates.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is this yard from the public-street - A.About an hundred yards from the common road, perhaps not so much; there is a kind of road which goes down to the yard, where the carts go round to carry potetoes. At the time I speak of, I don't know whether the gates were opened or locked. When the men had left me, Mr. Cranch let me out; I was nearly blind, and nearly dead. I believe Mr. Cranch unlocked the gate; I think it was unlocked, but I am not sure it was he unlocked it. I told Mr. Cranch I knew one of the man was

            , I am certain sure of that; that is the man, (pointing to the prisoner.) I have known him upwards of two years and a quarter; I mean to say I am quite sure of his person. When I found these men in the lime kiln yard, I was rather frightened. It was a stout young man that first seized me; he seized me by the throat; I was frightened.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that you were so much in your right senses as to be sure of the prisoner - A. I can safely say he was one of those men; he had a blue jacket and trowsers on.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell Mr. Cranch that Warren did not commit any violence towards you - A. Yes; he did not beat me. When I was speaking to Mr. Cranch, I told him I knew Warren was laying across my legs. I have never got a farthing back. I have seen some of it at Shadwell; I don't know the numbers; I had no memorandum of the amount I had. I don't know when Warren was taken up; I was as blind as a bat. I did not see Warren for a week after he was taken. When I did see him, I saw him at the Justice's at Shadwell; there I recognized him. I did not say at Shadwell office, I could not swear to him, but I said I could, for I would a thousand times; I mean to say that is the man, and it is impossible I can be mistaken; I am sure of the man.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by the COURT. I had changed a great many notes in the yard, five-pound notes and others, and the prisoner know I was possessed of a good deal of money. He came one night before, but I was prepared for him, and had a broom stick; I should have knocked him down. He got a ladder; he came about one o'clock in the morning; I should have given it to him too, if he had come on, about a foot farther, for I was guarded for him at that time. He crawled away through the kiln hole.</p>

            . The prisoner was in my employment in July last, at Mr. Mason's, at Bow; I reside at New Cut Lane, on the same premises where this lime yard 1s.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any noise in the course of that night that disturbed you - A. Yes, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I was disturbed by a noise, and I threw up the windows, and asked who was there, and what was the matter? and I received no answer, and I returned to my bed again. I was disturbed in about ten minutes after that, by the cry of murder. Upon being so disturbed, I got up, and I challenged three times who was there, and I received no answer, and I then said I would fire, if I did not receive an answer; I abstained from firing, and in the course of a few minutes the prosecutor answered it was me; I have been robbed. I then asked the prosecutor if they had abused him; I found him a good deal beat and cut about the head. I got the assistance of two watchmen prior to my going out into the yard; then, having the assistance of those two watchmen; I went down, and found the prosecutor in the yard; he had then untied his legs. He said the prisoner was one of the persons; and in consequence of that I got up early the next morning, and went in search of him; he said he thought the prisoner was one; he said there was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180005"></xptr>a person by the name of Dee, whom he knew to be one of the gang. I knew of the prosecutor having a considerable sum of money. I have frequently a changeed ten-pound twenty-pound and thirty-pound notes for him; both he and the prosecutor had worked for me.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you happen to know whether the prisoner has ever been present at the time he has got change - A. It was chiefly of a Saturday night when the other men were collected to receive their money, in their presence I have done it. The prisoner was one of those men. Both prisoner and prosecutor worked for me. There are two notes that are traced after the prisoner; but there are no marks of mine on them that enable me to say I have seen them before. I apprehended the prisoner at Bow, on Wednesday morning, about eleven o'clock, the day after. The prisoner lived at Bow Common. It was just by Bow Fair Field where I found him. He had a bundle when I appreheaded him. I took him from Bow to Limehouse, and there. I delivered him into the hands of the night beadle and constable; Lisles, and a person named Jones. I gave the bundle to the officers, as well as the prisoner; I gave them the bundle. I delivered it on the premises where the robbery was committed; I was not present at the search.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. This yard is about a hundred or a hundred and fifty yards from the highway; the back of the yard is near to the River, and the front is towards the highway. I do sometimes mark notes, but not constantly, I am not enabled to identify any note that I have seen that I passed to the prosecutors. It was between eleven and twelve when I heard this noise; the prosecutor was in the kiln-yard; he told me he had been robbed; he described to me who he thought it was; he was not so ill but he was well enough to describe the particulars of what had happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not tell you he did not know any of the persons by name - A. No; I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him to describe the persons of any of them - A. I did. I was not present when the bundle was opened.</p>

            . I am night beadle of the parish of St. Ann Middlesex; that is where this lime-yard is In consequence of some information I received I saw the prosecutor Millard on the night of the 16th of July last, between twelve and one; he was in a room at Mr. Cranch's house; Mr. Cranch came into the room during the time. The prosecutor was lying with his face on the carpet, and there was some blood dropping from it; he seemed dreadfully hurt; he had several bruises about his face, one in particular under one of his ears, from which blood was coming. He said that Warren was one of the persons who robbed him; and in consequence of his telling me that, at four o'clock that morning I went to his house at Bow Common; he was not at home, and I searched the house for him deligently; not finding him, I gave up the search then. He was delivered to me afterwards by Mr. Cranch; Mr. Cranch pointed him out to me in the yard, and I took the prisoner; and Mr. Cranch gave me the bundle, and the prisoner said it was his own. I am sure that is the bundle, and it has been looked on up at the watchhouse ever since; I have kept the key of that place ever since; there is a pair of white silk stockings as one article, a black silk handkerchief, a sailor's relveteen jacket, a pair of velveteen small clothes, a red waistcoat, and a yellow handkerchief. I was present when the prisoner was searched. I have a memorandum mode at the time of the search; he had twentyone pounds five shillings and sixpence on him; a ten-pound note, one pound five shillings and sixpence in silver, ten one-pound notes, and seven-pence three farthings in copper. I also found on him a small bag, that the note was in. and a case knife; there was also a bill of parcels which Mr. Jones took; I saw these things taken.</p>
               <p>-JONES. I am a constable of Limehouse. I was called out of my bed on the 17th; at about twelve or one in the night, between the 16th and 17th; I was called. I got up, and went to the watchhouse, and when I came there I saw Millard in a terrible state with a bruised head; a medical man was sent for belonging to the parish, and he dressed the wounds, and after that, we took him to the workhouse, and after that, I thought it prisoner was one by what Millard told me; when we had done what we could for the safety of the man, we went immediately to a house in Ann-street; we knew where the prisoner lived, and we went to his house; that must be about three and four o'clock in the same morning. He was not there; we did not like to enter the house forcible, so I left some of the persons to take care of it, and then I and

             the police officer went to Old Ford, and fetched the prisoner's son; and he shewed us the house, and the prisoner was not there. We found nothing in the house only about five or six club sticks under Warren's bed. I was one of the persons to whom the bundle was delivered. After that I came into the lime-house; we went to Cranch's yard, and the prisoner was delivered to us, and the bundle. On searching the prisoner, in his watch-fob I found twenty-one pounds in bank notes, and one pound five shillings and sixpence; the different sums mentioned by the last witness; here is a bill of parcels also that I found on the prisoner along with the notes; these were all the things beside a case knife and a bag. We went to Mr. Swift's, in Houndsditch, and got some information; I have kept the notes locked up ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Before the 17th of July, I did not know where the prisoner lived. I went to a house which somebody told me belonged to him. His son told me he slept there.</p>
               <p>(A bill of parcels was here put in, and read, and was for articles of wearing apparel bought of Mr. Swift, a slop-seller, on the 17th of July, amount three pounds four shillings.</p>

            . On the 17th of July last, I was in the employment of Mr. Smith; he is a woolen draper and clothier. I know the prisoner at the bar; I saw him on that day. I think nearer seven than eight in the mornings, it was at my master's shop I saw him; there was another young man with him, whom I should know if I were to see; they came there both together; I never saw them before.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180006"></xptr>I was in the shop when the bill of parcels was made out. I did not hear the prisoner mention his name. I saw a note produced; I received a thirty pound note from Dalton; the first note I saw was a thirty-pound note that Dalton gave me; he is one of Mr. Swift's men; I don't know how Dalton came to have it; I did not see any one give that note to Dalton. I got change for it; I believe there were a ten-pound note, two five-pound notes, and the rest in one-pound notes; I brought the change back, and delivered it to Mr. Dalton; I did not see what he did with it; I was called into the wareroom sometime after, and there received a twenty-pound note from the other man that was with the prisoner; that was given me to get change of. I went to get change for that; I brought it back, and put it on the table, and the man took it himself; the man that gave it to me took it up; the change I got was all in Bank of England notes; I did not see Mr. Dalton pay the prisoner nor the other the change I got for the thirty-pound note, nor do I know what became of the change of the twenty-pound note after it was taken by the other man.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Swift, and I was so on the 17th of July last. I saw the prisoner at the bar on that day, at my master's shop; I am sure he was one of the persons that came.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these things and tell us whether you or your master sold those to the prisoner, or the other person that came with you - A. They are, to the best of my knowledge the things I sold to the prisoner; he gave me a thirty-pound-note, to take the amount of them out; I am sure it was the prisoner; It was a Bank of England note. I gave it to the last witness to get it changed; I gave all the change to the prisoner, and he gave me the amount of my bill one of it. There is the name of

            . I remember his bringing a thirty-pound-note to me to get changed, on the 17th of July last; at about half past seven in the morning; I put Mr. Swift's name upon it. I sent that note to the Bank; the banker's clerk has got it in court. I am positive sure that that is the note; it has Mr. Swift's name on it, I wrote Swift on it becaue Moore was in his employ. I never cashed any other note of thirty-pound for him but th1s.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WHITETHORN. I live at the Angel, in Fenchurch-street. I gave change to Moore for a twenty-pound-note on the 17th of July last; I made a mark on it; I marked it "T. W. of Mr. Swift's man, Hounsditch, 17th of July." This is the note, I am positive sure of it from what I myself put on it; I wrote this on the same day I gave him change. I kept it in my possession, and the next day afterwards, Mr. Jones came with another officer. I am positive that is the note; then I took it to the police-office. I gave a ten-pound-note in-change. (The ten-pound-note found on the prisoner produced.) I look at that note; that is the note, I know it because there is the words "of Mr. Jones' man" on it, and I know it by that, because I gave change for it to one of Mr. Jones' men, of Aldgate.</p>

On the morning of 16th March I was on duty in the Barnet Road, Highgate, about half past 1 or 2 o'clock, near Mr. Johnson's, the Manor Farm—I heard the dog bark in the yard of the house—I went accompanied by another constable—we found in an out-house the two prisoners—there are two doors to the outhouse—I was going in at one, and they tried to come out of the other, but were apprehended by the other officer—Lander said they came there to sleep—I asked his name, and where he lived—he said, "At the Hog Market, Finchley"—M'Donald had this stick (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in his hand; he dropped it at his feet—I took M'Donald into custody—when I first saw them, the other constable had them by the collar—I took M'Donald to the station, and found on him a black cloth cap, a shoe brush, a toothpick, and a large clasp knife—it was from ten minutes to a quarter of an hour from the time I heard the dog bark till we came—the other constable had Lander—M'Donald gave the name of Robert Smith, living at a coffee house in Gray's Inn Lane; he could not tell what coffee house—I have made inquiries concerning the address given by the other prisoner—I could not find such a place—I searched Whitechapel all through—at the police station, Lander gave the address, "No. 50, Jeweller's Lane, Spitalfields—I could not find such a place.</p>

On the morning mentioned by the last witness, I went with him—we found the two prisoners in an outhouse, adjoining the building—when we came up to the door we observed the doors open a little, and the prisoners coming out; they were both taken in that outhouse—they gave addresses, that they lived at Finchley, near the Hog Market, but Lander gave me a different direction at the station—on Lander I found a bottle containing some oil, a duplicate, a letter, and a penny; nothing material to the charge, except two matches.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. James Johnson, of Manor Farm, Highgate. On Sunday night, the 15th, I went to bed at half past 8 o'clock; the state of the house was perfectly safe—my attention was drawn to a window over the staircase at 6 o'clock in the evening—when we went to bed, at half past 8 o'clock, I observed that it was shut—I observed the lock; it was perfectly safe—I closed the shutter inside at 6 o'clock—I observed that evening a cask, it was then on the opposite side of the steps, some distance from the window in the back place, at the back of the house—the window was quite safe when I went to bed—there is a catch to the window, that was fastened—in the morning I was alarmed by the police, about 5 o'clock—I then got up, and found the window with a square of glass taken out—it was in when I went to bed—I do not know whether the police found the glass out, but I found it when I looked at it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant at Mr. James Johnson's, the manor farm. About 6 o'clock, on the morning of the 16th, I observed a pane of glass under the wall, by the staircase window—the glass was not broken, it was laid down under the wall—I observed under the window the eighteen gallon cask that was on the night before on the other side of the steps—I found it right under the window—mounting upon that, a person might well reach the place where the pane of glass had been—removing that, the hand could be put through so as to undo the catch, and open the sash.</p>

On the 16th March, about 11 o'clock, I went to the Manor Farm—I observed that a square of glass had been taken from the staircase window; it had been taken out by cutting part of the lead, and pushing the other part back with a knife—I received a knife from the witness Townsend—I compared that with the marks on the lead, and found that it corresponded—it fitted exactly in the marks—the square of glass was about five inches by eight inches; part of the lead work was cut in a slanting direction, and the other part was pushed back—I compared the knife with the marks, and it corresponded—I observed the knife before I went to the lead marks—on the blade of it were some marks of some lead which I pointed out to Mr. Johnson previously—those were such marks as would have been made if a person had cut in such a manner—the taking out of that pane would enable a person to get their hands through to the fasten<lb></lb>ing of the window inside; you move it, and it opens like a door—there was no mark on the shutters—the dog kennel was directly opposite this—the position of the outhouse was where they would be most likely to go if the policemen came in the opposite direction—there was also some lead on the edge of the knife, but I could not keep it on.</p>

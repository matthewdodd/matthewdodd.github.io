               <p>Court. I am very sorry, gentlemen, I cannot concur in your recommendation. First, he is a servant: a servant is bound to protect our property, and not pilfer it; and we are always strict with servants: but besides that, there is a second indictment against him; though that evidence was not proper to be given in this case: under these circumstances, therefore, I dare to say you do not wish to press that recommendation any farther.</p>

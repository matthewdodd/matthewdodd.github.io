                  </hi>. I am a lighterman, and live at No. 20, White Horse-street, Waterloo-road. On the morning of the 6th of Jan., between one and two o'clock, I went into a coffee-house in the Waterloo-road—while I was there the prisoner came in—I had never seen her before, to my knowledge—she was not drunk, nor yet sober, half-and-half—I should consider she had been drinking—she had a dog with her, which she placed upon the table where I was sitting—I said, "That is not a fit place for a dog, you had better remove it, if not, I shall"—she made use of a very bad expression, and said she would stick a knife in my eye—I put the dog off the table, and the made an attempt—I got up and told her I would put her out—she put her hand to her pocket—I got hold of her by the waist, and attempted to put her out—she sat down by the door, which opened inwards, and I could not get her out, and wishing to have no <hi rend="italic">bother</hi> I went and sat down to tea—I drank one saucer full of tea, and then she made another attempt at me—she went into the further box—the landlord persuaded her to go there, and let roe alone—she then came towards me in a furious way—I got up and received this wound on the temple from a penknife, I believe—she struck at me with some<lb></lb>thing in her hand—I heard several people say, "She has stabbed him"—I seized her, and in endeavouring to rescue her arm she cut me in four places, and my trowsers too—I bled very seriously right down to my breast—it would have been a regular deep wound but for the bone.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a machinist, and live in Cornwall-road—I was in the coffee-shop on the morning of the 6th Jan., and saw the prisoner come in—she had a dog with her—she placed it on the table where Maxwell was—he had ordered his tea, but it had not come—he told her to take it off, it was not a fit place for a dog—she asked him how long he had been a gentleman, and called him some name—he <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> the dog off—she said she would <hi rend="italic">job</hi> his b—eye out with a knife she had in her pocket—he got up and took her round the waist to put her out—the landlord hearing a disturbance came in and parted them, and put one in one box and one in the other—Maxwell went back to his box and sat down to tea—the prisoner got up and stooped, as if to take off her patten or clog to <hi rend="italic">heave</hi> at him—he said, "I can't stand this"—the landlord came in and stood between them—I saw her put her hand into her pocket, as if to take something out—she reached over two men's shoulders, and made a <hi rend="italic">job</hi>, passing a clog from one hand to the other, and making the <hi rend="italic">job</hi> with the hand that had no clog in—I had not seen him strike or do anything to her before, except take the dog off the table, and going to put her out—I saw the wound immediately after the blow was struck—there was blood<lb></lb>there were several <hi rend="italic">jobs</hi> made with the same hand, and the landlord put up his hand to prevent it—he looked at his own hand a few minutes after, and found it was wounded.</p>

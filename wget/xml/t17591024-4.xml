             my apprentice 29 l. 17 s. in order to pay a bill. When I returned about 5 in the evening he gave me 5 guineas of that. I ask'd him for the rest; he said, he suppos'd I had had it. I said I had not. Then he said, it was taken from the place where he laid it, and suppos'd the prisoner at the bar had taken it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Jarrat. He was my servant: I employ'd him to fetch water in a cart, and other business about the yard. He was missing. I sent four people to look for him. They took him, and I was with him before the Justice of the peace; there he confess'd he had taken 20 Guineas and a shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it missing from?</p>
               <p>Jarrat. From out of the counting-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Does your counting-house join to your dwelling-house?</p>
               <p>Jarrat. No, it does not. He produces a bag. This is the bag that the money was in. Justice Pell deliver'd it to me with 16 l. 10 s. in it, which was taken from the prisoner at the bar.</p>

            . I am a Coachman. Mr. Jarrat desired me to go and see after the prisoner; I found him at the Black Boy on Salt-Peter-Bank. He ask'd me, what I did there? I told him, I came to see for him. I charg'd him with this robbery. I search'd him there, and found but a groat upon him. Going along in Whitechapel he said, he would walk no farther, he would have a coach. He would confess nothing, but said he would tell me in the morning. I deliver'd him up to Mr. Burill a constable in Whitechapel, and there left him 'till morning. When he was before the Justice he owned he had taken 22 l. 11 s. in my hearing; and he had given one woman 4 guineas, and another seven. We search'd him, and found 14 guineas and 16 s. and 6 d. and a 9 s. piece concealed under his backside in his breeches, in a bag.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner use to come into the counting-house?</p>
               <p>Swaiby. He used to come by the window and be looking in, but I did not see him in the counting-house that day the money in the bag was missing, which was 21 guineas in gold and one shilling, the rest in silver was not in the bag. I suspected the prisoner, when I found the money was gone. He was taken up, and confessed the taking it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence.</p>

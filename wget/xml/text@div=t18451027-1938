                  </hi>. I live at Sampson's-gardens, Wapping. On Satur<lb></lb>day night, the 12th of Oct., I was coming down Aldgate, and felt my handkerchief taken out of my pocket—I turned round, and saw the prisoner leaving me—I followed him—he ran away, and, after running some distance, he dropped the handkerchief, which I took up—I still pursued, and saw him stopped by a policeman—I am quite certain he is the person who dropped it—he was the nearest person to me when I turned round.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in River-terrace, King's-cross. I sold Mr. Noakes some potatoes—on 22nd Aug. I loaded his cart with fifty sacks of potatoes, each sack containing 1 cwt.—the prisoner was the carman; he was to take them to Mr. Noakes'—I saw the prisoner on the van just before he started, and I gave him the pass to get out of the yard—he told me how many sacks there were, and I took his word; I never counted them myself—he told me there were fifty sacks, and there were to have been fifty—they were my property.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Bedford-place. I was in Guildford-place on 22nd Aug., about 2 o'clock—I saw the van loaded with sacks—I saw the prisoner take a sack of potatoes from the van, and he carried it to No. 17, Easton-street, where Parker lives—that is between seventy and eighty yards from where he stopped the van—there was the name of Noakes in red letters on the sack, the same as there was on the sacks in the wagon—I saw the prisoner come out of the house again with an empty sack—it was full when he took it from the wagon—he threw the empty sack on the other sacks in the wagon.</p>

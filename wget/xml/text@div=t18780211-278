I am the wife of John Harding, a china dealer, of 180, Tottenham Court Road—on 7th January the prisoners came, and Truscott asked to be shown some wine-glasses—I placed some on the table for their inspection—Lucas preferred those with a thin straw stem, but Truscott said "No, my housemaid is very heavy-handed when she lays the dinner table," and that those would be more likely to be broken, and he chose a dozen port at 36<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and a dozen sherry and a pair of decanters to match at 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I made out a bill for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Truscott said "You are not a good arithmetician, let me correct an error; it is 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; you would have lost 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. by me if I had not corrected that</p>

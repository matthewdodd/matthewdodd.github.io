On the 25th of April, the prisoner came to me for a leg of pork, for Mr. Kingsford, of the Swan with Two Necks, Lad-lane, who deals with me - I never saw him before; I supplied him with it - it came to 6s. or 7s.; I asked him for the book which Mr. Kingsford generally sends - he said he had come away in a hurry, or something: on the 30th of April he came and asked for another leg of pork for Mr. Kingsford, which I gave him, and asked him for the book; he said he had forgotten it, and come away in a hurry; on the 1st of May he came again for a leg and a loin, for Mr. Kinsford; I let him have them - he came again in the afternoon for a loin; I had my suspicions then, but being busy I let him go away with it; and on the 7th of May he came again for a leg and loin - I gave it him, and sent my man to follow him; he stopped him - the value of all the meat is 26s. or 27s.</p>

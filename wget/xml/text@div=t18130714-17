The prisoner M'Carthy from behind rushed upon us, and with force separated us. I immediately told him it would be much better if he would go about his business. With that he rushed upon me, and seized me by the collar, and tore my coat so much that with difficulty I kept it on. I attempted to keep him from me; with that he closed, and I with difficulty threw him down, and my self upon him. There appeared to be a gang of eight or ten upon me, some crying release him, and an immense pressure upon my body, and as I was attempting to rise the prisoner kept holding of me; at last I succeeded in rising; I extricated myself with my torn coat, which the officer has, which with my hat Mr. Lovett took charge of. I then felt that I had my watch in my pocket, and wished to see Mr. Lovett to give it him, but before I could see Mr. Lovett M'Carthy again rushed upon me, and I again threw him in the same situation as before. I found the pressure much greater the second time than before, and was two or three minutes before I could succeed in getting my knees upon him. I immediately placed my hand to my fob: I found that my watch was gone. M'Carthy when I observed I was robbed, immediately let go his hold. I with some difficulty got up; he then pretended to be in a stupified state. The watchman was just coming upon his duty; I gave him in charge, and went with him to Bishopsgate watchhouse. There was a party when I gave him in charge; they went away.</p>

            . On Monday evening, the 4th of June, Mr. Watson and I were walking down Bishopsgate-street, arm in arm. The prisoner came behind us, and struck us both at one time on our shoulders, and likewise parted us at the same time we turned round. The prisoner was behind us; he was just in the act of striking me. I got of one side to avoid his striking me. He then went to Mr. Watson; he struck Mr. Watson; they both fell down together. Mr. Watson endeavouring to get up M'Carthy tore his coat completely off his back. Mr. Watson, when he got up, took the remaining part of his coat off; it was very little for certain. He then told M'Carthy to go about his business; he did not wish to have any thing further to say to him. M'Carthy soon after that struck him again; they both fell down; he kept him down for two or three minutes. When Mr. Watson got up the second time he said, Lovett, I have lost my watch. There appeared to be a gang of them. There were several persons that pretended to help Mr. Watson up; I rather thought they were keeping him down. The watch has never been found.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Lifting the coat he now has on up from a chair</hi>)—he said, "Mine"—I said, "Did you wear that last night?"—he said, "Yes"—I held it up and said, "What have you done with these buttons?—he said, "I have not bad any there, I have only had this one on this two or three months"—I said, "Only this one when you were in the prosecutor's employment?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Consider yourself in custody for breaking and entering the prosecutor's house, with another"—he said, "Let me sew this first;" but he trembled, and could not—I said, "Where are you living?"—he said, "You have been so clever I shall not satisfy you"—he said that he had not been out the night before, but afterwards he said, "I did go up Holborn and round Lincoln's-inn-fields; I got home about 12"—I said, "Where did you sleep last night?"</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 15, Skinner Street, Somers Town, and am a baker—between 10.30 and 11 o'clock on the evening of 28th December, I was in West Street, near the Euston Road—Roach spoke to me—she said "Halloa, ducky! what have you got under your arm?"—I said "A bundle"—she asked me to give her the bundle—I would not—shortly after she</p>

               <p>followed me, and got hold of my arm—she spoke one or two words, and took the bundle from under my arm—I said "If you don't give me my bundle perhaps there will be some one here who will take it from you"—I snatched the bundle back—I went down with her to a passage by 32, West Street, that is a goodish way from where she first spoke to me—she had hold of me by the arm, and I was making my, way home, and that was my home down that street—Brown followed us down the street—when we got to 32, West Street, Roach began talking to me and asking me for money, and I would not give her any—she swore at me three or four times, and said "You have kept me here for a quarter of an hour, or more," and she said if I did not give her something she would have it, and then she took the bundle—I did not go into any room with Roach—she got hold of me by the throat, and throttled me so that I could not speak or halloa in any way—as soon as I could I called for assistance—she dragged me on the ground, I got up, and she got me by the throat again—Brown put her hand in my pocket—there was a man there, he struck me, and twisted my arm up my back—they took two half-crowns from me, which were in my right hand side-pocket.</p>

About 11 o'clock on the evening of 28th December, I heard cries of" 15, Skinner Street," and "West Street," and "Murder" I was in the house 15, Skinner Street, occupied by Maher—there is an entrance in West Street—a knock came to the door—I opened it, and saw a little boy—I went out, and saw a crowd, and the prosecutor struggling with Brown—he said she had robbed him—I asked him how much, he said "Five shillings"—I said "Why don't you give him the money back?"—she said "No: the money is all right, it will soon be spent, he shan't have it."</p>

I saw the prosecutor holding Brown in West Street—he complained that he had been robbed by her and another female and a man—I took her to the station—about an hour or so afterwards, I went to 32, West Street with the prosecutor and Poile, and the prosecutor identified Roach from two or three other women there, and said she was the other one who assaulted him—she denied it—I found 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on Roach.</p>

About 10.30 on the night of 28th December, I was on duty in the Euston Road—I saw the prosecutor coming down with Roach, followed by Brown—I followed them, and being a short street, I went round the reverse way and passed Roach, who was standing at the door of 32, West Street, with the prosecutor—seeing that he still had his bundle, I passed by, and about an hour afterwards I received information that a robbery had been committed, and I went with the other constable and took Roach.</p>

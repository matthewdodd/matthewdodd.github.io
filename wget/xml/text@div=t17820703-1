On the 22d of May, between the hours of six and seven in the evening, the three prisoners at the bar came into the shop, and asked to look at some thread lace edging; I was at the further end of the shop; one of them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178207030003"></xptr> bought something, and then they all went out together. Mr. Kendrick immediately stepped into the shop, and asked us if we had lost any thing; upon examination we missed two cards of lace; I followed them to the Black-Horse. When I got there, Davis pulled out of her pocket two cards of lace, and put them on the fire. This (producing it) I took off the fire; the other was burnt. I am certain this is our property, for there are marks in my own hand-writing upon it; I know it was in my shop that day. Delaney whispered to Wilson, upon which Wilson ran down stairs, and Davis ran up stairs, but Delaney herself staid in the room.</p>

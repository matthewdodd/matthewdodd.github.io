I have known the prisoner several years - he was in the habit of calling on me; I missed two books last Saturday fortnight - I advertised them, and they were brought to me by a pawnbroker; I suspected the prisoner, and had him apprehended; the duplicates were found on him - these are them: I had seen them safe about a week before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How do you know them? A. By the binding, and one of them has a wreath, which is peculiar; it is a coloured engraving stuck in it, and this volume has my private-mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not I heard you say, that people called at your shop, and read the newspapers, and you did not like it? - A. Yes. The books were all in my shop within a month.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner, and found some duplicates on him, which he said were his own. I found others, relating to these books, at his lodging.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in a long address to the Court, stated that he had purchased the duplicates of a stranger, at an eating-house in the Minories; and that the prosecution was brought against him because he had declared it his intention to bring an action against Mr. North.</p>
               <p>MR. NORTH. The prisoner has been a respectable man, but fell into misfortunes; he has been a clerk: what he means about an action is, a medical certificate was obtained some time ago, by which he was confined in Hoxton madhouse.</p>

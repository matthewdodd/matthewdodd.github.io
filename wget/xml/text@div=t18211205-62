On the 8th of November, about seven o'clock, in the evening. I was in the Star, public-house, Well-street, the prisoner was in the public-house, and joined my company, he sat in the same box. We continued in company till one o'clock in the morning, drinking all the time; he was quite stupid with liquor, and I was a little intoxicated. I asked him to go to my lodging, he was going, but I found he was so much in liquor, that I endeavoured to leave him.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he walk straight - A. No; I had got about five yards from the public-house, he came after me, insisted on going with me, he caught hold of me by the shawl, and being unpinned, it came off. The watchman came out and took him, I did not tell the watchman that he had robbed me.</p>

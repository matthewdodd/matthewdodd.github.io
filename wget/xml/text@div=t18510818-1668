                  </hi>. I was in the service of Mr. John Rutherford, of King Edward's-row, Hackney. On 24th July my mistress, her sister, and I, were at home—the prisoner came about 12 o'clock—I let him in—he said he came to polish the banisters; they were very badly done, and were to be done again—I told my mistress; she said, "Very well"—the prisoner wanted some warm water and a piece of flannel, and appeared to employ himself in washing them—he asked for a cloth to dry them—they go up two flights of stain—the drawing-room is on the ground-floor—my mistress's bed-room and her sister's are the top floor—the prisoner was employed up to the top—he went away about 1 o'clock, and said he was going to dinner—he left his basket—he came back at half-past three, and brought another man with him—they both began to polish the banisters—the prisoner was on the top flight, and the other man on the lower—I went up-stairs, and passed the prisoner two or three times while he was there the second time—I went into my mistress's bed-room, and saw the neck-chain on the dressing-table—I came out again, and shut the door—the prisoner was very near the door—I went into her sister's bed-room, and saw her neck-chain on the looking-glass—I shut the door of that room—that was about 10 minutes before 5, and aboot twenty minutes before the prisoner went away—when he was going, he came down, and said the banisters were done—my mistress gave him 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he went away—about twenty-five minutes after he was gone, the chains were missed.</p>

On 24th July I learned that a person had come to do the banisters—it is a new house—Mr. Butters, a builder, had been doing jobs about it—I thought it was all right—the banisters had been very badly done—I was told about half-past 5 o'clock that the men had done the job, and were going away—I gave the prisoner a trifle, and he went—I had seen my chain and my sister's safe at 5—I went up to dress afterwards, and they were gone—my chain was under a towel—it was not exposed during the time the</p>

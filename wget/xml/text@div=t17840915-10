               <p>What did they do after they got you into the ditch? - They took my money out of my pocket, the prisoner was behind the other men, and one of them that was on me says, damn your eyes come on, and quiet that child or kill her.</p>
               <p>Do you believe he spoke to the prisoner? - Yes, and they did so, they took from me ten shillings and sixpence in silver, a frock, and my linen waistcoat, a hat, a pair of copper shoe buckles, and my shoes, these were the things I had on.</p>
               <p>Did they take any thing from the child? - The prisoner came up, and he could not quiet her with his hand, and he stuffed the child's mouth full of hay, then he run away towards Stepney.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he was the person? - I am sure that was the person, I went and apprehended the prisoner, who lived in my neighbourhood; Levy and Earle took him.</p>
               <p>Court. It was half past nine? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it a moon-light night? - A bright moon-light night.</p>
               <p>How long might they stay with you? - I imagine about five or ten minutes, not above.</p>
               <p>The first thing was one of them pulled your hat over your eyes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did your hat continue to be pulled over your eyes all the time? - No, when they threw me into the ditch my hat was off.</p>
               <p>Did you observe the faces of the other two men? - I did observe the first very well, but he is not to be found.</p>
               <p>Should you know the other men? - I should know one of them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner you described standing behind the others, so that he was farther from you than the other two? - Yes, but when he stopped the child's mouth he was before me, I could see him very plain, he was then four or five yards off.</p>
               <p>Which way did the moon shine, in your face? - No, it shone in his face.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed? - I cannot tell what his dress was, but it was a brownish loose great coat.</p>
               <p>Had he any hat over his eyes? - No.</p>
               <p>What sort of a hat had he? - It was an oldish cocked up hat.</p>
               <p>You never saw him before? - Never to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>When you were thrown down, did he stand behind you or in front of you? - I was thrown upon my back, but then when the other man pulled my clothes off, they pulled me up.</p>
               <p>Was you perfectly sober? - Yes, as sober as ever I was in my life.</p>
               <p>Had you been drinking at all? - I had a pint of beer at Poplar, and that was all.</p>

               <p>Court. Let her be sworn by all means.</p>
               <p>(Sworn.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Now tell all that you know, and tell the truth; where was you? - I was coming home, and my daddy thought it was the highest way to come over the fields, so he did; and as he was coming over the fields, three men stopped him, so one of them came up, says he what's o'clock; says my daddy I do not know, I have no watch, but it is about half after nine; then the man said, says he, O, says he, I am going to Whitechapel; says my daddy, says he, so am I, I came from the Isle of Dogs: so they knocked him down, and one of the men said to the other, come up, Joe, for, says he, here is a man, a dog, came over from the Isle of Dogs; so then they knocked him down, and pulled my daddy's hat over his eyes, and knocked him down; I stood and I screamed out, and then one of the men that was along with my daddy said, says he, blast your eyes, come up and stop that girl's mouth, and kill her, or else I will, and then he got some hay, and stuffed my mouth full of hay.</p>
               <p>Who did? - This here man.</p>
               <p>Which man do you mean? - That man there, and he took away my bonnet.</p>
               <p>What were they doing to your father? - They were taking his money away and robbing him.</p>
               <p>How long might they stay with you, think you? - He did not stay longer with me than he did with my daddy; then they all ran away towards Stepney; then my daddy and I came home towards Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Had your father got all his clothes on? - No, Sir, he had but a shirt, and a pair of breeches, and his stockings on, and when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150043"></xptr> he came to the Two Bells at Whitechapel, he called for a pint of beer, and borrowed a pair of shoes.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before, had you ever seen him? - Yes, he lives down the court next to us.</p>
               <p>Then you had seen him before this robbery? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you know him at the time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you tell anybody so, soon after the robbery? - Yes, I said, says I, daddy, I know that man that stopped my mouth full of hay and took my bonnet away; I told him it was the man that lived down the court next us.</p>
               <p>When you got home, did you tell the same story to any body? - Yes, I told it to my mammy.</p>
               <p>When did they take the boy up? - Not till the next morning; I saw him the next morning. I saw him go up the court before he was taken; he came up the court where he lives, and came into our court, he and another man.</p>
               <p>Did you tell anybody that you had seen him? - My mammy and I was standing at the door, so then I said, Mammy, I know that man, for I am sure that is him that took my bonnet away, and stopped my mouth full of hay; and I am sure that is the man that stopped my mouth full of hay; and took my bonnet away.</p>
               <p>You are sure? - Yes, Sir, I am quite sure.</p>
               <p>Did you know either of the other men? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. My girl, what led you to know him? - I had seen him come up and down the court.</p>
               <p>How long has he lived there? - I cannot say, because I do not know.</p>
               <p>How often have you seen him? - Ever so many times.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of his business? - No, that I do not.</p>
               <p>Can you tell where he got the hay? - No, I did not look, I believe it came from the hay-stack that was just by us.</p>
               <p>Was there a hay-stack just by you? - Yes, Sir, there was.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Was there a haystack? - There was hay in the field.</p>
               <p>Court to the Child. Do you mean fresh cut hay, a hay-cock? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. What is your occupation, Mr. Cole? - I belong to Mr. Bullock's brewhouse; my daughter told me she knew the prisoner, and that he lived in their back court.</p>

               <p>Who had you lodged with you? - The prisoner and his brothers, and his mother, and they were all at home in the afternoon, and I was at the door; the room that I supped at was about a yard from the stairs foot; they were all at home, the prisoner was at home, and I went to a little garden which I have, that is about a yard from the door, I went to the garden gate, I did not go farther, and Mr. Duckett went along with me; then I bid him a good night, and he bid me a good night, then I went in and bolted the door, then they were at home, all of them; and about half an hour eight, the servant maid came there for the pots, and the eldest brother came and brought down<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150044"></xptr> the pots, and he bolted the door and she went away.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you know in point of fact that the prisoner was at home? - I saw him at home at nine o'clock, looking over his eldest brother's shoulder; his eldest brother is taller than him; this was on Sunday night the first of August.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Garrow.</p>
               <p>What trade are you? - I am a shoemaker.</p>
               <p>You are pretty much at home? - Yes, the prisoner and his brothers are never out of evenings, they are very quiet good sort of people, I do not know that they are ever out of a Sunday in the day time, much more at night.</p>
               <p>Did they never stir out that day? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect what sort of evening it was? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It was a very dark night? - Yes, it was darkish.</p>
               <p>If I recollect it rained hard that night? - I cannot say it did.</p>
               <p>But it was particularly dark? - I cannot tell, I lighted a candle when I went to bed, it was nine o'clock exactly.</p>
               <p>Until that time you were all assembled in the neighbourhood, was the door open? - No, the door was bolted at nine.</p>
               <p>How happened it then that it was necessary to unbolt it at half past eight; when was it that one of the brothers got up to unbolt the door, to give the pots to the pot girl? - That was at nine, she came presently after I was in bed.</p>
               <p>You said at half past eight? - It was half past eight; what did I say before?</p>
               <p>Never mind what you did say.</p>
               <p>Court. Attend very much to what you say, because your story at present is totally inconsistent with what you said before? - I might mistake, but my meaning is this; the girl brought the beer at half after eight, then I went into the yard, then I went to bed at nine o'clock, then the girl came for the pot, and the eldest brother came down with it: I do not know that I did say half past eight.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Now a word or two more? - Sir, I have no more to say about it.</p>
               <p>No, but I have; what day of the month was this? - The 1st of August.</p>
               <p>How long is that ago? - Why, it was the month before the last; I am no scholar.</p>
               <p>But you can tell how many weeks it was ago? - It may be five or six weeks ago; it was the 1st of August, on a Sunday night.</p>
               <p>What makes you remember the day so particularly? - Because he was taken up the day after.</p>
               <p>You attended at the Justice's and told all this story? - No, I did not, I attended at the Justice's, but I did not say any thing; I told them there were five or six that would contradict the evidence of the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>But you did not tell the Justice you was one? - No; but he was abed, I saw him over his brother's shoulders.</p>
               <p>Now, upon your oath, is not the other brother taller than this? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then explain to us how you saw the shortest over the shoulders of the tallest? - I saw him lean over his shoulders, as it may be so, peeping out of the window.</p>
               <p>Court to Rider. Stand there, let one of the officers look to him.</p>

               <p>I was at home all day, and my wife with me; I was standing from eight to nine in the court, talking to the man that keeps the next house, and between eight and nine, I saw the prisoner looking out of window; then I wished the landlord a good night at nine, and I heard him bolt his door; then I left him and went to bed.</p>

               <p>Did anybody come to the house? - Only a girl with some beer.</p>

               <p>What are you? - I am a weaver.</p>
               <p>Are you acquainted with the prisoner? - No otherwise than seeing him come backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>You recollect perfectly this was the 1st of August, do you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>By what token and circumstance do you recollect this was the 1st of August and not the 8th? - I am sure that was the day.</p>
               <p>But I want to know how you are sure; was your wife brought to bed that day, or any thing of that sort? - No, Sir, nothing of that sort, no otherwise than knowing the day of the month.</p>
               <p>What day of the month is to day now? - I do not know, Sir, I cannot say I do.</p>
               <p>But you perfectly recollect it was the 1st of August? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now cannot you help us to a reason, or something like a reason? - No.</p>
               <p>Had Rider had his supper before you left him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where did he sup? - In the garden.</p>
               <p>Who supped with him? - His wife.</p>
               <p>Any body else; one of these lads, did not he, was it this boy or the brother, which of the two was it? - I believe it was the other.</p>
               <p>You are sure it was one of them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Recollect whether it was not this boy? - No, Sir, I cannot.</p>
               <p>So then after you had supped in the garden, I suppose Rider went into his house quietly, and shut it up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You never saw either of the Gregory's out of door, as you remember, before nine? - No.</p>
               <p>What time did the other boy go up, about nine or before? - Rather before nine.</p>
               <p>Did he pay any thing towards the beer? - Not to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>What sort of a night was it, a very dark one? - There were a few stars in the sky.</p>
               <p>Nothing like a moon I take it for granted? - No, not that I could perceive.</p>

               <p>Court to the Prisoner. I do not wish to curtail you in your defence, it is a very serious thing to make a bad case worse by a false defence; these two witnesses that you have brought contradict themselves: anybody you choose to call, do so; but for God's sake do not call people to perjure themselves, they can do you no good.</p>

               <p>Court to Prisoner. Now, prisoner, do you think you can do yourself any good by calling these witnesses to contradict themselves in this shocking manner.</p>

               <p>Court to Levi. What day was it you went to the house? - On the Monday.</p>
               <p>Pray what account did you find there given, had you any conversation with Rider? - Yes, he said, he was in bed that night, that he fastened the door, and the mother came down and opened the door.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, upon the whole of this case, you will decide the fate of this young man; the circumstances upon which he must be convicted, are chiefly the positive evidence of that child, she swears very positively to him, and she seems to do it with great innocence, and great ingenuity; but at the same time, to be sure, you will make great allowances where a man's life is concerned, for a mistake or misapprehension of a child of that age; however, she tells you she had seen him often go down the court, that he lived in the next court to her, and the father says, the moment after when they quitted him, she told him she knew him, and then told her mother; and Levi says, when she was before the Justice, she singled him out among fifty; the father also speaks very positively to him, but not with such a degree of certainty as the girl, because he does not pretend that he ever saw him before; therefore, all that enables him to swear to the prisoner, is from the view he had of him while the robbery was committed; if it rested merely upon that, to be sure you would hesitate a little: I think it rather difficult for a man thrown down as he was, and this man standing some yards from him, to have so clear and distinct a view of him: however, this circumstance you will take with you, that though the child told him that was the man, that lived in the court just behind their house, that could not lead him to single him out before the justice, because he did not know him: if you believe the prisoner's witnesses, that the girl and the father are mistaken, of course you will acquit him these people contradict themselves very much in the account they have given, and where alibi's are set up, it is only in little circumstances<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150048"></xptr> that witnesses can be detected, for they are led to suppose they shall be examined to one particular fact only; it is therefore in the little circumstances of this story, that they do contradict themselves, whether this one or the other, supped in a garden or room, or below or above stairs: in the grand and main point to be sure, that he was at home during that night, they all have spoken very positively: I therefore say no more about it, but that if you think they spoke the truth as to the fact of his being at home during that night, perhaps you will forgive the inaccuracies and little contradictions you have observed; but if you think from those contradictions the whole is a made up story, that they have met together, and concerted such a plan to enable them to say, he was at home during the whole of that afternoon, of course then it will throw discredit upon the whole of their testimony: but if you think that though they forgot those little circumstances, though they have not observed them, yet still in point of fact they are right, and they are not mistaken, of course then you will acquit him. As to character, they have given him that sort of character, that a lad of his age will have before he takes to bad courses; if you find yourselves embarrassed from all these circumstances, and think very possibly it may be true, notwithstanding this little girl and the father do so positively believe he robbed them, that he was at home that night; in short, if any doubt at all hangs upon your minds, if you feel the least suspicions, any balance at all, you know it is much the safest way, and it must be most pleasant to you, to lean to the merciful side and acquit him.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. Did you see the prisoner after the robbery was committed, till you saw him at the Justices? - The first time I saw him was when he robbed me, and the second time was when we took him up.</p>

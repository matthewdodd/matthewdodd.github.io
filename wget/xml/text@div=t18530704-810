                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police inspector</hi>). On Thursday, 16th June, I saw Griffin at the Red Lion in the City-road—the prisoner Fitch was there, and I heard Griffin say in his presence, "That is the man I had the paper of"—I said to Fitch, "Is that so?"—he said, "Yes, I bought it of a strange man in Thames-street, and gave him a guinea for it"—I know Fitch in the neighbourhood as a porter—he does not deal in paper that I am aware of—I said I should take him in charge for receiving the paper, well knowing it to be stolen from the establishment of Mr. Fitch, and took him to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wholesale stationer, of No. 3, Old Fish-street-hill. This paper is my property—none of the prisoners are in my employ—I know Griffin's father—he is a general dealer—I should say Griffin has never come to my premises—I have missed a large quantity of paper during the last twelve months—I communicated with the police—the wholesale value of this paper is 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this memorandum book has my private mark on it, both the cost and the selling price.</p>

I am the wife of James Lee, who keeps the Red Lion in Great Wild-street, Drury-lane—on 12th June, the prisoner came into our house, together with Henry Jackson, at about half-past 5 in the evening—Jackson asked for some shrub, I told him I had not got any in the bottle—then he said to North, "Shall we have spruce?"—North said "Yes"—he then asked for half a-quartern of spruce—I served them with it; the</p>

Jackson said, "I will pay, I have got some halfpence"—he put his hand in his pocket and pulled out some halfpence; he was about paying, when North said, "Never mind, I may as well change this." I gave him back the florin—I put it on the counter when Jackson was about paying me the halfpence—North took it up, and put it in his pocket; then he put the bad florin on the counter—I then said, "You have rung the changes"—I took it up and said, "You shall not have it back," and I broke it in the detector. I✗ turned round and said to my husband, "Look here, they have rung the changes"—he came from the parlour, and I gave him the bad florin—I went round to the prisoner and said, "You ought to have a punch of the head"—they did not say any<lb></lb>thing—I called in the policeman and gave them in charge.</p>

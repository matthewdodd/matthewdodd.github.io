                  </hi>. I keep the Perseverance beerhouse, Ironmonger Lane—on 30th October the prisoners came in, and Knight ordered a pot of stout and mild, and gave me a florin—I put it in the till—there was no other florin there—I gave him the change, and then he asked for twopennyworth of bread and cheese, and paid in copper—Knight then ordered another pot of stout and mild, and paid with another florin, which I found was bad—I then took the first florin from the till and put the two together under the counter, gave him the change, and sent for a constable—Knight was going, and I told him I wanted to speak to him, and I put the bolt down—he said "What do you want?"—I said "You have been passing bad money"—he made for the door—I took him by the collar, and he dragged me outside and threw me down—I gave him in custody with the florins—the prisoners all drank out of the same pot.</p>

I live at 166, Shepherd's Walk—I was in Mr. Pratt's beerhouse, and saw the prisoners and two others—they called for beer, and a florin—was tendered—after that Knight paid twopence for some bread and cheese with two pence; more drink was then served—I saw a florin on the counter, but do not know who put it down—Knight took up the change, and was going out, but the landlord took him on one side; he threw the landlord on the floor, and tried to rush out of the house—I assisted the landlord, and the prisoner was given in charge——he took something from his pocket wrapped in newspaper, which he handed to Stokes, who put it in his pocket; but a piece of paper and a florin fell on the floor, which Dampierre picked up—Stokes disappeared—I saw Wildsmith drinking out of the same pot with the others.</p>

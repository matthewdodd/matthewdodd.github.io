Yes, I was in the parlour adjoining the shop, I did not hear the glass break; I did not know any thing of it until the patrole brought the boys into the shop, and said, they had been robbing of it. I lost one pair of shoes; the shoes were taken from the corner of the window; they were within the reach of a hand; the break in the glass was large enough to admit a boy's hand.</p>

            . On the 14th of January, I was patrole of St. Sepulchres. I was in St. John-street; I had known Allcock to be a suspicious character; the two prisoners were loitering about there, and the one that made his escape, they were loitering about at every shop window until they came to the prosecutor's; the two prisoners were placed at the window, and the third over the way watching; the two prisoners committed the act, and the other was over the way upon the look out: I saw Allcock had some instrument in his hand that he cut the window with; he made a cut at it; he went on one way and the other the other way; the moment he drew up to the window, he gave it a cut; the second attempt he made he broke the window; one went one way and the other the other way; I apprehended the two prisoners, and took them both within the shop, searched them, and found the knife that would star the window. These are the shoes.</p>

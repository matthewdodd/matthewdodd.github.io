                  </hi>. I live at 87, King-street, Deptford, and am boiler-man in the employment of Huntleys the engineers—on Saturday, 14th Sep<lb></lb>tember, I and Borne other men went in vans on an excursion to Cremorne—the prisoner is, I believe, a sailor—he is a friend of one of the men—we stayed till 12 o'clock, and then returned to Deptford in the van—I got into the same van with the prisoner going home—we were very much pressed for room, and I asked him to shift a little further—he said that he could not, and he would not—I asked my cousin to make room—she made as much room as she could, and I sat between them—the prisoner said that if I did not get up he would throw me out of the van—I said that I had paid as well as him, and he could not do that—he jumped up and caught me by the coller but I shoved him back on the seat, and we went on to Deptford very peace<lb></lb>ably—when we got to the windmill there, a female with the prisoner said, "Now this big-whiskered fellow shall have it;" and the prisoner threatened that I should "have it" when I got outside—we got out at Gibraltar-street, Deptford, and I told him he had been threatening me inside, and asked him what he meant doing now—he made up to me and attempted to strike me—I defended myself, and turned him round, but we did not go down—we closed again, and I felt a blow on my right wrist—I felt something prick my wrist—I felt severe pain directly—I seized him by the wrist and knocked him down—the female seized me and staggered me till the prisoner got away—I lost sight of him, and believe he got into the van—I found my wrist bleeding tremendously—I went to a doctor with my sister-in-law and got it dressed—I could not see whether the prisoner had anything in his hand when I received the blow, as it was dark—it was about half-part I in the morning—I received a blow from no other person but the prisoner—he was apprehended about 5 o'clock the same morning—when I caught hold of his hand I felt something hard, different from the flesh, but in the straggle I let go—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my coat; it is cut clean through, and there is blood inside the sleeve—I was perfectly sober—I believe the prisoner was fresh.</p>

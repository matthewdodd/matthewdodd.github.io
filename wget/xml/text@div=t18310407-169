            . I am a Policeman. On the 18th of February, between seven and eight o'clock, I stopped the prisoner in Carter's-rents, about a quarter of a mile from Harris, with this tea-caddy under his arm - I asked how he came by it; he said he was going to take it to his brother John - I said, "That is not the question, where did you bring it from?" he said he fetched it from his father; I knew his father, who lived in Quaker-street, about two hundred yards from Harris' - I detained him, and the prosecutrix claimed it next morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PAVNE. Q. He had it under his arm? A. Yes, quite careless - it was wrapped in a cloth, but only partly covered; his parents I believe, are not of the best character - I took him before Mr. Broughtonlon the 18th, and he was discharged; but next morning I took him out of bed, as I heard it was stolen.</p>
               <p>MRS. HARRIS. I am quite sure this is my caddy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you been paid for it? A. His father came to me before I missed it - he asked if I was a mother, and said, "You have got a caddy to sell, what is the price?" I said 18d. - he said, "Will you he satisfied with that? I said Yes; he went out brought 1s. 6d. in about five minutes, - soon after somebody came and said I had done wrong in taking the money, for, I was liable to be prosecuted - I really do not think he took the caddy.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in prince's-street, Barbican—I am a Tuscan and straw hat manufacturer—about eleven o'clock at night, on 4th June, I was on my way from Kingsland to my own house—I was quite sober—I saw the prisoner wrangling with a policeman in front of the George the Fourth, in Old Street-road—there were two young men with him—the policeman was desiring the prisoner to go home—I seconded the policeman in desiring the prisoner to go home, or to remain inside the house till the mob had dispersed—I went into the house with the prisoner, and he asked me to partake of a pot of ale—he seemed very thankful for my interference, and wished me to go home with him—the two young men were with him—I desired them to leave him—I thought they were not fit company—we staid at the public-house about a quarter of an hour—I then went home with the prisoner to his house—I and the two young men went in with him—we had a glass of ginger beer and a pot of ale—the prisoner wished me to pay either for that or another—I told him I had but two country notes, and it was not worth while to change either of them to pay for the pot of beer that he had invited me to partake of—he made some remark that I had not got them, and I took one of the notes out of my pocket—he made some remark that it was a <hi rend="italic">flash</hi> note, not worth five farthings—I took the other note out and laid it on the table for the inspection of the company—the prisoner took them up, rolled them together, and put them in his pocket—I desired him to return them—he would not—I went to the door to call a policeman—the prisoner came to the door, pushed me out, and shut the door behind me—I had received those notes from James Absolom—they were two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes.</p>

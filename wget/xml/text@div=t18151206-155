            . I am a City officer, and was in company with Vaughan, on the 14th of November last, in Holborn; I was following one Connelly, a notorious character, and at that time, the prisoners passed us, and Vaughan said, there goes two more. After they passed <placeName id="t18151206-155-crimeloc850">Hatton Garden</placeName>

I saw Newman put his hand into a gentleman's pocket, and I suspected that he had taken something out. Vaughan at that time crossed the road, and I feared they should see him. They went a little further close to the side of Elyplace, and there attempted the pocket of another gentleman. They both continued in company, and turned up Union-court, Holborn Hill, which leads to Field-lane, towards a noted receiving house; Vaughan and I followed them. Newman was just going in at the door, when I ran forward, and seized hold of him, and Vaughan seized hold of the other prisoner. Newman at the same moment, dropped a handkerchief, and on searching him, I found another, and a knife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Adolphus. I don't know who this gentleman was, nor what was in his pocket.</p>

            . I was with Barrett, on Holborn Hill, it was about six o'clock. I saw the two prisoners pressing a gentleman, and we followed them; just before they came to Hatton Garden, Newman went up to a gentleman, and put his hand into his pocket; the other was covering him. We apprehended them going into Mother Dyna's, in Fieldlane.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus, on the part of the prisoners, objected to the foundation of this indictment, and conceived that nothing could be made of it at all, because the indictment started, that they put and placed themselves close by a certain person unknown, and that one of them put his hand into the pocket of a coat, upon a person unknown, with intent the goods and chattels therein contained, to steal, take, and carry away. When, for ought any one knew to the contrary, there was nothing in the pocket at all.</p>
               <p>In the second place, this was not done under any cognizence of the Police Act; for that only enabled the officers of Justice to apprehend such persons as they knew to be notorious characters, and to deal with them as vagrants only.</p>
               <p>And, in the third place, no intent at all was alledged to the prisoner Moore.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds, contra, submitted, that the attempt to commit a felony was an offence, and that the quoanimo was the principal thing to be looked at. The prisoners were charged simply with an attempt to commit a robbery, and he conceived that from the mouths of his witnesses, he had fully established that entent.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland, on the same side urged a similar answer, and the mischief that would arise from the admisubility of his Learned Friend on the other side's argument.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus, again contended, that there was no Overt Act, or Asportavit, that could constitute an indictable offence.</p>
               <p>THE COURT, was of opinion, that the argument of the Learned Gentlemen who was concerned for the prisoners was invalid.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus, then addressed the jury, on the novelty of this spicies of the indictment, and assimulated it to an accusation against a man for an intent to commit</p>
               <p>"Arson, in desects of Chabia," where there was no ignitable substance, because he had a lighted torch in his hand. Here the prisoners were charged with an attempt to pick the empty pocket of a coat, on an unknown person.</p>

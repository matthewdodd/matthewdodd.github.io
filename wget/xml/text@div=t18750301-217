I was house-surgeon at Westminster hospital—I examined Norah Conden there on 14th February—she was very much exhausted from loss of blood from a wound on her head 1 1/4 inch long and a 1/4 inch deep, and exposing the bone, such a wound as might be made by a poker—she was afterwards attended by the hospital surgeon—she was in a very weak state, and could not go to work for some days—she was still very weak last week when I examined her.</p>

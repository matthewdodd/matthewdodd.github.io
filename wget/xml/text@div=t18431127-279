                  </hi>. I am a butcher, at St. George's-market. Nellyer was in my employ—it was his duty to take the waste fat to Mr. Brooks's, the tallow-chandler's, Southwark Bridge-road—on the 17th of Nov. I directed him to take some—Turner lived seven or eight feet from my stable-door—I have since seen the fat at the station—I knew it—one part of it I had in my hand several times the same day—it was part of the gut fat, which we use to serve the Jews—I could swear to it.</p>

             HAMILTON. I am a serjeant in the third regiment of foot guards. I was in company with Hull on the evening of the 17th, between four and five o'clock. Hull put his hand into his pocket to take out his purse, to take a piece of money out. After that I saw Hull put his hand into his pocket again to take out his purse. He immediately said his purse and his money was gone. He sit upon the table a little bit, and then went and told the landlord. The prisoner Price went to the landlord, and desired him to send for a constable. The prisoner and Hull came from the bar into the tap-room. Hull then said in the tap-room, if any person had got it, and would deliver it up to him, he would say no more about it. A few minutes after that, suspicion aroso among the people in the tap-room, that Price had got the purse and the money. I went and asked the landlord if Price had been out of the house. He said, No. Price was then standing by the bar. I pushed Price backwards, with his back against the hatchway that led down into the cellar. I told Price that he was accused of being the man that had taken the money, if he had got it, he had better deliver it up. He denied knowing any thing of it. I kept my eye upon him all the time. I observed him raise his right hand and reach it over the bar-door leading down into the cellar. I said, Hull, watch Prices's right hand that is over the half-door. Hull stepped up, and laid hold of Price's wrist, and drew his hand over the half-door; in his hand we found the purse and the four one pound notes. I saw them. Hull took the purse, and shewed it all the people in the tap-room. Hull asked him if he was not a rogue for taking his money; the prisoner said it was done out of a joke.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they been joking together - A. Not as I saw; they had been drinking together.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hull. How long have you known the prisoner - A. Two months; we had been drinking together near two hours.</p>

               <p>Q. You found the money in his hand, did you - A. I did; this is the money, and this is the purse.</p>
               <p>MR. ADAMS. I am the landlord of the Red Lion. When I heard of the loss of the purse and the money the prosecutor and the prisoner came to the bar. Hull said he had been robbed; Price seemed very much hurt at the man losing his money. Price said it was hard for one man to sit by another, and to be robbed of his money; they went into the tap-room. I heard Hull say in the tap-room, if any person had taken his pocket-book, and would deliver it up to him, he would say no more about it. Price said to Hull, recollect what company you have been in; suspicion arose upon Price; the serjeant insisted a constable should be sent for. I saw Price's hand catched hold of by Hull; he took the purse out of Price's hand and throwed it into my wife's lap; he said, if my money is in the purse, it is four one pound notes. My wife opened the purse and it contained four one pound notes. Kennedy the officer took the prisoner into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner - A. A <rs id="t18141130-57-deflabel357" type="occupation">pipemaker</rs>

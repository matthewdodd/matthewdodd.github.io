I took the prisoners into custody at No. 10, Newcastle Court, at about half past 3 o'clock on the morning of 15th Aug.—Poole was in bed—I had seen him three or four times before, the same morning—I had seen him without coat and boots—the corner window of Mr. Whitmore's faces Greyhound Court—I had passed them both in the court between 12 and 2 o'clock—at the station Dineen said that Poole asked leave of his master to allow him (Dineen) to go and help him clean the pots; and when he closed the house, a little before 12 o'clock, Poole cut a notch at the bottom of the bolt where the shutter drops, and left the window unfastened—this was in the presence of Mr. Whitmore—Poole was not present—both the prisoners confessed to being in the house—Dineen stated that Poole told him to come out, and put the shutter up, and watch for a policeman, and whilst he was attempting to put the shutter up it fell down into the court, and gave the alarm—Poole left his employers at about 12 o'clock, and went home with Dineen to Newcastle Court to take their boots off; they put them behind the door, and went back to Mr. Whitmore's house to watch for an opportunity to get in—Dineen stated that they pulled the shutter out with a knife, and both got into the house—after Dineen had finished telling me his statement, I went and asked Poole how he came to get into the house, and what he got in for—he told me he had got in after his master's coppers—(<hi rend="italic">The</hi> COURT <hi rend="italic">considered that this evidence must be excluded, the officer having no right to ask questions and not having even cautioned the prisoner</hi>)—I asked him first where he had been to the previous night—he said that he was asleep there—he wanted to go home; and when I took him down stairs, and brought Poole down</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a public house in Greyhound Court. I went with a constable to take Poole into custody—I heard Dineen make a statement—Poole was a little before us; he said, "I met Poole one evening in the Strand, and he said, 'Will you assist me in robbing my master's house to-night; I can get plenty of money, and I shall have more time'"—those are his very words—he then said that Poole proposed to him that he should ask me on Friday evening—he did say to me, "Will you allow my cousin to come in and help me with the pots?"—I said, "Who is your cousin?"—he said, "He has lived in this situation before"—when Dineen was confess<lb></lb>ing to me, he said that he met my boy in the street, and asked him for the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. he owed him, and he said, "Will you assist me in robbing my master's house to-night, and then we shall have plenty of money to-morrow?"—that he hesitated a little, but consented to do so—Poole then said to him, "I will ask my master to allow you to come and help me to finish my work to night;" when Poole came in he asked me, and said, 'I have asked my master, and you can come'—we both went in the evening; when I was in, Poole gave me an old piece of stuff that he took out of a drawer, to make a bag, and a needle; I made a bag to put the coppers in; I handed him a knife to cut the hole in the window shutter, where the bolt drops in, and he kept the knife in his pocket to move the shutter; we went about 1 o'clock, intending to get in; we got in, and Poole said to me, 'You had better get outside, and put the shutter up;' in getting up I knocked my shoulder against the shutter, and the shutter fell flat in the court"—Redstall was walking on with Poole when Dineen told me this—where the shutter bolt drops in, appeared safe on the inside; when I went outside the shutter would come out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to John Brogden, jun., who is carrying on the works of the South-Eastern Railway Company at Woolwich. A stack of old bricks was placed in a particular part, almost opposite the George the Fourth, for Mr. Brogden's use—part of the George the Fourth has been since taken down—I remember the sale of some old houses, which were to be taken down for the railway; I cannot recollect when that was—Mr. Davis sold the pro<lb></lb>perty—I believe there was more than one sale—I know Mr. Watson purchased one of those houses, which was close by the side of where I was living, in King-street—I should say that house was better than 100 yards from the stack of bricks—that house was taken down after that sale—the stack of bricks was taken away before the house was pulled down—Mr. Davis came and asked me where the boundary-wall was, (the stack of bricks was part of the boundary-wall,) I looked, and the stack of bricks was gone—the house Watson bought was then partly pulled down—in consequence of what Mr. Davis said, I said to Hawley, "You have done a fine thing for yourself this morning"—he said, "What is that?"—I said, "You have sold the bricks belonging to this boundary"—(the stack, and the shed, and the wall, com<lb></lb>posed the boundary)—he said, "I will go down to Mr. Davis's office and</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carter, in the employ of Mr. Cook, of Plumstead. Towards the latter end of April I was employed in carting some bricks from Woolwich—I was employed by the Messrs. Watsons—they were both together—we were carting them from a house in King-street—while I was carting from there, young Mr. Watson spoke to me—they were both together—they called me from the house to come to cart some from a place opposite the George the Fourth—it was bricks and tiles—I took three loads from there, by Mr. Wat<lb></lb>son's direction, to his houses, at the back of the White Horse, which he keeps, at New Charlton—young Mr. Watson helped me to load the bricks from the stack—they were old bricks—the elder Watson was standing close against the cart while we were loading—I only took three loads from the stack—Vaughan was employed with me—he took four loads.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer. I sold by auction some old houses for Mr. Brogden, to be taken down—I think the last sale was on 26th April-Mr. Watson bought a house then—I cannot charge my memory as to what he gave for it, I suppose between 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were sold in separate lots—he bought one house, it was in King-street—I remember a stack of old bricks that had been placed opposite the George the Fourth—shortly after the sale I observed that stack was missing (they had been stacked there by my express orders, for the purpose of being used by Mr. Brogden on the line)—I inquired of one of Mr. Brogden's foremen, and spoke to Mr. Watson, jun., I asked him what right he had to remove them—he said, "I bought them, or my father did, and my father is at the public-house"—Mr. Watson, sen., was coming from the public-house, and I said to him, "What right had you to remove them?"—he said, "I bought them"—I said, "Certainly they were not included in the property you bought, you had nothing to do with them"—he said he had bought them of somebody else, and paid for them, that was enough—he did not say they were sold at the sale—there were no stacks of bricks sold in the sale, they were all houses—I said, "Who have you bought them of?"—the answer was, "No matter, I have bought them"—I might have put the question a second or a third time before I got that answer—I was very vexed about it—I then said, "If you do not tell me who you bought them of I will lock you up"—he said, "You may lock me up if you please"—I said, "Now mind, I am as serious as ever I was in my life"—he said, "I bought them of a little man at the engineer's</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose any carpetting in June last - A. I lost a great deal in former days.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know of fourteen yards and a half being taken away - A. Yes; that was taken the 21st of June, the fourteen yards and a half; it was standing in the front window, in the shew window; it was within the house; I expose nothing outside of my window. I had seen it at half past two o'clock. I missed it directly one of my men came in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060037"></xptr>from his dinner. I was standing with my man and my wife; my wife looked round, and gave the alarm; I missed the piece of carpeting immediately my wife gave the alarm, I pursued the prisoner; he was overtaken; he threw the carpet from him in Well-street; I saw the carpet come from him, it went into the kennel. He was taken at the corner of Union-street; he went to the top of Well-street before he was taken. I never lost sight of him only when he turned round the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him at your shop, did you - A. Yes, I did. The carpet is here; some of my work people picked it up; there is fourteen yards and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. What did it cost you a yard - A. The cost is a great deal more than what I charge; it cost six shillings a yard in the piece; carpets are rather fallen now; it is worth four shillings, or four shillings and sixpence a yard now. This is the carpet; it is mine.</p>

            . I am a chair-maker; I work for Mr. Cleland. I came into Mr. Cleland's, and was talking with him; I heard the alarm, and I pursued the prisoner, and never lost sight of him. I was the first that pursued him out of the house; I saw him throw down the carpet about twenty yards up Well-street. I saw him taken; he was taken about twenty yards off me; I was the next that came up. The prisoner is the person.</p>

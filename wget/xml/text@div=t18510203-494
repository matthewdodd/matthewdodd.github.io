                  </hi>. I live at the Colonial Training-school, Great Ann-street, Westminster; the prisoners lived there. On 27th Dec, between six and seven in the evening, I was lying down ill in the bed-room, and saw Townley, and Moore who has not been taken, come into the room; they spoke together, but I did not hear what they said—they could have seen me, but they did not look towards me—Moore opened a box belonging to the Institution, in which the clothes are kept, and took out some trowsers, coats, a piece of velvet, a piece of cloth, a waistcoat, and several other articles, and tied them up in a bundle—Townley was talking to him at the time; they then both went out together, Moore carrying the bundle-about five minutes after Timmins came in bringing the same bundle apparently, it was tied in the same handkerchief—he put it down while he opened the window, took it up, and attempted to throw it out, but the noise of the boys running up and down-stairs prevented him—Edes then came in and asked Timmins what he was doing—Timmins said, "Oh, nothing, in</p>

               <p>a minute I will tell you"—Bonifacio, another inmate, then came in and asked them where Townley and Moore were—they said they believed they were in the school-room—that is down-stairs—Bonifacio went down and Edes followed him—Timmins took up the bundle, put it in the cupboard, and followed them—I got up and followed also—I saw the bundle opened in the Governor's parlour, it contained the articles I have mentioned—Timmins and Edes both tried to throw it out of the bed-room window.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inmate of this Institution. On 27th Dec. I was lying down in the same room as Barham, and saw Townley and Moore come in; they whispered together, went to the box, and Moore took out some property and wrapped it up in a handkerchief—they both left the room, Moore carrying the bundle—a few minutes after that Tim<lb></lb>mins came in carrying the same handkerchief—it appeared to be the same size and appearance—he put the bundle on the floor, opened the window, took the bundle up again and tried to throw it out, and the boys just outside running up and down prevented him—Edes then came in and spoke to him, but I could not hear what was said—they both looked out of the window together, with the bundle in their hands—they tried to throw it out, and a lad coming up-stairs prevented them, and asked them where Townley and Moore were—Edes then went down-stairs—Timmins had dropped the bundle when the lad came in, and he took it up again and put it into the cupboard at the further end of the room—I afterwards looked out at the window and saw Townley and Moore standing against a wall opposite, and whistling—some one hearing the whistle, ran there; Townley was taken, but Moore escaped—I have no doubt about the prisoners being the persons; plenty of light comes in from the Queen's Stores, opposite.</p>

On 27th Dec. this bundle was brought into my parlour—the things in it are the property of the Institution—neither of the prisoners had any authority to take them—there is a light in the Queen's Stores opposite, which shines into this room, and it is quite light.</p>

On the 27th of October, the Prisoner (who used to go on Errands in the House) came up into my Room with a Gold Ring enamel'd, upon her Finger. I asked her, whose it was? She said, it was Mrs. Renward's. I bid her carry it down Stairs again, and put it into Mrs. Renward's Room. She went down, and said she would do so. After this Renward gave her a Guinea to fetch her a Gill of Wine, and she not returning again, I was employ'd to search after her. The third Time I was at her Lodging, I found her, and she had deck'd herself up very handsomely. I ask'd her, where the Rings were? She told me, she knew nothing of them. As I had seen one of them before upon her Finger, I got Mr. Jones at the Elephant and Castle in Fleet Lane, to take Charge of her; and then she acknowledged, she had taken one of them. I took her at her Lodging over against the Three Daggers upon Saffron-Hill.</p>

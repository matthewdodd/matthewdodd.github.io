             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant to Lord Abergavenny. About seven o'clock in the morning of the 4th of May, the prisoner rang the bell. I asked him what he wanted? He said he was sent to clean his lordship's windows; he had a brush in his hand.</p>

               <p>Did your windows want cleaning? - No; he came in, he said he was to clean the kitchen windows, and the parlour windows, but he did not know whether he was to clean the fore looking windows or the back looking windows; he went down into the kitchen; I went with him.</p>
               <p>Did you ask him any questions how he came to be employed? - No, I did not; he asked me for the steps, I gave them to him, and he set them out in the passage that goes out of the kitchen into the servant's hall.</p>
               <p>Did the kitchen windows look into that passage? - Yes; he got upon the steps and pretended to clean the windows; there were some things in the kitchen windows; he told me I must take them out; he then went up into the house keeper's room; I followed him. He asked me for a duster to clean those windows. I gave him one. He said he would clean that window first; he fetched<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280141"></xptr> the steps out of the passage and set them down in the house-keeper's room beside the window. I went out of the room to fetch my broom to sweep the room, and left him in it; as I was going up the passage with the broom I heard the door of the press, in which the spoons were kept, creek. I went into the room; as I was going in he came out of the room; he went out and left the outer door open. He said, he was going on the outside to the other window, as I understood.</p>
               <p>Had you no suspicion when you heard the door creek? - Yes, and that made me make the more expedition into the room. He said nothing when I went in; I passed him and he passed me; he went out at the door; he left his brush and duster on the area steps and went over the rails; I saw no more of him. I looked directly after him, because the doors were open.</p>
               <p>Where the doors shut before? - Yes; they did not use to be locked; the key was in the door; I am sure they were shut. I put the things, mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) in the press the night before. I saw them there about nine o'clock that evening; when I went into the room I looked into the press, they were all missing.</p>
               <p>What is the value of these things you missed? - The tea-spoons are worth twelve shillings, the sugar tongs seven or eight shillings, the table-spoons about ten shillings a piece, I do not know that the napkins were there of my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Jury. Are you certain the prisoner is the man? - Yes, he had the same wig on, to the best of my knowledge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. John Cassell. In consequence of information, I went to a house in Water-lane on 11th Dec.—we procured a candle, and Mr. Darkin and me, and the policeman went—I saw about two reams of double double crown paper on the opposite counter—I work for Mr. Cassell, and know the paper used in his office—it is a peculiar size, and very large—on seeing it, Mr. Darkin said, "This paper is the same size as is used by us; there is no doubt it belongs to us"—it was taken to the station—the prisoner was in the house—he said he would have it weighed first.</p>

I went to the prisoner's house, in Water-lane—I saw on the table, or counter, about two reams of this peculiar-sized paper—I should not be able to identify it by any other means than its general appearance—I said, "In all probability, this also is our paper"—the prisoner, I think, said, "No, no; that can't be; that is my property"—the policeman said, "All paper must be taken to the office"—the prisoner insisted on its being weighed, and he chalked down the weight on a board—when at the station, I pointed to the paper, and asked the prisoner, as he had intimated to me that the paper was his own, if he had any objection to state from whom he got it—his answer was that he did not claim it as his property, that I was mistaken, that he had it from the same party early the same morning—I understood he meant Walters—I believe he pointed or made a motion towards Walters, who was sitting on a form in the same station.</p>

I went to the prisoner's house in the evening of 11th Dec.—I found the room dark—I got a light, and saw the prisoner standing in the corner of the room—before I had a light, I called, "Is any one here?" and no one answered—when I saw the prisoner in the corner of the room, I said, "Why did you not answer me when I spoke?"—he made me no answer—I saw two reams of paper on the counter—he said, "That is my paper; I will have it weighed before it goes out of my place, or I might be robbed of it before it was returned to me again."</p>

               <p>Court. It has a spring lock? - Yes, I am sure that I shut it, I tried with my hand after I had shut it, I did not come home till it was all over, and they had taken the men into custody and carried them into the publick-house, I saw nobody till these men were taken to the compter.</p>

               <p>Mr. Peat, Council for Prisoners. Did not you say before the Justice that you had double locked the door? - No, I said I had pulled it too, and put my hand against it.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I came home on the 31st of March before my wife, and I found the casement open and the door open, and I went in and found the screen that we have round our fire place was put a little backward, and I saw a light on the outside over the chamber, and I heard the trampling of feet over head, and I thought it was my dame as I call her, and I called at the stairfoot and said, halloo dame, says I, is it you, which is my usual way of talking, and no answer was made me, I called the second time, halloo dame, are you coming down, no answer, and then they immediately rushed down stairs, then I thought there were some thieves in the house, or somebody that there should not be, and I made away to the door, and got it in my hand, and jammed it fast, and they were both pulling up against me to get by me.</p>
               <p>What time was this? - Between the hours of eight and nine, while we were pulling together one against the other, one of them, but I cannot say which, struck me with this stick, as I suppose, for I was cut over the knuckles to make me quit my hold of the door, and one of them says, damn him, cut his hands off.</p>
               <p>Do you know which said that? - No, it is out of my power.</p>
               <p>Had they any thing in their hands to cut your hands off with? - Not that I can tell, then I made an alarm, and many people came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270063"></xptr> about with pokers and tongs, and one thing or another, and when they found they were overpowered, and that the house was beset, they went into a little cellar that we have, and there they were taken.</p>
               <p>Are you sure these are the two men that run down against you at the door? - It was dark my Lord, I could not swear that, but these are the two men that were taken in my cellar.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Yes, I am sure of that, there is no way of coming to my house but at the front door, there is no yard, no backside to my house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. It was the outside of the door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was a good deal alarmed and frightened? - Yes, any body would.</p>
               <p>You did not observe whether any persons went in but those of your neighbours then? - I know nothing more, I went up stairs, and they had got an apron, and spread in the room and taken out these little trinkets and things, they were not all worth one shilling I suppose, which they had taken out of this drawer.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Barber. They were in the drawer before.</p>
               <p>What was there in the apron? - A half handkerchief, and a piece of a cap, and a bit of linen, these things were in the drawers when I went out, and they were all shut but not locked, the apron belonged to one of the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. Did you examine the drawers immediately before you went out? - I had taken some of my things out before that day, I saw them, and had them in my hand.</p>

               <p>Court. Are you sure that the two prisoners are the two men that they brought up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you go with them to the Justice's? - Yes, I attended the sitting Alderman next day, I know nothing more, I was examined before the Alderman, I gave the same account then as I do now.</p>
               <p>Prisoners. When we were examined before the Alderman, that gentleman who says now we were taken out of the house, said, my young fellows, we will have a good weeks work out of each of you.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. There had been a bag of nails lost before? - A. Yes, I believe there had.</p>
               <p>Q. And there was a wicked rogue or two, of the names of Birchley and Berry, that said you had taken them? - A. I heard amlost as much.</p>
               <p>Q. That Birchley and Berry said you were the thief? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you would be up to them for that? - A. No; I don't know that I ever said such a word in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not swear that you would be revenged of them for saying you had stole the nails? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say about it? - A. I don't know that I said a word about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Charged with stealing a bag of nails and not say a word about it? - A. I did not do it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say about it when you were charged with it in the yard? - A. Upon my life I don't know that I heard them say so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say you would be revenged on them for it. - What makes you so long answering? - A. Upon my life, I hope you will excuse me, I am hard of hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you so long answering? - A. I know nothing about the nails.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been employed in the yard? - A. Six weeks, or two months.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever employed there before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago? - A. Upwards of two years.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been to sea since, I believe? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to leave the yard; was it burning with ardor to fight for your country? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I shrewdly guess that you were turned away? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I have not a right to ask you whether you stole them, but, upon your oath, were you not turned away upon a charge of stealing bolts? - A. I was charged with stealing bolts.</p>
               <p>Q. And Mr. Hicks turned you away because you were charged with stealing them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And, two months ago, you told him you would leave off your old tricks if he would take you again? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were turned off, he brought you and the bolts together into the yard? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And, after this, you helped to find the copper that was stole; - hiders can find I am told? - A. I found it.</p>

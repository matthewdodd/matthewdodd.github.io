                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Oxford-street. On Saturday morning, the 15th of March, about a quarter to eight o'clock, I was next door, and received information, I went to my shop, and missed thirty-nine yards of doe-skin, which I had seen not five minutes before standing by the wall, above the counter of the shop—I had left my errand-boy there—I went down Portman-street, up Bryanstone-street,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184504070038"></xptr>
               <p>and in the door-way of No. 4, I saw the prisoner in the act of putting it into a bag, or putting a wrapper over it—I saw what it was, and said, "You are the thief who stole my cloth"—he said "Yes, I am"—I tried to catch hold of him, but having slippers on, I missed him—he went down Bryanston-street—I followed him directly, calling "Stop thief!"—he began calling "Stop thief!" also—he was stopped near the corner of Lower Berkeley-street and Portman-square—I never lost sight of him an instant—he was given into custody—I left the cloth where it was—it was brought to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 15th of March my master left me in the shop, and as I was taking down the shutters, a young man came and asked if I knew of a porter's place—while I turned my back he had got the roll of cloth from the middle of the shop, and put it in front of the window outside—I went to call master, returned with him, and saw the same young man with the cloth under his arm, and a wrapper thrown over it—he went towards Portman-street—master went after him and I fol<lb></lb>lowed—when master called "Stop thief!" he called also—I saw him stopped, and am quite sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

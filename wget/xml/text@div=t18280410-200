               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. This lace is on a cap? A. Yes; the cap is not mine - I know the lace by the pattern - it had been on a cap of mine; here are two pieces on the cap; only one is mine - the candlesticks are broken in pieces: they were broken, but not as they are now; I found them in a basket, with some rags; I had two yards of this lace - I know the blanket by the pattern - she owes my husband some money; she said the broken brass was given her by my servant.</p>
               <p>MR. J. ALLEY. Q. Is there any mark on the candlesticks? A. Here is a mark of some lead, where my husband tried to mend it; they were in pieces, but not broken - My sister had sent me the lace; it was exactly of this pattern.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 24th of March I went to the prisoner's room with the prosecutrix and others; I searched for a quarter of an hour, and by the side of the bed I found these candlesticks, tied up, in a basket - I found also the blanket and cap.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not the prosecutrix say the lace on the cap was hers? A. Yes; she did not say only part of it was hers.</p>
               <p>JAMES BOND. I missed these candlesticks, and know them to be mine, by a mark which I made on one of them by turning a tap; and I mended this one with lead.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that the candlesticks were given to her as old metal by the prosecutrix's servant.</p>

I called for assistance; he was secured in the room, and some keys, and a long spike nail found in his hat. He threw the nail under the bed, just before the officer came, I heard it fall, but did not see him throw it - I suppose he used it to wrench the padlock off. The property was worth 1 l.</p>

            . I am an unfortunate girl, and live at No. 39, Spring-street. I go backwards and forwards to the house the prosecutrix lives in. On the 22d of January, I went out with her - I locked the padlock for her, and had the key in my pocket. I returned with her, and found the staple drawn, the door open, and somebody shut it against us; it was forced open, and the prisoner found inside, and the things tied up, they were in their proper places before. It was dark when we went out.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took him in charge and found six door keys in his hat, and a spike nail in the room - he said he got there by mistake. I found no money on him. The things were tied up, in the middle of the room.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming from the West India Docks, and met this woman, and went home with her, (Here the prisoner's language was exceedingly indelicate) I went away, and said I would call to-morrow-I told my shipmates of it, they laughed at me. Next night, between five and six o'clock, I went and found the door open, and the bundle in the middle of the room. I could not find her all over the house, and sat by the fire, supposing she was moving, when she returned, and said she would swear tomorrow that I broke the door open. I could have robbed her, and gone away if I liked. I found the keys in Farmer-street, and cleaned them to sell. I never saw the nail.</p>

               <p>How long did she continue at your lodging? - One month.</p>
               <p>Did she pay her lodging? - It was three shillings a week, and I had seven shillings out of twelve; I missed the things a week before she went away.</p>
               <p>Did she continue to lodge with you after you missed the things? - She was there one week after.</p>
               <p>How happened that? - I do not know; she continued in the room after I was advised to take her up.</p>
               <p>Why did not you? - I was in hopes she would get me my things again.</p>
               <p>If she had got the things again you would not have taken her up? - No, I would not; I missed the greatest part of them all at once, except a few trifling things, such as a salt, a pepper box, and plates; she desired I would not make a noise to let any body hear in the house; she said, she had pawned them, and she would get them again; I gave her a week.</p>

            . I am an ostler, at the Swan, at Hendon. On Wednesday morning, the 21st of September, the prisoner came to our house, about a quarter-past six o'clock - he had no horse with him; he asked me if he could have half a pint of beer, and asked if I had any stabling to put a horse in - I said Yes; I took the key of the stable, unlocked the door, and put a saddle and bridle in, which laid at the door, when he came- he said he was late, and had to get to town by six o'clock, but he must go to Highgate; I took a halter out of the stable, went down the road with him towards Barnet, and saw a horse there - I asked if that was his horse, and why he could not come on; he said, Yes, that the horse was knocked up, and had no shoes on, and he could get no further; I said there was a farrier lived near, who would shoe him; he said, "Well, the man must have him shed where he is going to," and he might as well have him shod there - I called the farrier out of bed; his name is Sutling - I took the horse to the stable, and while I was at breakfast it was taken out of the stable to the farrier's; the horse appeared very much distressed, as if it had been ridden very hard; the farrier lives two doors off - I afterwards saw the same horse in the farrier's shop, being shod; I saw it again when it was shod - I saw White coming up the road behind Mr. Warren, who is a constable; they came to the stable where the horse had been brought back to - the prisoner went away before White and Warren came, but returned before Warren went away.</p>

            . I am a special constable of Hendon. On the 21st of September, about ten o'clock in the morning, I went to a blacksmith's shop, kept by Sutling, and saw a horse there, which was just shod; I did not see the prisoner then - the horse had been very much beaten on the off-side, and from the appearance of its feet, and the saddle and bridle, I had my suspicions, and took it to the Swan; I had it locked in the stable, and took possession of the key - I remained there till the prisoner came, which was not till about half-past two o'clock in the afternoon; I opened the stable door when he came, and let him go up to the horse - I saw him pay the farrier for shoeing it; I heard the prisoner desire it to be saddled - I then asked him where he brought it from; he said, "Three miles on the other side of Barnet;" I asked him who from there - he said a man named Smith gave it to him as he was walking in the road, about three o'clock in the morning, to take over Westminster-bridge; I asked if he knew Smith - he said he had seen him before; I asked if any body had seen Smith give it to him - he said, "Yes, a hay-cart man; I asked if he knew the hay-cart man - he said No; I asked where he had been since he had left the horse at the farrier's - he said he had been to Vauxhall-bridge; I asked what for - he said to see the hay-cart man; I said, "You said you did not know the hay-cart<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183110200006"></xptr>man;" he made no answer - I said, "I consider this horse to he stolen, and I shall take the horse and you into custody," which I did; he stood about a minute, and then said he was thirty, that he had had salt beef for dinner; I asked where he had dined - he said in Holborn; I said,"Did you not go to Westminster-bridge then;" he said No. - I asked where he came from; he said he had got no home that he went about with horses and cattle - I asked where he was on the Tuesday; he said at St. Albans - this was on the Wednesday, and that on the Monday he was at Hemel Hempstead fair; I detained the horse, saddle, and bridle - here is the saddle and bridle; I took him before a justice the same day - the saddle, bridle, and horse were shown to Mr. Hepburn that day week, at Edgware; he identified the horse as his property, but not she saddle and bridle - the prisoner gave his name as

On Monday, the 19th of September, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, he came to my house, and asked if I could lend him my saddle and bridle; I asked what he wanted it for - he said he was going up to Mr. Curwood's, at Bovington, to take his own horse to come to London to fetch the money for two loads of hay; he went up to my farm, and I lent him the saddle and bridle, which are those now produced - I know Putts-cross; it is in the straight road from Boxmoor to Chesham - I saw him again on that Monday afternoon, at Hemel Hempstead fair, and on the Tuesday he came to my house and had a pint of beer, which he drank, and left between nine and ten o'clock in the morning - I have not seen him since till to-day; when I saw him on Tuesday I asked what was the reason he had not gone to London - he said he had been to the fair, and he was going in the afternoon; I afterwards saw my saddle and bridle at Chesham.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not take the saddle away - you gave it to your uncle, and he put it into the barn again. Witness. It was not put into the barn; I saw the prisoner go out of the gate into the lane with it, and did not see it again till I saw it at Chesham.</p>

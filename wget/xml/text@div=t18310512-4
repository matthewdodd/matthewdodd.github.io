On Thursday morning, the 14th of April, I left the stable, about a quarter to eleven o'clock - I did not lock the stable-door, but am sure I shut and latched it; I looked the gates, and put the key into my pocket - Mr. Ellis' People have nothing to do with the yard; I returned about one, and found the gates still locked - I unlocked them, and went to put the horse into the stable, and the stable-door which I had left unlocked, was looked, and the key taken away; I had left the key inside - as I could not get in, I got over the fan-light of the door, and went up to my room; I missed a pair of boots, a coat, waistcoat, two pairs of boot-top covers, and two brushes - I have not found any of them; the prisoner had come into the yard that morning, and asked if I had got any dunk, as he wanted it for a man - I was then just going out with my master; I told him he could not have the dung, as I was just going out- he said he must have it, because they wanted it to top up a load; I put the horse in the gig, came out of the yard, and the prisoner came out with me - this was about a quarter to eleven o'clock; he saw me lock the gate - he was then outside the yard; I told him be could not have the dung that day - I knew him before by his coming with a man to fetch the dung; I then drove master to town, and on returning, found the stable as I have stated- I have not seen the property since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you known him long? A. Only by his coming for the dung ever since I have been at Mr. Bligh's, which is about a year and a half, but not for the last three months - I was robbed about six weeks before: I did not know where the prisoner lived - he was taken on the Saturday night following and searched, but nothing found.</p>
               <p>JOHN MORAM. I am a gentleman's servant out of place, and lodge in Jubliee-place, Chelsea, close to where these stables are; I do not know what parish it is in. On<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120005"></xptr>Thursday, the 13th of April, between eleven o'clock and half-past, I saw the prisoner get over the gate of Mr. Bligh's stable into the yard, and in four or five minutes I saw him come out - he got over the wall; he had something apparently under his jacket, but what it was I could not say; he went out into King's-road.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.How far were you from him? A. I should think twenty yards, as near as I can say; I never saw any body go over there before - I was once in the yard.</p>
               <p>JOHN KING. I am a Policeman. I was on duty when the prisoner was brought to the station-house, in Milman's-row, St. Luke's, Chelsea - I did not either threaten or promise him any thing; he said he had stolen the articles from Mr. Bligh's stables - One pair of boots, a coal, and some other things, which he named; he said so to me, and said he had sold some and pawned some - he said some were in Marylebone, but he did not know the place, and that he had done it through distress; this was on Sunday - he had been taken on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Tell us what you said to him? A.Being the serjeant on duty, I had occasion to go to the cells; I said to him, "This is a bad job;" he said,"Yes, it is," and immediately made the confession - no body else was present; I have been s serjeant in the Guards twenty-five years - he made the same statement before the Magistrate, and it was taken down.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The Policeman came to me in the watch-house, and said it was a bad job; I said it was - he then told me if I would tell the truth the young man would forgive me - that he only wanted his boots, and that was all. On the Thursday, as I went to the stables, I was employed by a man to work - he sent me to the stable to ask if he could have the dung; he said I could not - I said I particularly wanted it; he said I must come on Saturday - I said I would come on Saturday; this was about half-past nine o'clock, and I could prove I was in doors from ten till half-past eleven - on Saturday night I was with a Life Guardsman at Knightsbridge; the prosecutor came and looked in - a Policeman came and caught hold of me - I asked what it was for; he said I should know by and by - I will take my oath I never saw the things.</p>
               <p>JOHN KING re-examined. I did not say the young man would forgive him if he told the truth, and he only wanted his boots - I said nothing of the kind.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you know the stables? A. I was never at them till this happened; I know the parish it is in, because I live in the parish.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

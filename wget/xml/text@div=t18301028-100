            . I am a broker. On the afternoon of the 15th of October I was passing through King-street, and saw the prisoner go into this shop, come out again, and stand on the threshold of the door - she took down two gowns, and walked away quickly with them; the prosecutrix went and took her - another female came out of the house, and took hold of her till the officer came and took her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it not a passage through which people pass to different parts of the house? A. Yes.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 3, Greencoat Row, Westminster, and am fore-man at Mr. Downey's cab-yard, Buckingham Cottages—on Saturday night, about 12.30, I was coming from the yard, and as I got to the corner of Buckingham Cottages, three or four men rushed on to me—I was struck by home sort of weapon, which knocked two of my teeth out, and knocked me on my back—one of the men kneeled upon my throat, and the other took my money out of my right trowsers pocket, and they kicked me on both sides; I feel sore now—I could not say whether there were three or four men, they rushed from round the corner—the prisoner is the one that kneeled on my throat—I law him plainly when he got off—I saw his face from the lamp on the opposite corner—he went off towards the police-station, the others went the other way—I ran after the prisoner—I lost sight of him when he turned the corner of Rochester Row—I could not get along very well—I went across to the station, which was just across the road, and told a constable—he came out, and I pointed the prisoner out—he was then standing about, walking on the opposite side of the road—he had got on light trowsers, a brown coat, and a cap—I can swear he is the man that got off my throat.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had lost sight of him, it might be several minutes when I spoke to the officer—the prisoner was not out of sight then—I did not point him out then, not till I had spoken to the officer a few minutes—I was very much hurt, and don't know to a few minutes how long it was—I don't think it was as long as ten minutes—he was not crossing the road when I showed him to the constable—he was on the pavement, on the opposite side of the road—we went down Willow Street—I pointed him out before we went down Willow Street—when I pointed him out, he set off and ran, and the constable after him—there was not a fight in Willow Street then, there was afterwards, when we went to look for the others—the assault took place about 100 hundred yards from the station-house door—it was about 1 o'clock when the charge was taken—I was very much hurt—I hardly know the time for a few minutes—I was knocked almost senseless, but I came to before he got off my throat—I could not see what I was struck with; it was something about the size of a hen's egg that came against my mouth—I might have said before the Magistrate that I was not half a minute talking to the constable; it was more than that; it was not ten minutes—I have not told anybody that the only way I could identify the prisoner was by his having light trowsers on—I said that was what he had on.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman B</hi> 49). On Sunday morning, about 12.45, the prisoner came to me—I was standing inside the door of the police-station—he did not point out anyone to me then—I went with him down Willow Street, and as we were standing in Rochester Row, at the top of Buck<lb></lb>ingham Cottages, he pointed out the prisoner, who was then half-way across the road; that was about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after he first spoke to me—I walked rather sharply after the prisoner, and as soon as he got to the corner, and saw me, he made a spring with his feet, and ran to Vincent Square, towards Douglas Street—when I got to the corner, he had crossed the road, and was coming up on the other side, to meet me—I caught him, and told him what he was charged with—he said "I have not done <hi rend="italic">nothing,</hi> I suppose you want to make something of it"—a man left him just as I got to the corner—I handed the prisoner over to another constable, and went after the other man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was standing just inside the station, with two other constables, when the prosecutor came to me—I could not see anybody then—I went to Willow Street with him; there was a fight there; that fight was going on before I took the prisoner into custody—I went, with another constable, to stop the fight, and when we got back to the station the prose<lb></lb>cutor was there again; you can see the place where the prosecutor was attacked, from the station-house door—he was walking when he came to me, and blood was running all down his clothes—the prisoner lives in Willow Street—the prosecutor seemed very nervous when he came up, and did not know exactly where he was; he seemed rather stupefied, from ill-usage.</p>

About 12.45, on this night, the pro<lb></lb>secutor came in to the station, bleeding from the mouth, and complained of being assaulted and robbed—I saw him point out the prisoner—I followed him, with Russell, arrested him, and brought him into the station, and searched him—his hands and knees were dirty with the mud of the road.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's father, and live at 10, William Street—I have worked at the Gas Works for about forty years—on the night of 29th April, the prisoner left my house about 7 o'clock, after he had his tea—I saw him again a little after 12 o'clock—I was up stairs, in bed—I was very angry with him for being out so late, and having a little drop too much—we had some words, and he said he would go and get a lodging elsewhere, and he went out; that was somewhere about 1 o'clock—I did not see anything more of him after that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of 14, Johnson's Place—I called on the prisoner about 7 o'clock on this Saturday night—we went to the Standard Music Hall, and stayed there till about 11.45—we then came straight up the Vauxhall Road into Willow Street—when within a few doors of his house he bid me "Good-night!" and left me—I should think that was as near as could be between 12 and 12.15—I and a man named David Jones had a quarrel, and stripped to fight in Willow Street—the police came and dis<lb></lb>turbed us, and I ran down Keats' gateway, down the same yard where the prisoner lives—I there saw the prisoner <hi rend="italic">rowing</hi> with his father—the prisoner and I left together, and went down Buckingham Cottages into Rochester Row—that was about 1 o'clock—I left him at the corner of Vincent Square, and went straight up Rochester Row.</p>

As I went from the coach-office to the Post-office, I saw two men standing about twenty yards from the Post-office with a ladder - the ladder stood up against the wall of a house; I passed quite close to the men - one had a light short jacket on, and the other a long brown coat; it was a very dark morning; I did not observe their features - it was not light enough for them to see me throw the bags in.</p>

            . I am servant to Mrs. Butler the Post-mistress of Hounslow; I have lived with her four years. Seven mails call at Hounslow every morning in their way to town; when the first arrives the guard rings the bell; I sleep in the second-floor front room - on the first guard ringing the bell, I get out of bed and open the first floor window, and he throws the bags in; I then return to bed - this was the constant custom. On the morning of the 19th of February I remember the guard ringing: I opened the window - the bags were thrown in, and I returned to my room; as the different mails came in I heard the bags thrown in - I knew all the mails, and heard the horns; I did not go to sleep again - one guard rang the bell, and I delivered him the London bag from my bed room window: I went down to the first floor front room about two minutes after the guard rang for the London bag, and found only the Gloucester set of bags - I expected to find six sets - the rest were all gone; I went directly and told mistress; the Stroud mail came to the door directly after - I went down stairs, opened the front door, and found a ladder lying in the road, just against the pavement under the tree, about nine feet from the house; I afterwards took it into the house - it was a shut up ladder - this is it (looking at it); it laid close against the foot-path - the coaches could pass without going over it; it is high enough for a person to get in at the window with - the foot-path is raised and the ladder leaned against it; I found the Newbury bag lying on the footpath against the step of the door, and took it in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. The first mail passed about five o'clock? A. Yes, and the last nearly at six; the window was left open all that hour for the bags to be thrown in - I began to dress myself that morning immediately after the first mail arrived; I was in the room above, and heard all the bags thrown in - I heard nothing else; the ladder laid sideways, not across the road - the window has been left open for the hour all the time I have been there; I dare say that was well known to the people of Hounslow.</p>

            . I am Post-mistress of Hounslow, and receive letters both going into the country and coming to London. We throw the window open when the first mail arrives - the servant then goes up to dress; the other mails come in quick, and throw the bags in; this has been the case for twenty years. On the 19th of February the servant came and gave me information; I immediately went to the room, and found only the Gloucester set of bags - a ladder was brought in with the Newbury bag; twenty-nine bags were missing.</p>
               <p>Q. What inmates were in your house? A. My sister, who was ill, Mrs. Letitia, and Ann Bickham, who lodged there, and two little children - every one in the house was in bed; I did not take the bags.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Nobody else lived in the house? A. No - I secured the house the night before; I bolted the front door, as I always do: nobody sleeps in the room the bags are thrown into - a person in the room above could hear them thrown in.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could anybody have got into your house except at the window? A. They could not - the bags must have been taken out at the window; I examined the house - every part was secure.</p>

            . In February I lodged with my sister, at Mrs. Butler's - we occupied the first floor bed room, and the sitting room, which the bags are thrown into every morning; I was not disturbed in the morning, and saw nothing of the bags.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Had you slept there long? A. For ten years; I have occasionally been disturbed by the bell-ringing, and heard the bags thrown in - I heard one set thrown in that morning, but not more, for I was asleep.</p>

            . I keep the Pembroke Arms public-house, at the corner of Pembroke-square, Kensington. In February last Bull rented of me a four-stall stable, a coach-house, a loft and dwelling-room adjoining - they are all at the back of my house, in my yard; I have frequently seen Smith on Bull's premises - I have seen them in the yard together both before and after the 19th of February; I have seen them together almost daily for two or three months; Bull took the premises for the purpose of taking in horses to bait, and to let horses and gigs - Smith did live at Kensington, about three quarters of a mile from me.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the mode of entering the loft? A. There is one way from the inside of the stable, and another from the outside, through a door, by means of a ladder; when I let Bull the premises I left him a ladder, expressly for the purpose of getting up to the loft - the ladder produced is the same; but when I let it to him it was one straight piece with thirteen steps: it is now cut in the middle, and folds too, with hinges - the steps were wider than they are now: I recollect seeing it on the 11th of February, but not after - I missed it on Sunday morning, the 16th of March; when I wanted it to get on the roof of my bowling-green shed, as some lead had been stolen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did Bull live at these stables? A. He did - I cannot say whether he was there on the 19th of February; I had not seen the ladder after the 11th of February, but had every reason to suppose it was there - I did not want it till the 16th of March; Bull continued to live with me till then, and after - he took the premises in November; the yard is not open to the public - I gave him the keys of the gates; he kept them open in the day time; he appeared to live very regular, but never had any horses or chaises to let; when or how the ladder went I cannot say.</p>
               <p>MR. ATTORNEY GENERAL. Q. You used the ladder on the 11th of February, and did not want it again till the 16th of March? A. No; I placed it in Bull's coach-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182807030023"></xptr>house on the 11th of February, just by the side of the loft - I know it to be the same by one step, which I broke by letting a piece of timber fall on it, and by this nail in it - this step was always cracked; the steps projected about three quarters of an inch beyond the frame-work originally, but they have been cut to make them level with the frame, for the ladder to shut closer - it would not have closed if they had not been cut; Bull and I occupied all the premises - my back door opens into the yard; he had a horse and a chaise cart there, and sometimes two chaise carts, but he let none out - he had a green body to his cart, with a patent axle; he has bought horses and sold them.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Your ladder had wider steps than the one produced? A. It had originally - one was broken on the projecting part of the frame, but the greater part of it remains; my customers generally went through the yard to the green.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was Bull generally at home at night? A. I cannot say - I never saw him with any bags, nor any about; I have no reason to believe he was absent about the time of the robbery.</p>

I swear that this is master's ladder - it was there a week or two after Christmas, when I went there; the second step at the bottom has been broken - the steps were about two inches wider than they are now; I used the ladder on the 11th of February to assist master to throw snow off my master's building - I did not miss it before the 16th of March, when the lead was stolen; it was not wanted till then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were there binges on the ladder when you knew it? A. No - I know nothing about its being altered; I only saw it when I wanted to use it.</p>

On the 19th of February, about six o'clock in the morning, when I changed horses at Hounslow, I observed two men standing opposite the mail, on the side of the road near the Post-office; I perceived a ladder against the wall close to the men; one man was taller than the other; and one, who wore a light jacket, was about the size of Smith.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was it dark or light? A. Dark - the ladder was standing up, and about the length it is now it is closed: the man might be taller or shorter, and thinner than Smith; but he was as near his size as possible - I am sure he had a light jacket on.</p>

            . I am driver of a music van. On the 19th of February, early in the morning, I was on the road to Inglefield-green and stopped with my van at the Coach and Horses public-house, a very short way from Hounslow - it was a very dark morning; I went into the tap-room, and as I went in two men passed me; and when I got in, there was another man finishing a glass of gin; as I went I said "Good morning gentlemen, it is a very sharp morning;" one of them said it was very sharp - one of them had a light coat on, and the other, who finished the gin, had a jacket; it seemed to be a light jacket - there was a light in the tap-room; I had to move aside to let the men pass me to come out - the man finished his gin and went out; he seemed about the size of Smith - I cannot swear he is the man; before I went into the tap-room I drew up alongside a cart which stood close against the door; it was a light chaise cart, with pannels - there were no other persons coming out of the tap-room; it opens immediately into the road - I saw a ladder in the cart - about two rails hung over the tail of the cart; it was this end of the ladder, because I could see some iron work about it - I stopped in the taproom for ten or twenty minutes; I heard it drive off - after the man went out of the tap-room, I proceeded on, and when I got to Hounslow, I saw a cart opposite some trees, about the middle of the town; I cannot positively swear it was the same cart, but it looked very much like it - there was a horse in it: I saw two men standing about, but nobody in it, and did not observe the ladder then; I did not take particular notice, but passed on.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. What time were you at the public-house? A. About five o'clock - I went through Smallberry-green turnpike that morning; and that cart must have gone through the same turnpike and must have known the number - I do not swear to Smith.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you asked before the Magistrate to point out the persons you saw at the public-house, to the best of your judgment? A. Yes, and I pointed to the officer, and to an old thin man, who was taller than either of the prisoners.</p>

            . I am ostler of the Coach and Horses. On the 19th of February, about nine o'clock in the morning, I recollect a cart coming with three men; they had some hay and water, and some gin; they left the cart two or three yards from the door for a few minutes; it was a kind of light market-cart, with a stoutish horse - the tail of the cart was let about half-way down, and something hung half out of it; I cannot say what it was, for it was covered over - I think it was covered with a mat - it lodged just inside the tail-board; the men staid in the house a few minutes, had four glasses of gin, and went on with the cart towards Hounslow; it came from towards town: after giving their horse some hay I went and hung the three keys of our stable in the passage; the three men were with me, and saw me hang them up; there was a light three or four yards from where the keys hung - the passage leads from the tap-room; I missed those three keys eight or ten minutes after they were gone - they went through that passage to come in and go out: a man came with a music-van shortly before they left. (Looking at a key produced by Ruthven) this looks very much like one of the keys;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182807030024"></xptr>many keys are alike; I missed the keys about three minutes after the van went. I have seen a cart this morning - I cannot swear whether it is the one the men came with - it resembles it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you hear of this robbery? A. Yes, that morning; two or three days after that two men were apprehended, and one was taken to Brentford, in custody; Bull came to our house, and demanded a horse and gig which were left there; I did not know him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think he was one of the men who had been there on the 19th? A. I thought nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. When did you see Smith? A. I saw him at Bow-street; I never pretended to say he was one of the men; if this is our key it has been altered; there is a good deal cut out of the middle; another key was produced at the office, which I said was a little like one of ours - I have three fellow servants, who use the keys as well as me. I said what I saw in the cart was covered up, and looked like a coffin - I saw no part of it project over the tail; it was not my business to notice it: I did not say only three men were at the house that morning; I said the music van came just as they were going away.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Two men were taken to prison? A. That was a few days after - they were taken on suspicion of robbing a waggon; their cart stopped at our house - Bull came and claimed it; I had no reason to believe he was the man who had been before.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. When they went out, did one go out first or two? A. One went out with me, and two were left in the tap-room.</p>

            . My father keeps the Coach and Horses. On the 19th of February, in the morning, three of the stable keys were missing - the one produced is one of them; the interior of the wards have since been filed out - it is turned into a skeleton-key, but I know it by a mark on the face of the bit. I have locked up the stable twice a week for the last two years, and my attention has been called to this key - I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. What enables you to speak to it? A. That grove and the faulty part on the face of the bit; I told the Magistrate I also knew it by the brazing - I believe, after I gave my evidence, Mr. Harmer said that was common to all keys; I then mentioned the grove and other parts; the ostlers lock up the stables, but if they forget it I do it; the other two ostlers are not here; I do not know whether they have been asked about the keys.</p>

            . I am a blacksmith. I have a lock here whick I took off Woodward's stable door; this key fits the opening of the lock; the wards of the key have been taken out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. If the wards were there, you cannot say whether it would open it? A. Yes; I am certain of it; it is a very particular lock - there is no collar ward to it - I call it an uncommon key.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the Magistrate they might get a key at any stall in London to undo this lock? A. Not that lock; they asked the value of the key - I said they might get one at any stall for 1s.; a common key reduced to this shape would certainly open it; the key-hole is worn - most likely this is not the key which was first made for the lock, but it has been made as a make-shift. I never heard of a reward in this case.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Do not you call all keys that are not straight,"fancy bits?" A. Yes - whether this has been one or not I do not know: this has no doubt been "burred" to fit the lock.</p>

            . I am an officer. I searched Smith's lodging in Burford-mews, Edgware-road, and found this key, among several others, in this box, on his drawers in the sitting-room; he claimed the lodging as his. On the 14th of May, Mrs. Butler and Barnes delivered me this ladder at the Post-office at Hounslow.</p>

            . I keep the turnpike-gate at Smallberry-green, which is a little on this side of Hounslow. - On the 19th of February, about five o'clock in the morning, I remember a cart passing through, towards Hounslow; I saw two men in it; it was a dark morning; there appeared something in the cart - I could not observe what; I did not particularly look at the back of the cart - there was something in it about the size of the cart: it appeared to be loaded as other carts are; I did not notice the tail-board- about six o'clock the same morning a cart returned, trotting very fast, with two men in it - they called the proper number; they drove very fast, which made me notice them; it was a dark coloured horse, and a dark cart; my lamp was nearly out - it appeared to be a light cart, for draft.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You change your number at twelve o'clock at night? A. Yes; every cart that goes through knows the number, and they often tell others the number.</p>

            . I know the prisoner Bull and his wife. About the middle of February I went to his premises at the Pembroke Arms - I went in, and saw Smith there, with Bull - I saw a ladder standing at the loft door: I saw Bull standing by the side of the ladder, with a fork, which he took out of the stable; he was holding it up close to the side of the ladder, to measure it, to cut it, to put it into the cart; I went down out of the loft - Smith was then standing at the side of the cart, with the same fork; I saw him hold the fork along the side of the cart; when he saw me he put it down, and asked what I wanted - I said I was come to see if they could pay the money for the use of a horse and cart which they had of Thompson; they had taken it away when Thompson was in trouble; I saw Bull put the fork to the side of the cart - it was a green cart; Smith said he could not do anything then, I must come again in a fortnight; I went up stairs, and staid all day with Mrs. Bull; when Bull came up he told me Smith could do nothing yet, he was short of money, but in the course of a week or fortnight, or it might be a month, he could, for he had a job in hand: I asked what - he said it was a job at the Post-office at Hounslow, and it was a "put up job" Smith was not present; I understood by that that they were going to rob the Post-office. He said they had a job in hand - Bulls' wife was present; I was not very intimate with Bull; I did not know him till Thompson was taken: I did not hear of the Post-office robbery till I mentioned that they talked of doing it.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182807030025"></xptr>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Are you married? A. I am - I have been married ever since 1812; I have no husband now: I do not know whether he is dead; I have not seen him for about four years; I do not always go by the name of Collins - I never lived but with one man; I went by the name of Wright - I go by that name now.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you gone by any other name since you have married Collins? A. I do not think that question has anything to do with this; I never went by the name of Thompson - he was taken up for robbing the Tally Ho, Birmingham coach, and Smith was one of the party. -Wright's name was Wright Waller - that is not two names - it is one person and one name. I have not been living with a parcel of different men; I went by the name of Wright Waller; I know Kinsby - I never lived with him as his wife, or kept woman - I defy you or any one to say so- I have a room in his house, and pay for it, Waller was transported last January Session - I was never taken up for felony.</p>
               <p>Q. In January, 1826, were you committed by Mr. Hardwick, to the custody of Norris, on a charge of felony? A. I never was taken up for thieving - I have been in Clerkenwell prison, but not for thieving; I do not know who took me there; I was not there a month, nor half a month - it was about some wine which was brought into a house when I was in bed and asleep.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoners put down the fork that you might not see what they were at? A. They did not mind me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you say a word before the Magistrate about Smith measuring the cart with the fork? A. I said he was there, as I do now, and that he held it by the side of the cart; I mentioned it before I heard the key mentioned - I cannot say at which examination I mentioned it; I never heard of any reward - I never saw the placard.</p>
               <p>Q. You swear you never heard of the reward? A. I do not know about swearing that; I was asked at the office by Mr. Harmer if I wanted the 100l. - I had not heard of it before; I never could find Smith afterwards - I went to Bull's after him, to ask for the clothes they took out of my box; I saw Mrs. Bull - she said if I would come down she would see and get me some things - I did not go for money.</p>

            . I keep the Green Man public-house, at Chelsea. I have known Bull for twelve or fourteen years; I saw him drive up to the Swan public-house, at Fulham, with a horse and green chaise, or chaise-cart; he said to me,"This is the little drag to carry the mail (or Post-office) bags."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When was this? A.

            . I am a fishmonger, and live in Newland-terrace, Kensington. About the 3d of March I bought a cart of Smith at the Pembroke Arms - Bull was present; I was fetched by a farrier to look at it - Smith said he had it to sell for a person who had a bill to meet, and he must sell it; I bought it for 6l. - there was no name or number on it; I sold it on that day fortnight to Mr. Benham, and it was claimed: I went to Smith - he was out, but called on me next morning, and said he understood there was something unpleasant about the cart; I said it had been owned - it was not stolen, but I understood taken away for bire; he returned me the 6l. and said it would be a very hard case for him, for he had paid the 6l. to the person, and very likely he should get none of it back; I saw the same cart at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was anybody present besides the prisoners? A. Yes - two others; I bought an old horse-cloth of one of them.</p>

            .

            . I am a constable of Hammersmith. On the morning of this robbery I was in the Hounslow-road looking for some persons, and about a quarter to nine o'clock I saw Smith and two other young fellows come along with an iron-grey horse and cart, and turn towards Fulham; I heard of the robbery that morning at the turnpike.</p>
               <p>BULL'S Defence. The horse that we had at Hounslow was a broken-winded one - I had bought her for 5l.; it was there about the 28th of February - I went to claim it; a person named Evans had asked if I had a low-priced horse - he took it away without paying; I heard it was at Hounslow, and went for it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Cranford-lane, Heston, and am a baker—about 7 in the evening of 9th April, I was standing outside my shop door—the prisoner was there—he was using very abusive threatening language—I told him he had better go away—he was the worse for liquor—I fancy he knew what he was about—I said, "If you don't go, I will fetch some one to make you go"—he walked away then, then came back again, and came up to me and said, "Oh, you b—, you shall have a hot '<hi rend="italic">un;</hi>" and he struck me on the shoulder—he afterwards followed me, and knocked me down in the road—I ran away from him—he then ran away—Charles Thoms, who is in my service, ran after him—the prisoner got over into a field—I did not see whether Thoms got near to the prisoner—I heard him say, "Oh! Jem, Jem, he has stabbed me"—I could not see him at that time; but I saw him in a few seconds after—he came out of the field, and showed me the wound on his left thigh—his trousers and apron were cut, and he was bleeding very much—the prisoner was running through a pond at that time—he was followed and given into custody—I lost sight of him; I know him well.</p>

I lodge with and work for Mr. Wheeler—on the morn<lb></lb>ing of 9th, I was coming into the bakehouse from out of the yard—I saw my mistress crying about something—in consequence of what she said, I went after the prisoner—when he saw me running after him, he got over into a field—I went after him and, "I mean having you," and as I went to catch hold of him he stabbed me in the left thigh—I did not see any knife in his hand until I fell down—I fell directly—I then saw a blade of a knife—I bled a good deal—he only stabbed me once; he then ran away through some water—he was not sober—I was confined to my bed for a fortnight—I am getting pretty middling now.</p>

               <p>April, the prosecutor was brought to the surgery—I found he had a large wound on the outer side of the upper third of the thigh, about four inche long and two and half deep; it was of a dangerous character—it took place from below upwards—it was caused by a sharp instrument, probably a knife—had the wound commenced where it ended, in all probability it would have proved fatal in a very short time—it would have penetrated the artery and gone into the bowels; he had lost a great deal of blood—the wound is pretty well now.</p>

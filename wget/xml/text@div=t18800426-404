On the night of 13th April, about 10.30 p.m., I saw the prisoners in Murray Street, Seven Dials—I drew Pugsley's attention to them—I knew Taylor—we followed them into Soho Square—I caught hold of Taylor and Pugsley took hold of Ringwood—I said to both "Where are you going?"—Taylor said "To King's Cross"—I said "You are coming the wrong way for it; what have you got inside your coat?"—I saw it was bulky—he replied "Nothing"—I undid his coat and put my hand in his pocket and found this jemmy, knife, and key pro<lb></lb>duced—Ringwood said "I was merely walking with this man"—I took possession of these things—Taylor said "Oh, it is nothing"—at the station he said he used the jemmy in his trade—it is used by burglars to force doors and boxes open; the knife to unlatch windows, and the key is a skeleton key.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective C</hi>). I was with the last witness in Moo Street, Seven Dials—he made a communication to me, and we followed the prisoners to Soho Square—we there stopped them—Brown seized Taylor, and I seized Ringwood—the jemmy, knife, and key produced were taken from Taylor—I commenced to search Ringwood—he said "You will find nothing on me"—I found nothing on him—Taylor said he was a bricklayer; before the Inspector he said he was a painter—Ringwood said he was an engineer—they gave addresses, which I went to—I do not know what they are.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Taylor's Defence.</hi> I was taking Ringwood to the Mischief Tavern to pay him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which I owed him. If I had the things for an unlawful pur<lb></lb>pose I could have thrown them into the square. I picked the chisel up, and as I knew it would come handy to a handy man, who can do any mortal thing, I put it in my pocket.</p>

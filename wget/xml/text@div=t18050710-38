               <p>Q. How was it broken open? - A. It was entered by a pane of glass, which was partly broke in the sash window.</p>
               <p>Q. In what room? - A. In a room attached to the house, a lower room were we kept sundry articles, carpenter's tools, and other things that we had use for; the room was built against the end of the house, it had no internal communication with the house, it was used occasionally for the parlour. On the 4th of July I was sitting up late, I heard some person come past the house between eleven and twelve at night; I heard the gate open, which had been previously bolted, I immediately ran out, and heard footsteps, my sister ran out, and being alarmed by her noise, I could not hear the steps so as to pursue the person it being dark. The next morning the prisoner was brought to our house by a person who is present, with the articles in a cart.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 3d of July had you been in the room? - A. On the 3d of July I had been in the garden adjoining this back room about three o'clock in the afternoon; I then looked in the window, and saw it was shut to.</p>
               <p>- BEGG sworn. - I am a farmer, I live at Hendon: On the 4th of July, about five o'clock in the morning, as I was going into my yard, I saw the prisoner; he had a basket, and a quantity of tools; I stopped him, and took him into my house for about two hours, and his brother came, I sent him down with the tools to Mr. Mutter's, in care of his brother.</p>

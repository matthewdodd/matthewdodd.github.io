                  </hi> I live in Adam-street, Bryanston-square. On the night of 15th Feb. I was in Union-court, Holborn, talking to a girl—the prisoner came up and snatched my watch from my fob, and they both ran off—I pursued them across the road—they then went different ways—I followed the prisoner—I never lost sight of her—I gave her into custody—my watch has not been found.</p>

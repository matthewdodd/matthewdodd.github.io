                  </hi>. I am a porter in the employ of Van Orton and Co., of No. 22, Billiter-street. On Wednesday evening, the 8th of September, I was shutting up the windows of the premises, and noticed the prisoner by Mr. Richardson's shop, which is opposite us—I saw him come up to the shop front, and thrice look into the window—he then went to the door, de<lb></lb>liberately opened it, and walked in—I watched for a few seconds, and saw him come out with the property under his arm—I and our foreman pursued him, and when he got about half way down the street he dropped the pro<lb></lb>perty in the road—I picked it up, and he was afterwards stopped in Bil<lb></lb>liter-street, by Collingwood.</p>

I was at the corner of Billiter-street on the 8th of September, and heard a cry of "Stop thief"—I saw the prisoner running along in the middle of the road, with this piece of cloth and this coat under his arm—I saw him drop them, ran after, and stopped him—he was taken back to the shop, and the policeman called in.</p>

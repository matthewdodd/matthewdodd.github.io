               <p>I am a painter and Glazier; I was going to see an acquaintance in Tothell-street, and I saw a man coming out of Mr. Kelly's stables with the sack; with that I hallooed out coachman, it was Monday the 18th, the same day the things were lost, about a quarter before nine in the evening; not very dark, he made no answer; with that I drew back and I see him walk away without the sack, and I see him come back again and take the sack up and put it on his shoulder and went away with it across the high road; and I ran round the pavement and met him, and I asked him whether the coachman was in the stable? and he made<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100026"></xptr>no answer, so I went away; I am sure the man was the prisoner, I never saw him before but that evening.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; I searched the prisoner's house, I found the hempen sack in the one pair of stairs; it is here, it has been in my possession ever since; I went below stairs and in a tub there was a horse cloth wet, and the binding ripped off, and by the side of the tub. (The sack and horse cloth produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming out and going along the middle of the yard I saw something lay on the left hand, in this coach stable, I went up to it and it appeared to be full of something, I takes the sack up and sits it up on its end; and I thought it was stole from somewhere, or a sack littered out of some hackney man's cart; with that I takes the sack on my back and carries it half down the yard, and I takes it off my back, and I thought I would not carry it any further; and then I takes it up again and carries it home, the horse cloth was wet in the sack.</p>
               <p>Court to Moore. In what place was the hempen sack found? - In the one pair of stairs under the bedstead.</p>

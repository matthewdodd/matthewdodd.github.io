                  </hi>. I live at 19, Queen Street, Seven Dials, and am a carman—between 1 and 2 o'clock on the morning of the 29th February, I was in bed—the prisoner lived in the room above me with five other men—I heard a great noise, and I went up and asked them to be quiet because my mother was very bad—the prisoner went on with some bad language; I was standing by another man's bed, and all at once the prisoner pulled a knife out of his pocket, opened it and ran it in me—I went down and called a policeman—I was bleeding fearfully.</p>

At quarter to 2 o'clock this morn<lb></lb>ing, in question, I was called by Maurice Doherty—I went to the second floor front room, where I saw the prisoner and other men—Doherty said "That is the man that stabbed me"—I told the prisoner I should charge him with stabbing the prisoner, and he said "I have no knife"—one of the men in the room said "It could not be the prisoner stabbed him, because he had no knife"—the prisoner appeared sober, but the men all said he was drunk—as I left the house in Queen Street, and heard something drop as if from some height, and I found this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in two pieces.</p>

               <p>trowsers, and there was a large cut over the left hip, it corresponded with the wound, which was an inch and a half, a punctured wound, widely gaping—it went 3 inches in depth, and was stopped by the thigh bone—he was bleeding fearfully, and his stockings, and inside his shirt was full of blood—a wound like that must have been with great force—I attended to it, it is lealing—there is a great deal of discharge and he walks with a limp, which he says he dip not before—this knife is an instrument likely to cause such a wound.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutor. On Sunday morning, the 11th of March, the prisoner came to clean the boots, as he was accustomed - it was about half-past ten o'clock. I took the boot to him in the workshop, in the yard, and laid them down at the door for him. I saw him take them up, and go into the workshop; he did not sleep in the house at that time. I did not see him again until I saw him at Marlborough-street. I went into the workshop to send him on an errand, about a quarter of an hour after I took the boots, but he was gone - the four pair of boots were gone also. Nobody had been in the shop that morning. I have not seen them since - they had been worn; and repaired. I should have given about 4 s. for them, if I was to buy them. Nothing else was missed that morning.</p>
               <p>MR. TURNERELLI re-examined. My boots were worth about 30 s. altogether. A suit of livery was missed that morning, but I do not know when it was taken. There is a back door to the shop, which he might unbolt and let himself out. I never saw the livery after it was in the press.</p>
               <p>JOHN MURTY. I work for the prosecutor. I met the prisoner about a week after he left, and asked him why he did not come to the shop to work - he said he would not come again, because he had taken some clothes and boots.</p>
               <p>GEORGE HARMAM. I was present when the prosecutor gave a suit of livery into the care of the prisoner. It was about a fortnight before he left the house. I saw the prisoner put them into a press in the prosecutor's study.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was cast away on the coast of Cornwall. I walked to town, and applied to the prosecutor for work, which he gave me, at 1 s. a day. I came on this day as usual, the maid brought me four pair of boots; I laid them on the bench in the back shop, and went out to breakfast; I met a friend, who told me of a better place, at Greenwich, where I could get more wages. My master had told me to leave if I could better myself. I went to Greenwich about it, and did not return to clean the boots. I did not succeed, and did not like to return, thinking he would not employ me. I shut the door when I left, and did not steal the boots. I have been fourteen years in his Majesty's service.</p>

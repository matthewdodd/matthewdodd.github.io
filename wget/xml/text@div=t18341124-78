                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Mercer, and live in the Match-walk, Shadwell. On the 4th of November, I met the prisoner—she asked me to drink—I got quite intoxicated—I had a pocket on, which contained two half-crowns, 6 shillings, and four sixpences—when I recov<lb></lb>ered, I found myself in the prisoner's bed—she lives in the same house with me—my father and the officer came and asked where my money was, and I missed my pocket and money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> She told me to take the money, and to send 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to her mother. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No—I had not sense to do it—we began drinking about ten o'clock—we went into three public-houses, and drank rum—I paid for some.</p>

                  </hi>. I met the prisoner and prosecutrix—they were both tipsy, and they asked me to go into a wine-vaults and take some rum, which I did—the prosecutrix was sick soon after, and the prisoner took off her apron and her pocket, which was under her apron—she said she would see what money she had, and return it when she was sober—she counted the money before me—there was 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she then took the prosecutrix by the arm, and said she would take her home, and put her to bed—the prosecutrix's father said he would seek after the prisoner, that the money might be delivered to him, till his daughter was sober—the officer took her, and when she was brought into her own room she denied all knowledge of it—she was drunk then.</p>

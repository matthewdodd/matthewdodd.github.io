            . I was coming down Holborn in my way home on the 11th of May last, I think it was a Wednesday; a woman met me and said sir, where are you going? I said my dear I am going home; said she, you had better go home with me; I said no, I objected to it, but I consented at last to go to some tavert with her; from thence she persuaded me to go home with her; we went to bed, and by and by the prisoner Price came up stairs; she called her sister and asked who she had got with her; the other said a gentleman; the prisoner said then I shall be deprived of my bed; I said no my girl you shall not, I will get up and go somewhere else; I offered to get up; she said no if I would give her something to drink she would sit up; I gave her a shilling; she brought some shrub, I drank some of it; I saw her sit in the chair before I went to sleep; when I waked I missed my watch, a French crown piece, about eighteen shillings in silver, my shoe and knee buckles, and a pocket book which contained notes to the amount of between four and five hundred pounds; and I lost a ticket of an annuity for eight pound a year for my life; I have since discovered that they destroyed them going to Gravesend; when I waked there was no one in the room; I stopped till the watchman came round at half past three o'clock I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your bedfellow gone too?</p>
               <p>Webb. Yes; I called the watchman, and he called the woman up that rents the house and she lent me a shilling; I went into Gray's-inn-lane and sent for a gentleman to lend me ten guineas, and then I went and gave information at Sir

            . I am servant to Mr. Harrington a pawnbroker the corner of Benjamin-street; I took in this watch (producing it) of a man on the 13th of May last.</p>
               <p>Q. What man?</p>
               <p>Wilde. I do not remember the man again.</p>

               <p>Q. I suppose it is a part of your business not to know the thieves that come to pawn things with you, it would spoil your trade if you knew them again?</p>

               <p>Q. Do you believe that to be the man or not?</p>
               <p>Wilde. It was a young man somewhat like him.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part does he resemble the man?</p>
               <p>Wilde. He does not resemble him in dress; the man I had the watch of was dressed well.</p>

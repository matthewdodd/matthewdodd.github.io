                  </hi>. I am the son of John James Hitchcock, of Poppin's-court. On the 26th of June the prisoner came with another man—the prisoner asked for a bottle of ginger beer—he had a penny one, which he drank, and put down a good half-crown—I examined it, and it was good—I asked my mother if she had got change—she said, "No"—my father was down stairs—I went and gave him the half-crown, and brought up 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—the other man then called the prisoner a fool for changing half-a-crown when he had halfpence, and he said, "Go, fetch up the half-crown again, I have got change"—I went down—my father came up with me, and then he said, "I have no halfpence now, I must change half-a-crown."</p>

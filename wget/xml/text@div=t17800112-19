               <p>I am a constable. I went with the warrant, and searched two houses of the prisoner's and found three pieces of tin plates, which Mr. Jones says are his, that is all I found in both houses.</p>
               <p>Did you take the prisoner up? - No, he was taken up before.</p>
               <p>Jones. I was not at home at the time; he was kept in custody, till I came home, and a constable sent for.</p>
               <p>Was he searched? - No.</p>
               <p>How comes the door of this warehouse to be open in the day time? - It is opposite to my house; it is left open for the work-people, and our people, to go in and out.</p>

               <p>I was employed by a gentleman to whitewash the house. There was a place where<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178001120034"></xptr>Mr. Jones put his lumbering things; I could not do it without removing some of Mr. Jones's things, such as chairs and other brokery things. Mr. Jones came and said I had taken some things; I said I had not; that if they had lost any thing I was sorry, I knew nothing of it. I moved the things as carefully as I could. As to the pieces of tin we swept them out; I took them up to be sure afterwards, I thought they were pieces of waste tin; I might move the tiles out of the way; I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>To Jones. What is the value of these pieces of tin? - Little or nothing; I have valued the three pieces at three-pence.</p>

                  </hi>. I was coming up Type-street on Saturday, 18th Oct. at dinner-time—I saw Taylor and the prisoner standing nearly at the top of the street talking together—when I was within ten or twelve paces of them I saw Taylor stagger across the road and fall—it seemed to me as if he went with great force from one side of the road to the other, as if shot out of a gun almost—after picking him up, I saw Scadden, and asked him what we should do with the man, he was either dead or dying—he said it served him right, and walked away—I picked up 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver off the ground, which I expect from Taylor's position he must have had in his hand at the time—he never breathed, moved, or spoke after I picked him up—I did not know him before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I saw the deceased after his death—his death had arisen from some external violence, but the external injury was so slight that I could not judge from that—I examined the body, and found effusion of blood into the left ventricle of the brain, extending to the base of the brain, especially on the left side, and the blood was almost wholly fluid—I attribute the death to the effusion of blood into the brain—a blow under the left ear would occasion that—a blow of that sort would occa<lb></lb>sion sudden death—there was no visible blood-vessel broken—the whole of the blood-vessels of the brain were so exceedingly congested that it appeared there had been very considerable excitement previous to the blow—the vessels were in such a condition that a very slight blow might produce the injury—there was no evidence of his having been drunk.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Might the excitement have arisen from drink? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185110270050"></xptr>
               <p>Either from drink or wrangling—it is possible that such a fall as has been described might rupture the vessel—I cannot say that it is probable—in order to fall forward with considerable force there must have been previously an impetus—there was a slight bruise or abrasion under the left ear, and a little blood was oozing from it; there was a slight swelling—he was about thirty years of age, he was a stout, strong man; he was exceedingly pale, but there was no appearance of disease about the body, with the exception of the liver being slightly enlarged, which is generally the case with labouring men who always take more or less spirits.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in Type-street, and saw the prisoner and deceased—they appeared to be talking together—Taylor went in a fighting attitude opposite Mr. Scadden—he was drunk—Scadden gave him a round blow, which I should term a box on the ears—it was with his clenched fist—as the blow was struck Taylor looked at Mr. Scadden, stepped on the left, and slipped off the kerb, ran across the road, and fell on the side of his face—he fell with his head against the bar, in front of the window, and the force of it caused him to reel backwards, and he fell very heavily on the pavement—I did not think the blow Scadden struck was a violent one—Taylor did not appear to be capable of controlling himself from drink.</p>

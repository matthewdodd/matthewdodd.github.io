               <p>Was you sensible of the blow? - Yes, I was sensible enough; they caught me by the throat; their nails were stuck in my throat; when I was in the ditch one man came upon me directly, and another held my throat, and two were rummaging my pockets; they took my watch; and I had two guineas and some silver in this great coat, which I have on at present; they took my watch from my fob, and tore the buttons off besides; I put the money into my great coat pocket, all but one guinea; and I had silver in this left hand breeches pocket; they took that also; they took every farthing I had, which was about three guineas, in money; they took a handkerchief: it was a silver watch; one man throttled me in that manner, that I could hardly swallow for three or four days, and I can feel it now; and there were the marks of his nails in my throat; I was sensible the whole time: they were with me about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Court. That is a long while? - I cannot say just to a minute; but I dare say it was near that.</p>
               <p>What sort of a night was it? - A fine moon-light night, as bright as day: I never saw either of the four men before to my knowledge: they were going to strip me; they were getting off this coat, but somebody disturbed them; I believe it was a man on horseback; and they went off, they went toward Chelsea again; they had taken this hat, which I have, and when I got up I begged my hat very hard; I got out of the ditch, and asked for my hat; and one of them turned back and d - d my eyes, and swore he would kill me if I did not turn my head the other way; while I was in the ditch I begged for mercy, and to have my watch; and one man said, d - n my eyes I will take and kill you if you say another word; I just turned myself round, and they were on the full run; and I picked up my hat, and ran after them, to see which way they went; I followed them till I came to the green, there I lost sight of them; not till then; just over the stile I lost sight of them; and the blood poured down, that I really got faint and weak, and I returned home.</p>
               <p>Do you know any of the persons who committed this robbery? - I do.</p>
               <p>Which of them? - These three men at the bar were the men that robbed me; as for Durham he was the most desperate man I ever knew; I am equally sure of them all, by my own eye.</p>
               <p>How were they dressed? - There were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130010"></xptr>three in soldiers clothes, and one in a darkish coat, which is Newton.</p>
               <p>What is it that you swear to them by, by their faces, or their clothes, or what? - It is not by their clothes; it is by their faces.</p>
               <p>Did you take notice of any other weapon besides the bludgeon? - I did not.</p>
               <p>How many of them spoke? - When they came up they began to stop me.</p>
               <p>Which of them was it that said, d - n you, where are you going in such a hurry? - That was Jones.</p>
               <p>Which was the man that had the bludgeon, and struck you? - Durham.</p>
               <p>What did you observe Newton do? - He rifled me.</p>
               <p>How soon after the robbery did you see them again? - I believe it was a week after.</p>
               <p>Did you know any of them again? - As soon as I saw them I knew them all again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner Newton's Counsel. Why when you came to the publick office, in Bow-street, I suppose all these men were in irons? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether Newton had? - He was cut very much.</p>
               <p>These were shewn to you as the persons who had robbed you? - They were.</p>
               <p>At the time you went to Bow-street, you expected to find those that robbed you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I observe that the letter which was sent, and which you have put in, informs you that the persons who had robbed you were in custody? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And before that some little part of your property was found, so that you came there in full expectation that you should see the persons that had robbed you? - I could not say till I saw them; but I came with that view.</p>
               <p>You say these people might be ten minutes with you; I dare say the time appeared very long; it probably would to any man under such circumstances? - I cannot say as to the time; it might not be so long.</p>
               <p>There were three of them in soldier's clothes? - Yes; they had slouched hats.</p>
               <p>I need not ask you whether you was considerably alarmed and frightened? - I certainly was.</p>
               <p>You had bled a great deal in the ditch? - A vast quantity.</p>
               <p>You have swore to all these persons; recollect yourself, you know their lives are at stake? - I am as safe as if on the spot.</p>
               <p>Are you equally sure to all of them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Durham. I have not had any regimental coat on for this two months.</p>

               <p>I am one of the patrol under the direction of Bow-street; on Monday night, the 11th of January, I went out, and staid out the whole of Monday night; and coming up from Brentford early on Tuesday morning, on this side Kensington, I met two persons in haste; they told me of Gardiner being robbed, and we went in pursuit of them; and about five in the morning, in the Fulham-road, we came up to the three prisoners; there were three of us; we immediately endeavoured to secure them; they began fighting, and a desperate scuffle insued; at last, we secured them, and got them handcuffed; near the place where Newton was engaged with one of the men, I found this old handkerchief, with a steel watch chain, and a parcel of seals and trinkets to it; it lay in a little heap in the handkerchief; I heard something rattle when I picked it up; and I found a small pocket handkerchief in Newton's pocket, marked; I found no other property that the coachman owned.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I can safely swear to my chain, and every little trinkum that is to it; and this handkerchief, to the best of my judgment, is mine.</p>
               <p>Is there any mark on the handkerchief? - There is P. A. or something of that sort; I picked it up some time since; but I would not swear to it on any account; the mark is like the mark, and the handkerchief is like the handkerchief I lost.</p>
               <p>Maynard. Durham, whom I laid hold on, had this bludgeon in his hand; and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130011"></xptr>this bludgeon was found near the place where Newton was; my partner produces another bludgeon; Durham and Newton were in the same dress; Jones had a drab great coat on.</p>

               <p>Had they any weapons? - No.</p>
               <p>Had they any thing to defend themselves with, or to attack you with? - No; we found the three bludgeons in the road.</p>
               <p>Was there any scuffle between you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How was the scuffle? - With our fists; my foot slipped, and Newton lay across me; I laid fast hold of him by his hair, and he could not do me any damage.</p>
               <p>Then, you fought only with your fists? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you soon down? - Soon down; in getting hold of Newton, my foot slipped, and I could not recover myself; Newton remained upon me a quarter of an hour; Hughes helped me.</p>
               <p>When you was down in that manner, could you see in what manner the others were scuffling? - No, only I heard Mr. Maynard, the captain of the party, call out murder! murder! several times.</p>
               <p>Did you see how they were fighting? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>How do you know whether they fought with fists or weapons? - Hughes told me he came up to Jones, and took this bludgeon from him, and beat him with it.</p>
               <p>Do you call a bludgeon a weapon? - I do not call it fire-arms.</p>
               <p>I did not ask you about fire-arms; I should think a bludgeon a weapon, and a dangerous weapon? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>But you told me the three bludgeons were picked up in the road? - That was afterwards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Newton had no bludgeon; and in the end of the scuffle, you took but two bludgeons? - There were three found on the spot.</p>
               <p>You, the patrol at that time, only secured two? - The three were found in the road.</p>
               <p>How many did you find yourself? - I found none.</p>
               <p>Who did find any? - I do not recollect; three were found on the same morning, and we brought them to town with us.</p>
               <p>Were they all three brought in together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were they all three brought in by strangers, or did any of the patrol bring them in? - We brought them in with us; we picked them up in the road; I cannot say who picked them up; I was in the house with the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Newton. I leave it to my counsel.</p>
               <p>Court. Your counsel cannot speak for you. If you have any account to give of yourself to the jury, where you was; or if you have any thing to observe on the evidence, you must do it yourself.</p>

               <p>I was going to Battersea about five in the morning, and I saw these two prisoners as I was going along Putney-road; I was just behind them, and the patrols laid hold of them two, and took me.</p>
               <p>Are you in the army? - No.</p>
               <p>What way of life was you in? - I lived<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130012"></xptr>with my aunt, who kept a wine vault; I was going to see a cousin at Battersea.</p>
               <p>Court. Where are the wine vaults? - In King-street, Westminster.</p>

               <p>Jury. My lord, in consideration of the good character of Newton, the jury beg to recommend him to mercy.</p>
               <p>Court. I am always glad to listen to the recommendation of juries on such subjects; I will tell you why in this case I cannot accede to it, because these men have been guilty of a great deal of unnecessary cruelty in the perpetration of their robberies; they have added an unnecessary barbarity to robbery. The duty we owe to the public, for the sake of protecting honest persons who are going about their lawful business, ought not to suffer us to shew such persons any favour; and therefore, though I am very sorry for that prisoner Newton, and particularly for his youth, and with respect to the good character that has been given him, it is impossible for me, consistent with the opinions I have held during my whole life, and which I have constantly declared in public, to give the least countenance to your recommendation.</p>
               <p>Tried by the first Middlesex Jury before the Lord CHIEF BARON.</p>

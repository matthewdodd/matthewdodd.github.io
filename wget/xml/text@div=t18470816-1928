                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman C</hi> 112.) On Tuesday, the 3rd of Aug., I saw the prisoners in Marylebone-street, with a horse in their possession—O' Don<lb></lb>nell and Condon were leading it by these two comforters—one was tied round the nose and head, and the other attached as a rein—Hogan was close by, in company with them—I asked them where they had got the horse—O'Don<lb></lb>nell said, "We found it"—I said it was strange to find an old horse like that, and asked where they found it—Condon said, "In the Bayswater-road"—I asked him where he was going to take it to—he said, "To the station-house"—I asked what station-house—he said, "Any one"—I said, "Well, here is a station-house very near here, I will take the horse and you there," which I did.</p>

                  </hi> I live in Wood field-road, Harrow-road. I had a grey gelding in a field in the Harrow-road—I saw it safe about half-past one o'clock in the afternoon of the 3rd of Aug.; and about two, when I went to fetch it, it was gone—it was the same horse that was stopped by the officer—the field is about three miles from Marylebone-street—there was no mound on one side of the field—they are building there—the horse could have got out of the field, but he would not do so—there is very good pasture there—it had been there two months—the gate opens into the Harrow-road—when I left the horse about half-past one o'clock, it was in the centre of the field—there was another horse with it—that remained there—it was rather a better one than mine, and they could not catch it—if it had strayed from the field it could not very well have got into the Bayswater-road, because they were laying down pipes there, and it could not have got by the men and the fires—I had not seen the prisoners about my premises.</p>

               <p>near the prosecutor's. I met the three prisoner together, about a quarter past two o'clock, coming down the Harrow-road, with the horse, not more than forty yards from the field—Condon was riding it—I knew the horse, as my father has borrowed it—Condon had a red comforter for a bridle, and a black handkerchief for the reins—it was a very quiet horse.</p>

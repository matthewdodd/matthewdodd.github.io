                  </hi>. I am a tailor, living at Ely-court, Holborn—on Satur<lb></lb>day night, 22d March, I think, I was coming along the Minories—I saw the prisoner, another man, and a woman together—as I was passing by them, the two men gave me a severe shove on the side—I turned round and asked them what they did it for—I was walking quite steadily—they gave me a <hi rend="italic">shoulder</hi> with their arms—the other man was nearest to me, not the prisoner—they struck me one after the other—the other man struck me first—the prisoner first struck me with his arm, and immediately afterwards I moved from them; and he <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with a stick, and before I knew where I was, I was struck with a stick, which broke in two halves—they went along, and in going along I met a policeman, and said something to him—they went along jeering and laughing as if they had gained a victory over me—I met them again at the corner of Aldgate, and they several times threatened me then—they said they would give it to me when I got down to Houndsditch—I said that was on my way home; so when I went down there the prisoner struck me with the stick again—that was near Fireball-court, in Houndsditch—there were two young chaps standing by, and in self-defence I struck the prisoner, and he struck me back—I gave the two young lads my hat and the bundle—the prisoner struck me with the stick, and then I hit him in self<lb></lb>defence—as we were fighting in the street, he gave me one stab here in the side of the head—I did not fall—he was standing and so was I—we were tangled together, and he stabbed me in the side of the head—when I felt the first stab, I got him down underneath me, and he had not the full power of his hand—I could not get away from him—I saw a penknife in his hand—I cannot say how often he struck me with it—he repeated it several times—he gave me one stab before we got on the ground, and he followed up the stabbing directly afterwards—when I got up I ran off as quick as I could, for medical aid—I went to two or three shops, and they would not dress the wound—I was bleeding frightfully; my clothes were all covered with blood—I went to the London Hospital at last.</p>

I am a cooper, and live at 4, Fireball-court, Houndsditch—on 22d March last, I was coming down Houndsditch and saw O'Brien and the prisoner quarrelling for about ten minutes, I should say—they got fighting and struggling together and fell on the opposite side of Houndsditch, opposite Fireball-court, just underneath a lamp—I saw the prisoner raise his right arm and strike him repeatedly—O'Brien then got up and stood about four yards from the prisoner, and said, "He has got a knife; he has stabbed me"—he was covered with blood—the prisoner then got up and walked over towards Fireball-court side, and went along up Hounds<lb></lb>ditch, and went away—O'Brien ran just before he got to Fireball-court, to get assistance—I saw the prisoner taken up past St. Mary-axe, about forty or fifty yards from there—I was following him and saw him taken—I did not see a stick used of any kind.</p>

I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital—on Sun<lb></lb>day, 23d March, the prosecutor was brought there, after 12 o'clock at night; he was bleeding very much from the head—I found seven punctured wounds in the scalp; they went through the scalp; they were not quite a quarter of an inch deep; they were inflicted by a sharp pointed instrument; a penknife would do it—he has been out of the hospital for some time; he its discharged, cured—they were not serious wounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Would not you expect, if they were done with a pen<lb></lb>knife, they would have gone in deeper? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would depend on the severity of the blow—I should expect to find small punctured wounds; the bone would prevent it going in deep; unless the penknife was very strong, it would break against the bone—I have seen pipes with metal at the end—I should scarcely think that a metal pipe which had been in use some time and had got worn at the end would inflict those wounds; it might do so; I would not swear that it could not; if it were worn it might.</p>

               <p>"I was in the Minories on Saturday evening; I had been to a concert room and was returning home with my friend and his lady. The prosecutor shoved the lady by the arm, and I said, 'You should not shove the lady.' I knocked him about with a stick; he went back and then approached again, and wanted to have some words with us. We told him it would be better for him to retire; I said, 'I do not intend to fight here, but come to my house and I will fight.' He then pushed me on the cheek with such violence that I fell. I had a German wooden pipe in my hand, and struck him with it; I cannot tell how, as I had drunk well. I cannot say what further occurred till I was taken into custody.

                  </hi>. I am the landlord of the Cape of Good Hope public-house, Lime-street—the prisoner was in my employment as a waiter for two years, up to the last day he was taken in custody—he has always been very quiet during that time—he never keeps a knife in his pocket—I have asked bun for a knife, and he had not had one—nobody smokes in the houses-all the Germans keep pipes, but he never had one in the house to my knowledge—Mrs. Kraus brought some pipes over with her from Germany for her cook and her other servants—I always found the prisoner a very quiet, orderly, respect<lb></lb>able man.</p>

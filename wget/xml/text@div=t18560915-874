                  </hi>. I was a police inspector, but have retired On 1st Sept I went, in consequence of information, to No. 23, Chapel-place, Coram-street, Russell-square, with other officers—I found the front door open, I proceeded up stairs to the first floor—I pushed the room door in, and found the two prisoners; they were sitting close to a bright, dear fire—on seeing me enter, they both jumped up—the woman picked from the table a quantity of counterfeit coin, and flung it towards the window, which was open—a portion of it fell on the floor—at that time the man threw from his hand a plaster of Paris mould, and commenced stamping on it—he had neither coat, waistcoat, nor hat on, and his shirt sleeves were tucked up—I seized him, and pushed him into a sort of cupboard—he resisted violently, and the female prisoner seized me behind—by the effort of the officers, she was pulled from me, and both the prisoners were taken to a distant part of the room and secured—I picked up a portion of the mould which the man had thrown down, it is for making 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pieces—I saw on the mantelpiece eight counterfeit shillings unfinished, of the date of 1820, and three counterfeit sixpences—on the fire I found this ladle, with white metal in it in a fused state—inside the fender this plaster of Paris mould, which is complete, with this counterfeit shilling in it—the <hi rend="italic">get</hi> is to the shilling—the mould was so hot I could not hold it—the shilling is of the same date as the others, 1820—I found on the table a galvanic battery, in full play—there was a good groat attached to the wire, and six counterfeit groats were in the deposit place undergoing the process of electro plating—there was a piece of glass with plaster of Paris on it—I saw these two files found on the table, with white metal in their teeth, some plaster of Paris in powder, and some white sand; all the instruments for making counterfeit coin—this battery cylinder was in the cupboard—I took the prisoners to the station—they were asked their names and address; the female prisoner said she was not married.</p>

On Tuesday the 5th of May, the prisoner came to my house, about eight in the evening, and said, he was desired by a lady, to call at a shoe-maker's, and send some shoes for her to try on; I believe he said her name was Thompson. I put six pair of callimanco shoes into a bag, and sent my boy with them; and in about six minutes he came back and told me, the man had got two pair from him; on which I went to two or three pawnbrokers, and left the mark of the shoes, that is a B, and my name, and desired them to stop them; accordingly one pair of them was stopped the next day, by Mr. Parker, who sent for me; (the shoes produced and deposed to to be one of the pairs that were put in the bag.) I never found the other pair; I am sure he is the man that was in my shop; I took him at the pawnbroker's.</p>

            . I live servant with Mr. Blackburn. The prisoner came to my master's on the 5th of May, about eight in the evening, and desired I would bring some shoes to a lady; my master put six pair in a bag, and gave them to me. I went with him to the house; he desired I would stay below till he went up stairs; he came down again, and said, the lady was engaged with a mantua-maker; he came again and took all the six pair up; then he came afterward, and said, I might come up; I went up and saw the bag lying on the stairs; I asked, if any body was there that wanted shoes? and was told, no. I took the bag up; there were two pair missing, and the man was gone.</p>

A friend was walking with me; I turned round and saw my handkerchief in the hand of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know how long before that you had felt the handkerchief in your pocket - A. I knew my handkerchief was in my pocket ten minutes before, I should presume. I immediately when I saw the handkerchief in the prisoner's hand, went up to him, and he dropped the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him drop it - A. I did. I picked it up. The prisoner run away, and I pursued him. I never lost sight of him for a moment. I took him in Somerset-place, and secured him. I took him to Bow-street, and he was committed. I have the handkerchief, I have kept it in my possession ever since. This is the handkerchief. It was in my outer coat-pocket when taken from me. It is my handkerchief.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence; called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

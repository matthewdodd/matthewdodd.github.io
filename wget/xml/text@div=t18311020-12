            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner on the 23rd of October, in Worship-street, Shoreditch: I found a carpet bag, and apparently the cover of it, both filled with clothes - he was walking up Worship-street with them over his shoulder; one bag in front, and the other behind; they contained three coats, three pairs of boots, a pair of trousers, a pair of breeches, three pairs of drawers, two waistcoats, six shirts, a handkerchief, three table-cloths, a silver knife, a common steel one, and three common knives; he had in his pocket six sovereigns and 12s. 6d. - he told me he had left his place for a month, and that it was at No. 12, Berkeley-square - Jones claimed the things as his master's; I found a paper in his pocket, through which I found the owner.</p>

            . I live at No. 246, Shoreditch - I buy and sell clothes. The prisoner came to my house on Sunday morning last; I never saw him before - he asked if I bought old clothes; I said Yes - he said he had got some at his lodgings; I went with him to a public-house opposite Shoreditch church - he brought out two bags, and told me he would come down to my house, and I should buy them of him; he brought the bags to my house about a quarter to eight o'clock that morning - the first article he showed me was an olive double breasted coat, quite new, and asked 30s. for it; I value it at 4l. or 5l. - he then showed me two coats, and asked 20s. each for them; I asked how he came by them; he said his master gave them to him - I said, "I think they have hardly been worn, and I think them too good for your master to give you;" I told him to put them all into his bag, and I sent for the headborough, who took him to the station-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He asked me first if I wanted to buy any thing; I asked if he bought old clothes, which I had to sell - I asked him a price for them, and he offered me 2l.; and because I would not take that, I suppose he fetched the officer.</p>
               <p>ROBERT JONES. I am confident all these things are my master's - I have examined them; the bags are also his - he had a written character with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) My Lord and Gentlemen, - I beg leave to assure you that so far from my being an old offender, or having and bad accomplices, I have only been five months in London, my native place being Market Overton, in the County of Rutlandshire. I had served two masters faithfully, and in all probability should have continued to serve the prosecutor with the same faith and industry, had I not been driven to despair by the bad usage of the butler, Robert Jones; it is true, I ought to have complained to my master, who I am sure would have seen me righted, but I was afraid to complain. I am, my Lord and Gentlemen, overcome with sorrow and shame- but I do trust that you will take into your consideration my youth, being only eighteen years old - that you will consider the respectability of my family, my father having been forty years high-constable of the County of Rutlandshire; my father died about three years since - my mother is alive, and will be heart broken when she hears of my disgrace. I do hope, my Lord and Gentlemen, you will consider these circumstances, and inflict as lenient a fine as the nature of the case can admit. My Lord and Gentlemen, I throw myself entirely upon your merciful consideration, in hope that my master will speak for me, and prove the character he received with me from Mr. Chapman.</p>

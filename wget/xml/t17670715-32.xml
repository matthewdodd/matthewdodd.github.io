            . I am a silversmith, and live at Charing-cross; the prisoner came to my shop on the 29th of May, about nine in the morning, and asked what I would give anounce for this tankard; (produced and deposed to by prosecutor.) I weighed it, and marked upon it that I would give 5 s. an ounce; he told me he would go back to the gentleman that sent him, and ask him if he would sell it for that, and he would give me the preference; he went away, and the paper came; I was reading an advertisement about it being stolen; he came back at the time I was reading it; he said, the gentleman would let me have it at the price; I stopped it, and told him it was stolen from the Black Lion, Russel-street, Covent-garden; he seemed very cool, not affrighted, and said he would go back and tell the gentleman; he went, but never returned again; I sent to the prosecutor, to let him know I had got his tankard.</p>

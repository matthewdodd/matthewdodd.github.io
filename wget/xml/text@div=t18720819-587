On 3rd August I was on duty near Ropemaker's Fields, Limehouse, about 12.45 a.m.; I met the prisoner—he passed me—I went a few steps further on, and saw the cellar-flap of 66, Three Colt Street had been broken open—that was about 20 yds. from where I saw the prisoner—he was coming away from there—there was a hole in the flap large enough for a man to go down—the occupier was called up, and the prisoner came back while I was still there—I turned my light on him, and saw he was all over sawdust and cobwebs—he said "What are you looking at? do you think I have robbed anyone?"—I asked him where he had been, and he said he had been to Mr. Waller's—I asked him where he had been since, and he said "In Limehouse"—that was all I could get from him—I charged him on suspicion with breaking and entering the cellar—he said "All right"—he was taken to the Station by a constable, and I returned to where I met the prisoner, and found a bottle of wine close to the kerb opposite the shop—that was two hours afterwards—a pocket-book and some matches were found on the prisoner—I went into the cellar with the occupier—there were footmarks about the place, sawdust on the floor, and cobwebs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Mr. Jannaway, wine and spirit merchant, 66, Three Colt Street, Limehouse—on the night of 2nd August I saw the cellar fastened securely about 11 o'clock—I was called up a few minutes before 1 o'clock, and found two boards had been wrenched up, and there was a hole sufficient to admit a man into the cellar—It was rather an old flap, and the boards were somewhat rotten—I was shown this bottle; it has "201" on the cork—it belongs to the prosecutor, and was safe in the cellar—the cellar was very low, and there were cobwebs on the ceiling.</p>

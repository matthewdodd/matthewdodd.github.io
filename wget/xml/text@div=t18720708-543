On Monday morning, 26th May, I was on duty in the Essex Road, Islington, about 5.15—from information I received I went to a low wall where I could see the backs of the houses in Cross Street—I looked over the wall, and I there saw the prisoner Holmes and a man named Llewellyn who is now under sentence—they looked me straight in the face, and I asked them what they were doing there—they made no reply, but immediately went to the back kitchen window of 35, Cross Street, and forced their way through that window into the house—I ran round to the front door—that house was untenanted, but there was some one minding it—the door was open, and Holmes and Llewellyn stood in the doorway; it was partly open; when they saw me they pushed the door to again—I forced it open with my shoulder, and seized hold of Llewellyn in the hall—at that time Holmes was about two yards from him—it was quite light; the sun was shining—three gentlemen came in to assist me, and they seized hold of Llewellyn too—I let them hold him, and pursued after Holmes—he made his escape down the back kitchen stairs, and out of the window he had got through—I saw a third man standing behind the door in the passage, and when I went in he ran out the front way—I can't speak positively as to that man being Dennis—Llewellyn was taken to the station—I found property tied up in three large bundles in the garden at the rear of 35—I took it to the station, and Mr. Carruthers identified it.</p>

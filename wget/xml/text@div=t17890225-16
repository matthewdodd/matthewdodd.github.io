               <p>I am a constable; about six o'clock on the 9th of this month, the prosecutor came to me, and said he was robbed of his watch and half-a-guinea, and some silver; I asked him if he knew the person? he said, yes; she had robbed him in the Red Lion stable; I got up immediately, and he went to the Red Lion, and I followed him to the yard, I then took him with me to the Bell at Hounslow, and asked a carman, whom I met, if he had seen such a person as the prisoner? He said, yes, he saw her a little beyond the Black Dog at Belfound; I advised him to go back, and get his horse, and I got another, and we pursued; we heard of her all the way on the road; we went on to Windsor, and took her nearly within about half a mile from the Bells at Hoseley, near Datchet; I told her she had done a robbery; she said she had not; I desired her to give me the watch she had taken from the gentleman's servant; she said she had no watch, and that she had not robbed any body; I said I would search her; she then gave me the watch, and afterwards I searched her, and found in her pocket only one good shilling, and one bad one, and two linen handkerchiefs, one about her head, and another in her pocket; I put her on my mare, and carried her before Justice Lane, at Belfound, and he committed her; I believe we took her about half past nine in the morning.</p>
               <p>Court. When you first saw the prosecutor was he perfectly sober? - I did not perceive him to be in liquor; I can't pretend to say.</p>
               <p>How far from Hounslow was it where you took her? - I never was that road much, I only know by information.</p>
               <p>What account did she give of the watch? - She denied it at first, and then she gave it to me on my threatening to search her.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Did not I tell you that the servant had given me the watch? - No, my Lord, she said he had given her a shilling, but did not mention a thing about his giving her the watch.</p>
               <p>To Culbert. Look at the watch? - It is my watch, I had it at that time, there is no number to it, but I am sure it is my watch; I know the handkerchiefs, my name is on one.</p>
               <p>Court. You will not swear to her taking your money? - No, it might have fell out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>What money had you? - Half-a-guinea, and some silver, I don't know how much.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250046"></xptr>Might not your watch have fell out of your pocket also? - Yes, it might.</p>

               <p>I had been to see my child; I have a child about three months old; I was coming home to Brentford, and I met the gentleman's servant; he asked me to go back, and he would get a bed, and give me something to drink; I went with him, and the house was shut up; we went into the yard, and he put his horse in a stable, and then pulled me in, and locked me in, and left me for half an hour; he then came back, and was to give me half-a-crown; when he felt in his pocket he had but one shilling, and he gave me his watch to keep 'till he got change in the morning; he gave me a handkerchief to tie round my head, and the other I took up in the stable; I was afraid to stay there too late in the morning for fear the people should get up, and see me there.</p>

On the 20th of July, about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to the door, and asked to see a pair of spectacles. He came to the counter; I shewed him eight pairs, leaving them all before him. When he tried on the eighth pair, he said they would suit him, and asked the price - I said 12 s. He said that was too much; and, in the meantime, I missed a pair. He went out. I looked to be certain; then followed, and overtook him three doors off, and said he had a pair of spectacles - he appeared confused, but made no answer. Wilcox came up, and said they were in his hand. I then found them up his cuff. Nobody but me was serving in the shop. Mr. Farrow was at the door.</p>
               <p>JAMES WILCOX. I am an officer. I saw him come out of the shop with something in his hand. I assisted in securing him, and saw the spectacles taken from under his cuff. I found another pair of spectacles on him, and duplicates for five pairs.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Duncan. On the 23d of December nobody was in the house but myself. I left the house between three and four o'clock. I double-locked the street door, and left all safe; the clerk had the keys of the warehouse; he took them away on Saturday night. I returned at six o'clock, and found the street door locked; but cannot say, whether it was double-locked as I had left it. On going into the passage, I found a black bag containing silk stockings, which was not there when I left the house. The patrol was coming by, and I told him; I stood at the door, and did not leave it. The warehouse door I found wide open, which was shut when I left, and a dark lantern in the warehouse. The constable and patrol searched the place. Mr. Pearson afterwards saw it.</p>

            , I am a marshalman. In consequence of information, Bradfield and Mr. Duncan, went to Grout's lodging. I remained in Bishopsgate church-yard; they returned to me there; Bradfield and I then went to Grout's lodging, and on returning found him with Mr. Duncan. I took him; we went into a public-house in Wormwood-street. I asked him if he had given Bradfield two pair of gloves to sell to Stevens; he said he had, and that he found them in a bit of paper in Bishopsgate-street, by the London Tavern. I asked him if he ever had any more, or had seen any more, he said No; there was only one pair. The question was repeated more than once or twice; he gave the same answer. I took him and Bradfield to the justice-room; this was on Wednesday the 2nd of January - I felt his right hand coat pocket and found nothing; as I was going to the left hand coat pocket, he put his hand in it, and said,</p>
               <p>"Don't take my money." I watched him draw his hand out, and saw a piece of paper in it. I opened his hand, and took it out; it contained four pair of silk gloves. I believe there was a penny, a halfpenny and a farthing in his pocket. I said,</p>
               <p>"How is this! you told me you had only the one pair, that you sold to Stevens." He said,</p>
               <p>"The four pair were with the one pair; I found them altogether." I went several times, and to a great many places, to find Solomon, but could not. I went to his neighbourhood, to Grout's, and several public-houses. The paper was not muddy - it was a loose bit of paper - I cannot say what weather it was on the 23d of December.</p>

            . I am a marshalman. I accompanied Mr. Duncan and Harrison to search Grout's lodgings, in Still-alley, Houndsditch. I searched two rooms on the second floor - the house had no number. Grout's wife came in at the time. In one of the rooms I found a black bag; there was a bed in each room. In the large room backward in which his wife was, I found a black bag containing a quantity of mitts and gloves, all silk. I found the bag in an old broken press-bedstead; and in a box, containing women's clothes, I found a paper, containing more silk gloves, I think about four dozen. In the next room, which is a small front room, communicating by a door from one to the other, and fastened on the large room side (both rooms had doors communicating with the staircase.) I found two black bags, empty; and a pair of half silk stockings, which had been worn. I compared the three bags with the other found in the prisoner's house, they tallied exactly in size, colour, quality, shape, and tape. Grout's wife was taken, I saw her in Grout's company - he acknowledged her as his wife - she was afterwards discharged.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How did he acknowledge her as his wife - A. He said,</p>
               <p>"It is true what I told you to-day, that my wife brought them, and here she is, ask her." The door opening from the small room to the staircase was unfastened; I could go from the large room to the small one.</p>

            . I assisted in the search. I produce the four pair of gloves, also the gloves and mitts found in the large room, and the gloves found in the box, also the bags. I searched for Barnett, without success, at several places. I went with two or three more officers who knew him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do not hatters use those bags - A. I do not know; they are made of black linen.</p>

            . I am the daughter of Grout. I know Solomon; he was my father's lodger, he lodged in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200033"></xptr>the little front room, for three or four weeks before my father was taken, and then he went away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Where did you live at the time of this transaction - A. I was servant to Mr. Lazarus, of Cutler-street; I went home three or four times a week for clean things; my father's is the large room, a door leads into the other room, which is fastened on my father's side, with a piece of leather and a nail. Only Solomon lived in the other room - my mother cleaned it, and made his bed. I never saw the bags before.</p>
               <p>Q. Where have you come from - A. Brand's house - he told me that he could see my father was innocent, because he was lame; and said it was my duty to come and get my father off.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mind so as you get your father off - A. No; I have no reason to care for Solomon; I am angry with him for getting my father into trouble.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. How does Solomon get to his room - A. There is a door to the staircase.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you state what you have to-day, before you went to Brand's - A. Yes, at Guildhall. I have been kept at Brand's for fear I should run away. I was sent to sleep at a person's the night before I was examined. I am near sixteen years old.</p>

            PEARSON re-examined. I have examined this property; here are a pair of half-hose, partly worn; I had seen them on the Friday or Saturday before the robbery - the mitts and gloves are all their's; I had seen them in the course of two months previous; they had been many years in the house; we sell for exportation only, and pack and ship all goods ourselves; there is a private mark on them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Do you mean to to say you saw that identical pair the day before - A. I saw the dozen of which they formed a part, and opened the paper - we have a mark on them.</p>
               <p>Q. Would not that mark be on every pair you have - A. No, only on that dozen, as it was all we had of that quality.</p>
               <p>COURT, Q. Must all these goods be taken at one or at different times - A. I should think it would take two hours to remove them; they might take them away at once in three or four bags, each bag would weigh fifty or sixty pounds. They opened six drawers to get them.</p>

            . I am an officer. I searched after Barnett in the neighbourhood of Petticoat-lane, I knew him before; I found him on the 21st of January; I had been looking for him for a fortnight or three weeks. I took him into the George, public-house. Worster was with me, and sat in a box opposite to him - he opened the door, shut me in the box, ran off, and made his escape down Still-alley. I followed him, and was then stopped by his brothers - as he went out at the door, he said,</p>
               <p>"Joe," his brother Joe stopped me. I saw him again on the 2d of February, when I was in the Lee Hoy, Mile-end, and took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. He was smoking his pipe very quiet, on the 21st of January - A. Yes; he was at the corner of Still-alley, which is a place much frequented by officers. I told him to come into the George, public-house and stop till Worster returned. I said,</p>
               <p>"I suppose it is all right, or you would not be standing here," he smiled, and said</p>
               <p>"Yes, or I should not be here." This was on the day Grout's wife was discharged.</p>
               <p>GROUT'S Defence. I am perfectly innocent of the robbery. My wife brought the things up into our room - I asked what she had there, she said it was a few things belonging to Mrs. Barnard, where she was lodging.</p>
               <p>SOLOMON'S Defence. I know nothing whatever of the transaction.</p>
               <p>MR. PEARSON, re-examined. The goods were worth 500 l. or 600 l., without those found in the passage - Those found in Still-alley, are not worth above 15 l. or 16 l.</p>

            . I am a baker, and live in Union-place, Tabernacle-row, I have two rooms there. On the 23d of December, between eleven and twelve o'clock, Solomon knocked at my door, and asked me to go to his father, who lives about one hundred yards off, to ask him for a shirt and handkerchief, as he was not on good terms with him. I asked him in and went, and his father gave them to me - he went into my kitchen and washed himself, then went into my bed-room and dressed himself. I asked him to dine with me, which he did; we dined between twelve and one o'clock, and after dinner, had two or three pots of beer - he staid with me till ten o'clock. When he heard the watchman call ten, he said he should be too late, he did not leave me all that time.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Are you married - A. No; I have no servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Who dressed your dinner - A. A young woman in the house, she saw him. Mr. and Mrs. White keep the house, she is not their servant; she washes for me and comes very often - she is not very well, she was here two or three days; I believe she had a pain in her inside, she has been taken so this three days, she once had an inflammation - her name is

               <p>Q. At home at your place - A. Why, to tell you the truth, she lives with me. Mrs. White is in the family way and is not well. I cannot say whether she was at home on this Sunday - I have two rooms on the first floor, there are no other lodgers - I have lived there a year and a half, with Shillitoe; she goes by my name. Her sister did live in Pratt-street, Lambeth, a fortnight ago.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath was Mrs. Shannon or Shillitoe in your house when you left it - A. Yes, this morning she was, I left at nine o'clock, and have not been home since - she is her own doctor, she knows her complaint, and has medicine in the house. I suppose it is nine months since a doctor attended her; she had a very violent pain in her bowels this morning, and said she was very poorly, and had rather not come here - I am sure she is too ill to come; she said,</p>
               <p>"A'y'nt you going to the Old Bailey to night?" I said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, will you go," she said,</p>
               <p>"No, I don't find myself very well; I am very ill still."</p>
               <p>Q. You only asked if she should like to come - A. She not being a married woman, did not like the disgrace. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200034"></xptr>left her ill this morning - I understand the prisoner lived in Still-alley, I was never there. The last time I saw the prisoner before, was when he was in possession under the Sheriff. I was subpoenned to come here about Wednesday. Shillitoe let the prisoner in.</p>
               <p>Four witnesses gave the prisoner, Grout, a good character.</p>

I went with him to an Alehouse, and he (the Prisoner) asked for a private Room, and said if I would let him have some Money, he would conduct (deduct) it when the Lambs were sold, that I might bury the Skins, and then no body could swear to the Lambs. He likewise said he should have some more Sheep and would employ me to kill and sell them for him. I then suspected the Prisoner, and we went to Dobey's House, and I sent him for a Constable, but before he returned the Prisoner attempted twice to escape from me, and said it would do me no Good to take his Life away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot-clicker, and live at 64, Sun-street, Bishopsgate—on the morning of the 27th July, about 2 o'clock, I was at the Swan public-house in Long-alley—the prisoner was there singing—I invited him to take a glass of ale, which he accepted, and then I sung; then he sung again—at about half-past 2, I left the house with him and his wife, and we went to another public-house to have some spirits—I was never in that house before; the prisoner suggested our going there—I paid for some spirits—I drank some, and the prisoner and his wife had the rest between them—we did not remain there long, we all three came out together—at the top of Long-alley I put out my left hand to shake hands with the prisoner, and with his other hand he took my ring off my finger; it was on the little finger of my left hand—I grasped him by the collar and said, "You vagabond, you have my ring, give it me back; I do not wish to hurt you"—he struck me several times on the head with his fist—I bled very much from the nose—I still had hold of him, and I called out "Police" as loud as I could—he knocked me down—I struggled with him, and he hit me again several times—I kept calling out "Police," and one came to my assistance—the blood was flowing very much from my nose, and I could not give the prisoner into custody in the way I ought to have done, and he ran away—I did give him in charge to the policeman, but he would not take the charge—I said, "I give this man in charge for robbing me of my gold ring, and for an assault"—he said that he did not clearly understand me, and he would not take the prisoner into custody—I had been drinking a little, but I was sober; I knew what took place—I went to four police-stations before I could find out the right one that the street belonged to—I think it was 5 o'clock when I finished the last one—The next afternoon, I went into the public-house where I had first met with the prisoner, and he came in and I gave him in charge—he said he knew nothing about it—I afterwards went with the officer to 39, Primrose-street, and received my ring</p>

Mrs. Hatton lives 400 or 500 yards from the pawnbroker's—went and saw Mrs. Hatton, I did not see the ring there, I got it from her husband—I did not drink with him after<lb></lb>wards—he called for some ale—I did not pay for it—I told him if he restored my property I would not prosecute him, and would assist him all I could; that was before he gave me the ring—I might have been with the prisoner altogether, an hour and a half, but I am not positive.</p>

                  </hi>.—I am the wife of George Hatton, a boot-closer, of 39, Primrose-street—on Wednesday, 28th July, between 11 and 12 in the morning, the prisoner came to our house and asked for my husband—he was called down stairs, and he produced a ring and offered it for sale to my husband—that was not exactly in my presence, I was at work; the pri<lb></lb>soner was standing, whistling and singing, at the door, and that attracted my attention—he handed the ring to my husband, and my husband came in directly from the door and told me that the prisoner wanted to sell it him—the prisoner was not near enough to hear that—my husband after<lb></lb>wards brought me the ring, and I kept it in my possession—I did not show it to any one until I went to Mr. Attenborough's, the pawnbroker's, to know the value of it—that might have been about half an hour afterwards—he told me it was worth a sovereign or 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I brought it back and gave it to my husband—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

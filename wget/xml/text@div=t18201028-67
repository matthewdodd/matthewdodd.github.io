On the 14th of August, about twelve o'clock in the day, a dance was at Hackney-marsh; John Green came to the house, and remained there about two hours, he was tipsy when he came in - he went to the bar about two o'clock, my master served him with some gin, and asked for the money? he was very abusive, and said he would pay when he liked - my master shoved him backwards into the tap-room, he fell down and cut his head with the fender or table, at the back of it - it was not a violent push, perhaps it would not have hurt him had he been sober. He came into the passage to abuse him again, my master shoved him into the tap-room, and he fell again, came out of the tap-room, and my master shoved him out of doors, he fell on his back upon the threshold; my master picked him up, and dragged him into the yard by the shoulders; he got up in about two minutes, and went into the street, about four houses off, and laid down there about an hour and a half. My master was at home all the time. I told my mistress of it. I saw him get up, and lay down by the Cock, public-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. He behaved very rude to your master - A. Yes, he said he would pull the place down if he did not have another glass. I went to Worship-street six weeks after.</p>

            . I was at the gingling match, on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182010280030"></xptr>the 14th of August, and saw the deceased there, he was only a spectator. A dispute arose - he was struck once only, that was with a fist on the breast - he was not hit on the head - he fell upon the ground, was picked up, and taken to the public-house, as he could not walk. I remained there with him, and left between two and three o'clock in the morning - he was insensible.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR BRODERICK. Q. Did you afterwards see the man who struck him, with his hand tied in a handkerchief - A. Yes, he had no stick in his hand. There was a general fight, but he did not strike till he was struck.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I saw the deceased, he was brought to the London Hospital on Tuesday afternoon, about three o'clock, in an insensible state, remained so till that day week, and then died. He was wounded in the back of his head, it appeared to be made by an obtuse instrument - a fall against a table might have produced it - there were no external marks upon the body. I opened the head, and found a great deal of extravasated blood on the brain, which would produce stupor and insensibility. The injury on the head caused the extravasated blood, and that certainly caused his death.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODERICK. Q. What time elapses after the injury before insensibility is produced - A. Sometimes two or three hours, but it is much sooner when there is a considerable extravasation of blood - it appeared a contused wound.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose the wound to be given at two o'clock, would a man be about his ordinary business till night - A. If extravasation had not taken place - it does not always follow the blow immediately, the vessels are not able to emit the blood till the system recovers itself.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. What part of the head was he struck on - A. I cannot say. I saw one blow given him on the back of his head, and he bled at the back of his head.</p>
               <p>MR. BAILLIE re-examined. I am certain there was only one external wound upon his head.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing both these accounts to be true, as to his being apparently in perfect health at six o'clock, should you ascribe his death to the first blow given at two o'clock or to any subsequent blow - A. The blow at the back of his head caused his death. I am firmly of opinion that the blow given him in the morning caused the extravasation, if extravasation took place before the match, he could not have acted as described.</p>

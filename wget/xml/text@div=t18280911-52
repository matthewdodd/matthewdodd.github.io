            . I live at No. 28, Cheapside. On the 8th of March, I went to bed about ten or eleven o'clock at night, and saw my premises shut up; and in the morning, when my brother came down stairs, he alarmed me - on coming down, I found the shop broken open and completely stripped; I lost the articles enumerated in the indictment, in value between £200. and £300.; I heard nothing of them till the officer called about a fortnight ago - I went to the pawnbroker's in consequence of a duplicate, and found one of my umbrellas: I have traced nothing else, but I believe a bludgeon or life-protector produced to me, is mine - it is the same description as I sell, and was in my shop; my premises were entered by skeleton keys.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you any mark on that life-protector? A. Not particularly - I cannot positively swear to it.</p>

            . I am an officer. I heard of this robbery, and have been on the look out ever since - when I apprehended the prisoner I found in his fob two duplicates, one for an umbrella pawned at Williams', for 9s., the other for a coat and trousers; I afterwards searched his lodgings, and found this life-protector and some skeleton-keys - he afterwards said the umbrella was his own property.</p>
               <p>MR. CRAWFORD. This life-protector was sold at my shop; I only lost one umbrella of this sort.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an innkeeper at West Ham. On 28th August I was trying to put a strolling fiddler out of my house about half-past 10 at night, and while doing so, the prisoner, who was there, in a very determined way, closed towards me six or seven times—I pushed him away—he caught hold of me to prevent my turning the fiddler out, and in less than half a minute afterwards I missed my watch from my waistcoat pocket—the prisoner was then gone.</p>

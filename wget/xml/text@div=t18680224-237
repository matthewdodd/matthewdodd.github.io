On 28th January the prisoners came to my shop, 79, Fulham Road—Lewis asked for half-an-ounce of tobacco, which came to three half-pence—Vickers took it up—Lewis gave me a half-crown, which I returned to her, and told her to go and get change for it—as they were going out I said "Come here, I will see if I can manage it for you"—I took the half-crown and said "This is a bad one"—Lewis said she would run and fetch the person they took it of—I sent for a policeman, and they ran away—I next saw them nearly a fortnight afterwards, in a cell of the police court—I gave the half-crown to 196 B.</p>

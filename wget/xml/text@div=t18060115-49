As soon as I went into this man's house, another man that went with me called for a pint of beer; he went out of the house afterwards, and I went up stairs with the prisoner to go to bed; there was some people in the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there many in number in the tap-room? - A. There was about ten or a dozen in the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Q. You asked the landlord to shew you up to bed did you? - A. Yes, he shewed me up to bed himself with a candle in his hand; after he went down, I pulled my jacket and waistcoat off and laid it on a chair, the landlord went down and brought up a pot of warm ale, he took the waistcoat off the chair.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before the landlord came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180601150037"></xptr>up with the pot of ale? - A. It was not more than five minutes, to the best of my opinion.</p>
               <p>Q. You had bespoke the ale I suppose? - A. Yes, and I paid him for it too.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pay him for it then? - A. Yes, and I sent for a glass of good gin and water.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you pay? - A. Six-pence or a shilling, I cannot say, I know I paid the money for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in silver? - A. It was in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you take your shilling or six-pence out of? - A. Out of my pocket, along with the two notes I had in my pocket, I had some small change in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. You had two notes? - A. Yes, One a five and one a two pound, that I got at the commissioners office, at Portsmouth, after I come from the West Indies.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take out these two notes at the time that you paid the shilling or six-pence? - A. Yes, while the landlord was in the room, I took the notes out of my waistcoat pocket; I cannot tell the numbers, I can neither read nor write.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you said he brought you up a pot of hot ale when you were in bed? - A. Yes,</p>
               <p>Q. Was it then that you looked at the notes? - A. It was a little while before, when I was going into bed, that I over hauled the notes, when the landlord was present, he was standing quite close with the candle in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. And you looked at the notes by the assistance of that candle? - A. Yes, and I put them in my pocket again, while he was standing with me.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the purport of your over hauling your notes? - A. The purport was, that I was perfectly sure that I had them in this purse that I will show you; I separated them and looked at them.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the use of your looking at them if you was sure that you had them in your pocket? - A. I was confident, I looked because I would not miss them in the room, and afterwards when I got up; he gave me a half guinea on my watch, when I went out.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came from Tottenham-court they were twisted together in your purse? - A. Yes, I meant to take them down to the ship at Portsmouth.</p>
               <p>Q. Having laid your jacket and waistcoat on a chair by the side of the bed, and the ale being put there, what happened then? - A. He took the notes out of the waistcoat before my face, after that I said not a word, and I come down in my shirt; I brought a wrong hat down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing? - A. Not a word, I was afraid of my brains being beat out if I was to impeach him at that time of the night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go out of the room so soon as he had taken your money? - A. Yes, and I got up immediately and put the waistcoat on and come down with my waistcoat and shirt, and went into the bar, he went up for my jacket and hat, as I had brought a wrong hat down; upon that I asked him half a guinea upon my watch, and I walked out of the house the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. You went out of the house the next morning? - A. I went out of the house that night and did not come to the house till the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you go out of the house? - A. The very moment I got the half guinea I went out of the house; I went again the next day to the house between twelve and one o'clock to get my pass to get it signed; I took notice of the house, to come with a peace officer to secure him.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to the house did you say any thing to the landlord? - A. Not a word.</p>

               <p>Q. Your object was to know the house again? - A. To know the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body in the house when you come back again? - A. There were two or three women and some outlandish men, I told the man who shewed me the house, he advised me to go to Lambeth-street, I did go there, and in consequence of my going to Lambeth-street he was secured; he appeared at the office at seven o'clock in the evening.</p>

               <p>Q. And then you asked him for half a guinea on your watch? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you went out of the house, where did you go? - A. I went about a quarter of a mile from the place, and there I slept.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. You did not sleep alone? - A. No, I did not sleep alone.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say that you told them there that you had been robbed? - A. Yes, I told them that I had been robbed, and that I left my watch at the house and my pass too; I told a young woman so.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted that you took some of these people to the house? - A. I took a young woman to shew me the house, because I was a stranger, but she could not find it, as I did not know the sign or the name.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask her where to find a police-office? - A. I did not ask a question till I came out of the house; I came to the house between twelve and one in the course of the forenoon of the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. When you come there was the prisoner at home? - A. Yes, that was the time that I asked him for a half guinea on the watch.</p>

               <p>Q. You said that just before the prisoner had taken the notes, you took them out to be satisfied? - Yes, to see that I had them about me; they were twisted up, I untwisted them.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180601150039"></xptr>Q. When they were twisted up, you might see as well and be satisfied without untwisting them? - A. It was to be sure that I had took them about me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you was not sure? - A. I was sure of it, it was to satisfy myself, and to look at them.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you be more than sure of having them; why did you untwist them? - A. I untwisted them to look at them.</p>
               <p>Q. You was sure they were there? - A. It was to satisfy my own mind.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you were certain you had them? - A. I was certain of it, it was only a foolish idea of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to look at them and to see if you had them, when you was certain of it. whether it was foolish or wise? - A. I will tell you, when I am among six hundred men of a night, I look that I should see my notes about me when I am going to bed, and when I saw the two notes, I rolled them up before I put them in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any more Bank notes about you? - A. Only these.</p>
               <p>Q. When you untwisted them was it for the purpose of seeing whether it was dirty paper or Bank notes? - A. To see that they were the notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say at Tottenham-court before you come away, how much money you had left? - A. They did not know how much I had left.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell any body? - A. I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say that you had deposited above twenty pounds in the steward's hands? - A. No, never; I said that I had five or six pounds in his hands; it was the gunner of the ship that gave me the money.</p>

             sworn. I believe it was on the 27th of December that the prosecutor came to the public office, in Whitechapel, and said that he had been robbed of a five pound note and a two pound note, at a public house in Blue Anchor-yard; hearing that it was at a public house, I went and spoke to the magistrates, they desired me to go down the next morning, and desire the publican to come up; I went down, I stated to the servant of the house, my business, the publican not being at home; as soon as he came home he came up, it was about a quarter before three o'clock; I took him before the magistrate that was then sitting, he examined him; I was desired by the magistrate to take him into custody till the evening, when he was examined again, the prosecutor gave much the same account then as he has now.</p>

On Monday morning I was going out, I said to him I understand you are going you had better take the five pound note, probably I may not be at home when you go; he took it.</p>
               <p>Court. Whether he had any more notes you do not know? - A. No, I saw no more.</p>

To the best of my knowledge there was about three or four; he had a glass of porter, and then he called me of one side, and asked me if I would be so good as to take care of his watch and liberty ticket till the morning.

               <p>Q. Did he enquire for a bed? - A. Not just then; some of his acquaintances came in, and he called for a pot of beer; he went to and fro in the place, and asked me if he could lodge there that night; I told him yes.

Between six and seven o'clock he came back, then he called for a pot of porter; he came then with one man and two women; after they had drank the pot of porter, he said a second time, Mrs. Murphy will you be so good as to take care of my watch and liberty ticket till the morning.</p>

               <p>Q. You say he applied to you for more money what did he say? - A.

               <p>Q. After he had done that did he go away? - A. Yes, he had three more glasses of brandy for himself and the other men, then he went away.</p>

I am not the mistress of the house, Mr. Leary asked me what demands there was upon the watch; I told him one pound three shillings, Mr. Leary asked me for the watch and gave me the money for it. When I gave him the watch, Leary says to me, this man lost seven pound here last night, did he not mention this when he was here to-day before: I turned round and asked him if he had mentioned this before, he was a long time answering, and then he said, yes, a five pound note and a two pound note. Then I says to Bryant, Cabiner did he mention any thing of this money when he was here before to-day: he made answer, no.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you as far as you know the least reason to believe that he did loose any money in your house? - A. No he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that he knew what he was about? - A. No, he said his head rolled about, he had been roving about, and had been drinking all that morning.</p>

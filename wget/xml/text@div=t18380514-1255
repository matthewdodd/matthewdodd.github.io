Q.</hi> It was not business hours then? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I was not engaged in business—I was not amusing myself with the prisoner—I was reading—there is a pulley in the warehouse—the prisoner and I were amusing ourselves with pulling the weight up out of a box with the pulley, I recollect that now—it was not that that made the noise—we were in the warehouse about half an hour—we have a Mr. Brown, a buyer, in the establishment—he did not come in while we were so engaged, and send the prisoner out on an errand to Deakins—I did not see the prisoner go out—I will not swear that Brown did not come in—he might hive sent the prisoner out on an errand, and I not observe it—the fire was generally kept in the counting-house—it was not the prisoner's business to attend to the fire—I never saw him at the fire—on my asking him that day what he did there, he told me he had been laying the fire—there are about seven clerks or porters who live in the house, and three or four who do not live in the house—there are about a dozen altogether.</p>

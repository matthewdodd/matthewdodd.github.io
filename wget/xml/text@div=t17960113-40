               <p>Mr. Garrow. May it please your Lordship, and Gentlemen of the Jury. The case now submitted for your consideration is one of very considerable importance to the prisoner now arraigned before you, and also to the public; for as my learned friend has stated to you the offence imputed to him is a capital offence, made so by the wisdom of the legislature for the protection of the commercial intercourse of this country, through the medium of the General

            , which is so absolutely necessary to the existence of the commerce of this country, that every body must be aware, that unless some severe restrictions of the law should take place, in order to correct those who are employed in such a trust, where the most unlimited confidence is necessarily placed in them, unless the scar of punishment should deter them from abusing that confidence, the plunder of property conveyed by the General-post, would be beyond all calculation; all intercourse with the commerce of the country must be at an end; and the interest to the prisoner is the greatest that can possibly be at stake - it is a question of his life or death.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I shall call your attention to some dates of the transaction, in evidence, from which we for the Crown, think it sir to ask your consideration-whether there can be any doubt of the guilt of the prisoner at the bar, if, in the result of the enquiry, you should entertain any rational doubts, you will be advised (and I am sure will readily adopt the advice), to give the prisoner the benefit of it; but if, on the other hand, they should form such a body of circumstantial proof, as that no reasonable man in the place, in which you are now assembled, or in any other, can entertain any rational doubt upon the subject; it is then your bounden duty, which I am sure you will discharge, though not with equal pleasure, it will be your duty to pronounce a verdict of guilty.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, in my statement to you, I shall dispose of some parts of the case, with that strictness, that the criminal jurisprudence of this country will call upon me to prove, because I undertake, with respect to them, to give the most ample satisfaction.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I shall shew that the prisoner was a letter-carrier, as alledged in the indictment, in the employ of the General-post-office; I shall shew you that the letter, in question, was put in the post at Liverpool, on the 6th of August; and that, in the course of business, it arrived safe at the General-post-office, on the 8th of that month; you will have the goodness to bear in your mind that most important day the 8th of August.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I shall shew you that the two bills in question, constituting only a small part of the remittance, which that letter made, were paid by the houses to whom they were addressed for payment upon that very day. It will be material for you to recollect, that I am not able to give you, in evidence, any account of the whole of this remittance, and it is extremely important; you will find the letter contained bills to the amount of upwards of 500l. - 530l. and a fraction; we have been able only to account for one bill of 44l. and another of 180l. both payable upon this 8th of August, the very day the letter arrived in London; the other bills were of later dates; therefore you will perhaps think that if they fell into improper hands, it was not improbable that that should have happened, which did happen, precautions being taken for stopping the payment, and arresting them in their progress, that they never came to hand; those, which we have been able to trace, were payable the very day of their arrival; and therefore it was extremely natural that they should have had the fate which these two bills had, namely, that they were upon that day paid.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I shall not be able to prove clearly to whom these bills were paid; they were paid by bankers, clerks, who, in the great multiplicity of their business, cannot identify the persons to whom they pay every bill that is paid at their house; but the manner in which they paid them is important; for it will appear that each time the party receiving it was desired to write his name, and in each of the instances, the name of a nonentity<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130071"></xptr>is written by somebody; from thence I suppose you will not think it harsh to infer, that the party who received each of these bills, was conscious he had no title to the cash he was receiving; that he had not acquired it in the fair course of business, and that there was a something that he thought sit to conceal; in each of these instances, the party receiving it, was called upon to give in his place of abode; I shall prove to you, that in each of the instances, though the name was different, and the place of abode different, they were both equally false; but it may be said, was this the prisoner at the bar? - Why, not from any evidence that I shall produce by those who made the payment; but I think I shall put it beyond all doubt, that it was the prisoner at the bar, or somebody employed by him, for I shall shew you that one of these bills was paid amongst others, by a bank note of 50l.; that bank note of 50l. I shall trace beyond all question or doubt into the possession of the prisoner at the bar. I shall shew to you, that another of these bills was paid amongst other valuable property, by a bank note of 40l.; I shall prove to you with equal certainty, beyond all doubt and question, that that 40l. bank note came into the possession of the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I have now then shewn you, that of the produce of this remittance, which never came to the hands of the person to whom it was addressed, which came in the course of the duty of the prisoner at the bar, into his hands for delivery, that 90l. and that not an entire 90l. but compounded of two sums of 50l. and 40l. came through different mediums into the hands of the prisoner at the bar; it will be for him to shew that consistently, with all fair dealing, he came honestly by these notes; this prosecution calls upon him to shew that he did so, God send he may be able to do it; but it is my duty, in stating this case to you, to tell you what he has already said upon that subject; I suppose, that it is not unfit for me to ask you, whether your own knowledge of the world and its transactions has not taught you, that persons who receive bank notes, particularly those, who are not in the daily habit of receiving a great many, and who receive them to the amount of 40l. or 50l. at a time, generally make a memorandum, either upon the note, or in some book of the person from whom they receive it; and then they trace it back, and are able to give a satisfactory account of how they came by it. I hope to God you will have such a satisfactory account. The prisoner was a letter carrier, a young man of no trade, with no independent property, and from a salary, from whence all his means are to be derived of 14s a week; it will be material for him to shew how so recently, after these bills were lost, he had the misfortune to have this dangerous property come into his hand.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, after these notes were traced, the prisoner was questioned as to one of them, the enquiry went no farther than as to one; he was asked, where he had received the 40l. note which he had got cash for, from a person who will be called to you as a witness; he said he had received it on board a ship; this was very easy of proof: upon being asked on board what ship, and in what transaction, he then said he had found it, was very much confused, and unable to answer any further questions; upon which the humanity of the gentleman, whose duty it was to make the enquiry, led him to desist from asking any further questions, and I am sure no man is more humane, or conducts himself with greater propriety; indeed, I am afraid you will think, that he had arrived at that satisfaction, which alone could be expected from any such enquiry; I am afraid it was the conclusion, that you must, by your verdict, draw, unless this unhappy man can give you some better account of the way in which he came by this property.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, to recapitulate the circumstances of the case, they are shortly these. The letter is put into the post at Liverpool, arrives in its regular course at the General Post-office, does not come into the hands of the persons to whom it was directed, and to whom it should have been conveyed by the prisoner, who had it for delivery, the property is found in bank notes, and traced into his possession. The solemn and important question you have to ask yourselves is, can you doubt that in some unfortunate moment he was tempted to deviate from the line of his duty? If you come to that conclusion you will find him guilty, if not you will acquit him.(The witnesses were examined apart at the request of the prisoner).</p>

               <p>Q. (To Medley). Look at that bank note: do you know, that whoever received Atfield's draft received that as part of it? - A. I know that I paid a note of this number, and this date, that day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. In that book you are looking at, is the entry in your own hand writing? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. That 50l. it appears, by your own book, was paid in part discharge of Atfield's draft? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys Q. You only know that you paid a bank note of the sum of 50l. and bearing date the 3d of August, but don't know in what year? - A. I did not enter the year in the book.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you cannot tell what year it was? - A. No; I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't know whether you know that the same numbers and the same value occur in bank notes of the same date, in different years? - A. They may, but I believe they are not out both at the same time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. Since the world began such a thing might have happened once, but it is about a million million against it. My Lord, I am now going upon to the other bill.</p>

               <p>Q. Be so good as look at that cancelled bank note of 40l.; did that form a part of the payment of the Liverpool bank bill? - A. Yes; it corresponds with the number of the note, and the day of the month; the day of the year is not here.</p>

               <p>Q. When such bills are paid, is it the constant course of business to have a receipt from the person receiving it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the book: does it appear that the same course is taken there? - A. Yes; it is the name of Thomas Thompson.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, you have no memory of the person? - A. No; it says, Thomas Thompson, No. 12, Oxford-road.</p>

               <p>Q. Tell my Lord and the Jury all you did in consequence of the information you received from Mr. Battier? - A. In consequence of Mr. Battier's disappointment in not receiving some bills, measures were taken to stop payment at the Bank, of certain bank notes which had been received for those bills that were lost by him; we stopped them at the Bank; the 40l. appeared first at the Bank before the 50l. one; that bank note was traced through several hands to the house of Wood and Fossick, in Bishopsgate-street, there we could not get certain information where they received it; they said, they apprehended they had received it from a Captain Evans, who had paid them bank notes; he was gone to Liverpool; he was written to respecting them, and he gave an account of what bankers he had received notes from, but we could not trace it, till a 50l. note which had been received for another of the bills appeared at the Bank; that bank note was traced through various hands, to Williams and Company, the bankers in Birchin-lane, and from thence to the house of Wood and Fossick; and upon enquiry there, it was found, that on the 12th, two days before the prisoner at the bar had paid them the 50l. note; in consequence of that I went to the Post-office on the evening of the 15th, at the time that the prisoner was to come to the office with his letters, after ringing his bell, and I spoke to the officer attending, that when he came, I might see him; he sent him to me, I told him there was a 40l. note that had been traced to his hands, he having negociated it at the house of Wood and Fossick, and it became necessary therefore for me to enquire where he received it; he said, he received it on board a ship; I enquired where, and under what circumstances he received it; he then said he found it, he desired to have a chair to sit down, and he said he was so confused he did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130077"></xptr>know what he said; I then said I should not ask him any further questions, he was that evening taken to the Public-office, in Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of part of the intelligence derived from all your enquiries, and finding that there was an indorsement upon the back of the different bills of exchange, directing to a certain house where to find the person receiving the amount of those bills, did you make any enquiry in the places so described? - A. Upon the bill for 180l. 6s. 9d. there appeared a direction, Philip Jackson, No.12, Castle-street, Oxford-market.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apply there? - A. There are two Castle-streets, Oxford-market; there is No. 12, in each of these two streets; I enquired in both, and no such person was there to be found. Upon the bill of exchange for 44l. 8s. 10d. there appears a direction,

               <p>Q. But their idea was, that they had received it from Capt Evans? - A. Yes; there was nothing laid to the prisoner, respecting this 40l. note, till after the negociation of the 50l. because it was not known in the counting house of Messrs. Wood that their shopman, Andrews, had given change to the prisoner for the 40l. till after the circumstance was known of giving him change for the 50l. note.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time when you had this conversation with the prisoner, I suppose, upon finding that an accusation was likely to be preferred against him, he was naturally a good deal agitated and alarmed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was under considerable alarm that the circumstance might bereave him of his situation in the Post-office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He said he found himself confused? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. It is likewife indorsed by you? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. Did you ever see Mr. Simpson write? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Mr. Spark.) Q. You knew the prisoner in the office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there not, in the office, a great number of persons employed in sorting of letters when they are first taken out of the mail, when they first come into the office? - A. There are.</p>
               <p>Q. It goes through a considerable number of hands; sorters? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Previous to its coming into the hands of the letter-carriers? - A. Yes; through a great many hands.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish Mr. Spark to explain to the Court the situation I was in; it is a post paid letter, there is a deal of difference between telling the charges, it is a different department to those that are post paid.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. The prisoner was employed as a teller of charges, was he not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not so employed on that day? - A. I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There are three persons in that division that always tell the charges, and I was always one.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Is that so? - A. It is so; but I cannot say whether it was so that day or not.</p>
               <p>Q. You said he was generally employed in that way? - A. Very frequently, I have seen him there.</p>
               <p>Q. In his situation as charging letters, of course, the post paid letters do not come to him? - A. The post paid letters should come to him to be delivered in his district; but, if he had been employed in charging of letters that day, it is probable he would not have received that letter till the latter part of the morning: he was more in the habit of telling out the charges, than in sorting the paid letters.</p>
               <p>Q. This in question was a post paid letter? - A. So I understand.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't know whether you can tell, as a fact, whether a person of the name of Rumbold did not take the paid letters that day? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. It might come into his hands as a carrier at last? - A. Yes. (The Bills of Exchange read).</p>

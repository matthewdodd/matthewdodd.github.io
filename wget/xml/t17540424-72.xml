               <p>Drummond. I saw the prisoner in June last at Mr. Keith's, at May-Fair-Chapel; he was married there to one M'Coomb, [pointing to her;] I have been clerk to doctor Keith several years.</p>

               <p>I lodged in her father's house; he and his daughter used to dine at his distiller's at Lambeth; he had this warrant granted; I had pawned my watch and every thing to support her, expecting a little money to maintain her in a short time, and having no money I lay a-bed pretty long in the morning. Accordingly, she tied up some things in a handkerchief, and I went and pawned them for twenty-five shillings. I do not deny that I married her.</p>

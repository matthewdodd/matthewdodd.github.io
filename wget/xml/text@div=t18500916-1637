                  </hi>. I drive an omnibus. On 10th Sept., about half-past eleven o'clock at night I drove my omnibus into the yard at Irongate-wharf, Paddington, and while taking the horses off, Sheldrick ran across the yard with a sack on his back, and something in it—I called out, "Halloo! there, where are you going, are you going to steal the corn?"—he ran off as fast as he could, through a hay-shed to a boat in the Grand Junction Canal—I called a policeman, went with him, and found two boats; Munday was in the first—the policeman asked him where the man was that brought the corn—he said he did not know anything about either man or corn—no man had come there with it—I saw the policeman take the sack out of the boat from under where Munday stood—he appeared standing on it.</p>

I was called, and saw some corn scattered, and traced some of it to the cabin of the boat, which was one that horses draw along the canal with a cabin to it—I found Munday in the cabin, with his feet on the corn—I asked him if he saw a man come there with the sack of corn—he said, "No; there was no man came over there"—I asked him if he had any corn in the cabin—he said, "No"—he was in the cabin and I just outside the boat—I went into the cabin, and found the two bushels of oats in a sack—I asked him how they came there—he said a roan had put them there—I asked where the man was—he said he could not tell—I said he must consider himself in custody—he then said, "If that is the case, the man is over there"—I crossed over to the other boat, and found Sheldrick lying on his hack in the cabin—the boats were lying alongside each other, you could hear from one to the other—I asked him, in Munday's presence, where he got the corn—he said he was employed by two men to carry it from Mr. Meredith's stable to Munday's boat—Munday said nothing, and I took them into custody.</p>

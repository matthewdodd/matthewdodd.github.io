I had been to see a few friends home; the prisoner met me; he gave me a violent blow on the side; I am quite sure he is the person; he is a perfect stranger to me. I never saw him before he met me. He said nothing to me before he struck me a violent blow on my breast. I have been very ill ever since. I had a shawl on; it was a common printed shawl; I had it on at the time; I had nothing on but my shawl. The shawl was worth eighteen pence. I gave nine shillings and sixpence for it; I have worn it long, the colours were all worn out; it is an old one now. When he struck me, he dragged the shawl off my shoulders. When he took hold of my shawl my hand was up to my mouth, the shawl was up to my mouth in my hand. He stuck his nails into my hand before he could get it away. I called out watch, I have lost my shawl; he run a little distance, I went to run after him; he dropped my shawl, I ran and picked it up; as I picked my shawl up, I said, that is the boy that struck me, and took my shawl; the prisoner is the boy that struck me, and took my shawl; there was another boy with him, and two girls; the boy offered me sixpence not to come against him. When I called out watch the boy and the two girls left him; he went strait on, he was never out of my sight, except when I stooped down to pick up my shawl.</p>

             I am sister of the prosecutrix. That night I was with her when she was robbed. We were coming along; I saw the prisoner and another lad, taller than him, with two women, we gave them the wall; The prisoner struck my sister, and took her shawl away. I am sure he is the person that struck her, and took her shawl away; he threw the shawl away, I stooped to pick the shawl up, and never lost sight of him only that moment. I am certain he is the lad, the other lad and the two girls went away at that time; they met us as we were going one way, and they the other.</p>

            . I was watchman in Church-street, Bethnal Green. On the night of this transaction I heard the women hollow out watch. I went towards them; the young woman hollowed out, this man has robbed me of my shawl; she was within sight of him at the time when she called out.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she picked up the shawl at that time - A. She had not got it in her hand; the prisoner asked me to let him go. A gentleman come up, and told me to take him to the watchhouse, and search him, he thought he was a young thief. The prisoner asked me if I thought he would do any such thing; I said I did not know. I met his companions; the prisoner was just behind them there were two young women also; they were running away from the cry of Stop thief; I searched him at the watchhouse. When I took him, he had an handkerchief, which he attempted to throw away. He had an handkerchief on his neck besides that that the officer has. He wanted to throw away a stiffner that he took out of his hat; he he took the silk handkerchief from some where behind him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know his person before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>THOMAS JACKSON. I am an headborough; the prisoner was brought to the watchhouse about half past twelve in the morning by the watchman, charged by the prosecutrix that he had struck her, and robbed her of a shawl. The watchman gave me a silk handkerchief and a stiffner that he wanted to throw away; I have kept it ever since. There is no mark on it; when she charged him with striking her, and taking the shawl, he kept crying, and said, did I think as he would do any such a thing. The shawl was delivered to me; this is it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. That is the shawl that was taken from me by force; I gave it the watchman; it is worth eighteen pence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was just come out of the country; I was coming along Church-street with my brother and his sweetheart. I had been at my uncle's. Coming along, the woman went about an hundred yards away, when the patrole took me; he said I was charged with taking a shawl. I said I know nothing about a shawl. he said come along back; with you, I said; I will in a minute. I asked the lady, whether I had taken a shawl of her's; she said, she believed I did. The patrol said I had; then the lady said I had. I knew no more about the shawl than nobody,</p>

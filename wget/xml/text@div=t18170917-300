            . On the 4th of August, I had come into this country from the West Indies; I left my ship at four o'clock in the afternoon; I had been drinking, but was quite sensible. I was returning to my ship, and met the prisoner, Middleton, in the Commercial-road, she asked me for something to drink - She took me to a private house; I sent out for some porter, but before she returned I fell asleep-Burn was in the room. My watch was safe before I met them. The watchman awoke me next morning about three o'clock, when I missed my watch, and 3l. 10s. I saw the prisoner in custody at the office, and a dollar, which I knew by a mark.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 4th of August, between ten and eleven o'clock, I was in Cuthbert's public-house, the prisoners came in with a bottle, Middleton, threw a gold coin down, the landlady refused it; she then offered her a Spanish dollar, but they could not agree about its value, and she left it until the morning. I had seen the prisoner, Burn, about half-past eleven o'clock, she told me the girl had robbed a man of his watch, and ran away. I found him asleep with his pockets turned inside out. He said he had been robbed, and gave Burn in charge.</p>

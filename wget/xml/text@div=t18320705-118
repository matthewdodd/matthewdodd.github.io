On the 11th of June, the prisoner came in; I had known her for three years - she asked for a piece of calico, and while my young man turned his back to get it, I distinctly saw her steal two handkerchiefs from my counter, and put them in her cloak; she bought the calico, paid for it, and then walked out of the shop - she got about a quarter of a mile, into a lane; I pursued her with the officer -(I had suspected her before, and lay wait for her in the passage) I said to her, when we came up to her, "You have some handkerchiefs, I saw you take them" - she said she had not; the officer then took her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was the officer present in the lane? A. Yes, I spread out the handker<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050067"></xptr>chiefs on my counter, and counted them; they were laid there to see whether the prisoner was a thief or not - I had allowed her to take some things home for her sisters to look at, but they were entered in a book, and she used to return them - she did not say that she had taken these to show her sister; her family is respectable.</p>

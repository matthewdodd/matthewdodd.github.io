                  </hi>. I am an engineer in the London Fire Brigade. On Wednesday, 10th March, about twenty minutes before 9 o'clock in the evening, I was called to a fire at No. 36, Monkwell Street—I got there about five or seven minutes after I was called—I got the engines to work, and obtained entrance to the house by breaking a door open—there was no one in the house—I succeeded in extinguishing the fire in about twenty minutes—theprincipal part of the fire was under the cutting board, in the centre of the shop—the fire was burning all round the shop—the partition in the shop and the wainscot was burning—in the centre there was a hole through the floor, and there was a quantity of cuttings under the cutting board—the hole was about twenty-four inches long and about fourteen inches wide—a flame issuing through the hole would extend to all the premises, with the assistance of the cutting board, which was about five feet wide—there was a door which was put to support the cutting board; it was across the cutting board, under<lb></lb>neath, and made a place to put the cuttings in—there were gas burners in the shop; the gas was not burning—there was no fireplace or stove—I left about a quarter before 11 o'clock—I did not see the prisoner at all that night.</p>

               <p>burners in the shop or warehouse, two are over the cutting board, one at the back of the warehouse, and one in the counting house—there were no burners from the sides, two were suspended from the ceiling, and were about three feet above the cutting board; the other was at the back of the warehouse, against the wall—the one over the cutting board had two burners, the other had only one—there was one in the counting house, on the same floor with the warehouse; that was fixed to the wainscot, which divided the counting house from the warehouse, and there were several burners in the upper part, which is a family residence—there are more than half a dozen—there were no other burners in the lower part, except the one in question—when I went in none of them were burning in the warehouse; the taps were turned off but the gas was not turned off from the meter—I remained in possession of the premises, and took charge of them the next morning—I was not there all night—Iremained till a quarter before 11 o'clock—there were some persons on the premises all night—I remained in possession of the premises till the prisoner was taken—there were persons in possession of the premises belonging to the Company till the prisoner was apprehended, on the 15th of the month—I am still in possession—when I left that night, two men, Oaks and Bates, were there—I did not see the prisoner's wife and children return from the theatre.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engineer of the fire brigade. I went to the house, No. 36, Monkwell Street, on the night of the fire—I found the last witness when I got there, three or four minutes after 9 o'clock—I went into the warehouse, and observed the hole in the floor—I looked through it, and saw a light below; I went into the cellar, and found the gas light and the pipe bent up towards the floor—the burner was on the gas pipe—the middle of the burner was out—I do not know what a fishtail burner is—this is the burner, the middle of it is out—the burner should hare been screwed on here—theflame extending from this pipe was about ten inches long; it was a large volume of flame—the nozzle of the pipe was within two or three inches of the floor, or where the flooring ought to have been, but it was burnt away—theflame came through the hole six or seven inches above the flooring—thebracket was unscrewed from the post, and was bent up to the flooring—I found these three screws, which had serewed the bracket to the post, lying at the foot of the post—the screws correspond with the holes in the post.</p>

This is the claim that was made on 17th March—I had gone on the premises on 12th March—the insured spoke of the patterns which were consumed; he said, there was a large number of them hanging round the shop or warehouse, and their loss would be very serious to him; that his customers and his men thought that he got these patterns from Paris, but that was not true; his practice being, when a cus<lb></lb>tomer asked him for any new mantle, to tell them that he was in course of making them, and that he then went round to various manufacturers and wholesale houses, and found the mantle that his customer described, and he bought it, and made a number from that, and he wished me not to mention this, as it might prejudice him before his customers—I afterwards examined the stock remaining—the whole of the contents of the show room on the first floor was uninjured by the fire, or water, or smoke, those articles appeared in the claim—the men's clothing was in the first floor—there is in the claim a claim of 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for fixtures—I examined the fixtures, and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think, or at the outside 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., would fully reinstate the fixtures—the value of the entire stock to be insured would be 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and it was insured for 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with the fixtures—the stock is valued in the claim at 241<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., that is the property which I considered cost the insured 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I know nothing about the patterns which had been round the shop—there were the marks where they had hung—theseare the sort of things (<hi rend="italic">Producing some patterns</hi>); these were in various parts of the place—the patterns which had been round the shop were burnt—Isaw the gas burner on the morning after the fire—I have had considerable experience with gas burners in cases of fires.</p>

I am seventeen years old—I live at No. 3, John Place, Islington Green—my father is a shoemaker—I went into the prisoner's service on a Monday, about 8th March, as a warehouse boy—on the second day after I was there I went down into the cellar; it is very dark indeed; there is no other light than what can be obtained by the gas pipe—when I went down that day I lighted the gas—that was a little before dinner—Mr. Parker had shown me the gas pipe, and the place below, on the Monday, the first day, and on the Tuesday I lighted the gas—I was there three days before the fire took place—on the Tuesday I had to go down into the cellar, and before I lighted the gas I knocked my shoulder against the gas pipe—I went up stairs and got a match, and lighted the gas—I looked at the branch pipe, and saw the screws were about half an inch out of the holes—I observed the branch was fixed to the post—I put the serews in, as well as I could, with my hand—theywere so loose that I could shove them in again—on the Wednesday, the next day, I was attending to my business in the warehouse—there were no repairs being done in the warehouse; there had been on the Saturday before I came—there was lumber about the warehouse—Mr. Parker asked me on the Wednesday if I had anything to do; I said, "No," and he told me to take this lumber down into the cellar—he told me about 5 o'clock, but I did not attend to it for about half an hour afterwards; I then carried a long piece of wood, and some other pieces of wood, down into the cellar; but first I had to light the gas before I took them down—I went down twice with the lumber in that way—I had two drawers to carry down—I carried them on my arm, and on the top of my head—I was about placing them by the water butt, but when I turned I saw room in another part, and in going to that place I had to pass the gas branch, and in going I stumbled over the dust heap, and one box flew against the branch, and the other on the left side of me—I then heard my master call, and I ran up stairs directly I had put it in it's place—I did not put the gas out; my master said to me, "Look sharp for the post, or else you won't be there before 6 o'clock"—I went, and on my return I did not go down in the cellar—I had to get a truck to take some goods to Gravel Lane, Houndsditch—I did so, and I met my master in London about half past 6 o'clock—I asked him if I should pay for the truck; he said, "Yes," and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185804050073"></xptr>
               <p>he gave me a sixpence—I left the track at the owner's, and returned home, and just afterwards my master came in—I left the warehouse about a quarter before 8 o'clock that evening—I had got back to the warehouse at a little past 7 o'clock—between that time and the time I left I saw my master in the warehouse; he came in just after I got in—I did not observe where he was afterwards—I know Mr. Russell, the clerk and traveller—he came in after my master—I do not know what became of him and my master—I know where the counting house is—just as I was barring the door up, my master and Mr. Russell went into the counting house together—I left them in the ware-house when I left for the night—while I was there that day I saw my master go one or two steps down the cellar stairs; that was just before dinner—that is the part that communicates with the cellar—there is no other way—on the morning after the fire I saw the gas branch—the gas was not then lighted—I saw the branch a little, but I did not take particular notice of it—there is a paving of bricks to the cellar—the post where the branch was fixed was about a yard or a yard and a half from the dust heap—a water pipe ran between the flooring and the gas pipe.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The gas burner was fixed on the water closet, side of the post, was it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; on the opposite side to the one you go down—wnen I went down with these things, I was going to put them by the side of the water butt—I could not see where I was going; the drawers were over my head—the dust heap is just as you get down on the right hand side—it is not on the opposite side of the post; it is just behind it—the dust is scattered all about—just as I got down, I stumbled; I had advanced only a step and then I stumbled, and what was on my head fell off and hit something, and most likely it was the branch—after it fell off my head it hit the branch, but it did not touch anything below it left my head—when I went up stairs, when I heard my master's voice, the gas was alight in the cellar still—it was on the Tuesday I put in the screws—I did not say anything about it to any one—I did not put out any of the gas lights on Wed<lb></lb>day; I left the warehouse to go home at a quarter before 8 o'clock—when I left, Wicks, one of the cutters, and Jones were there; I left Wicks coming out; he had just put on his coat—that was when my master and Russell were in the counting house—Jones went to the door; he was standing just on the step when I went away—I was first spoken to about my evidence on the Saturday after the fire; I am quite sure about that—I am quite certain it was on the Saturday after the fire—I did not attend at the police court as a witness—I heard my master was taken into custody—I lighted the gas on the Tuesday; it gave a light something similar to a butcher's light—the flame came out thick when I first lighted it—I did not call my master's attention to the state of the light.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am a cutter. I was employed by Mr. Parker as a cutter—I had been employed for him before in Angel Street, St. Martin's-le-Grand—I had only been employed by him two days this time—I went on the day before the fire—I was paid 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day—I remember the afternoon of the fire—on Wednesday, 10th March, I was generally employed in the ware-house from half past 8 till half past 7 o'clock—there were some girls employed up stairs, but I never saw them—on the day of the fire I recollect my master being in and out several times—my work was in the warehouse or cutting shop—besides me, Mr. Wicks was employed there and Mr. Thomas Parker—Iknow the cellar where the water closet is and where the gas pipe was—when I was in the warehouse that day I saw my master go down one or two stairs—that was after dinner, about 1 or 2 o'clock—I know Gage, the errand boy; he was there on that day—I heard Mr. Parker, in the course of the afternoon, give him an order to clear some wood and drawers down stairs—thatwas wood and drawers which had been in the shop—there had not been any repairing while I was there—Gage did not set about it immediately; he afterwards did so—after Mr. Parker gave him orders to carry these things in the cellar, Mr. Parker went out; he returned just before post time, and I heard him call the boy out of the cellar—he said, "Make haste, or you will be too late for the post"—he gave him one or two letters; he told him to run all the way or he would be too late—Mr. Russell, the clerk, came home about half past 7 o'clock—the shutters were being shut up—I packed up what things I had been cutting, and put on my boots and my coat—Wicks started out of the warehouse first—when I went to the door I saw the horse and trap; I stood looking at it—while I was there standing my master and Mr. Russell came out, when the church clock had just struck 8—I did not see the girl go out for the beer—I saw the bracket the next day; it was then loose from the post, and I saw a lump of lead on it near the cock—the fire<lb></lb>man was moving it and the lead dropped off—the lead was on this part of the branch, very near the tap—it was a piece of lead very similar to this piece here produced—I attended at the police court each time, ready to give my evidence if called.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>of Mr. Nicholson, in Angel Street, St. Martin's-le-Grand, but he was in business in Whitecross Street—he has been a cutter twelve or fourteen years—Iwas in the habit of working for him in Monkwell Street—he was in the habit of working for Leafs, in the Old Change, Morley's, in Wood Street, and others—I have worked for my brother six or seven years—he was in the habit of collecting patterns—he had a shop of his own in Whitecross Street, where there were patterns belonging to him; he had a retail shop there—at the time of the fire the patterns were in Monkwell Street; there were some hundreds altogether—a set of patterns averages from a dozen to eighteen—theycommence from children's up to women's of different sizes—a set is an assortment of sizes—there were some hundreds of these patterns, they might average from 250 to 300 sets—a single pattern sometimes consisted of several pieces cut out to fit into each other—you have to use your judgment about them—thesepatterns are of known and recognized value in the trade—a set of patterns to a wholesale manufacturer, if they were French, would cost from 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to three or four guineas the set—to a person who had collected these patterns they would be of actual value—I was not present when the inventory was made out—I do not know whether the articles which were in stock at my brother's had tickets or marks of the prices on them—on the day in question, I was in the warehouse at work with Jones and Wicks—I went out it 1 o'clock in the day—I was in the warehouse in the afternoon, I left at 3 o'clock, and did not return till about 8 o'clock, I then left—when I went out I went to the retail shop, in Whitecross Street—I attend to that a good deal, it is my particular business—when I left the warehouse at night, Jones, and Mr. Russell, and my brother were there; I did not see Wicks—I know this burner and pipe (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw them the next morning, the burner went within an inch of its natural position—I noticed on that morning a piece of lead on the pipe—I noticed this piece of lead on it—I remember that before the Monday of that week some old wood had been made into a sort of counter—I was aware of the repairs being done to the counter on the Saturday—when I returned to the warehouse about 8 o'clock, I went im<lb></lb>mediately to Whitecross Street—I heard of the fire about 9 o'clock, I then went to the premises, the fire was out—I only knew where my brother and his wife had gone that afternoon from what they told me—I was there in the evening when they came home, about half-past 11 or quarter to 12 o'clock—mybrother, and his wife, and his mother, and the two children came—I remained in the house that night.</p>

I am the prisoner's mother—he is married, and has two children, one aged seven years and the other five—on Wednesday, 10th March, I was at my son's, in the morning, and I went again in the evening, to take the children to the theatre—they sent to know if I could be down there at 5 o'clock, and I was there and waited for my son—I got there about twenty minutes before 6 o'clock—my son came in, and he gave me five shillings to go to the theatre—I took the children to the Surrey theatre; we went into the pit—itwas not a pantomime; it was the "Fatal Marriage"—we expected it would have been a pantomime, but it was over—we met Mrs. Parker there; she was in the house when we arrived—my son joined us that evening, he came about half-past 8 o'clock; he went out for about five minutes and returned—we all returned about a quarter before 12 o'clock, and slept that night in the house—thehouse part was not injured.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Buttesland Street, Hoxton. I have been in this business for many years—I am partly acquainted with the mantle trade, as a cutter—patterns are valuable according to the circumstances under which they are required; what might be valuable to me might not be valuable to others—supposing a person obtains one pattern, it is the practice to cut from that a set of different sizes, and that set becomes valuable—with regard to mantle patterns, it is according to circumstances, and the claim that might be required—with me an article might be worth 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and to another not worth 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; it is entirely as to the trade I was carrying on—I cannot tell what is the highest value that I have known a mantle pattern; a pattern I have in my pocket (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>) cost me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; if I made a set of patterns from this it would take four or five hours cutting—the value of that set would be to me about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but perhaps not to a stranger—I cannot say that I have known a set of patterns to be worth 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or more—I should think the highest I have known would be about 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; a set of four—I spoke of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for a set of three—I do not know that a set of twelve would be required—I cannot tell what would be the price of 200 or 300 sets of patterns—it would be entirely with the manufacturer; the value lies with him.</p>

I have been in the employ of Parsons and Co., who are very extensive dealers—I have been there about a year and a half—patterns of mantles are undoubtedly of recognized value in the trade; they are in sets of different sizes—I cannot speak as to the highest price of a mantle pattern; it depends on the time and labour expended on it's production—supposing you get a pattern from a friend, or from Paris, you have to pay for it, and have to expend labour in making a set to work by them—I do not know what would be the value of a mantle pattern, or of a set of eight or ten, whether they would be worth 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; some pat<lb></lb>terns are more or less elaborate than others—supposing a person had collected 200 sets of patterns of different sorts, they would be of a recognized value in the trade most assuredly—I know they are always taken in stock.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186312140027"></xptr>
               <p>Wellclose-square, Whitechapel, about 10 o'clock I saw the deceased, Thomas Bunn, there with his wife—I was near the end of the hall, and he was next to me—I arrived when he was in the act of leaving the hall, and the waiter was offering him some refreshment; he would have to pass by the front of the stage to go out—the prisoner was then on the stage singing a sentimental song; he had been singing a comic song previously; it was the second en<lb></lb>core, I think—when the deceased arrived at the corner of the stage he up<lb></lb>lifted his hand and said to the prisoner, "Shut up"—he then moved on till he arrived in the centre of the stage, facing the prisoner, and again said, "Shut up, we have had enough of that"—the prisoner had an old felt hat in his hand, with which he had been singing, and he threw it; it struck the deceased at the side of the head—thereupon the deceased turned round and made an observation; I did not hear it, on account of the confusion from the singer throwing his hat; a number of people rose at the time—the observa<lb></lb>tion was directed to the prisoner—upon that the prisoner jumped from the stage and struck the deceased twice about the neck and shoulders—I could not exactly tell which, I could not see the exact position.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 214, Whitechapel-road, and am assistant to Mr. James Davy, a tobacconist there—I was at Wilton's music-hall on this night, and saw the deceased there with his wife—I did not see him get up to leave, but I saw him coming out of the hall in front of the stage—I heard him call out, "Shut up," twice—at that time the prisoner was singing a song—the deceased addressed the observation to him—the prisoner threw his hat at him first—I think it was one of those felt hats they usually sing these songs with—the hat struck him; the prisoner then jumped off the stage, and struck the deceased twice at the back, of the head—I saw him fall back<lb></lb>wards—I did not see where he fell—I saw him afterwards—I saw that he was insensible—I could not say whether he was dead or not—I went to call Mr. Wilton—I afterwards saw the deceased sitting in a small supper-room, and saw him carried from the supper-room, through the small bar, into Mr. Wilton's bar-parlour—I did not see any more of him—I saw him sitting in the supper-room, I should think, three or four minutes after the blows had been struck—he was not sensible then.</p>

Q.</hi> Did you see him fall? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw him stagger—I know he had been drinking, because I saw him a little time before—before he said, "Shut up," he had insulted me, and I noticed that he was intoxicated—he pushed me against the seat—that called my attention more particularly to him; he was a man that would make two of me, sixteen or eighteen stone—I got out of his way to give him room, because he was creating a disturb<lb></lb>ance, before this matter occurred at all—I was not more than four yards from him when he fell—he had to pass along immediately in front of the foot-lights—there are chairs and seats in front, where the people sit; but there is a thoroughfare between the seats and the stage—I could not say that the deceased turned round after he received the blows, before he fell; from what I know of the place, I should say that he might have fallen against something—I can't speak positively, but on other evenings when I have been there, there have been a great many chairs sometimes, and I should think, from being a benefit evening, there were chairs there, and possibly he might have fallen against them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at 48, Manser-street, Whitechapel—on the night of 25th November, shortly after 11 at night, I was called to see the deceased at his own room in St. Mark's-street—he was then dead—I should suppose he had been dead about half an hour—I made a slight examination at that time—there were no external marks of violence on him, with the exception of a little puffiness at the back of the head—I did not observe any bruise—it was such a puffiness as might have arisen from a blow—on the Friday morning I made a post-mortem examination—on removing the scalp, there was a large patch of extravasated blood at the back of the head on the right side, behind the left ear, and a similar one on the left side, also at the back of the head; on opening into, the skull, a large quantity of blood escaped—the cause of death was extravasation of blood on the brain; that was the result of violence, either a blow or blows, or a fall or falls, at the back part of the head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Probably you have not had reference to the size of the man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was rather over the ordinary size; he was what is called a North Sea pilot, I am told—death could not have been the result of apoplexy in this individual instance—the internal appearances corresponded with the external—assuming that I had heard nothing of these facts, and that he had received violent blows a few hours previously, so as to cause blood to ooze from his ears, the post-mortem appearances would not have been entirely consistent with that state of things, but nearly so—I made the post-mortem examination some time after death, and hemorrhage must have been taking place during all that time—had I found this extravasation of blood, and no blows received at a later period than three or four hours pre<lb></lb>viously, I must have ascribed it to that—I find but little variation in the appearances from death by extravasation; there may be some—in this case there was blood around the <hi rend="italic">medulla oblongata</hi>, the commencement of the spinal column—immediately on the suspension of that, life would cease, because that is perhaps the most vital part of the human frame—if effusion commenced between 6 and 7 o'clock, it would depend upon where it com<lb></lb>menced, whether it produced increased pressure on the <hi rend="italic">medulla oblongata—</hi> it would do so if the effusion was on the base of the <hi rend="italic">cerebellum</hi>—imme<lb></lb>diately there is the slightest pressure on the <hi rend="italic">medulla oblongata</hi> insensibility would ensue, and death almost directly after—there was nothing in my examination to indicate that the pressure of blood on the spine might not</p>

               <p>have commenced some hours after the blow which produced it, and gradually gone on to the moment of death.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Looking merely at the appearances on the post-mortem examination, you attribute the death to the blood flowing into the skull, and on to the spinal cord? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that might be a slight oozing origin<lb></lb>ally, continuing for some time—the moment it came on to the spinal cord, it would produce insensibility—I believe there would be no difference in the appearances, whether the blood oozed gradually or came suddenly—there was nothing to indicate whether the blood had been coring into the skull for some time before it reached the spinal cord, and there was nothing to indicate that it came there suddenly—as far as that goes, it might be possible that the violence which produced the extravasation was some time before the death, that is presuming I am to know nothing about the evidence.</p>

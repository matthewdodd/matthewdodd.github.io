                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of 19, Crown-street, Parson's green—the prisoner lives in the same house—on Wednesday, 7th November, I was standing against the palings of the house, between 9 and 10 in the evening—the prisoner came across to the palings, made a blow at me with a knife, and struck me in the neck, and again on the left shoulder—I had had no quarrel with him—he had said nothing to me about his wife.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Elysium row—I was standing against the palings talking to Callaghan—I saw the prisoner cross to the next house to his own, and hit Callaghau in the neck—I saw no knife; and the next time he jumped across the palings, and hit him on the left shoulder—he said nothing—when he was taken to the station, he said that if he was to get twelve months for it he would take his life, and his wife's life besides—I saw blood running down Callaghan's side, from the place where I had seen him struck, and went with him to a doctor.</p>

On Wednesday night, 7th November, I met Callaghan, bleeding from his shoulder—I went with him to the prisoner's house—the prisoner had this hatchet (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in his hand—it was about a quarter past 10 o'clock—I took Callaghan to the doctor and saw him stripped, and the wounds dressed—there was one on his left shoulder, and the other on the right side of the back part of his neck—they were cuts, and were bleeding—I believe them to have been done by a sharp instrument.</p>

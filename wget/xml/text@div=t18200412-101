On Tuesday night, the 4th of April, I was returning from Bishopsgate-street, and went into a public-house in Cheapside, about a quarter before eleven o'clock. I had a pot of ale, and came from there with a hackney coachman. He was a stranger to me. I merely rode on the box with him - I believe he is here. He sat me down in Charles-street, Covent-garden, about half-past twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not have been all that time going there, had you been drinking - A. I had, but knew what I was about - I may be mistaken in the time. I went into the watering-house, in <placeName id="t18200412-101-crimeloc579">Charles-street</placeName>

I was going out and was surrounded by a set of people just at the door. A person came up to me and knocked me in the breast, merely to push me back, it was not a violent blow. He snatched my watch and ran away - they held me fast to prevent me running away. Every one in the house was concerned in it. They came round me and held me back that I should not run after the man. They came from the taproom directly as I was going out, I pushed them back and ran after the prisoner. He had got very near to the bottom of the street, towards Tavistock-street, and as he turned round a hackney coach at the bottom of the street, he flung the watch into the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any of them hold of you at the time he snatched the watch from you - A. Yes. They had at the very time it was taken from me. I was not able to defend myself and property. I did not stop to pick the watch up, but pursued after the prisoner and caught him. Just as I caught hold of him, two men came up and forced him away from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you sufficient view of his person to be able to say the prisoner is the man - A. I saw him, looked him in the face, and know the prisoner was the man. I knew him by a rising on his nose, which I particularly noticed. He got away, and I took the two men who rescued him to the watch-house. They were bailed out. As soon as I gave them in charge, I came outside, and the beadle said,</p>
               <p>"Should you know the man if you saw him?" I said I should. He took me to the house where I was robbed - it was the sign of the Marquis of Granby. When I got in I turned round, the prisoner was sitting in the room, and directly as he saw me he dropped his head, and covered his face. I went up to him, lifted up his hat, and pulled away his hand. He then said I am not the man who took your watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he said so, had you given any intimation what was your reason for looking at him - A. No. I had said nothing. I am quite sure he was the same man I caught before. I gave charge of him to the beadle. I have not recovered my watch, it was new, and worth 3 l. I attended at Bow-street next day, and he was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been able to see the parties who confined you to prevent your following him - A. Yes. I have seen several of them here. As I gave charge of the prisoner to the beadle, they surrounded us, and said he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120035"></xptr>not the man, and he should not go to the watch-house. In going from the house they came round two or three times, and tried to rescue him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Where did the men surround you - A. At the Marquis of Granby. I first laid hold of the prisoner at the house. I took the two men to the watch-house. The beadle returned with me, and coming from the house and while in the house the men surrounded us, and tried to rescue him.</p>
               <p>Q. You say when the beadle had the prisoner, some men surrounded and tried to rescue him, where was that - A. In the house. I did not say at the watch-house, that my watch was worth seventy guineas, the men round said so, but I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, where you not insensibly drunk - A. I certainly had been drinking, but knew what I was doing at the time. If I was so I could not have done what I did. I described the man who robbed me as having a light coat on, and two belcher handkerchiefs round his neck, and told the beadle I should know him by the rising on his nose. I think he was taken about one o'clock, which was about three quarters of an hour after he got from me. I never entertained a doubt of his being the man. I should know the men who surrounded me. I never saw the coachman before. I did know the man before he took me from Cheapside to Covent Garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect taking your watch out when you was on the box with him - A. I do not. I know it was safe when I was in Bishopsgate-street about half-past ten o'clock - I was at the Four Swans, public-house, Bishopsgate-street, and walked alone from there to Cheapside. The prisoner is a coachman, but I do not know his number.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Paul's, Covent-garden. On the 4th of April I was in Charles-street, and saw the prosecutor there - I was standing at the end, near Russell-street - the Marquis of Granby, public-house, is about the middle. I heard Watch! called, and when I came up the prosecutor laid hold of a man - there was a crowd of men about him, assisting the person he had hold of. The prosecutor said the prisoner had drawn his watch from him.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of men were they - A. They appeared like hackney coachmen. I laid hold of the man. The prosecutor gave him to me, and left him with me while he went to look for his watch in the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not come up till the watch was thrown into the coach - A. Yes. He was rescued from me, but I do not think I should know the persons who rescued him, and I cannot say the prisoner is the man, for his coat was over his head - I could not notice him when he was rescued. I called Stop thief! and sprang my rattle, but could see no man. The prosecutor called me to the coach - I told him to take the number. Some men behind me said,</p>
               <p>"Take the coach to the green-yard" - the prosecutor was there at the time; they got quarrelling, and he gave charge of them; I took them to the watch-house. I should know them again if I saw them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prosecutor appear to be able to hold the man - A. Yes. He held him till I took charge of him - he was tipsy, but appeared to be sensible; he walked, stood, and spoke very well. After this there was a cry of Watch! and I assisted in conveying the prisoner to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the people about suffer him to go peaceably, or attempt to rescue him - A. No, not as we took him from the house to the watch-house. We pulled him along, for he did not wish to go. The watch-house is in the market.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The Marquis of Granby, public-house is a watering-house - A. Yes. I did not know the prisoner before that night - I was not in the public-house. When I took him he had a light coloured coat on, much the same as he has now. I did not notice it - I cannot say whether it was like it or not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long was it from the time of the alarm, till the time you took him into custody - A. I think about three quarters of an hour. A man might change his dress in that time.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was any attempt made by other people to rescue him - A. No. He struggled himself.</p>

            . I am beadle of the parish. The prosecutor came to the watch-house, said he had been robbed, and brought two persons in for attempting to rescue the prisoner from him - they were detained.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to be insensible - A. He appeared agitated from the robbery, and talked very fast - he did not appear incapable of giving an account; he had his senses about him. I went out with him, and asked him if he should know the man who had robbed him? he said he should, and that he had a rising on his nose. He said he had been robbed coming out of the door of the house. I walked with him under the Piazza, and into the first public-house, near Bow-street - he said that was not the house. We then went to the Marquis of Granby, public-house, and he said that was the house - it is kept by a widow woman. I knocked at the door, but it was some time before it was opened. I told the prosecutor to go in and look well about the taproom, but not to notice me as if I was in company with him. I went in in about two minutes, the taproom was full of people. He looked round, and pointed out the prisoner, who sat in a box in the corner of the room, with two or three coachmen round him. The prosecutor leaned over the table, put up the prisoner's hat, and I believe asked him what he had done with his watch? he said he had not got the watch. Two or three coachmen said,</p>
               <p>"What do you mean by saying he has robbed you?" I went up and asked the prosecutor if that was the man who had robbed him? he said Yes. I told the prisoner he must come out, as the man had given charge of him.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time was this - A. About a quarter past one o'clock - he did not come out. I said if he did not come out I should call a watchman in to bring him out by force. A man on the other side of the room said,</p>
               <p>"Why, that shews you are guilty if you don't go out." He then came out, and as we were going towards the door they tried to rescue him from us, and when we got out we were surrounded by coachmen and others, who tried to rescue him.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know any of them again - A. I think I should know some of them. I called Watch! and the last witness came up among others.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120036"></xptr>Q. Was there any further attempt to rescue after that - A. Yes. As we went along Tavistock-row, by the New Hummums, I had hold of the prisoner by the left side, and the watchman on the other - I think it was another watchman that had hold of him, not the witness. They laid hold of him, and pulled him about, but I said if they did not stand back I would knock them down; we got him to the watch-house. He had a rising on his nose as the prosecutor described.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What had he on - A. I cannot say. I do not recollect the prosecutor's description of him. He said the watch was worth about 3 l. at Bow-street - I heard nothing about the value at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent, and leave it to my counsel and witnesses.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean fresh, or stupidly drunk - A. I believe he was not so far drunk, but he could recollect what he was doing - he appeared agitated at first. When the prisoner was brought in, I believe he had on the coat which he now wears; the two men were held to bail at Bow-street for an assault. I believe I should know them again - one of them is a printer. The prosecutor said himself that the watch was worth seventy guineas.</p>

I set him down at Drury-lane Theatre.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put him down on that spot by his own desire - A. No, by my own will. I know he had a watch, for I saw the chain. He was so drunk he could hardly stand when I took him up.</p>
               <p>Q. When he left you did he talk sensible and rational - A. Yes; he went in to treat a coachman opposite where I put him down. I left him there about half-past eleven o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. Where you at the Marquis of Granby, in Charles-street, on the night this happened - A. Yes; I was there before the Theatre broke up. I had been there about ten minutes when I heard a rattle spring - it was half-past eleven o'clock when I put my coach in the rank; I then went into the house, and sat in the taproom. I dare say there were a dozen or fourteen persons in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that lad there - A. The prisoner, Yes; he sat within one of me in the same box - he was asleep, leaning with his head on his hands; I knew him - I did not awake him. I had just began my supper, and then heard a cry of Stop thief! and Watch! I had been there about ten minutes then.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner then - A. Just by the side of me - he had not been out of my sight. I did not go to the door, but remained there eating my supper.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he awoke by the noise - A. No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Could the prisoner have got out of the box without passing you - A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The prisoner appeared to be asleep - A. Yes, he appeared so to me. I afterwards saw the beadle at the entrance of the taproom door - he afterwards came in. The prisoner did not go out of the room from the time I went in till the beadle came. When the beadle and the prosecutor came the prosecutor looked about for two or three minutes. The prisoner awoke up, and was rubbing his eyes, as if he had awoke out of sleep, and the prosecutor said to him,</p>
               <p>"I think you had a light-coloured coat on."</p>
               <p>Q. That was the first thing he said to him, was it - A. Yes. I think he said,</p>
               <p>"You are the young man that stole my watch." I believe he said he had a light coat on first.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that - A. I think I could.</p>
               <p>Q. You must know whether the first thing he said was,</p>
               <p>"I think you had a light coloured coat on," or not. Now mind, the beadle heard what was said - A. I will not be positive. I will not say whether he said that first or not, or whether he charged him with robbing him of his watch - I really think the first thing he said was about the coat.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Tell us, as well as your memory serves, all that passed between the prosecutor and prisoner, in the order in which it happened - A. He accused him of having a light-coloured coat on; the prisoner said he never wore a light-coloured coat. Then again, the prosecutor said,</p>
               <p>"I think you had a light-coloured coat on, and that you are the person who looked me in the face, and robbed me of my watch."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean to swear that he said,</p>
               <p>"I think you are the man," or did he positively say he was the man - A. He said he was the man; at first he said he thought so, and then he said</p>
               <p>"I am sure you are the man." I am sure his first words were,</p>
               <p>"I think you are the man."</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Was the beadle near enough to hear what passed - A. He stood at the entrance of the taproom, I dare say he could hear.</p>
               <p>"I said,</p>
               <p>"You know yourself innocent, and you had better go back into the parlour and be searched." The beadle immediately took hold of him, and instead of taking him into the parlour, he drew him out of doors, and took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that he went willingly, or was he obliged to be forced out - A. He went willingly. I said to the prosecutor,</p>
               <p>"You must be a very false man for saying it was him, when the young man has been asleep here for this hour."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you say that in the hearing of the people - A. I did. I said he had been there above an hour to my certain knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard the cry of Stop thief! but had not the curiosity to go to the door to see what was the matter - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before you heard the cry of Stop thief!<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120037"></xptr>was it that the beadle came in - A. Near three-quarters of an hour.

               <p>Q. Was any other person in the box - A. Yes, William Bridge; he did not go to the door. The house is kept by Mrs. Weedon, she was in the bar at the time - she is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the watch-house with the prisoner - A. No, I did not think they were going to the watch-house, as I knew the lad was innocent. I thought they were going to take him into the parlour, but they took him out. I went out, but did not go farther than the first coach, and met the others coming back. They said they would let nobody speak.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not say to the prisoner,</p>
               <p>"I will go with you and explain that you are not the man" - A. I did not, because I had not paid for my supper.</p>
               <p>Q. They would have given you credit - A. Yes. I did not think they would take him to the watch-house. The landlady knew the prisoner was not out of the taproom.</p>

            . I am waiter at the Marquis of Granby, and have lived there ever since September. I saw the prisoner in the taproom about half-past ten o'clock on the night of the robbery. Randall came in and sat on the right side of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Could the prisoner get out of the box without making Randall get up - A. Yes, the prisoner was nearer to the entrance of the box than Randall. Several others were between Randall and him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the rattle sprung - A. Yes. I did not go out, for my mistress sent me after the prosecutor for his reckoning. They had a glass of rum and water and a pipe of tobacco between two of them. He stood in the bar, not in the taproom; he was drinking with Judd, who had driven him.</p>
               <p>Q. Judd was with him - A. Yes, he brought him there. A person named Phillips, and another, whom I did not know, was drinking with him. My mistress gave the prosecutor leave to go into the bar; he went out of the bar into the street with his pipe.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it immediately after that that you heard the cry of Stop thief! - A. Yes, two minutes before that, I saw the prisoner with his head down on the table; Randall was eating his supper by his side. I do not think the prisoner could go out without my observing him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you tell us what would prevent him - A. No, I cannot. As soon as my mistress sent me after the gentleman for his reckoning, he might have gone out. I went after him, and he was giving charge of two men. He had been out about two minutes when I went after him. He did not return to the house for better than a quarter of an hour after that.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. He requested leave to go into the bar - A. Yes, she gave him leave to come through the bar into the taproom, which my mistress never allows people to do after twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you hear the cry of Watch! and Stop thief! - A. Yes, and went out about two minutes after that, and saw him by the York Hotel, which is opposite our house. The gentleman who keeps the hotel said,</p>
               <p>"Don't kick up a row here!"</p>
               <p>Q. You heard the cry, and took no notice - A. Not till my mistress sent me out; I am sure Judd was there. When I returned to the house the prisoner was in the taproom. I cannot say he was there when I heard the cry of Stop thief! I was at the bar at that time. He was in the taproom just before the prosecutor was in the bar. Judd, the coachman, brought him there. The prisoner could have got out without passing Randall. The box was open at both ends.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go to the door to see if the prosecutor was the man that was robbed - A. Yes; I did not see him robbed. When I went out I saw him running down Charles-street. I went out immediately as he called Stop thief! I do not know the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him in the house - A. Yes, I saw him asleep on the table when I went to light my pipe. Whether he was there when I heard the cry, or not, I cannot say.</p>

            . I am a hackney coachman, and drive No. 720, for my father. I went to the Marquis of Granby about half-past ten o'clock on the night of the robbery. I went with the prisoner. I have known him about six years. Randall was there, and sat with his back to the window on the opposite bench to me - the prisoner was on the same bench with him, and went to sleep. There was a cry of Stop thief! about twelve o'clock. I did not go out, the prisoner was then asleep on the table.</p>
               <p>Q. After that did Hughes come into the taproom - A. Not for a good while after. Taylor was then in the same place - he was awake then. Hughes said he thought he was the person that took his watch from him, and said he had a drab coat on. Taylor said he had not. Hughes said he had, and then the beadle came and took him out. He had not been out of the taproom. He had a snuff-coloured coat on, the same he has now. He never had a top-coat on - he could not have been the thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not go to the watch-house when you knew he was not guilty - A. Several went, but Hughes swore so positive to him.</p>
               <p>Q. You was not there - A. No. I went with him to the watch-house, but did not go in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apply to go into the watch-house - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. On the solemn oath you have taken, could he have been out of the taproom, or out of your sight, before you heard the cry of Watch! - A. No; he was not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you give any reason why you did not go into the watch-house to declare the man was innocent - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When the cry was rose, how many coachmen were there in the box with you - A. About seven; none of them went to see what had happened.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prosecutor came in did he not positively<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120038"></xptr>declare the prisoner was the man. No. He said he thought at first - he afterwards said he was positive.</p>

            . I am a coachman, and drive No. 712. I am servant to Mr. Boreham, who Randall drives for. I went to the Marquis of Granby, about half-past eleven o'clock, on the night of the robbery - all was quiet then. Taylor laid with his head on the taproom table. Randall sat on his right, and I was facing him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he first awake - A. When the gentleman came in he just rose up, was wiping his face, and was going to lay down again. The gentleman said,</p>
               <p>"I think you had a light coat on - I think you are the man that looked me in the face, and took my watch." He said he was not, and we all said he was not, for he had not been out of the box. Randall advised him to go into the parlour to be searched. I expected he was going there, but he pushed him out into the street. To my thinking Hughes was no ways sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible Taylor could have been out of the house for an instant - A. He was not. I am positive he did not change his dress. I went to the watch-house to say he was not out of the house, but they would not let me come in. I went to Bow-street next day, and they said I must attend at the Old Bailey.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the springing of the rattle, and the cry of Stop thief! had you seen Hughes - A. No. Nor Judd.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible for a man sitting where you were to see what passed in the bar or lobby - A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you go out to see what was the matter when you heard the cry - A. No. Nor any one at all from that box. The prisoner did not like to go to the watch-house. At first he stopped against the wall, and said he had done nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not any one attempt to pull him away - A. Not at all. I never saw any one, and I was close to him. I followed behind him.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear nobody attempted to force him away from those who had him in custody - A. I am speaking about the door. I can swear nobody attempted to rescue him at all.</p>
               <p>Q. I am speaking about the Hummums - A. I will swear nobody pulled him behind to get him from the beadle, if it did happen I must have seen it. I am sure it did not happen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any one leave the taproom before the cry - A. Nobody at all.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BUDGE. I am a coachman, and drive No. 173. I came down to the Marquis of Granby to water my horses just as the rattle was springing. I saw nobody about the door, but some persons were at the bottom of the street near the York Hotel. They said a man had been rescued.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the Marquis of Granby - A. Yes. The doorway was then quite clear. When I got in the prisoner leaned with his head on the taproom table asleep, with his arm on his head. I pushed his head up, he appeared quite intoxicated - his appearance was sleepy. I did not speak to him. He was dressed in a brown coat, the same he has on now. Randall sat in the same box under the window, within a yard of the prisoner. I went to the other side of the taproom and had my supper, and was there when Hughes came in with the beadle.</p>
               <p>Q. Who spoke first - A. The prosecutor. When the prisoner awoke up he looked at him very hard, and said</p>
               <p>"Hold up your head, young man - I think you had a drab coat on." Then he said to the beadle," I think it is him, we will take him at all events." They went out and took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they take him for - A. They charged him with the theft of the watch. Somebody said,</p>
               <p>"Go into the parlour and be searched." He got up, and the beadle pushed him out of the house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then he never said particularly that he was the man - A. Never, I am quite sure. I will be on my oath that he never did say so in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, man! the beadle and prosecutor are here, will you say he told the beadle he thought he was the man, but would take him at all events - A. Those are the very words he made use of. I am quite sure he never said more than that he thought he was the man.</p>

               <p>"Why" said the prosecutor</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Was the prosecutor much agitated - A. Not when he gave him in charge. I saw Judd at the house, he came to the watch-house with another young man, and tried to rescue the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any attempt made to rescue him in the house - A. The most was at the door, it was made by persons who came from the taproom.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Whitelock, an attorney, of King-street, Cheapside. I had been to Covent-garden Theatre. I was coming up Tavistock-street, towards Charles-street, there was a general row and calling of Stop thief! I went into the Marquis of Granby, in consequence of what passed, and was in the house at the time Hughes came in with the beadle.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long had you been there - A. About five minutes, not more. I was only looking at what passed.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. When Hughes came in, what did he say - A. I positively swear, he said, I think you are the person who stole my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner - A. I did not see him. I do not know who Hughes addressed himself to. I stood by his side. I had other friends with me at the time, and went away immediately.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean to say the cry of Stop thief! was only five minutes before the prosecutor came in - A. I cannot say when the cry was, I was at the door sometime with my friends.</p>
               <p>Q. The prosecutor did not return for three-quarters of an hour after the cry, did you wait at the door all this time - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. All was quiet then - A. No; the coachmen and others were canvassing the thing over at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after that did you become attorney for the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120039"></xptr>prisoner - A. The prisoner's friends who were there, believing him to be innocent, entered into a subscription afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they find you out - A. I go to the house every night.</p>

               <p>Q. Could you avoid seeing him laid hold of - A. My attention might be directed to the people. I was talking to my friends at the time.</p>

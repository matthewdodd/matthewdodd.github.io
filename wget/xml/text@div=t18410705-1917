                  </hi>. I am one of the masters of Westminster School, and live in Little Dean-street, Westminster, in the parish of St. Margaret: it is my dwelling-house. On the 30th of June I lost a watch, two watch-keys, a ring, and four boxes—I believe the watch was in the custody of my housekeeper—this is the watch, ring, and keys—(<hi rend="italic">examining them.</hi>)</p>

On the 30th of June, about eight o'clock in the even<lb></lb>ing, the prisoner came to my shop with this gold watch, and wanted 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,—I took it of him, and asked if it was his own—he said, "Yes"—I asked where he got it—he said, of Mr. Savory, of Cornhill, and gave four so<lb></lb>vereigns for it—it is not one of Savory's watches, and it is worth twelve or fourteen guineas—I knew it must be untrue, and gave him into custody.</p>

I went towards Marylebone; he was going in that direction. I told him I was going to High-street. He asked if I would pledge the watch for him. I said it was a thing I did not like to do, and asked what he wanted on it; he said, thirty shillings, and I might have the ring if I pledged the watch. I took it to Mr. Walker's. He asked where I got it; I said, "I bought it nine months ago at Savory's, on Cornhill, for four guineas."</p>

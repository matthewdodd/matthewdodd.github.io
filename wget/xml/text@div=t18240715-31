            . The prisoners were in India with me, and we were going to Liverpool together, and took our places last Saturday week, at the Paddington canel, when I paid Mr. Wightman. I gave him my watch to take care of for me - the prisoner Fox went and got it, and pawned it, which I had not given him leave to do.</p>

Fox took the watch from Casey, and gave it to me to take care of for Casey, till the following evening; and about two o'clock on Monday the prisoners came, and Fox said he had been sent for it by Casey, who was very ill. I gave it to him. I did not see them till about ten on Monday night. Mail was lying on some straw, apparently drunk; Fox was drunk then, but he was sober when he came for the watch.</p>

               <p>MAILL'S Defence. I was at the Grand Junction Arms, public-house, on Monday the 28th of June. The prisoner Fox asked if I would earn sixpence - I said yes. He took me to Mr. Wightman's wharf, and we brought the watch to the Grand Junction Arms, and then Fox said he did not know where to go with it; but I shewed him, and we pawned it.</p>
               <p>FOX'S Defence. I told Maills I had no money - but I said I was going to Mr. Wightman's, and asked him to shew me the way. I brought the watch, and the prosecutor told me to go and exchange the seal and key, and bring what I could for them. I told him I was a stranger, but Maills went to shew me the way. In the evening I told Casey I had got every thing ready for the voyage but liquor and bread; he then gave me the watch to get what I could, and told me not to ask less than 16 s.</p>

On the Sunday afternoon, I marked some money, and put into the desk in the counting-house; on the Monday, between eight and nine o'clock, I missed it - I went to Furzman, who searched her, and found the money on her which I had marked; she said she had a shilling from me, and a shilling from my cousin, which was not true; there was some marked money left in the desk.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL FURZMAN. I was sent for on the 16th of November - the prisoner was sent for from the factory into the shop, a little before nine o'clock in the morning; I searched her, and found in her tobacco-box 2s. 6d., nine halfpence, and one penny-piece, all marked; she stated that Spencer had given her one shilling, and his cousin another - in going to the watch-house she said her husband gave them to her.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

               <p>I am servant to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>What happened on the 12th of this month? - A bell rung between seven and eight, I went up, there was nobody in the house but myself, I asked who was there, and somebody said Mr. Berckley was very bad, and my young master and old master must go to him directly, for he wanted to speak to them, they went directly; in about two or three minutes after, somebody else rang at the door, I went up to the door, and a young man asked me for a letter that lay upon my master's desk in the parlour; I went to look for the letter and was returning out of the parlour, and the prisoner met me with a pistol, and says, not a word; they took me and put me into chair, and put a hat over my face, but it did not cover my face, and I saw the prisoner open my master's desk, and he strewed the papers about the floor, and him and another went up stairs and came down again; they came and asked me for the money; I told them I did not know there was a farthing in the house; then says the one that held me, come and hold her, and I will go and find the money; then the prisoner came and held me.</p>
               <p>You do not know the other person that held you? - No, and presently the bell rang again, and then they came down stairs, and they all went out and locked me in the parlour; the bell rung again; I believe it was three times, and I opened the shutters of the parlour window and got out; then I went to open the street door and found it bolted top and bottom.</p>
               <p>Which way had the persons that left you got out? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Are there more ways than one out of your house? - Yes, they might have gone backwards or forwards.</p>
               <p>Where does the back way go to? - It goes down into the water; there was no other way for them to go out; I was going to wash myself, and my cap was off; I have no doubt of the prisoner, I am sure it was him, I have seen him frequently go backward and forward to work with Mr. Dowding, which was but a little way off; I told my master directly, and the porter who it was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What fastenings are there to the back door? - A padlock on the inside.</p>
               <p>Was you much frightened? - No, I said, do not hurt me, and they said they would not.</p>
               <p>Was you or was you not? - I was frightened.</p>
               <p>You happened by good luck to be going to wash yourself, and had your cap turned up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Or else you would not have been so able to see them? - No.</p>
               <p>Had you your apron on? - No, it was in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Had these people any disguise? - Yes, the prisoner had a handkerchief over his lips, which covered his mouth, he had a round hat, not pulled down over his face.</p>
               <p>Remarkabley cocked up perhaps? - I did not take notice, it was as he wore it usually; he had a sort of a red cross bar handkerchief.</p>
               <p>When did they go to fasten the front door? - I did not hear them.</p>
               <p>How far is the parlour from the front door? - Not very far, only through the shop.</p>

               <p>Did you know his name at the time the robbery was committed? - I had heard it many times, I mentioned his name to Cole.</p>
               <p>Who told his name after the robbery was committed? - I described him, and then they said that the person that I described was Bull; I did not know his name till they told me; he had thick lips and a small face, and his dress I described, a brown wide coat on, a great coat, and dirty leather breeches, very much like a working dress.</p>
               <p>How long have you been in this family? - Eight or nine months, I came from Yorkshire, I have been in London about three years.</p>
               <p>How many families have you lived in since you came to London? - Three.</p>
               <p>About twelve months in a place? - Thereabouts: they left the key of the parlour on the outside in the door.</p>
               <p>How high is the parlour window from the yard? - Only a bit of a rail which I caught hold of to get down.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. As you have seen the prisoner come backwards and forwards, did you when you described him, say it was Dowding's boy? - Yes.</p>

               <p>On the 12th of February I rung at the bell between seven and eight, the servant came to the door in a great fright; she was some time before she came; when I came in I found the door had been bolted top and bottom; nobody was with me, I immediately run out and cried out thieves; we got lights and went to look for somebody, we searched all round, and then went into the warehouse, and the door next to the water was open; upon the wharf there laid a candlestick which we brought in; I saw the papers laying on the floor, then I went along the shore, and there appeared to be nobody.</p>

               <p>I keep the Crown ale-house, I remember the evening this young man was apprehended, it was the Saturday evening; in the course of that evening, I had seen him a great many times in the tap-room; he lives at my house; I cannot tell at what time he came to my house, because I was very thronged; it was between seven and eight, I believe, he came and asked me for a bit of paper, to make out a bill, to receive some money for a pair of sawyers that were at work; and he went to buy a sheet of paper, and in about two minutes he came back, and sat down in one of the boxes, and wrote the bill out, I saw him, his father is a sawyer; he continued at our house I cannot tell how long, I missed him very soon after.</p>
               <p>A quarter of an hour? - I cannot fix any of the times.</p>
               <p>Did you hear of an alarm of robbery at Mr. Sampson's? - Yes, Sir, I did, and he was in my house at that time.</p>
               <p>How far do you live off? - Six houses; he was in the house writing when the alarm was made, he was writing that bill for which he bought the paper; I have known him about eight years, he is a very honest, sober, hard-working lad, as far as I know, that has been his general character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. The house was very thronged? - Yes, what time he came in, and went out, I cannot say; I saw Sampson, and his maid, they came to the tap-room, and opened the door, and asked if any of Mr. Dowding's men were there, I said yes; they said some of Mr. Dowding's men had robbed Mr. Sampson? I said there was one of them in the parlour.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mrs. Groom, I remember the night that Mr. Sampson's house was robbed, it was this night fortnight; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230124"></xptr> heard of the alarm two or three minutes before eight; I live near Mr. Sampson's; I know the prisoner, I saw him that evening come to write a bill out, he was writing at the time the alarm was brought to our house, he came into the house, and into the kitchen, where I was, then he went out for a sheet of paper, he was gone about five minutes, and he returned and drank tea, and staid in the kitchen; I think he was not gone above five minutes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. What makes you so clear as to the time? - Because I was in and out of the tap-room; I cannot say how much it was before eight; I did not drink tea with him, he drank tea, because he said he could not drink beer; I heard him ask for a sheet of paper; I remember Mr. Sampson's coming to the door, he had not quite finished the bill when the people came in.</p>
               <p>What makes you so particular to the hour? - I was affraid my master would not have had cash enough.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Buller. Wherever there is a public-house that labourers are constantly paid at, I have recommended it to the magistrates to take away that licence, for it is a temptation to the people to spend half their money, they cannot resist it, and then they have not enough to live upon.</p>

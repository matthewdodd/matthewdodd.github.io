                  </hi>. I am chief mate of the <hi rend="italic">Eleanor Lancaster</hi>, which laid in the London Docks—the captain went on shore on the 1st of May—after he has gone I overhauled the priosner's berth—I found in his bag, amongst his dirty clothes, nine bottles of wine, four of champagne, and five of port—the prisoner was steward—I did not let him enter the cabin any more—as soon as the captain came on board in the morning I told him, and then the Custom-house officer found the other things—Francis Wilhelm Lodge is the captain.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARNELL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is Captain Lodge here? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, he was not on board at the time—I found this wine in the clothes-bag, about two o'clock in the morning—the prisoner was then on shore—he came on board about three o'clock—he did not go into his cabin then—no one used that cabin but the Custom-house officer and the prisoner—I know these bottles were the ship's property—they had been kept in lockers and cases—I do not know how many had been in the lockers—I did not look to see—the bottles of wine were all packed up in casks and cases before that, to go into the bonded warehouse—I took account of the casks and cases before they went on shore, but I did not see whether they were full—they were sent on board on the 11th of May, after I had found these things—the casks were never opened—they were fastened down and sealed—the wine was removed from the lockers into the casks by the prisoner before the ship came into the docks—there is no confusion when the ships arrive in the docks—I had no squabble with the prisoner on the voyage—I never was on a voyage in my life in which I spoke less to a man than I did to him—it is not my business to interfere with the steward—he came on board on the 12th of Feb., 1846—this happened on the 1st of May—I went before the Magistrate on the 6th of May—the</p>

               <p>captain gave the prisoner liberty to take his own clothes out of the ship—the prisoner was standing on the quay on the 6th of May, when the captain gave him into custody—I do not think anything passed between them on that day—the captain walked on board quite quick—I do not think the 6th of May was pay-day—the pay-day is according to the captain's pleasure, just as in convenient to him—I do not know that the prisoner came to ask the captain to pay him his money, and that he gave him into custody—the captain never told me the prisoner had not been paid his wages at the time he was given into the custody—it was by the captain's direction that the prisoner packed the wine in the casks, and the captain took an account of everything—I told the prisoner to purchase me some candles at the Cape, and he bought me a pound or two—he said he bought these other candles, but I was standing in front of the ship's poop, and saw the basket which he brought, and the things in it—I received my candles from him—I know that was the only time he was on shore—it would have been possible for him to have taken this wine out of the docks without having a pass, if he had come back a second time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Custom-house officer. On the 1st of May the mate awoke me—I saw him take nine bottles of wine from a bag wrapped in dirty clothes—the captain came on board, and the prisoner came, but he was not allowed to go into the cabin—his chest was <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> on deck, and the candles and oil were found in it—the captain asked him about the bottles of wine—he said he put them there for safety—the captain said it was his opinion he put them there to thieve.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The captain took no more notice? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said he would give him in charge—the prisoner said the candles and salad-oil were his own—he did not mention to me the name of a person from whom he received the candles—a person would not be allowed to pass from the vessel to the docks if it were known—if there were a bulk seen in a man's pocket he would be searched—I think it would not be possible for a man like the prisoner to carry eight or nine bottles out at once—I think it possible to carry two.</p>

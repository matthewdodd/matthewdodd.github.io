               <p>Q. Was he in your company in Mr. Manton's house - A. Yes, on the 7th of May, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you two left in possession of the house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What past at that time - A. He asked me if I was going to bed, I told him I was not going to bed till the washerwomen came.</p>
               <p>Q. What, the washerwomen were coming were they - A. Yes; the prisoner said if I did sit up for them I should sit without fire; then he began to put the fire out with the poker, and it became too hot for him; he says, d - n you, if I cannot put you out I'll quench you out.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did he say so the fire - A. Yes. I then went towards the kitchen door, he pulled me back again; the gate bell rang for the washerwomen, he went to the gate using all the bad language he could, and he returned using bad language, the same as before, and did not let the women in; I them went towards the door to let them in myself, he gave me a blow on my right breast, and sent me back again, and insisted upon me not letting them in; I then went and unbarred one of the kitchen windows, I said to the women, for God's sake do not go, if you do I shall be killed. The women I had not let in, they were in the front court; the prisoner then barred the window again, and then I went and let the women in. When I went out there was a fire, and when I came in there was no candle; I bid the women stand still; I went up stairs into my own sleeping room and truck a light; I came down again; he put that candle out; I went up the second time and struck another light, and left one burning in my own room, and brought the tinder box and one light in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you lock the door of your room - A. I did, and brought the key of my door down; he put the second light out I had brought down; I struck a light the third time, he attempted to put that light out; with great difficulty we kept the third in; he then gave me several blows, and insisted upon my going up stairs; he pulled me up one stair, and I resisted him; he kept using very bad language, and insisted upon the women going home, and my going up stairs.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. Where were the women all this time - A. In the kitchen. He then found that he could not get the better of none of us, he fetched three large doors out of the yard, he came into the kitchen with them, and one of the women went out for assistance; there was one of the woman left with me in the kitchen; he then threw me down, gave me several blows upon my arms and different parts of my body, he said, if that d - d old bitch is gone out she shall keep out; he then went out to bolt the woman out that was gone for assistance, and while the prisoner was bolting her out I concealed myself in an out house.</p>
               <p>Q.Could you see the house from the out-house - A. No; I saw the house as I was going through the court, and while I was in the fore-court I saw the prisoner in the closet, in my sleeping room; when I saw him come out of the closet I went to let in the woman that went for assistance; I let in the woman and

               <p>COURT. When you saw him in the closet in your room I suppose he had a candle - A. Yes, he had two candles, one he had with him in the closet, and one I left in my room; I could see all over the room, there were no curtains; I stood in the front court until I saw him come out.</p>
               <p>Q. What was there usually kept in that closet - A. Powder and arms.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he in that closet - A. For the space of three minutes; and when I saw him come out of the closet I let the woman and Darvill in; I said, for God's sake make haste, we shall have the house burned, or else we shall all be shot, the gardener has gone into my master's powder closet.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. Did you return with Darvill and the woman towards the kitchen - A. Yes, and on our entering the kitchen he said, d - n my eyes if I do not shoot the first man that enters: Darvill went up to him and laid his right hand on his left shoulder; Darvill lowered the pistol with his left hand, the prisoner instantly pulled both the triggers, (it was a double barrelled pistol) and lodged three slugs in my foot; I have never been able to do my work since. This is the pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. When Darvill went towards the prisoner in what direction was the prisoner pointing the pistol - A. The prisoner was sitting in a chair when Darvill went up to him, he was holding the pistol in this position; the pistol was pointed exactly to my middle at the time that I went into the room.</p>
               <p>COURT. Then the pistol was pointed towards you was it - A. Yes, it was pointed towards me; Darvill lowered it; the prisoner instantly pulled both the triggers, it went off and lodged three slugs in my foot; one ball grazed my ankle bone and the other my toes the prisoner refused to give the pistol up after he had fired it off.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. Did you afterwards see the door of your bed room - A. Yes; it had been broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the key of the closet where the arms were kept in your bed room - A. Yes; it by over the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Then for the purpose at coming at the pistols, he must have broken open your door - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. The moment the pistol went off, was as Darvill had hold of the barrel, lowering it - A. Yes, his hand laid to, lowering it, and the prisoner's fingers were in the triggers.</p>
               <p>Q.When you speak of his pulling both the triggers you cannot tell whether it was lowering it that moved the triggers - A.He only put his hand so on the barrel.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you see the prisoner's fingers move - A. Yes. I am sure Darvill's fingers were not on the triggers.</p>
               <p>Q.But did you see his fingers move - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you suppose his fingers moved when the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181006060018"></xptr>pistol went off - A. Yes. Darvill did no more than lay his hand on the barrel and lowered it, or else I must have been shot dead.</p>
               <p>Q. That is, supposing the trigger had been pulled, if he had not laid his hand on the barrel you must have been killed - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. He was angry about the washerwomen coming so late that night - do not suppose that I say he was right - A. Yes; he said because they came so late he would not let them in, and they should not come in.</p>
               <p>Q. And then when one of them went out afterwards he said no man should come in the house - A. He said he would shoot the first man that came in and Darvill was the only man that did come in then; I let him in.</p>
               <p>Q. After the pistol went off did he say it was done by accident, or what did he say - A. I said, see what you have done; yes, he said, I have done it now, those were the words; I said, look, you have made me a fine foot, he said, d - n your foot; when the surgeon came he said, I am the boy that done it.</p>
               <p>COURT. What was your situation in the family - A. Cook.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been acquainted with the prisoner - A. Ever since the 19th of December, that is the time I came into Mr. Manton's service.</p>
               <p>Q. And what was this day of the month - A. The 7th of May when it was done.</p>
               <p>Q. You had lived together in the same house had not you, you the cook, and he the gardener - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you had any disputes together - A. No further than other servants do, trifling affairs, and not before this night any particular dispute; we had been good fellow servants together till this night.</p>
               <p>Q. And you had no reason to suppose that he owed you any gradge or malice - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You owed him no ill will, nor he owed you no ill will - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he at any time taken any liberty with you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And he did not, as I understand from you wish to take any liberty with you - A. Yes, he wished to pull me up stairs and send the women home again.</p>

            , the washerwoman; came and called me up out of bed; I went to Mr. Manton's house, and when I came to the door the prisoner swore he would shoot the first man that, entered the door; I got about half across the kitchen, I said, John, if you shoot the first man that enters the kitchen, you must shoot me, for I am the first man that enters the kitchen; he swore he would be d - d if he would not; I seized him by the collar with my right hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you stand with respect to him - A. By the side of him; I clapped my left hand on the pistol and lowered it down.</p>
               <p>Q. Now at that time that you put your hand on the pistol and lowered it down, did it appear to you that he was pointing it at any person - A. Yes, it was directed to the cook, much about her middle. After I lowered the pistol it went off immediately; he shot the young woman in the foot, and the young woman said, for God's sake hold that fellow fast, do not let him go, while some assistance comes; he said, there I have let it off.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Upon your lowering the pistol it was pointed quite downwards - A. Much about so.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner standing or sitting - A. Sitting.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he point the pistol at all to you when he said he would shoot the first man that came in - A. No, it was merely as I tell you; he did not alter the pistol at all until I pointed it down.</p>
               <p>COURT. Before you had bore it down as I understood from you it was levelled at the cook - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. And you say, until you bore it down, he had not altered the direction at all - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who entered the kitchen first, you or the cook - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And she followed you - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Then he did not alter the pistol to point it at her, but she came by the side of you - A. By the side of me.</p>
               <p>COURT. I understood you to say when you and she went into the room the pistol was directed to her - was it directed to you or to her - A. Directed to her.</p>
               <p>Q. You say she was on the side of you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. When you entered the kitchen you entered before her, then she was behind you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Then do you mean that when you entered the kitchen that he must have shot you first if he meaned to shoot her - A. I entered the kitchen first, and when I got up she stood at the side of me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. And you have told me from the time that you entered the kitchen he did not alter the position of the pistol - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore by her not remaining behind you but coming of oneside of you, she came in the front of the pistol - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And at that time you clapped your hand on the pistol to lower it, and then it went off instantly - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. To whom was the pistol pointed at when you first went in the kitchen - A. It was pointed rather across the kitchen, in a direction towards the persons that entered the door.</p>
               <p>Q. And if you had not lowered the pistol would it not have shot the woman in the body - A. Yes.</p>

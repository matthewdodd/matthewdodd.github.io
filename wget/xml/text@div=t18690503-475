                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of Higgins, Eagle, &amp; Co.—a suggestion was made at the end of 1867, that Mr. Hutchinson should go through the accounts, and the prisoner said that it would be showing a want of confidence in him—the prisoner left the firm in March, 1868, and after he left these entries were pointed out to me, and I examined each separately—we afterwards saw Tester, told him what we had found out, and asked him if be would give any explanation of a particular entry omitted—I think it was the one referring to Mrs. Barrow—I asked him if he could give any explanation of it—he said he could not, but it was an error which he could not account for—one or two of these items were pointed out to him, and he gave the same reply to each—this was before we took any criminal steps against him—about a month afterwards we directed that he should be given in custody, and during the whole of that time no explanation was afforded to us—he was taken before Sir Benjamin Phillips, these charges were made against him on several remands, and he was committed for trial—we were prepared with all our witnesses to go into the case at the last Sessions—I was present when Serjeant Parry applied for the case to stand over to these Sessions, that the prisoner might have an opportunity of inquiring into the charges which had been before the Magistrate—that adjournment was granted, and I gave directions that the prisoner should be furnished with any of the books of the firm which he might require, and they were sent to him—the cash-book of 1866 is missing, and the payment books into the bank—the prisoner had the custody of them—it was his duty to give them up to me when he went away, but he did not do so, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had he any opportunity of examining the books until after he was taken in custody: they were in the bands of an accountant, were they not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Some of them were—I don't know that the prisoner examined them before he was committed for trial; but he had the oppor<lb></lb>tunity before he was given in custody—I don't know whether he has had twelve hours given him to examine the books of twelve years—the books were taken from the warehouse and brought to this building two or three times, books extending over nearly three years—he and I were formerly in the service of Fisher &amp; Robinson—Mr. Eagle and I were travellers there—one of the reasons that we seceded was that a clerk, who had been a long while in the establishment, had been badly treated, Mr. Bate—I had been in their service with the prisoner ten or twelve years before the prisoner</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186905030040"></xptr>
               <p>entered our service—he has been twelve years in our service, so that I have known him twenty-four years—when he was taken in custody, he was carrying on business as a bill-broker in Cheapside, and also when we communicated with him—he continued there; we knew where to find him—when we showed him these items, I don't know whether he offered to make good any deficiencies occasioned by reason of his errors; but my impression is that he did.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUDDLESTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say he was allowed from the last Session to the present for an investigation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the charges had then, I believe, been investigated before the Magistrate—I gave directions after that that every facility should be given him in reference to the books.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). I took the prisoner on 6th March—I afterwards went with the books of the firm to him, when the case was ad<lb></lb>journed last Session, to afford him facilities for looking into them, on three different occasions—I was prepared to supply any books that he might require further.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). When the prisoner left in March, 1868, he handed over his cash balance to me—the amount was 1801<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that does not contain either of these three sums mentioned—I found that balance correct, according to the balance in the book.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

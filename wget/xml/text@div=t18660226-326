                  </hi>. I am a plumber, of 7, Napier-street, Wandsworth-road—on Saturday night, the 21st January, I was in the Binfield-road, South Lambeth, after 12 o'clock—Puttock stopped me, and used bad language to me—he went a little way with me, hit me in the chest, knocked me down, and kicked me in the chest when I was down—I felt a tug at my waistcoat, and he took my watch—about half a minute after that, Rose came up, just as I had got up—he knocked me down, and hit me on the chest three or four times—Puttock then fell on me, and hit me on the chest—I said, "You have got my watch"—Rose went away while Puttock was on the top of me—a gentleman came up, and said it was a shame to knock me about so—a constable came and pulled Puttock off me—I have not seen my watch since—I am still under the doctor's care from the injuries.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where had you been spending the evening? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In Chapel-street, at Mr. Baker's public house—I had been there about an hour and a half—I had received my wages that day—I had been to another house that night—I do not know the name of it, or the landlord's name—Puttock walked a little way beside me—there was no quarrel or altercation between us—I had no fight with him—no people gathered round besides the gentleman—I did not see Rose standing about twelve yards off when I got up—there was no struggle when Puttock hit me—I did not return it—I saw my watch about four minutes before I was knocked down—there are no shops in the Binfield-road—it was about a quarter past 12 when I looked at my watch to tell the time—I swear I could see it—I did not know Puttock before.</p>

Q.</hi> When you first met me, did you catch hold of me by the jacket, and begin preaching, and say it was what you had learnt out of your father's Bible? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, you did not tell me I was drunk, nor did I say I was not so drunk as you—I did not make a <hi rend="italic">grab</hi> at the handkerchief round your face—we did not have two or three rounds in the road—I called "Police!" once—Rose did not seperate us—I did not strike him on the head, and say I had knocked his thumb up so that he would not fight any longer—he was a stranger to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a mathematical instrument maker, of 7, Bolton-street, Kennington-park—between 12 and 1 o'clock on that night, I saw Mr. Hancock at the corner of Larkhall-lane, in Greenfield-street—Puttock was struggling with him—they were standing up, but Puttock knocked him down, and punched him while he was down—I told him not to strike him while he was down—Hancock called on the prisoner to desist striking him while he was down, and let him get up—he left off striking him, but Hancock did not rise—he then went to him again, and struck him on the chest several times—Hancock cried, "Murder," three or four times, and "Police"—Puttock then left off—Hancock rose and told me he had lost his watch and chain—Hancock stooped on one side to avoid his violence, and Puttock punched him across the road and back again to the middle of the road—Rose then went to the middle of the road, to all appearance to separate them—when Rose left, Puttock punched the prosecutor back to the spot where I first saw them, and knocked him down—the police then came up, and took Puttock—I saw Rose on the Monday at Wandsworth police-court.</p>

               <p>struggling with the prosecutor—he did not strike you—I did not strike Rose on the back of the head when he come up to part us—there was no one else there till the policeman came.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, W</hi> 99). I heard cries of "Murder!" and found Puttock on top of the prosecutor, beating him—I pulled him off, and after that he kicked him—Hancock gave him in custody for stealing his watch, and beating him—Puttock said he did not do it, he had only had a round with him—I saw Rose two yards from them, going away—he came back in five or six minutes, and said that he was in search of a policeman—he passed me as he went away—Hancock said that Puttock and his mate had assaulted him and taken his watch—I cannot say whether Rose heard that, but he went away altogether, and I took him on Monday morning about 9 o'clock in the court-yard of Wandsworth Police-court—Puttock had an attorney, or an attorney's clerk, before the Magistrate, but Rose had not.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You saw Rose going away, and he said he was going for a policeman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I saw him going away, and when he came back he said he had been for one—I was about a yard from him when he passed me—I was in uniform—I did not speak to him, or he to me—Hancock had been drinking, but I consider he was sober—Rose must have seen me—Puttock was sober.</p>

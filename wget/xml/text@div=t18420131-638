                  </hi>. I am a carman to John Thorogood, of the Blue Boar Aldgate. On the night of the 26th of January, about six o'clock, I was driving a cart containing goods, in Cheapside, and saw the prisoner near the cart—he took a box from the cart, and ran off with it—I ran after him till he dropped it, and I fell over it—I took it back to the cart, and saw no more of him till next morning about twelve o'clock—I had noticed his features, and how he was dressed, particularly—I had a full view of him—there was plenty of light—I had noticed him above a minute before walking behind the cart—I watched him—he took the box from the hind part of the cart—I was walking by the side of it, watching him—I am quite sure he is the man—I afterwards gave the box to the policeman—I was taking it to Pawson and Co.'s.</p>

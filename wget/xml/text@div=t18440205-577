                  </hi>. I keep a pork-shop in Bagnigge Wells-road. Between eight and nine o'clock on the evening of the 19th of Jan. the pri<lb></lb>soner came to my shop, and ordered 2lbs. of pork chops and 1 1/2 lbs. of sau<lb></lb>sages—she said she came from No. 6, Percy-circus—I said, "What, from Mr. Brusius?"—she said, "Yes," she was servant there, that she had been out for the day, had just come home, they had company, and had nothing for supper—Mr. Brusuis is a customer of mine, and I delivered her the articles—she was brought back in ten minutes by Mr. Meeking, who said she had been to his shop and ordered sundry goods in the grocery line, and represented herself as coming from another house—I asked what she had done with my goods—she said she had not taken them—I gave her in charge.</p>

I took the prisoner back to Mr. Barr—I had seen her in his shop and leave it—I followed her—she went to No. 1, Percy-circus, and pretended to knock at the door, but she did not—I went up to her, and asked what she wanted there—she said she wished to see the servant—I said I would knock for her—she asked to see the servant who had lately come there—they said there was not any servant there—I said, "You had better come and show me where to take my goods."</p>

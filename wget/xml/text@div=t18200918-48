            . I am servant to Mr. Spicer, at Harefield. On the 12th of February the prisoner brought me the basket, he always fetched it from the carrier's. I opened it in his presence, the napkins were there, but no notes. I told him the money was not there, and I supposed my master was coming down; he said he wondered he had not sent it, as he never omitted to do so. I had lent him 1 s. the week before. He left on the 14th of February without notice.</p>

               <p>"How could you take your master's money? how did you get it?" he said he put his hands between the basket and cover, and took the money out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter to Michael Ovington and Co., warehousemen, of No. 138, Cheapside. Poulton was their porter, and during the last six or eight months I have seen Shirley walking up and down the front of the warehouse, and have seen Poulton speak to him there—Poulton has never told me who he was—on Monday morning, 19th Nov., at 20 minutes past 9 o'clock, I saw Poulton come down into the packing room with this parcel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and Shirley was outside, in Gutter-lane—Poulton went out with this parcel and a book, and walked on as far as Gutter-lane, and was then joined by Shirley, and I lost sight of them.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>). I am a detective—I received informa<lb></lb>tion, and watched Messrs. Ovington's premises on 19th Nov., and about a quarter past 9 o'clock in the morning, I saw Poulton come out of the ware-house with a paper parcel and a small red book—he walked on as far as the end of Gutter-lane, joined Shirley, and they walked down Gutter-lane, through Goldsmith-street, across Wood-street, into Mitre-street, which leads from Wood-street to Milk-street—in the narrow part of the court I saw Poulton hand the parcel to Shirley—they were in conversation about a minute, and Poulton returned the same way that he had come—Shirley went on, across Milk-street, through Honey-lane market, into Cheapside—I stopped him, and said, "What is in that parcel? "and, "Where are you going to take it to? "—he said, "I do not know"—I said, "I must take you to the station-house; it is strange that you do not know where you are going to take it, nor what are the contents"—he said, "I got it from a man who works at the firm of Ovington and Co., named Poulton"—I lodged him in the station—(they had taken a circuitous route, and came into Cheapside again)—I then went to the warehouse, and told Poulton that I was an officer, and came to apprehend him, for robbing his employers—he said, "Let me get my cap first"—on the way to the station he said, "What do you charge me with stealing? "—I said, "That parcel which you gave to that man in Mitre-court, a few minutes ago"—he said, "I have given no parcel to any man in Mitre-court; I have not been out of the warehouse this morning"—I took him to the station, placed him beside Shirley, opened the parcel, and it contained these two pieces of woollen cloth (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I charged Poulton with stealing it, and Shirley with receiving it—they made no reply.</p>

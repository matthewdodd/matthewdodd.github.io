               <p>prisoner there upon his hands and knees—he was about ten feet inside the fence from the road, and about two or three feet from the house—on seeing me, he crawled into the shrubbery, and hid himself behind a tree—I could not get in at the gate, where I looked in; it was fastened—I went round to a side gate, and then went up to him—I asked him what business he had there, and he made no answer—I told him he must go to the police station—I then took hold of him, and lifted him up—we then went out at the gate, and pro<lb></lb>ceeded fifty or sixty yards along the road; during that time neither of us spoke—he then suddenly struck me a violent blow on the head with this in<lb></lb>strument (<hi rend="italic">A life preserver, produced</hi>)—the blow nearly stunned me, and cut my head open nearly two inches long—I received two other blows from him before I could secure him; one behind the ear, a cut nearly an inch long, and the other a bruise on the other side of the head—I kept up, and held him, and as soon as I sufficiently recovered from the blows, I threw him to the ground—myhair was matted with blood, and there was a considerable quantity of blood on the ground in the morning—we were on the ground together for a quarter of an hour; he tried all he could to injure me, by kicking and biting, and endeavouring to use his life preserver—I then managed to spring my rattle, and two of my brother constables came up to my assistance—I then gave him in charge—when I got to the station, I found this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) upon him—it is used for getting open windows, in forcing back the catch of the sash—I have been in the police force for five years.</p>

On the 10th March, between 3 and 4 o'clock in the morning, I heard the springing of a rattle—I went in the direction of the sound in the Greenwich Road—I saw the prisoner lying upon the ground, and the policeman upon the top of him, holding him down—the prisoner had hold of the constable's rattle, and was trying to wrench it from his hand—I secured the rattle, and assisted in taking the prisoner to the station—the constable's hat was off, and his head was bleeding—on the way to the station, the prisoner was very violent, and tried to get away—there were three of us to take him; Russell was able to help—on his way, he said, "You b—s, I could eat better men than you"—he also said, "This comes of going to see a girl; she would have me there."</p>

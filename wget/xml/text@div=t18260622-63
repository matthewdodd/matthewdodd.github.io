            . I am a watchman of St. Andrew, Holborn. On the 17th of June, about one o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner and another at the door of Mr. Moon, a silversmith and tobacconist (I had observed suspicious persons about there for a week before); I watched, and heard wood crack; I saw the prisoner wrenching something back; I was in the court opposite: I came into Holborn, and they went into Middle-row when I crossed; I turned back, and they turned back again, and went to the door - they were at work at the door again; I watched them for three quarters of an hour. I then crossed over to secure them, and they crossed over to my side; I took no notice for a moment - they walked over to where I came from, and stopped opposite Mr. Beauchamp's door, and looked over to the house - I crossed, and took no notice, as if I had not observed them, and made a grasp at the prisoner - the other man directly ran up Brook-street: I said, "I have been watching you for some time;" he said, "What for - I am looking for my daughter; I have got a daughter in the street." I took him to the watch-house. I then went to Mr. Moon's door, and found the jam broken to pieces, but they had not made an entry; the lock was spoiled.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was I not discharged at the watch-house? A. No - he has been in custody ever since.</p>

            . I live with my father, in Green-street, near the prosecutor's. On Sunday, the 25th of April, between five and six o'clock in the evening, I was talking with Sampton - I saw the prisoner take a knife out of his pocket, and cut the prosecutor's cow; he ran up the court, and I followed him - I saw him go into a public-house; when the prosecutor came, he said he had been cutting his cow - he said, "I have no knife;" he did not deny it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He said nothing about a knife till the prosecutor said he had been cutting his cow? A. No; I stood at the door of the public-house, and saw him go in - I did not see him throw the knife away; I think I must have seen if he had - he was in the tap-room about ten minutes; I did not see him there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the handle of the knife? A. No, only the blade; it was a pen-knife - the cow was cut down the neck, between the horns; I had not been in that cow-house - the door was not open; it leads into Green-street - the door was bolted inside, but the prisoner put his hand through the bars - he did not speak to me.</p>

            . I live in Green-street, Theobald's-road. On the 25th of April I had a cow, which I saw safe, half an hour before the witness called out that it was stabbed - it had no cut, or mark, or blood, on it before; there was no nail, or hook, or any thing in the cow-house - it is all iron bars, higher than the cow can reach; I went to the public-house, and found the prisoner in the tap-room - I got the officer, and we took him to the watch-house; we there charged him with it - he did not deny it, but said he had no knife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know any thing of the prisoner? A. No, I never saw him before; I cannot tell bow he came to do this - there was a good deal of blood; I washed the cuts, and sent for a cow-doctor - one cut was six inches long, and very deep; no part of the cowshed is wood but the roof, which the cow could not reach - there was no wood before the cow; the little girl said he was the man - I did not search him; I was in a flurry - I left him for ten minutes, while I got the Police-officer.</p>

            . I am a cow-doctor. I was called by the prosecutor to see his cow, on the 26th of April - I found one cut, from six to eight inches, on the top of the neck, and one about an inch long, which was not through the skin; the wound on the top of the neck was very near the pith, but it was cut the wrong way for the pith - it was a cut, not a stab.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then you did not see any blood? A. No, it was merely a scratch not half-way through the skin; it was done with something sharp - the cow was not injured, and did not require attendance; I was not sent for till Monday.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could it produce any considerable flow of blood? A. I should think not much - I dare say there was a little.</p>

Yes, except where the creases are - I do not know how it was; it was only half cut through on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270082"></xptr>Monday - I only found a key and a comb on the prisoner - the prosecutor only asked him, in my presence, if he had cut the cow, and he denied it; there were eight or nine other cows there, but this was the only one he could get at - he was three parts drunk; I found no knife.</p>

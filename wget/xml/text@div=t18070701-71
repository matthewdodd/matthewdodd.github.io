               <p>Q. Was she an acquaintance of yours. - A. I had never seen her but once before, that was at the play house; an acquaintance of mine was with me that knew her; not knowing her I did not lend her the shilling; she had to come through the room where the lace and the spoon were to come to me; about a quarter of an hour after she went away I missed the spoon and the lace; the other prisoner did not stir out in the yard all the time. In consequence of this I went to the Circus to find Jones; I passed her on Westminster bridge, she called after me, and asked me if I was going to the Circus; I told her I was, but I did not mention any thing to her till she got to the house; the other prisoner was with her. I then asked Jones if she had seen any thing of a piece of lace and a silver tea spoon; she said she had not; then I beckoned to the other prisoner and asked her the same question, she burst out in tears, she told me that

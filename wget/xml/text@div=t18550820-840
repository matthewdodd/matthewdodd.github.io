                  </hi>. I am clerk of the parish of Rusden, in Northamp<lb></lb>tonshire. I know the prisoner, he formerly lived at Rusden—I was pre<lb></lb>sent at his marriage with Ann Miller—she was bred and born there—they</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185508200145"></xptr>
               <p>were married by banns, on 13th Oct., 1834—this is a copy of the register it was taken by the Rector—it was examined, and is correct—they left Rus<lb></lb>den in some little time after the marriage; I cannot say when—his wife was afterwards chargeable to Rusden—she was part of the time in the Union—I cannot say how long that was after the marriage—it might be nine or ten years.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you produce the certificate of the burial of a woman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; it was on 9th Aug., 1849—this is a true extract—I expect she was the same person whom the prisoner married—she was buried from the Union—I think the last time I saw her alive, was somewhere about two years before her death—it was before she went in the Union—I met her in the street—I saw the prisoner afterwards with Ann Eastbury, in my own house, at Rusden, about four or five years back, about twelve months after his wife died—1 suppose he came about his work—he said he was very glad that his wife was dead, and that he had a good drink the night that he heard it—that while he was away from home, he was with a considerable party, and the "relieving officer at Rusden, Joseph Walker, came and asked if any of them knew William Welford, and he himself jumped up, and said, "I know Wil<lb></lb>liam Welford, I will go and fetch him;" and he offered to go after him, and went away.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember, while he was away, Mrs. Welford going away with a man of the name of William Wood? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not to my knowledge—I never knew a man of the name of William Wood—she might go away with an<lb></lb>other man, and live with another man, for what I know—I know she went away, but about her living with another man, I know no more than this paper in my hand—I never remember any talk about her living with an<lb></lb>other man—of course there must have been some other man, because there were children afterwards—she had children by somebody, but who I know not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Don't you know it to be the fact, that when the prisoner left her, it was merely to fulfil his engagement with a contractor, and during his absence she went away with another man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not to my knowledge—it was at Rusden that I saw the prisoner with his last wife, but that was after the first wife was dead—the first wife died in 1849—I have got the proper record of it.</p>

I live in Love-lane, Wandsworth—I was married to the prisoner—I first saw him seven weeks before we were married; I think it was in Worcestershire—I married him on 4th Sept., seven years ago this Sept. that is coming—he represented himself as being a widower—he and I came to London five or six years ago, and took a beer house in Maiden-lane.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I am the person who was convicted for shooting at that man, almost five years ago. I received his majesty's clemency for fourteen years transportation. I had not been in the country long before they compelled me to take up arms against my king and country. I took the first opportunity of deserting from their service and going over to the king's troops; I surrendered myself to Lord Cornwallis, and took the benefit of the proclamation which offered a free pardon, and leave to return to their own country, to all persons who would come over to the king's troops. I was innocent<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230068"></xptr>of the crime for which I was tried. George Hartley, who was convicted about two years ago, declared and took his sacrament upon it, that he was the man who shot at this man.</p>
               <p>The prisoner produced a certificate under the hand of General Pigot of his having deserted from the American forces and taken the benefit of the proclamation.</p>

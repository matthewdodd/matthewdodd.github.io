               <p>M. Tisdale. This is my handkerchief; this was missing with the rest of the things.</p>
               <p>Pugh. When the prisoner came up to me, he said, good-morrow to you, watchman; do you know such a place as Stretton-ground, Westminster; I said, very well; said he, do you know Justice Manley; I said, very well, he said he should be much obliged to me if I would direct him his way, for that linen he had got belonged to him, and the laundress was in trouble, and she employed him to carry the linen home. I said, you are heavy loaded; I said, it is a strange thing, as you are a soldier, you do not know Westminster better; said he, I am a young soldier, and affected a country dialct; I had a suspicion of him, but thought I could not secure both him and the goods, so I directed him by the Broadway, and I went the other, intending to get another watchman to assist me: I hastened down Dartmouth-street, and asked a watchman, named Gregory, if he saw such a man go by; he said he did, and he asked the way to Stretton-ground; I said, let us go as far as Justice Manley's; he could not go, so I went by myself, but the prisoner was housed before I got there. I came back, and in an hour's time who should come by but the prisoner; he said, a good-morrow to you, watchman, I found it out very well; did you see Justice Manley, said I; no, said he, I did not, but I took a little watchman to go along with me that was at the chapel; I knew that to be a lye, for that watchman went part of the way in pursuit of him; then I was determined to take him; I said I would take a walk along with him to my brother watchman's stand, and get a bit of tobacco, for it was cold; he said he would give me part of a pint of beer if any house was open; I said I know a house open, meaning the watch-house; we went on, and just by my comrade's watch-box I seized him, and said, you are my prisoner; he went directly on his knees, and said, pray let me go; the other watchman took hold of him, and we carried him to the watch-house; then he said, here is a shilling for you to let me go, that will do you more service than to take me up, and forced it into my hand; I said I should keep him; then he said he would have his shilling again; I said so he should, but I should make use of it as evidence against him first; he made two struggles to get from us; they did not care to take charge of him at the watch-house, because I did not bring the goods as well as the prisoner; I said, there is a handkerchief in his pocket; he took it out and threw it on the table, and confessed the things were stolen, but said they were not stolen by him, but by another person; the next morning he was carried before a magistrate, and committed to the Gatehouse.</p>

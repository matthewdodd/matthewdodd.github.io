            . I live next door to the prosecutor. I was requested to attend to his house on Monday, the 15th of October, and about five o'clock in the afternoon, just as my little girl came home from school, a young man dressed in a flannel jacket and a pair of light coloured trousers, was at Mr. Goldsworthy's door - he knocked at the door; I pushed up my kitchen window, and asked him who he wanted - he asked me for the name of Andrews; I said no such person lived there, and he asked me if there were any lodgers - I said no, the family had the house to themselves, and they were not at home; I saw a person next morning at Lambeth-street office, and think he was the same man, but I cannot positively say - he only knocked once at the door, and when I told him there was nobody there, he went away: about half an hour after that there was another knock, and I opened the window again, and saw another man, a tallish man, dressed in dark clothes, and he asked me for the name of Drew - I was very agitated, and left the window without answering him, as I knew my servant was shutting the parlour window, and she answered him- I shut my kitchen window down; I had not a good sight of that person, but he had a dark dress, and was a very dark looking man - the prisoner Taylor appears to me to be the first man whom I saw - he appears to be the very same young man who asked for Andrews, but I cannot positively swear to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. This was a little after five o'clock? A. Yes - the child generlly leaves school at five; it was not dusk - I could see pretty well: I was at the kitchen window, which is below; there are bars before the window, which would impede my view of him - I can speak to his dress, but not particularly to his features; I cannot speak to the features of either of them.</p>

            . I am servant to Mrs. Mills. On Monday, the 15th of October, I saw a man knock at Mr. Goldsworthy's door; that was the second knock - I did not see the first man, except just his back - I heard mistress speak to him; I cannot speak to the first person at all - the second person knocked at the door, and asked for Drew; I said there was no such a person lived there - I was at the parlour window; he stopped there two or three minutes - he said, "I was directed to No. 51, Tothill-street," and asked if there were any lodgers; I said No - he would not go away; he staid there two or three minutes, close to the window - I had to answer him a second time before he went away; I told him no such person lived there, and the family were all gone out - he looked through our parlour window, and then went away; about half-past six o'clock a Policeman came to our door, and as he stood at the door three men came by the window, from Mr. Goldsworthy's - I had not heard any thing between the time I spoke to the man and then: I was in the house, not watching the door; the three men passed our door, one by one, and looked veryhard at the door - I knew the last man again, and gave the Policeman some information, as I recognized Allen as the man I had seen; the Policeman followed - I saw him take Taylor and Allen - Taylor got away, and the third man run away; he secured Allen; Taylor was dressed in a flannel jacket, and drab trousers - Allen is the man who asked for Drew; I knew him directly the Policeman brought him to the door - I just saw Taylor's back, but not his features.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At what time did you first see Allen? A. Half-past five o'clock - when he asked for

             I was in my mistress' parlour, and answered him from the window; he was right in front of me - he came off the step of the door, right facing the window - it was quite light then; I had never seen him before; I swear positively he is the man, and have been as certain of him from first to last; I was twice before the Magistrate - I said at first that I was positive Allen was the man - he looked right into the parlour window; I could not be mistaken.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I went to Mr. Goldsworthy's on the 15th of October, between six and seven o'clock; I found the house in a very confused state; all the things tossed about; the back door was open, and the front door on the spring lock, and the top of the door bolted - as I came towards the house I saw Allen, Taylor, and another man come up by Mr. Goldsworthy's door - I stood at No. 51, which is Mrs. Mills', and as they passed I looked very sharp at them - it was between six and seven o'clock; Mrs. Mills and the servant were at the door at the time, and when they had passed fifteen or twenty yards the servant gave me information - I ran after them; as soon as I got close to them I heard something fall, it jingled - Taylor ran away; I laid hold of Allen, and the other; I called for assistance, but got none, and the other one forced himself from me; I kept Allen - he has not been secured - Allen threatened that if I did not let him go he would strike me; I took Allen down to Mrs. Mills' door, and asked the servant if that was the man who had knocked at the door, and in his presence she said, "Yes, that is one of the men;" whether Allen made any answer I cannot say; as I took him to the watch-house I met Smith, the Policeman, and he assisted me - we locked him up; Smith got a lantern, and we went to the place where I heard the things fall, and found six spoons and a punch-ladle, two small bits of candle, and the top of a phosphorous-box, on the ground - we afterwards went through Mills' house to the back of the prosecutor's house, and found the back door open, went in, and saw the things in the house very much tossed about; I did not go into the house very much tossed about; I did not go into the house till after I took him - Smith went for Mr. Goldsworthy; Goldsworthy found the skeleton-key in the closet - I found in Allen's pocket a latch-key; he would not let me search any more at that time - I searched him again at the watch-house, and found a large penknife, and a small bit of whalebone; I found a small bit of whalebone on the step of Mr. Goldsworthy's door, about the size of a brass pin, but it did not correspond with the other; on the following morning, when I came to take Allen to the office, I saw Taylor outside the door - I knew him again, and the inspector sent for Mrs. Mills; we did not take Taylor then; he followed us to Lambeth-street office, and was then taken - he was dressed in a flannel jacket, and had the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290005"></xptr>coat he has on now outside it - I knew him to be one of the three who passed the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. At what time did you see the three? A. Between six and seven o'clock- Taylor had a hat and a flannel jacket on then, but in the morning his coat was over it - he could see me as well as I saw him; I was dressed as a Policeman; I had a great coat on at night, but not in the morning - the Magistrate offered to admit Taylor to bail.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Did the house appear to have been entered by the back door? A. I cannot say, but it was open - I was the first person who went in; there is a skittle-ground at the back of the garden, and they could get from there into Palmer-street - the prosecutor's house is not in a populous place; I saw nobody else pass while I was there; when I saw the three men they were walking one after the other, close to each other, within two or three feet of each other; I seized Allen at once, and told him he was my prisoner - I did not tell him the charge till afterwards, and then he resisted.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you tell him what you took him for before he resisted? A. Yes. both before and after.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I went to where the scuffle took place, and found two bits of candle and a phosphorous-box - we went round by some alms-houses, and over a wall found the six spoons and punch-ladle, just opposite where the scuffle was - I went to Goldsworthy's house, and found the front door was fast; I afterwards went in at the back, and found the house as Mullins has stated - I went next morning to the same spot, and found a bunch of keys by the alms-houses; there were footmarks at the prosecutor's back door, apparently of two or three persons - they were made apparently in getting away from the house; Taylor came to me next morning at the watch-house, and asked leave to see a prisoner, whose name I do not recollect; I did not let him see him - there were eight or nine prisoners taken before the Magistrate that morning for different offences - Taylor followed them; I saw him speaking to Mrs. Mills' servant as he went along.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. After the scuffle you found the spoons and things over the wall? A. The spoons were over the wall, which is about sixteen feet high - there is a gas-light a little way off; the footmarks were about two hundred yards from that spot, at the prosecutor's house; the wall the things were found over is in the street - there were no footmarks where the keys and things were found, as it is grass there; the footmarks did not go in that direction.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. At what hour did you find the spoons? A. About a quarter to seven o'clock, directly we had put him in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM GOLDSWORTHY. I believe, when I went out, I fastened the back door as well as the front; I might have left it on the latch - I double-locked the front door, and put the key in my pocket: I am confident I shut the back door too; it was not left open; in fact I am almost certain I bolted it - when I saw it afterwards there was no appearance of force about it; this punch-ladle is marked G; I have had it four years, and am certain of it - the spoons are not marked; I lost spoons of this description, and these are my keys; they fit my locks - this skeleton-key was in the back closet door, which was forced; it is not mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Are you quite sure you may not have left the back door open? A. I fastened it - it has no lock on it, but I believe I bolted it; there is a latch to it - I am confident the latch was fastened.</p>

               <p>JAMES MULLINS. When I went to the prosecutor's house I looked at the back door; there was no mark of violence on it - the skeleton-key would not open the front door.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Bolland. I am a <rs id="t18051204-18-viclabel112" type="occupation">warehouseman</rs>

On the 6th of November I was going from town to Islington; I overtook the prisoner, she was going slowly; I asked which way she was going; she said she was going to Holborn? I told her that was not the road to go, I would shew her the way.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was this? - A. Between 8 and 9 o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you met the prisoner what money had you about you? - A. I had 156 l. in Bank of England notes, one guinea, some silver, and Sadler's Wells admission tickets.</p>
               <p>Q. When you said you would shew her the way, where did you go? - A. She seemed to be cold; I asked her if she would drink any thing with me; we then went to the door way of the public house, at the sign of the Lady Owen's Head or Arms, at the upper end of Goswell-street road near to Islington; I just stood in the door way.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you drink there? - A. A quartern of gin; I just sipped and tasted it; she drank the whole; after she came out of the house, she said I will take you to a nice place; she took me across the end of the <placeName id="t18051204-18-crimeloc113">City Road</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did she set down on the ground? - A. - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she at all in liquor? - A. I could not discern that.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in liquor? - A. I was a little in liquor. After she laid hold of my coat, she pulled me down; in consequence of that I fell on my backside on the side of the bank, and when I was down she threw her body over me, and there, when I was laying on my back, and she upon me, she undid my small-clothes and robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel her rob you? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by undoing your small clothes? - A. The whole part of my small clothes was undone by her.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last felt the money and notes in your pocket? - A. When I went into the public house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was all the money in one pocket? - No, I put the Bank notes in my right hand fob, and the guinea and silver and tickets in my left hand pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you loose the guinea? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. In short she picked every pocket? - A. No, not every pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Every pocket where there was money? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were your Bank notes in a purse? - A. No, they were folded up in a lump.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they your own? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do upon discovering that she had robbed you? - A. I got up that instant and seized her, and told her that she had robbed me, she denied it, struggled, and wanted to get away.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you afterwards took her to the watchhouse? - A. Yes, there was a very slight search; she resisted very much, and would not be searched; a woman was called in, but she would not search her, nor did not search her. After which, I went into the place where she committed the robbery, with one or two of the watchmen, and a constable or a patrole; I do not know which it was.</p>
               <p>Q. You found nothing upon her there? - A. No, we searched the place where the robbery was committed, and one six-pence was laying on the spot.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you attended again the next morning? - A. Yes, I was dissatisfied with that search; I got Carter the constable, and she was searched again, but nothing was found upon her but some trifle.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any thing found upon her at all belonging to you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180512040021"></xptr>Q. Did you find any of the cash or bank notes upon her? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you was intoxicated; where had you dined that day? - A. At the White-hart, St. Anne's-lane. We had three bottles of wine and some brandy and water; after I had returned from searching the field, during the time I was in the watch-house, I had put into my pocket this identical packet; they are Sadler's Wells tickets, and some bills I had besides.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never seen this girl before this night when you had gone in the field with her? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had been on the ground you called a watchman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call a watchman and desire the woman to walk before you? - A. Yes; I was very particular to see that she did not throw any thing away, being confident that she had the property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not she walk before you by the light of a watchman's lanthorn, because she should not throw any thing away? - A. I cannot tell the motive; generally speaking, I made use of every observation.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the woman carry the lanthorn a part of the way? - A. I did not see any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a watchman with her carrying a lanthorn? - A. Yes, the woman refused to be searched at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How many watchmen were there at the watch-house? - A. There were several.</p>
               <p>Q. I should have thought the more she refused the more you would have been for searching her; did not they take up her petticoats? - A. The next morning that was.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted that she was not at the watch-house all night? - I cannot say, I was not there? - Q. You left her in the custody of the watchman, when you went to the field? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came back, you found her in the same custody? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were her pockets searched on the first search? - A. Yes, that was all that was searched.</p>
               <p>Q. Nothing that belonged to you was discovered at that time? - A. Nothing but the tickets.</p>
               <p>Q. Nothing discovered but these tickets, which you found in your left coat pocket? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you positively say that the tickets (they are cards you know) were not in your coat pocket in the course of the day? - A. No, I will swear that they were in my left-hand breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. They are clumsy things to carry in that pocket. I will positively swear that they were in my left-hand breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned from the field did not you find several watchmen there as well as the the girl? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. There was Franklin there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And Carter was there? - A. I do not know that Carter was or was not.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Bolland. Q. I believe you are head-borough of Islington parish? - A. Yes. On the 6th of November two watchmen and Mr. Tickell brought the prisoner to the watch-house; Mr. Tickell said she had robbed him of banknotes to the amount of 150 l. and upwards; I took the prisoner's pelisse and gown off, and turned them inside out; I took the clothes all off but her shift; Mr. Tickell wanted to have her searched so as I did not chose to do it; a woman was sent for, and she refused to do it. The prosecutor still insisted to have her searched in that manner.</p>
               <p>Q. What manner? - A. By searching her private parts; he wanted to do it himself; she said if he offered to do such a thing she would knock him down; but if it must be so, she said I seemed to be a good kind of a man, I might do it, and I did do it. I pulled her shoes and stockings off, I found nothing in them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you search her as you do all people when you are searching for property? - A. Upon my word I searched her as though it was for my own property.</p>

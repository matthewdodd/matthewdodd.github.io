            . I am agent to Mr. Richard Bury, and have a warehouse in King-street, Cheapside, as a silk hat shag manufacturer. On the 12th of August the prisoner purchased a small quantity of goods, amounting to about seven guineas, which he paid for at the time; he called again on the 16th, and bought about 8 l. worth of goods, and paid partly in cash, and a small bill for six guineas; he represented himself as one of the firm of Bakewell and Co. On the 20th of August I received a letter, and wrote an answer to Bakewell and Co.; and in consequence of another letter, I went to Mr. Rawlings, and enquired of him respecting Bakewell and Co; after which I opened an account with them on the behalf of Mr. Bury. I saw the prisoner, and agreed to receive in payment, bills drawn by Bakewell and Co. upon respectable parties - they carried on business at No. 3, King's-arms-yard, Commercial-road. The prisoner said Mrs. Bakewell was a relation of his, and he was the other partner. I furnished him with goods at different times up to the 12th of November. On the 22d of November I received a bill for 25 l. 14 s.; in a letter, which I produce.</p>

            . I know the body of this bill, the signature and endorsement</p>
               <p>"M. Bakewell and Co.," to be in the prisoner's hand writing; this letter is also his writing.</p>
               <p>This letter was here read - it stated, that the bill was enclosed, and contained an order for more goods. The bill was also read - drawn by M. Bakewell and Co., on Thomas Oakley, Brentford, and accepted; payable at Mr. H. Rawlings's, No. 18, St. Dunstan's-hill.</p>
               <p>MR. HAYNES. I saw the prisoner afterwards, and inquired who Oakley the acceptor was; this was after it became due - he stated, that he was a very respectable man, living at Brentford; that he had done a good deal of business with him, and he had no doubt the bill would ultimately be paid. It was returned to me on the 15th of January, the day after it became due; I called at Bakewell and Co.'s, but did not see the prisoner; I called at Rawlings's where it was made payable, but did not get payment; I addressed a letter to T. Oakley, of Brentford, the same day; it was afterwards returned from the post-office; the date on the envelope is 22d of January, with this written on it,</p>
               <p>"No such name at Brentford, J. Durhan:" I wrote to Bakewell and Co., the prisoner came to me some time after, and I received this letter.</p>
               <p>This letter was here read; it stated, that a ship having sailed, without paying a shipment account, had placed them to temporary inconvenience, but they would take an early opportunity to satisfy the prosecutor as to Oakley's bill - signed</p>
               <p>"for M. Bakewell, M. A. Thompson." This letter enclosed another, addressed to Bakewell and Co. - dated, Brentford, 17th of January, and signed T. Oakley; stating, that unexpected losses had caused him to dishonour his bill; but that in a few days, he should be able to return to his usual punctuality. - Post mark,</p>
               <p>"20th January, 12 noon."</p>
               <p>MR. HAYNES. I saw the prisoner a few days after this; it was then I asked him about Oakley's bill; he gave the account I have before stated - before it became due, I had had dealings with him to the amount of 150 l. or 160 l. - I have received bills for it, which have not been paid - I received another letter; after which I wrote to him, requesting a personal interview - he came to me - I said, I wanted to hear what he had to say, but I could do nothing without the advice of my solicitor. He then gave me a kind of statement, which I put down at the time; he proposed giving up property, as a security for the debt - he said, he had twelve dozen hats pawned for 30 l.; but which were worth 90 l. - that the stock in his house, after his paying rent and taxes, was worth about 35 l. - that he was going to sell the stock, to one George Owen, and to receive a bill from him, which he would give me as part security; I did not accept this security; I inquired who the parties were to the different bills he had paid me; mentioning Oakley among them - he said, he was an agent of the house, and not worth two-pence; and spoke of the parties to the other bills in the same way - he said, if I chose to take what there was, I might; if not, I might arrest him, and do what I liked; I went to Brentford about the latter end of February, and again about a week ago, and then made diligent inquiry, but could learn nothing of such a person as Oakley there - I went to almost every second or third house in the town; and I looked for the Swan; as he had stated that he lived opposite to the Swan - I could find no such sign; I found the Swan-stairs, and inquired about there, but could find no Oakley.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. A man might be there in November, and not in April? A. I inquired if any such person had lived there - they had never heard of him - my agreement with the prisoner was that he should furnish me with respectable acceptances - not Oakley's in particular. I have been to King's Arms-yard, and found a business carried on in the name of Bakewell and Co. - I did not inquire about Oakley till the bill was due.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner stated, that he had been unfortunate, and obliged to pawn some goods, but would give up all he had: at your first interview did you not tell him you considered what he had done was a forgery? A. I did not. I took him into custody at our last interview - he had come of his own accord, upon an understanding that he was not to be arrested for debt.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. When did you go to Brentford to make inquiry? A. The latter end of February, I inquired at both the post offices, but did not go round to the houses till a week ago.</p>

            . I am post-master of Brentford, and have been so nineteen years and a half; the returned letter produced has my notification on it. I was born at Brentford. Before I returned the letter I personally made every possible inquiry, and directed my two men to do the same, but could discover no such person, and I made as diligent inquiry as possible, after my examination at Guildhall, whether any such person had been there for the last year, but could find no such person.</p>

               <p>The prisoner being called upon for his defence requested the Jury to dispossess themselves of all prejudice which had been excited against him, and complained of the vindictive conduct of a person named Catchpole, who had used every means to injure him. He stated he should prove the existence of Oakley, and that the acceptance was his; that Oakley had been engaged to sell shoes for him on commission. He would call persons who had heard him talk of going home to Brentford at night, and fearing he should be too late for the stage - that Oakley and Wilson had an office in Union-court, for the purpose of showing samples, as King's Arms-yard was at too great a distance for persons to come - that before he went to Mr. Haynes he had received an anonymous letter, cautioning him to get out of the way. The prisoner further stated the nature of the case he had to prove, which will be seen by the following evidence:</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Levy, a Sheriff's officer. I arrested the prisoner before the last term, between the 28th of November and the 23d of January - he proposed one Rochester, of Ratcliffe-highway, as bail; we took him to Rochester, who was not at home - my master sent me with the prisoner to find bail, and at last went to a man named Oakley, in Union-court, Broad-street. I saw a person in an office on the left hand side of the passage; the prisoner called him Oakley, and he answered to that name, and said he would become one of his bail; the writ was at the suit of Catchpole, for 17 l. - I asked him for a reference, and took down that he kept a situation with one Wilson, at Brentford - he said something about an establishment there in the hat line - Thompson said to him</p>
               <p>"Oakley, I have paid your bill away;" - he said it was for 25 l. and upwards - he said</p>
               <p>"I hope you will take care of it when it becomes due, or it will spoil my credit;" I went to Rochester with the bail bond, which he signed - Oakley went with me, but master would not take his bail as he lived so far he could not go to make inquiry.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Do you often bail persons yourself. A. Never - I have not got the warrant or bail bond here - I am in possession of a house at Knightsbridge, and did not know I should be called here till this morning. Oakley said his situation was in Union-court, and he had an establishment at Brentford. I knew I was to come here to give evidence of what passed at the prisoner's arrest - A young woman brought me a subpoena - she called herself Mrs. Riley - she said I was to mention what happened when Thompson was arrested.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What sort of a man was Oakley? A. Rather taller than I, but not so stout.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you recollect whether there was any name on the door in Union-court? There was, but what I do not remember - it is the second door before you come to Wormwood-street.</p>

I have seen him with Thompson three or four times since, and have seen Wilson with them both; I was at Wilson's house, at Brentford, about two months ago; it is on the right-hand side, opposite to the Castle, public-house; I did not see Oakley there.

            . I am a painter, and live in Philpot-lane. I know Oakley, the swindler.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person named Oakley? A. Yes; I believe his Christian name is Thomas; I used to see him at the Rose and Crown, Leadenhall-market; I understand he had a counting-house in Union-court, as I was ordered<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070041"></xptr>to do some work there, but I never went there - one of my men took the order.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever see Oakley write? A. Yes; (looking at the acceptance on the bill) this is exactly the form in which I have seen him write; I certainly think it is his writing. (Looking at the 4 l. draft,) I think this is his.</p>

            . I am a hatter, and was in the employ of Bakewell and Co. from May till Christmas. I knew Oakley perfectly well - he was employed as agent, to sell hats for the firm; I have heard him say he lived somewhere by the west end of the town. I saw him last on Christmas day.</p>

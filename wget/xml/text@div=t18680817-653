                  </hi>. I am a publican, of Princes Street, Leicester Square—on the night of 2nd July I went to my door, as there was some disturb<lb></lb>ance in the street—the prisoners were crossing the road—Cotterell up with his fist, and struck me in the eye—Salter immediately struck me, and as I struggled with them, somebody snatched my watch from my pocket, but did not get it—I was bruised and beaten about—the chain did not snap, and I put my hand up and saved my watch—I did not see the hand, but I felt the snatch.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 36, Princes Street—on the morning of 3rd July, about 12.30, I was at Mr. Wallace's, and heard a disturbance—I went outside, and saw the two prisoners and a woman quarrelling—Cotterell struck Mr. Wallace, who stood at his door, in the eye—Mr. Wallace went after him into the middle of the road, and he assaulted him again, and was taken in custody—I saw nothing of the attempt to rob.</p>

I was in Princes Street, and saw both the prisoners assault Mr. Wallace—he had hold of Cotterell, who struck him in the eye; and Salter struck him about the body and arms—I caught hold of both of them, and the rest of the crowd tried to rescue them—six men and two women were near them in the crowd—the women beat my knuckles, to release my hold—Cotterell gave the name of Watson.</p>

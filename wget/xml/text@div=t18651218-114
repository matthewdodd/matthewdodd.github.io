I am an engine fitter, of 22, Denmark-street—on 16th November, about a quarter to 11, or it might be 11 o'clock at night, I was coming out of Haye's-court, which is near Compton-street, and saw the prisoners Lucas and Byford, and five or six others, four or five doors from the prosecutor's house, running away from it—one of them had a bundle in his arms—they ran round the corner of Church-street—Lucas halloed out, "Look out, there is some one coming, "and the one who had the bundle <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> it against a doorway—I crossed over towards them, and the one who had the bundle let one of the ends slip, and dropped some shirts and waist-coats on the pavement—they were wrapped in a kind of table-cover, black, with red spots—I told Mr. Sharp what I had seen, and he sent me next morning to give information to Sergeant Cole—I was sent for next day to identify Lucas at Bow-street—I picked him out from 30 or 40 others—about a week after wards I identified Byford at Vine-street; I picked him out from others.</p>

He said at the Court that he could swear to the lot of us; he says that I had a different hat and coat, and you are aware how clothing alters a man; by my having this clothing on now, I may resemble the man he saw, but I can assure you he is mistaken; he never saw me in his life before, nor I him, to my knowledge; I will not say that he did not see this man, but he did not see me. I have passed Cole, and nodded to him, and he has nodded to me, without my having the slightest idea of being captured. I never saw the other prisoner before, and never was in Byford's house in my life. I told Cole I knew the robbery had been done, but I had nothing to do with it, and that I was always taken for things I knew nothing about. I have been bad, but am now trying to lead an honest life. I was at work at Mr. Woodville's, an engraver, in Wardour-street, and was living at a re<lb></lb>spectable lodging in King-street; but Cole came to the landlady, and told her that she had got a convicted thief in the house; and when I went home she said that she could not keep me there any longer; I begged her to tell me why, and she told me what Cole had said. Cole has a great bitterness against me, and has often said that he would <hi rend="italic">lag</hi> me. I left work two months ago, and have never been in a place since; it is a long time since I was convicted. Cole knows that I am innocent of this.</p>

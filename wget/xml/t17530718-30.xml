               <p>Q. Do you recollect what words past?</p>
               <p>Alderton. No, I did not take notice, he wrangl'd and jaw'd. I took a knife out of the prisoner's hand a little time after the woman fell.</p>

               <p>E. Targoose. I cannot, they were quarrelling like ; I went out of the room and left them quarrelling. I was just out of the room and stood by the door, when I saw the woman fall : her husband was a little distance from her at the time, (about 3 yards) I believe she spoke as she fell, but never afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any wound afterwards ?</p>

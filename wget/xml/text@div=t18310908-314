The prisoner had been in my employ about five weeks - he was employed to go out to sell goods, and receive money; he was to account for them every day - I did not keep a book; I looked over his box when he returned.</p>

Yes - Bell, Bentley, and Co., in Cheapside, became customers of mine a few days after the prisoner came into my service; I charge the prisoner with selling goods to them, and not accounting to me for them - I did not trust him with a very large stock; I never allowed him any commission on what he sold, or agreed to do so - I keep some books, but when he took out goods for sale I merely made a memorandum of them, and looked over the box when he came back; he should account as soon as he came home - I entered the goods that were sold in a day-book; I have not brought that book - these sums I charge him with are entered in the day-book, but not as paid; I have no means of knowing what he sold, except from the day-book, and the bills of parcels.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner- his master asked him what he had done with the money; he said he had lost two sovereigns, he had lent 6s., and 13s. he had spent at Fairlop fair.</p>
               <p>COURT to CHARLES JAMES FOX. Q. Did he at any time give you an account of the 6s.? A. He said he had sold the goods, and he was to call again for the money.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When was that? A. On the 25th of June, the day he sold the goods - there is a memorandum of the fringe being sold, but not of the money being paid.</p>

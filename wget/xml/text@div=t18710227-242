               <p>walking from the Deptford Railway Station to my lodging at the corner of Church Street—I saw Lockland with four or five others, and I inquired the way to Church Street—he said "That is the way," and pointed—he then pushed me down another turning, put me on the ground, and got on the top of me—the other men rifled my pockets, and pulled all my clothes to pieces—I can't speak as to the other prisoners at all, only Lockland—I had in my pockets a pair of spectacles, seven pawn-tickets, some small keys, and a purse and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they were all taken from me—when I was on the ground they turned me on my head, and all the things I had in my pockets came out—<lb></lb>the witness Ballard called out of a window, and laid "You come to<lb></lb>morrow, and I will tell you who they are"—the men then ran away—I met a policeman at the corner of the street, and told him—I saw Lockland about ten minutes after in the street, and I gave him into custody—I have not recovered any of my property.</p>

I am a widow, and live at 3, Stanhope Street, Deptford—on Sunday night, 5th February, I was in bed—I was awoke by hearing a noise in the street—I went to the window, and opened it—I saw the pro<lb></lb>secutor lying on his back on the pavement, and Lockland on him, Mullins on one side, and the <hi rend="italic">Doctor</hi> on the other—Smith goes by the name of the <hi rend="italic">Doctor</hi>—I knew them all well—I have known Mullins from a child—he kicked the prosecutor three times, and I halloaed from my window "Oh, Mullins, what a shame"—he said "If you come down I will serve you the same"—Smith said with an oath "If you don't put your head in I will break your windows"—Lockland then got hold of the prosecutor's feet, and the other two by his shoulders, and turned him up on his head, and shook him, and the things fell from his pockets—the men who are not in custody were groping about for them—they stood the man on his feet against the wall, and one took his hat up and put it on his head—they all went away then—I spoke to the man before they went away—after they left the pro<lb></lb>secutor went away, and Mullins and Smith came back to the place with two others, and searched on the ground, and in the gutter—they were talking about a half-crown—there was a woman named Margaret McKenzie with them—the <hi rend="italic">Doctor</hi> and Margaret McKenzie went in next door to where I live, and the others went down the street—I have lived in Deptford all my life, and keep a fruit stall in the Broadway.</p>

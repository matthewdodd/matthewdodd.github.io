                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of 7, Gray's Inn Square—I have for the last four or five years been professionally engaged by Mr. J. Lisle, of Bonithron, in Cornwall—the defendant's father was a tenant of Mr. Lisle's—after his father's death the defendant became tenant from year to year—towards the end of 1869 sundry claims were preferred by him against Mr. Lisle and his three daughters—they were referred to me, as Mr. Lisle's solicitor, to settle—I corresponded with the defendant upon them—he was professionally represented by the London agent of his attorney in Cornwall—his wife is a dressmaker—there were claims for Dressmaking—those claims were settled by me, and I have the receipts, and, if necessary, can produce them—the defendant was in possession of the premises for a year and a half—he subsequently signed an agreement to give up possession of the premises, and a receipt in full of all demands upon the family of Mr. Lisle, and at that time I paid him 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was on that occasion represented by the London agent of Messrs. Hill, of Helston, and the agreement was witnessed by Mr. Spencer, the managing clerk—I subsequently sent a letter to the defendant, requesting him to give up possession according to this agreement—I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in answer—it is in the prisoner's handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">This letter was put in and read; it contained the</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">alleged libel, which, was a gross aspersion of the character of Miss Emily Ann Lisle, and an insinuation of an improper intimacy between her and himself</hi>)—I wrote a letter in answer, and afterwards saw Miss Lisle, and told her, in general terms, the contents of the letter, after I had heard there were reports in Cornwall, not before; I showed her the letter—in consequence of what I learnt in Cornwall, I came back to London, and applied at the Clerkenwell Police Court for a warrant—I did not take any unfair advan<lb></lb>tage of the prisoner; he expressed his satisfaction at what I had done—he did not act in any way under coercion, his own solicitor would prevent that—Miss Lisle has been on intimate terms with me and my family, and continues to be so.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> When did you first know me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think five years ago—I heard a very indifferent character of you at that time—Miss Lisle did not give at all a favourable one of you—she did not tell me what you had done for her—she did not tell me you had saved her from the union—she said you had bought the furniture for them, nothing else—they were living at Bonithron when I first knew you—they were not shut up in prison—the doors were not locked—there was not an execution against Miss Lisle—the doors were not shut for twelvemonths or two year, to my knowledge—I did not go down and pay off the execution—I did not take Miss Lisle to London—I paid you for the furniture, at 75, Guildford Street—Miss, Lisle was not living there with me; she was on a visit to Mrs. Taylor—I was living there with my wife and children, and Miss Lisle was on a visit with her father—she came up to London on account of an action—she stayed there, I think, about three months—she came up at my request—I think your demand was about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the furniture—I paid you what was settled between us—Miss Lisle received several letters from home while she was in London—she did not receive a letter to come home because there were reports that she was in the family-way, and had been confined in London—she was visiting my wife and daughters—she was also lodging with her father, in Norfolk Street—I never went there to see her but once—I think I paid you about 3001. for the furniture, I am not quite sure; the matter was gone into—I had great difficulty in getting any account from you—I told you that the Lisles were in great distress—you were very urgent for me to pay you the money you had advanced for the furniture, and I did so—I paid you what I believed was due, and got you to sign an account—I think the next payment was made to your wife, when I was at Bonithron; that was for dressmaking—I forget how much it was—I think it was 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account—I did not wrong you out of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I paid your wife all she asked for.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have a letter here, which I received from the prisoner while he was in custody—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Clerkenwell Police Court Sir,—Will you kindly withdraw the case against me?

               <p>paid you 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. then—I settled all the accounts that you and your wife had against the Lisles—here is your receipt, in full of all demands—I had such difficulty in getting the accounts, that at last I refused to have any inter<lb></lb>view with you, and referred you to my managing clerk; an investigation was made between him and your solicitor, the amount was adjusted at 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and you signed it—I recollect giving you a letter, on behalf of Mr. Lisle, to the Lands Improvement Company, in Parliament Street, relating to 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said Mr. Lisle would have no objection to your receiving it out of that money; that had nothing to do with the claim against Mr. Lisle; you had done some work on the estate upon which the Lands Improvement Company were to make an advance, and you were to be paid out of that by the Com<lb></lb>missioners—the receipt in full of all demands was not made with a view to get rid of that claim—I never intended it, nor would it affect your claim against the Company—I did not tell you that Mr. Lisle was not worth a shilling—I told you that all the money I advanced had come from my pocket—you have been over-paid, rather than under<lb></lb>paid—you expressed your satisfaction, and said this payment enabled you to pay the composition to your London creditors.</p>

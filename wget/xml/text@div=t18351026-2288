                  </hi>. On Friday, the 9th of October, I was servant to Nicholas Kenward. On the evening of that day he was driving on the Clapham-road in a carrier's cart—we were going towards the Brixton-road, near the Horns Tavern, at a short distance from the tavern, on the near side of the road, which was our proper side, our near wheel was about four or five yards from the footpath—there was plenty of room between the off-wheel and the off-side of the road for one or two carriages to pass—we were going at a very steady jog trot, four or five miles an hour—when we were about 100 yards beyond the Horns, a chaise was coming from the Clapham-road, as I suppose—it was coming from London—it came on us all in an instant before we had time to save ourselves—I suppose it was coming fast—I can't say at what rate it was coming, for it came all in an instant—the off-wheel of the chaise came in contact with the off-wheel of our cart, and the stock of his wheel came in contact with the stock of ours, and over<lb></lb>turned our cart—I received only a slight bruise—both carriages were overturned—on my getting up I saw the policeman come to Mr. Kenward's assistance, and he was taken to Mr. Taylor, the surgeon's—he was dead when I went into the shop.</p>

               <p>was an omnibus standing at the corner, at Mr. Simpson's—the accident happened on the Brixton-road—I do not recollect whether my master tried to jump out of the cart—I suppose, from the sudden jerk of the cart, he was thrown out, but I cannot say whether he attempted to jump out or not.</p>

                  </hi>. I was on duty near the Horns on the 9th of October, at seven o'clock in the evening, and saw Kenward's horse and cart cross the road; and after that, observed the chaise in which the prisoner was—it was between twenty and thirty yards from the cart when I first noticed it—the prisoner was driving, and he was going at about ten miles an hour—it was coming at a sharp trot, but was not un<lb></lb>steadily driven—before I noticed it, I heard a voice halloo, "Aboy!"—I do not know whether it proceeded from the cart or chaise—I saw the chaise come in contact with the cart, exactly opposite me—I did not see the chaise overturned—I saw the cart overturned—I picked up Mr. Ken<lb></lb>ward, and thought at the time that he was dead—it was a cloudy night—I saw it coming at a distance of thirty yards, by the light of the lamps—I should think the people in the chaise must have seen the cart—the cart was on the right side of the road—the proper side—the near side—it had got into a direct line towards Brixton—when the prisoner was within a few paces of the cart, the horse and chaise branched off to its near side, to avoid the cart—I took the prisoner into custody—there was another person with him—the prisoner into custody—there was another person with him—the prisoner was very much excited by liquor when I took him into custody, and the other one was the worst of the two.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty near the Horns—I was about twenty feet from the cart when I first saw it, and fifty or sixty yards from the chaise, which came zigzag along the road, apparently, as if the driver had no command over his horse—when it came nearly in a straight direction on the cart—the horse in the cart was very spirited when thrown down; but before, it was very steady and quiet—the chaise drove at the rate of ten miles an hour—I saw the cart overturned, and Mr. Kenward taken up—I did not see the chaise overturned—it went on as far as the Obelisk.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you accustomed to horses? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I can<lb></lb>not distinguish between the rate of eight miles an hour and ten, but to the best of my judgement it was ten miles an hour—it was a dark night, but there was sufficient light from the gas to discern it—I was not examined at the inquest.</p>

               <p>the striking together of the two vehicles—I saw the chaise overturned as well as the cart—it overturned almost at the same moment as the cart, and then the horse ran away with the chaise—I suppose the prisoner and his com<lb></lb>panion were thrown out, but I did not see that—I saw the prisoner looking after his horse, after it was stopped—I herad somebody tell him he had caused the death of the man—he did not display any emotion at that, but I did not myself observe that he was in liquor—I saw the other man, and think he was grossly drunk—I think the cart was on its own side, but near off wheel of the cart, and the off side of the road.</p>

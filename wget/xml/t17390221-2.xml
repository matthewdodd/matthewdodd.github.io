            . When I took Mann and Udal, Mann was carried to one House, and Udal to another. Mann desired to be admitted an Evidence, and it was granted. He gave me Directions where the Watch was pawned for ten Shillings. I went to the Pawn-broker's, and demanded the Watch, telling the Man it was stole. He refused to produce it, upon which I sent for Mr. Thorn, and he described it. and said it was in a Tortois-shell Case, and a Piece was broke out; then the Pawnbroker produced it, and Thorn immediately owned it; but we could not have it, unless we paid twelve Shillings, and twelve Shillings I was obliged to pay for it. The Prisoner desired to be admitted an Evidence, and said he could hang three or four; but, as he had been admitted an Evidence several Times before, his Request was deny'd. He wanted to have been made an Evidence against Mann, and said he could put three or four more into his Information. He did not deny the Fact at all.</p>
               <p>Mann. The Prisoner would have killed the Man, for fear of being discovered, had it not been for me.</p>

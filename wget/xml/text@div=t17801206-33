On the 24th of November, a little after one o'clock, I lost a basket, and the things mentioned in the indictment, out of my room; while I was at dinner in my kitchen I heard a foot in the passage; upon which I looked up and saw the two prisone rs go down the steps through the garden, which is before the door. I made an alarm and sent my servant after them; I likewise pursued them down the walk and never lost sight of them till they turned the corner; I cried out stop thief! they threw the things down at the end of the row, turning down the walk; they were taken and delivered to me. The prisoners were taken immediately and were examined before a magistrate; they denied the fact. I am very sure they are the men; I know their faces perfectly.</p>

I turned into the field; there I met and stopped them; they had quitted the basket. Upon my coming up to them they both drew their knives, and with many execrations swore they would cut me down if I attempted to touch them, and they both made several blows at me with their knives, and I actually received two wounds in my hands, nevertheless I seised Bowen; upon which Clayton came up to me and struck me with his fist in the face, but did not knock me down, but he stunned me so as to make me let Bowen go, and then they both ran away. I recovered myself and pursued them, and at the end of the field again seised Bowen; then some other people came up and secured them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am proprietor of Cowley Hall-mills, in the parish of Hillingdon, and reside there. Previous to the 18th of January, the pri<lb></lb>soner had been one of my grooms—I had another groom—in consequence of some information, I caused Biggs, an officer, to be stationed to watch the prisoner's movements—after the officer had made a discovery, some corn was shown to me, some beans, and some iron—they are my pro<lb></lb>perty.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant A</hi> 11.) I went with John Scotney to a place about fifty yards from Cowley Hall Mills on the 18th of January—while we were proceeding the prisoner overtook us—he passed close by us, and said, "Good night"—he was going towards Mr. Benbow's premises—I noticed his dress and appearance—he had a fustian jacket or coat on—I observed the pockets of it, and I could tell that there was nothing in them, as the wind was very boisterous, and the coat flaps turned up several times—we placed ourselves near a hedge on Mr. Benbow's premises, and waited there, and in half an hour I saw the prisoner come in a straight direction from Mr. Benbow's stable—it was then about half-past six o'clock—when he came out he came down the road, and when he came to the end there was a gap in the hedge—I jumped over—the prisoner said, "Halloo, you frightened me"—I said, "What about?"—he crossed the road, and went on—I walked by his side—I said I was afraid it was Mr. Benbow come home, as I was over in his field, fishing—I noticed his pockets, and as we got on to a stile, I said, "You seem very bulky to-night"—he said, "No,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184002030099"></xptr>
               <p>I have nothing"—I put my hand into his pockets, and felt the corn, I took hold of his collar—he called out, "Eliza, and some other name—(his own cottage was very near)—he said we were murdering him—while we were handcuffing him his wife came out, and said, "What have you been doing? what is the matter?"—I said he was my prisoner, he had been stealing his master's corn—she said he had not—Scotney then put his wife's hand into his pocket, and said to her, "Will you believe it now?"—she said, "Oh, dear, what shall I do?"—the prisoner said, "Never mind"—I went with him to the Fox public-house, and on the way he, by some means, got his hand to his left-hand pocket, and made a hole in it, and most of the corn fell out on the road—during that time Mr. Cole came up, and said, "Here is something falling from his pocket," and Mr. Cole caught some of it—I then took up the two ends of the prisoner's pockets, and took him on to the Fox public-house—I then found these two pieces of iron in one of his pockets, and a pocket-full of corn, and a little corn left in his left-hand pocket—this is the corn—he said, "I have done wrong, I must suffer for it"—I believe he keeps a horse.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How came you to handcuff him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was very resolute, and tried to get away into his own garden—we handcuffed him at the little stile which leads to his own garden—Scotney was with me, but he had sprained his ancle, and could not render me any assistance—when the prisoner first passed he saw us—I had not seen him before, but I had a description of his person—I was on duty, and I had my uniform on—it was then about half-past six o'clock, and was rather darker than when he came out.</p>

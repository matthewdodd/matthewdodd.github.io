On the 15th of June I saw the prisoner, in company with a man and a little girl, in Montague-street, Russell-square—the prisoner had a basket in her hand—they turned down Montague-mews—I went to the top of the mews, and saw the prisoner come from the bottom—she went out of the Mews, and the man and little girl followed after her—they all went down Montague-street—I saw Fryer, and gave a signal to him—he stopped her, and said, "What have you got in your basket?"—she said, "What is that to you?"—he then looked into the basket, and saw a purse, and said there were five coun<lb></lb>terfeit sixpences in it—he showed them to me—she was then taken to the station-house.</p>

I stopped the prisoner at half-past three o'clock that morning—I found in the basket a purse, con<lb></lb>taining five counterfeit sixpences—I found in the basket a bundle of wood, some pieces of meat, some bread, and an orange—I took her to the station-house—she told me the money was given her by a gentleman, and afterwards she said the girl who had been with her gave it her, and told her she could get a better living by passing counterfeit coin than by begging—I said if she had any more money she had better give it to me, as she would be searched, and she gave me another counterfeit sixpence, a good shilling, and 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

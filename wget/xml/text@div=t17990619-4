             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to the Excise, I was in company with one Hughes, on Sunday, who is an officer; I had been to see him on duty, and after duty he came with me, it might be between the hours of five and seven; we came into Hyde-street, Bloomsbury, I proceeded from Hyde-street to Castle-street; I don't exactly know the hour; as we were going along Castle-street, two men, the prisoners at the bar, passed us, with a bundle under each arm; the first of my perceiving the prisoners was in Castle-street; I pursued them to Dyot-street, St. Giles's, No. 27, marked with chalk only; I don't know that it is the number now, I saw them go in, and I pursued them close to the door; I was within three or four yards of the hindermost man, and should have caught him had he had a dozen yards further to run, the hindermost man was the tallest; they both run, but the other was considerably before; I pursued them to the door, where a girl attempted to shut the door, but I prevented it, I stood between the door and the door-case, or jam, as they call it, they began running the moment they passed us; they were rather running when they did pass us, but they saw we noticed them, and they then run as fast as they could. I staid in the frame of the door, when my friend holloaed out "Day, don't go any further, for you will be murdered;" for I had out-run my friend; with that I made a pause, and drew back to him, which might be the space of half-a-dozen yards; I then saw a man coming, Cummins, and some other people running down the street, he ran into the house; I drew up to the door again, considering myself in more danger than I was before, I did not go into the house with Cummins; while I staid contending with my friend, I heard a noise in the house, a holloaing, and tumbling three or four stairs down at a time, like a scuffle; by that time there were several people collected together about the door, I pressed through them, and went towards the stair-case, the prisoner, Duggan, and the man whom they called Cummins, came falling down the stairs together, one over the other; I then perceiving that Cummins was endeavouring to take the prisoner, I assisted him, and received a violent blow, I don't know from whom, but either from the prisoner or from Cummins; they got the prisoner into the street, I was rather stunned for the moment, I don't know what became of the other prisoner; but after some little scuffle in the street, the other prisoner was brought by some other persons; they took them to the watch-house, and took charge of the bundles; there were two bundles, one was a silk bird's-eye handkerchief, and the other was a white napkin, or handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What time was this? - A. Between the hours of five and seven.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179906190008"></xptr>Q. When you came to this house did you enter it at all? - A. I went to the threshold first, where a girl attempted to shut the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go in at all? - A. I certainly did.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other persons in the house? - A. There was a girl who attempted to shut the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you have staid at the door of the house? - A. But a very short time.</p>
               <p>Q. A few minutes? - A. I consider I was there but a few minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any back yard to the house? - A. I believe there is, I have seen it since.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a wall broken down, through which the prisoners might have escaped? - A. I really don't know, there was a back yard.</p>
               <p>Q. How many other men might have been in the house, you do not know? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the prisoners in Castle-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw their faces? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say at Bow-street, you never saw the faces of the men, only their backs? - A. I really said at Bow-street, I could state the facts, and undertake to swear they were the two men; it was my friend that said he could not swear to them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Hughes knows no more than you? - A. No; he says he don't know that he should know their faces.</p>

My father was a plaisterer, and this man was a bricklayer, and he does this for nothing but spite.</p>

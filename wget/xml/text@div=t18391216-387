                  </hi>. I live at Isleworth. I was going through Hanwell on the 2nd of December with a coal-cart—I was riding on a horse—the prisoner was there scraping the road—Eleanor Eyre was going by, and the prisoner splashed her with mud—I said to him, "You ought to have a good hiding for that—it would serve you right if I gave you one"—he made no more to do but took up his scraper, and struck me on the head—the iron went through my hat and into my scull—I bled a great deal, and lost my senses—I was taken to a doctor—I had not attempted to strike the prisoner at all.</p>

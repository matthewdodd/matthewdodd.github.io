            . I am an apprentice to a calico-printer. My master's factory is close to Bromley fields. I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner come into the fields on the 20th, and layed down, and go to sleep; presently I saw the prisoner get up, go over to the prosecutor, took some money out of his right hand pocket, and then turned him over, and took the money out of his left; then counted it, and went away.</p>
               <p>JOHN CLARIDGE. I am a constable. When I took the prisoner into custody, I found a good deal of silver on him; he said, part of it was his own, and nineteen shillings and sixpence, he said, belonged to the prosecutor, and he pulled it out in one of the prosecutor's gloves; he said, he took it out of the pockets of the prosecutor, by his desire, when he was dead drunk, in Bromley-fields.</p>

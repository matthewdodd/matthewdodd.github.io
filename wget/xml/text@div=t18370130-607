                  </hi>. I am an officer. I took the prisoner on this charge at his residence at Islington, on the 14th—I asked what he had done with the books he had taken from the Master in Chancery's Office—he said he had sold them at different places—he showed me one place, and then he told me he had a relation in Swan-alley, whose daughter took some for him, and she took me to the place where these were—I took the prisoner from a lodging in a very back street, in White Conduit-fields—his wife and children had not a bit of bread to eat till I gave them some.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> It was my intention to plead guilty, but I did not know how to act—for five or six months I was destitute of employment—my wife and family had not bread to eat; and the evening the officer came that was the case; though I had made the most earnest appeals at the Masters in Chancery, yet they were so unfeeling as to give the work to others, and not to me, who had been so many yean there.</p>

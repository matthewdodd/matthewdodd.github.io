            . I am an officer of Bow-street. I apprehended the prisoner on Monday night, the 6th of December, in Duke's-court, Bow-street, at a coffee-shop; I took him on Mr. Carman's charge - I afterwards mentioned this charge to him; he was very much frightened, and said it would be his ruin.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you told him the charge affected his life? A. No, I told him it was a forgery - I knew that affected his life; I searched him.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you find any duplicates on him? A. I did at his lodgings; I returned to the coffee-shop, and in a room there, which they showed me as his, I found thirty-six duplicates - I only knew it to be his room from what others told me.(The bill and acceptance were here put in and read.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - Circumstanced as I am this day before you on a charge of serious and important character, I trust you will pardon the liberty I take by intruding upon your valuable time and patience, while I attempt, if possible, to explain away the unfavourable impression that may in the course of the evidence have obtruded itself upon your notice: and do trust that by showing and explaining my previous transactions in business that I shall be enabled to convince you that nothing could have been more opposite to my feelings and former pursuits in life, than to have imposed upon any person an instrument fraught with so much danger and serious consequences. From the year 1811 until 1818 I was engaged in the business of a most respectable ironmonger in Greenwich, and, I believe, to the satisfaction of all who then knew me. From 1818 until 1822, I was at Sheffield as factor, and where also every transaction was conducted in a tradesman-like way. From 1822 until 1824 I was engaged as a corn-factor and agriculturist in Lincolnshire, and can give ample proof that every circumstance was conducted with due zeal and attention, and at the same time advantageous manner as I could possibly wish. I shortly afterwards was induced to embark my capital in the cabinet and ivory-turning business, and continued therein until March, 1830, when I became acquainted with a person named Charles Anderson, and from this time, I am sorry to say, I have to date all my present calamities, and to him I may attribute this charge; and as the only party who ought to be responsible for the consequences. In the course of business, the person, Anderson, to whom I have alluded, became acquainted with me and represented himself as a capitalist and made several overtures to me as regarded my business: which, after I had explained, he remarked that it was his intention to freight a vessel and trade to France with various descriptions of merchandize. and he said that many articles in my line of business would do remarkable well as principal and leading commodities, and that he could, by barter, render me very essential service. The offer seemed to savour of probability: and I, trusting too much upon his representation, engaged immediately without making the necessary and precantious inquiry. I therefore unfortunately became his dupe, and supplied him with various articles of cabinet and ivory turnery, and goods to the amount of 150l., and in payment thereof he, (from voyages made to France in April, May, and June,) gave me in return French fans and other fancy articles of French manufacture, and also bills of exchange amounting to a considerable sum, out of which I paid him the balance, in cash and took the responsibility of the bills upon myself, never doubting his integrity. Some of these bills were paid and duly honoured - I gave the bill in question, and which forms this prosecution, to Messrs. West and Strange upon the same faith as the others had been put into circulation, and in payment for the same received of them for this bill, in cash 22l., in goods about 10l., and the balance was held by the prosecutors in payment of my account with them - the bill was paid in due course from the prosecutors to their bankers, and was returned to them as a forged bill; they, of course, adopted the necessary steps, and unfortunately I have not been enabled to find Anderson, who, I understand, is now in America. This I have stated before and again repeat, and do therefore, my Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, humbly submit that I am a truly injured and unfortunate man, and trust that when you have considered my respectable family, friends and connexions, my previous habits and transactions in trade, and also that I am a married man with three very young children, that you will be pleased to come to a verdict in my favour, and restore me back again to my family and friends. My Lord, I shall merely trouble you with a few friends as to character, and now leave my case in your hands.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

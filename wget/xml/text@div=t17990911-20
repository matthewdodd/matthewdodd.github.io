             sworn. - The prisoner was at work upon my premises, doing some repairs to the brick-work; I missed two iron sash-weights on the 2d of September, I was from home at the time they were taken, I was sent for; I found the prisoner in the shop, he told me it was the first time he had ever done any thing of the kind, and hoped I would forgive him, my foreman had charged him with stealing them; he was taken to the Compter, and examined next day; there is no particular mark upon them by which I can swear to them, but I have every reason to believe they are mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they like those which remained behind? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your store so great that you could not miss them? - A. It is impossible.</p>
               <p>- sworn. - I am foreman to Mr. Rice: I saw the prisoner and the carpenter talking together, and as he turned away, I perceived some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110050"></xptr>thing in his breeches; I asked him what he had got there; he said, nothing; I said, I was sure he had got more than he should have; he said, no, he had not; upon his stooping, one of the weights projected out behind; the carpenter was behind him, he said, here is something else; then I took him back into the warehouse, he went down some steps into the cellar, and called for a light, and before the light was brought I saw him throw one of the sash-weights from his breeches, the other I took from his hands; he had pulled them both out of his breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they iron sash-weights? - A. Yes; they were wrapped up in a paper, I gave them to the officer; I sent for Mr. Rice, and when he came, he said he was very sorry for it, and hoped he would forgive him.</p>

            . - I am a carpenter: I was by when the foreman stopped the prisoner; he went into the cellar and called for a light, I did not go into the cellar, but when he brought the prisoner up, he told me he had taken that property from him; the foreman brought the property in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. They were articles that Mr. Rice sold? - A. Yes, from the foundry.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

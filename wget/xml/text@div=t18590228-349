                  </hi>. I am a butcher of Woolwich—on Tuesday night, 1st February, I had a quantity of meat in my slaughter-house, which was fastened in the usual way with bolts and a chain—on the following morning I found an entrance had been made, and part of a bullock had been taken away, and some salt beef, about thirty or forty pounds in all—it was worth about 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the entrance had been made by getting into a neighbouring yard, and over a shed into my yard, and Into the slaughter-house—there is no door to the slaughter-house inside—that was the way they got in, and they let themselves out at the back door—they would have to unbolt it and to undo the chain—the salt beef was on the tub the previous night, and the fresh beef they took from a carcase which was hanging up.</p>

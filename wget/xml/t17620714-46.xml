            , the deceased my wife, was led home by two women; the blood went over her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176207140028"></xptr> handkerchief into her shoes. This was on the 10th of June, and she died the 22 d.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she die of?</p>
               <p>Thatcher. I believe of that wound on her head. She said the prisoner gave it her by flinging her down.</p>
               <p>Q. When did she tell you this?</p>
               <p>Thatcher. About 3 or 4 days before she died.</p>
               <p>Mr. Allen. I am a surgeon. I attended the deceased. The two women were drinking together.

             desired the deceased to go out of her house several times. The deceased said she was afraid of her husband, and chose to stay all night.

             took her by the right arm, and desired her to go out; the other catched hold of the door-case, and desired her to stay in. There were then high words on both sides. Then Cooper said, if you do not get out, I will knock you down, and kill you.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those her words?</p>
               <p>Allen. I think so. They were both very much in liquor. At last the prisoner got her out. She went a little way, and came back again, and said, the people that lived here before you were hanged you b - h. The prisoner had not struck her then, but desired her to go out. What shall I be hanged for? said the prisoner. The other replied, if you kill me, you will be hanged. The prisoner gave her a push on the breast, and said, you b - ch get home. She fell on her back, and received three wounds, but the scull was not fractured in the least. The prisoner's husband came and took her up. Then she and he went in and shut the door. Afterwards the deceased came to the threshold, and said, mistress, I am not gone. She put her hand to her head, and found it bloody. I took her home, and dressed her head. Next morning she was brought to me by two women. The wound seemed to be in a fair way. She lived very irregularly. I do not look upon it that this wound was the cause of her death. I believe the prisoner did what she did with intention to put her from the door.</p>

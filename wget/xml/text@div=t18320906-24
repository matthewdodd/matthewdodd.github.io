            . I live in Philip-lane, opposite Fisher's house; the prisoner was a stranger to me. On the 1st of August, I saw him coming out of Fisher's house with the windows - knowing he did not belong to the house; I followed him to Red Lion-market, Whitecross-street, where I saw an officer, and told him - he had just got inside a door; the officer seized him with them, and told him to take them to where he brought them from - he carried them part of the way back, then put them down, and would not carry them further; I saw them fitted to the house.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 1st of August, Mrs. Bamfield charged the prisoner with taking these sashes; I was at the corner of Red Lion-market, and had seen him with them, but as he dealt in old materials, I took no notice, till she gave me information; he had then gone through a court, into the house where he works - I went, and said, "Bill, I want those windows;" he took them up - I told him to carry them back to where he took them from; he put them down, and would not take them further - I took him into custody; his employ is cutting up fire-wood.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

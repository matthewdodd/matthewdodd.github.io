I am steward of the <hi rend="italic">Abercrombie Robertson,</hi> lying at Deptford—Mr. Selby is the owner—every thing on board is the property of the captain, Robert Laurence Frazer—it is a transport, and the Crowe provides the stores. On the night of the 12th of January I was called by the captain to go into the <hi rend="italic">Trinity</hi> barge, which was lying alongside the ship, in consequence of the lighterman having called for assistance—when I got into the lighter I found Connolly and the prisoner—the third officer then went into the cabin of the lighter, and found a bottle of wine con<lb></lb>cealed—it was the same sort as had been placed in the barge <hi rend="italic">Nelson,</hi> which was lying outside the <hi rend="italic">Trinity</hi> barge—I had placed seven hampers of wine in that barge, which was to return them to the Victualling-oflice—it corresponded with the bottles placed in the hamper—there was one hamper missing, containing twenty-five bottles.</p>

               <p>Was you acquainted with her before? - I had seen her once or twice before.</p>
               <p>What month was this? - If I were to die I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear of Mrs. Bennet's being robbed? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Was it in the spring of the year? - It is about eight or nine months ago, I could tell by the death of my child if I was at home.</p>
               <p>Have you forgot when your child died? - I have the receipt at home, but I cannot tell the time; one has been dead six months, and one nine; to the best of my knowledge I saw her between five and six, she asked me where the Jew was; I said I could not tell, I did not expect he would be there till the following morning; she said, he owed her some money; presently this Harry the Slabberer came in.</p>

               <p>When did you see her again? - I never saw her again till I was taken up, and carried before my Lord Mayor, because I would not tell where the Jew was; I know no more, but that one of the Jews was taken up, and the other is out of the way; this Harry the slabberer, he has never been at home in his own place since.</p>
               <p>Court. You said something about two pots? - When she first came in the shop, she said she was taken up for two pots.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Mrs. Wells. Did not I ask you when I came in, says I, do you buy old silver, no, says you, but I will fetch a man that will; she knows it was an old bruised quart pot that I had, I had a guinea and a half for it; and please you my Lord, it had been my great grandmother's, for ought I know; I am as innocent as the child in my womb now, of robbing that gentlewoman; to be sure I have been to blame about the cloak: there was a young man laid over head, I sancied it was my young mistress's sweetheart; another woman lived in the next room; I came into the tap, and I did something in the tap, and my mistress saw me; I have two children at home, I thought I will not stay, I will go home; as for that cloak, I bought it for four shillings and six-pence out of pawn, in Monmouth-street, that was the first day I put it on: to be sure, when my mistress said, it is better to confess, well says I, it is your cloak; she took me to the three Tuns in Fleet-street, the people there said, they could not swear to me; my mistress sent me word yesterday, telling me, not to be uneasy, for she would never appear against me.</p>
               <p>Jury to prosecutrix. Did a young man sleep in your house? - Yes my Lord, he has lodged with me a year and better, he lodges with me now; and the woman that she mentions has lodged with me ten years, next Christmas.</p>
               <p>Court. Were any of these people in the house that night? - They were all in the house, they got up; I went myself, and fetched the young man out of bed, and got him to go to the Justice's; my daughter is very young, and has no sweet heart.</p>

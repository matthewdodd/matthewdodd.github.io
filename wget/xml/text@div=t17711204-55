            . I am a horse-dealer. I bought a bay gelding of the prisoner last Tuesday. The prosecutor described the marks of the gelding before I shewed it him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the person you bought the horse of?</p>
               <p>Spencer. Yes; the prisoner brought the horse into my yard himself to sell. I bought him for 15 l. I gave a shilling earnest; he first asked 20 l. for him, then he offered to sell him for eighteen guineas. I said to some gentlemen I believe he is stolen. I told the prisoner I was afraid that he did not come honestly by the horse; he told me it was his father's. He said he lived at Wing, and then at Littlecut.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found him vary in the place where his father lived, did not your suspicion encrease?</p>
               <p>Spencer. No; I thought he might have brought him away in a clandestine manner from him; he said his father sent him with a horse to the White-hart at Barnet; when he came there, the landlord told him the gentleman that wanted it was provided for; so he brought it to sell on his own account. I kept him in custody, and sent for the constable. On Friday the prosecutor came, and I shewed him the horse; the prisoner was then in the Compter. The prosecutor said he was a bay horse; he described the very marks of the horse.</p>

               <p>I had the horse out of the Marsh-ground.</p>
               <p>Q. to Cutler. Do you know this boy?</p>
               <p>Cutler. Yes; he was born in the same parish as I was; he was a good servant-boy.</p>

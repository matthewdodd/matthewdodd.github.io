               <p>I keep the Flower de Luce: the prisoner sat down on a seat at the door; as soon as Mr. Jordan came into the house the prisoner asked how far it was to Highgate; I told him a mile; he asked how far it was to London; I said, about four miles and a half; I went for a bit of hay for the horse; when I returned it was gone; I got my horse out of the stable, and I pursued him over the common; I heard somebody striking a horse smartly; I came up to him, and stopped the prisoner on the horse; I brought him back; he attempted to get from me by pushing me into a ditch; but I held him fast; and brought him back; he said, four men put him on it; and then he said, the owner gave him leave to ride it.</p>
               <p>Was he drunk? - I don't know that he was; he shamm'd drunk when he came back; before the justice he said, he was a horse-dealer, and came from Cumberland on Monday morning; he said, he was in liquor.</p>
               <p>PROSECUTOR. It was my horse the witness brought back with the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Four men set me on the horse, and I fell off on the other side, I was so much in liquor; I was very much stupefied: the man said I might ride it as far as Highgate.</p>

When I came to the premises on Monday morning, the 21st of January, I learned that there had been a robbery between the Saturday night and the Monday morning; I missed fifty-one pieces of silk handkerchiefs, ten of them were quite plain, and the other had a mere outline of the pattern on them - they were in an unfinished state; I also missed some printed stockings - Knight afterwards showed me some handkerchiefs which I have here, and which I recognise as part of what I lost; I afterwards went with the officer to the prisoner's house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Were you at the Police-office when the prisoner camethere? A. Yes; he came there voluntarily - he produced a boy, who was discharged, I believe; the prisoner was not in custody as I conceive; the Magistrate told me to get further evidence - I went before the Grand Jury, and took the prisoner on a warrant last Friday night.</p>

            . I am in the prosecutor's employ. I had been at work on these handkerchiefs, among other things, in the course of the week, and on Saturday evening, the 19th of January, I left them safe on the machine, about half-past three o'clock; I came to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140090"></xptr>work on the Monday morning at half-past eight - I found the premises broken open, and the handkerchiefs gone.</p>

               <p>ANN KNIGHT. I am the wife of John Knight, he lives at No. 190, Brick-lane, and is a block-maker; he occasionally works for the prosecutors - I know the prisoner, he is a watchmaker and general dealer, and lives in Mansel-street. On the afternoon of a Thursday, the beginning of February, I received a message by his daughter to go to his house on the Friday, which I did - I saw these handkerchiefs there, and while I was purchasing these four of them, the prisoner came in; I gave 11s. for them - the prisoner saw them, and saw me while his wife was cutting them off; I did not inquire where they came from; I had been in the habit of dealing with them, and thought them people of good character; I showed these handkerchiefs to my husband - he knew them, and showed them to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q How far is Mansel-street from Brick-lane? A. I suppose half a mile, and six or seven miles from the prosecutor's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Where does your husband work? A. At home; we make blocks for the prosecutors - I do not know that the prisoner or his wife knew that; they keep an open shop, in which handkerchiefs and such things are sold - I gave a fair price for these handkerchiefs; it was an open transaction in day-light - I had no idea that the handkerchiefs were not finished, but my husband did directly he saw them.</p>

            . I am the husband of this witness. I do all the prosecutor's business in block-making. On that Friday my wife showed me these four handkerchiefs - I knew they were not finished; I had a bill in my house, offering a reward for the robbery, and the mark on one of these handkerchiefs (H. F.) corresponded with the description in the bill; I knew that they were not finished, but every one would not know that; it would depend on their judgment - I should think drapers or persons dealing in them must know it; I went to Mr. Jones, and went with him to get a warrant.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Is the mark you speak of, a paper mark? A. It is a printed mark on the handkerchief; I am aware that in cases of bankruptcy every thing is sold, whether finished or not - I know the prisoner: I am not aware that he knew that I worked for the prosecutors - he knew I worked for the trade in general; my wife did not know that these handkerchiefs were not finished; the chemical process which fixes the colour, does not alter the appearance of them.</p>

            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street. I was applied to by the prosecutor on Saturday, the 9th of February, for a warrant; I got one, and went with him to the prisoner's premises - he was not at home, but his wife was; I told her my business, and she produced to me this bundle of handkerchiefs, which I have here, from a cupboard in the shop; she made no hesitation whatever - I asked where they came from; she did not tell me, but referred me to her husband - I waited for him, and one of the girls went after him, but he did not come; I left a message for him, and in about an hour and a half afterwards he came to me; he said "I am very willing to go before the Magistrate" - I told him the prosecutor and another gentleman would meet him at six o'clock in the evening, and he said "I shall decline to answer any questions, till I go before the Magistrate:" he came again at six o'clock, and I took him before the Magistrate - he then stated that he bought the handkerchiefs of a man named Nathan, that Nathan's boy brought them to him, and he paid him 8l. odd for them - the prisoner was not then in custody; in consequence of what he said that night, I went and brought Nathan and his son, a boy about eleven years of age, while the prisoner waited; - the prisoner then repeated the same story, that he had the handkerchiefs fromthem, and gave 8l. odd for them; both Nathan and his son denied it - the Magistrate asked the prisoner if he had any bill of parcels or receipt, and he said he had not; to the best of my knowledge, he said they were purchased in his own house, and that Nathan's boy brought them - the boy was upon that given into custody, and remanded till Monday: the prisoner then produced two servant girls of his - they were examined on his behalf, and stated they had seen the transaction of the purchase of these goods, and that 8l. odd had been given for the lot.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. What time did you go to the prisoner first? A. About twelve o'clock; these handkerchiefs are very nearly in the same state as when I received them - they are not much more tumbled; I have been an officer for five years, and have known the prisoner as a most respectable man - I left work with his wife, and he came to me about three o'clock; I had left my card at his house - I told him the prosecutor would be there at six o'clock, and he went at large till then; the Magistrate took his word - he did not say that he had seen old Nathan at all on the business, but that he bought them of him, and his boy brought them to his own house; I think he said on the Thursday, which would be about the 7th of February - Nathan denied that he had sold him these, but he admitted that he formerly had had dealings with the prisoner, through the medium of his son; I stated just now that the prisoner's servants were not examined till the Monday, but I now recollect they were examined on the Saturday night; when Nathan's boy denied taking the handkerchiefs, the prisoner desired the two servants to be sent for, and they were examined separately - after that the prisoner was allowed to go home, and the boy was remanded till the Monday; I cannot tell whether these handkerchiefs would be useful to persons in their present state, or whether the colour would wash out.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140091"></xptr>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Now just attend to me; the prisoner was allowed to go home on the statement of the two women? A. Yes; he was not in charge at that time - the boy was charged with stealing them, and he was detained. On the Monday, the two females appeared again before the boy, but the boy was discharged; the Magistrate asked old Nathan if he had had dealings with the prisoner before, through the medium of the boy; and he said he had to the amount of 15l. or 20l. - that was five or six months ago.</p>
               <p>MR. JONES re-examined. Q. What was the value of what you lost? A. About 50l.; they are worth 1l. a piece - I lost fifty pieces, but only ten are found; these were to receive five or six more colours - there are none sold in this state; I dare not offer them to any dealer in this state - they never leave us completely finished; they have to go to the folders.</p>

            , of Greenfield-street, Commercial-road, whom I have known as a general dealer for four or five years; he is frequently accustomed to send his son to my house with various kinds of goods, in the same manner as I know he does to other houses - on this occasion, the boy came with some handkerchiefs; Mrs. Samuels, who was up stairs with me, went down and looked at them, she came up and informed me that Nathan's son had brought some handkerchiefs; that she had offered him 2s. 6d., or 17s. 6d. per piece, and that he took them away - the boy returned, and I went down stairs; he said "Tell Mrs. Samuels she must give 18s. for them" - I said "No, I am positive she gave the full value for them;" I took them up stairs - I brought him down the money, which was 8l. 15s., for ten pieces; on the same Thursday evening they were put in the shop, and exposed for public sale - on the Friday morning I took two or three pieces with me to a shop; I could not sell them as they were bought too dear - when I came home, Mrs. Samuels was cutting four handkerchiefs from different pieces, which were sold in my presence to a Mrs. Knight for 11s., being 3d, each profit; on Saturday morning after breakfast I went out with several gentleman to visit the sick of a charitable institution of which I am founder, and have been secretary for nine years; when I came home, Mrs. Samuels informed me that an officer from Lambeth-street, with two gentlemen, had been there, and inquired after the handkerchiefs - that she went down with them into the shop, and delivered them all up, with the exception of five, which were sold; I went instantly down to the office, and informed the officer, that I knew from whom I purchased the handkerchiefs - I went before the Magistrate, and informed him from whom they came; I then asked the officer whether I ought not to go with him to Mr. Nathan's house - he said "You had better let it rest till the gentlemen call on you, as they agreed on, this evening, at six o'clock;" they came at seven o'clock, when the officer informed them of my having been at the office - I related to them the particulars of the purchase of the handkerchiefs; they inquired to whom I had sold the five - I informed them that four was sold to a Mrs. Knight for 11s., which circumstance he must have known to be correct, from the information he received; I then inquired whether it would not be adviseable to go to Mr. Nathan's house, whom I supposed would state from whom he purchased them - they thought it was best to go first to the office, when Nathan and his son were fetched; Mr. Nathan admitted that he was in the habit of sending his son to me, but said he had not to his knowledge been there for a fortnight - my two servants were sent for, and were separately examined on their oath; they swore to the identity of the boy, and to the circumstance of his having sold me the handkerchiefs - the boy was remanded, and I went on Monday with my servants to the office; the case was gone into before four Magistrates, which, after a long investigation was dismissed, one of the Magistrates particularly observing, that there was the manufacturer's name plainly on the goods, which was evidence that they were not bought or sold with any felonious knowledge; I trust that all the circumstances, the price I gave, the public manner they were bought and sold, together with my character, which has ever been unblemished, will operate on your minds in my favour. The handkerchiefs were exposed in the shop, and were sold precisely in the same manner as they were bought; nobody ever observed to me that they were in an unfinished state, and but for the prosecutor's own statement I should not have known it.</p>

            . I am servant to the prisoner and his wife; I know a young man named Nathan - my master has had dealings with Nathan for some time past. I recollect young Nathan calling at my master's on Thursday, the 7th of February, about four or half-past four o'clock - he had some handkerchiefs with him; I saw them - they were of this description, exactly the same - I do not know whether my master was at home; he was not in the place when the boy came - my mistress was at home; the boy had some conversation with her, and then took the handkerchiefs away - he returned in about five minutes, or not so long as that; he came in as he usually did into the kitchen, and I called my fellow-servant to call my mistress; my master and mistress were then both up stairs - they both came down; Mrs. Samuels bargained with young Nathan for the handkerchiefs, and he said that Mrs. Samuels ought to give him 18s.; the prisoner said Mrs. Samuels had bid the full value, and he could not afford to give any more - I saw 8l. and 5s. or 15s. paid; the prisoner took the handkerchiefs into the shop, and placed them on the counter; at night the goods are generally put in a cupboard, some in a trunk, and some in a desk.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know what time the officer came? A. I cannot say - it might be one o'clock or half-past one; the goods are generally removed from the counter and put away, in consequence of our Sabbath.</p>
               <p>MR. ROWE. Q. What time does the Sabbath terminate? A. On Saturday, after dark - at half-past twelve or one o'clock, the Sabbath was in full operation; I was not in the shop on that Saturday, but our kitchen is even with the shop, and we see the things moved from the counter to the cupboard, and the trunks, as much as they will hold; I opened the door for Mrs. Knight when she came on the Friday, between eleven and twelve o'clock, as near as I can recollect; that was before the Sabbath - she was in the shop with my master and mistress; I did not notice whether these handkerchiefs were then on the counter - they were on Thursday night; I have seen young Nathan frequently - he seems to be about fifteen or sixteen years old; he is not very big - he came on the Thursday to the kitchen door, and I called Mrs. Samuels down - he brought a bundle tied up, and it was in a blue chequered bag, not a very large one; he talked with mistress for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour - he took the handkerchiefs out, and put them on a chair - that was the first time he came; he came again in about five minutes, and came into the kitchen; my master and mistress came down together - master went up again, and got the money; the boy said, "Mrs. Samuels ought to give me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140092"></xptr>18s.," and master said she had bought them well at 17s. 6d. - that was half a crown a handkerchief; I saw the money paid in sovereigns and silver - I did not see say receipt taken, or bill of parcels; Mrs. Samuels asked the boy how many pieces there were, and he said ten.</p>

               <p>MR. ROWE. Q. Are you sure it was not in the shop? A. No, Sir, it was in the kitchen, the shop and kitchen adjoin - the kitchen is more private than the shop; there is a shop door and a kitchen door, both come into the passage; I know the boy very well, but I do not know where he lives; he is a thin pale faced boy, not so tall as I am; I should think he is 15 or 16 years old - I did not let him in, but I came there after he had been there a minute; I came into the kitchen for something - I was at work in the yard; I believe I came in for some sand to scour some saucepans - I did not stop long; I left the boy and my fellow-servant there, and my mistress was bargaining with him; the handkerchiefs were tied in a bundle, and I saw him untie them - I did not see whether the bundle was in any outer wrapper; I did not see any bag - I did not see one on the table; if it had been on the table I should have seen it - he might have one under his arm; I do not know whether he had a cloak on - he went away for about five minutes, and then returned, and my fellow-servant called me in to call my mistress and I refused - I had gone into the kitchen the first time while the boy was there; I then went into the yard - I went into the kitchen again in about six minutes; I saw the boy there again, and my fellow-servant - my mistress was not there; I refused to call her, but I did call her - I am quite sure the boy had gone away, because I saw him go; I was in the yard, and the passage leads into the yard; he went out of the kitchen into that passage, and went out; the first door in the passage goes into the shop, and the next into the kitchen - my master mostly buys things in the kitchen; I went into the kitchen again, and saw my master pay the boy - I came in with a saucepan just at the time he was paying it; he counted it on the corner of the dresser; it was silver and gold, but I do not know how much.</p>

            . I live at No. 15, New-road, St. George's. I know the prisoner, and have dealt with him for six or eight years - I always considered him a very honest man; he offered me some handkerchiefs for sale on Friday, the 8th of February, and on the Tuesday before; it was two or three of this description; I think he said 2s. 9d. was the very lowest he could take for them - I did not think them worth the money, and did not purchase them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What are you? A. A linendraper - it did not occur to me that they were imperfect articles, and that the colour on them would he discharged by water; I did not observe that, I hardly looked at them - I believe I did take hold of them, and I found they were silk; the silk might he worth as much as it is now - I bought some a great deal better for 4s. each, something very similar to these.</p>

               <p>MR. ROWE. In the course of your experience with silk and silk handkerchiefs, have you often had articles of this kind offered for sale? A. I never bought any exactly of this kind - I did not want these, and I thought they would not suit me: I should think that these are unfinished handkerchiefs, if any one had pointed it out to me, but I should not have given it a thought at first - they are undressed; the goods in respectable shops are not in this state; they are done up in pieces, and made up, but these are quite in a tumbled state; I can see now that these are unfinished; I never bought any in this state, but I do not see why if a Jew were to take these about, many persons might not boy them in this state; but if I were to go into a warehouse I should not buy such, unless they were sold as a job lot.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you ever see such a job lot in any house in the City? A. No, I never did - I have no doubt now that they are unfinished; I do not know whether they should have had borders to them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Would that have struck you on a cursory observation? A. No, it is only from a more minute examination of them that I see they are not finished - I believe this is one of the handkerchiefs I had in my hand.</p>
               <p>MR. ROWE. Q. Do you think that these goods could have been opened, examined, and bargained for by a person accustomed to the trade, without their seeing that they were not finished? A. I should not have noticed it unless any body had pointed it out to me - if I had looked them all over perhaps I might; I have dealt with the prisoner at his own house, and he called at my house once or twice a week; my wife generally goes to his house - I have gone there and looked at prints in his little back room - he keeps a kind of warehouse; I do not know that I ever bought goods there, but I have looked at them.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Have you ever bought soiled and damaged goods of him? A. Yes - I have known silk goods and other goods sold under extents and bankruptcies; there are thousands of patterns of silk handkerchiefs- I have seen many without borders like this, many with a white ground and black middle only; I dare say many persons would think these were finished - patterns like these are very common.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received an excellent character from twenty witnesses.</p>

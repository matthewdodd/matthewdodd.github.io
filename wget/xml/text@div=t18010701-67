             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a soldier in the Coldstream regiment of Guards, and so is the prisoner: On the 21st of May, coming off guard from the Tower, I saw the prisoner; he said, what is the matter you look so sackless this morning; why, says he, I have had a poor guard, without any money in my pocket; he told me to go to a public-house and order a pot of beer, and he would come to me; he came to me, and then we both went to a public-house in St. Catherine's; he said, landlord, can you give me change for a ten pound Bank-note; he replied he could; then the prisoner pulled out two notes and gave them to me to look at, because he said he could not read them; he said one was a ten and the other a forty pound note; I went to the bar and got change for the ten pound; I think there were about five guineas in cash and the rest in notes; he desired me to take those notes that I had from the landlord and put them in my pocket-book; when we were coming away he said, I wish you would take this forty pound and get change for me; he said I want to buy a new suit of cloaths, and I cannot read, I may take bad notes; I put it into my pocket-book, and the next morning I went to the Blue Anchor, in East Smithfield, and there I met with a sailor, we were drinking together; I said I wished to buy a coat; I said I had got a forty pound note, and I wished to get it changed; the sailor went with me to a cloaths shop upon Tower-hill; I bought a coat for fifteen shillings, and I gave the man the forty pound note to get change; the master of the shop went out to get it changed, and he was so long that I began to be uneasy, as it was not my own note; the sailor then said, I need not be uneasy; for he knew the man, and he was sure he would come back; he said, if I would give him a trifle he would give me change for it; he said, if I would give him a guinea he would do it; I said I had better lose a gui<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010063"></xptr>nea than the whole, and he gave me four ten pound notes; I was in liquor, and I thought I would go to the Tower and lie down; I went to lie down, and in about three quarters of an hour, the sailor and Levy came to me and told me the note was stopped at the Bank, they thought it was too much for a soldier to have; I said I will go with you down to the Bank, and so I went with Levy, and I met the prisoner somewhere about the Tower; I told him what had passed, I hoped he had come honestly by it, I was afraid he would bring me into a hobble; he said, yes, I came honestly by the notes, I found them; I said I should go to the Bank, and he might as well go too, and accordingly he did, but he did not go in, he stopped at the door; I told him I had got the four ten pound notes, and I gave them back to the sailor before we went to the Bank; the sailor did not go to the Bank; I then received the change in a ten, a twenty, and the remainder in twos and ones.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you tell them at the Bank where you got it? - A. No; then Walton and I went to a public-house, and I gave Walton the change upon the table; I was taken up on the Wednesday night following, and the next day I gave an account of it to the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You asked him if he had come honestly by it, did you suspect him? - A. Yes, I was afraid.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you tell them so at the Bank? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Did they not ask you if it was your own note? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And you told them it was? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. That was not true then? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you quartered at the same house? - A. No; I have been three times in the house.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you there on the 21st? - A.No.</p>
               <p>ISRAEL ISRAEL sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I live with Philip Levy, upon Towerhill: On the 21st of May, Riding came to the shop, with a sailor, to buy a coat, and then he gave me a forty pound note, which I gave to Mr. Levy.</p>
               <p>PHILIP LEVY sworn. - On Friday morning Israel gave me a forty pound note; I took it to the Bank to know whether it was a good or a bad note; they told me it was a very good one; I told them how I received it, and they stopped it till Riding came, and then they gave him change, a twenty, a ten, and the rest in small notes.</p>

               <p>Q.Before the prisoner said any thing, did you make him any promises, or hold out any threat? - A. I did not; he told me the 20l. and the 1l. was part of the change of the 40l. that had been stopped at the Bank.</p>

James Walton, having a wife and two children, one of them near four years old, which I pay 2s. 6d. a week for, and have been a soldier thirteen years and upwards, and never had a stain in my character before this, and I now declare I know nothing of the robbery laid to my charge. The landlord says, he was robbed between twelve o'clock on the 20th of May, and twelve o'clock on the 21st of the same month, I was at an hospital; at five o'clock on the 20th of May, I went to my quarters, stopped there half an hour; I went out, came back at eleven, and went to bed; a great many lodgers go in and come out at all times; the next morning I got my breakfast, and went out at eight o'clock, the mistress was then in bed in the same room they state to be robbed; about a fortnight before this they lost a large kettle, which they laid to my charge, and abused me very much for, and afterwards found it upon another man who worked in the house. My father was in the Lancashire militia 26 years; my four brothers are all in the army; and the one that has been in the shortest time has been seven years.</p>

               <p>The prisoner also called a corporal of his own company, who had known him from October last, and gave him a good character.</p>

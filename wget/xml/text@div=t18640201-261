                  </hi>. I live at Union-place, Limehouse—on 26th December the prisoner and four more, came into my place, and wanted to send out for some beer; I objected, and so did my wife—I afterwards went out for some beer, in order to get them to go quietly out of my place, and before much of it was drunk, the prisoner said that me and my brother could be bought for a shilling—after repeating that several times, he tried to throw me into into the fire, but found he could not, and my friends shoved him out into street—he challenged me to fight, but I was not let out—he then went away—I called at his place two nights afterwards, Monday the 28th, between 8 and 9 o'clock, but he was denied, and I went away—I had not gone very far when I heard a step, turned round, and saw the prisoner, who struck me on the eye with a piece of iron, which knocked me to the ground insensible—I knew nothing more till I found myself at home in bed next morning.</p>

I am a hammerman, and live at Union-place, West India-road—on 28th December I saw Myers go to Dunn's house, and turn back—Dunn then came out at his own back way into the street—he followed Myers, went behind him in the middle of the road, and struck him with a fire-brick; he threw the brick when he was between three or four yards from Myers—it struck him, and knocked him down stunned—I saw him picked up; he was altogether helpless, and had to be carried away—Dunn did not speak before the blow—this took place about six yards from Dunn's house—Dunn immediately turned back to his own house—I am sure it was Dunn; I knew him—it was a whole brick.</p>

I am a Licentiate of the Royal College of Edinburgh, and reside at Canton-place, Limehouse—I was requested by Dr. Nightingale to see the prosecutor, as he considered he was dying—he was sinking very fast, and erysipelas had set in over the wound—I could not examine the eye, it was so much swollen—he rallied under the use of stimulants, and when the swelling subsided, I discovered that the eye was cut right through; the humours had escaped, and the eye was lost—it had swollen as large as an egg—he was very ill, and was three weeks before we could leave him alone—I apprehend the lobe of the eye will have to be taken away. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

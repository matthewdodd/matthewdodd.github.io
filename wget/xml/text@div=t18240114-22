            . I am an officer. On the 23d of December, in the evening, in consequence of information, I followed a coach from the neighbourhood of the Mansion House, with Jones and Wilden; it stopped at Mr. Angus's, chemist, Whitechapel. The prisoner got out, with a basket in his hand, containing these chests. I asked what he had there - he said, two medicine chests and a roll of oil-cloth, and was taking them to Mr. Angus. We all went into the shop. Mr. Angus said he expected such things. The prisoner was asked where he had got them - he at first said that was not a fair question, but afterwards that he had them from one Hardwick, of No. 36, Compton-street, St. Giles's, a general dealer, and had no doubt but he would shew us black and white for them. We took him there. Hardwick was not at home. Dynan said, he thought we could find him at the Coach and Horses, public-house, Belton-street; and, in the way there, he suggested that one of us should go in, and ask if Dynan had had the boxes that were left there by Hardwick. Jones went in, came out, and said the landlord told him that he had. I immediately went into the house. Hardwick and the landlord were at the end of the passage. I afterwards asked him, in Dynan's presence, if he had had the two chests from him. He denied it. Dynan said,</p>
               <p>"How could you say so?" He still denied it, and I took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. What became of Hardwick. - A. He escaped from Wilden. I saw him and the landlord in private conversation. Dynan said he had commissioned him to sell a brace of pistols, and I found a brace in Hardwick's house. He was admitted to bail, and went with me to find Hardwick, but we could not.</p>

            . I was with Hesketh. His account is correct. I went into the public-house, by the prisoner's desire, to ask if Hardwick had left any cases there for Dynan. The landlord said he had, and Dynan had fetched them that evening. In about a minute Hesketh went in and brought Hardwick out - he said he knew nothing about them. The landlord then came to the door, and said he had never told me a word of the sort.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The prisoner was bailed. - A. Yes; and attended on the three following days at Bow-street, and accompanied us to different places to find Hardwick. Prichard's is a flash house.</p>

            . I keep the Coach and Horses, public-house, Belton-street. Hardwick is frequently at my house. I never saw him with any medicine chests in my life - he never left any at my house, or said anything to me about medicine chests or cases.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell the constable so. - A. It is his mistake. He asked if Dynan had fetched any away - I said yes; Dynan had left them at my house, tied in a handkerchief. I have frequently seen Dynan and Hardwick together. I said Dynan had left two boxes - he left one on the 22d, and one on the 23d - a little girl left the other. I was to take care of them for Dynan. When he left the first, he said he would call in a few hours for it, but he did not till the 23d, about three o'clock in the afternoon. Hardwick was never near them. I never spoke to him about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182401140014"></xptr>them. The constable did not mention Hardwick's name to me, to my knowledge - I was busy serving in the bar. We did not talk together in the passage, only in the bar, so that anybody could hear. He said nothing about the boxes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Then you mean to swear that the constable is mistaken, in saying that you said Hardwick had left them. - A. I swear positively that I did not say so. I might have spoken to Hardwick in the passage, but I had no private conversation with him. I have had dealings with him - I have lent him money - I owe him 4 l. now. I never appeared here to prove an alibi. I was here twenty years ago, to give a man a character.</p>

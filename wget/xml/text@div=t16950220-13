               counterfeiting and making several Halfcrowns, which were of false and counterfeit Metal
            </rs>. The Evidence for the King swore, that the Prisoner's house being searched near Hidepark, there was found in the Cellar a pair of Flasks, some Shears, melting Pots, Files and Crucibles, with all other convenient Utensils, fit for the Trade of Coining, besides several pieces of false money; all which were brought into Court, and shewed to the Jury. The Prisoner was found in the house alone, and no one else; and there was a Fire-place where there had been a Fire lately made, for the Bricks were even hot when they came into the Room, and in the house there was several pieces of false Metal found. There was a stranger who was wont to frequent the house, who was suspected to be a great Clipper, &amp;c. and an Associate of the Prisoners, but he is fled, and not yet taken. The Prisoner said, when first apprehended, that he had let the Room to one Baldwin, but could not produce him. He denied all the matter of Fact, and said that he knew nothing of the matter. So he did at the Tryal, saying Baldwin had taken the Room of him, and what he did there he knew not; neither could he tell where he was, nor the stranger, and denied that he knew him. But the King's Witnesses swore, that he barr'd the Door against them, and stuft the Key-hole with old Rags, denying them entrance at first. He disown'd all that was swore against him. Being asked what Trade he was? Answered, that he bought Hair, and was a <rs id="t16950220-13-deflabel49" type="occupation">Peruke maker</rs>

He said that being afraid of being Arrested, made him so timorous. The Evidence was not so clear, as to satisfy the Gentlemen of the Jury that he was guilty, so he was <rs id="t16950220-13-verdict50" type="verdictDescription">

On the 2nd Dec., I met the prisoner at King's Head-hill, in the parish of Chingford, about three quarters of a mile from Hawk Wood—he had this oak post with him—I stopped him, and asked him where he got it from; he said, he picked it up on the stub ground as he came along—I asked him whose property it was; he said, it belonged to the lord of the manor—I asked him, who gave him leave to take it; he said, No one—he said, he knew he had done wrong, but if I would allow him to take it back again, he would never take any more.</p>

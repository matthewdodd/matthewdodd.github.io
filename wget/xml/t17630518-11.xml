            . I went to Smithfield, and saw the prisoner on this horse; I took him by the leg and the horse by the bridle, and asked the prisoner how he came by him? He said, he had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176305180008"></xptr> him of a man at the lower end of the market: I took him to the Bell inn, and sent for a constable. I asked him if he knew the man he had him of; he said he did not; he was carried to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he offer to sell him?</p>
               <p>Dendy. I do not know that he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say that it was his own horse?</p>
               <p>Dendy. Not as I heard. Before my Lord-Mayor the next morning he made another sort of a story, but I cannot tell what very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how do you know that it was another sort of a story?</p>
               <p>Dendy. He said he had him of a man at Epsom, who gave him a shilling to ride him to market.</p>

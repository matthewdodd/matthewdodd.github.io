                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, V</hi> 215). On 5th June, about a quarter past 8 o'clock, I was on Putney-heath and saw the prisoner there, in the furze, near the centre part of the heath, just opposite Ashburton-house (<hi rend="italic">looking at a plan produced on the part of the prisoner</hi>)—this plan is not right; the two witnesses are not in it—the prisoner was within about seventy yards of the Roehampton-road—I know the houses of Mr. Hedges and Mr. Harris; he was within about two hundred yards of their houses—there are three roads, one leading to Roehampton, one leading to the Kingston-road, and the Kingston-road—we call it the centre of the heath—it was light enough to see—he was then in the furze—there was no other person in the furze, that I could see, except the prisoner—I saw him stoop down, and then saw him rise up, and flames of fire rise up at the same time—he ran away from it—he came in the direction of me towards Putney-hill, and towards the Green Man—I was between the Green Man and the fire—he saw me, and then turned to the left and went in the direction of Putney Park-lane—he walked very quickly.</p>

               <p>directly he rose up again the flames broke forth, a strong body of flame; this was between 200 and 300 yards from the prisoner's house—I never knew that he kept geese on the common—he never told me that he had been looking for his geese—I heard him say so next day, but not that night—after the flame broke out he came in the direction of the Green Man, towards me—I was near the Roehampton-road, which leads to Putney-bridge—I was coming from the Green Man—he came towards me for a few yards, till he caught sight of me, and then he turned, and went towards Putney Park-lane—I came up to him just opposite to the next house to Ashburton House—there is a pond there; he did not come up to that; it was 200 yards from the pond—I had passed the pond—the road he lives in is at an angle of the common—I do not know that he keeps geese, but I have been informed since that he does—it has been customary with those who live on the common to keep geese—I had laid hold of him at the time; he said, "Don't be too hard on me"—I laid hold of the cuff of his coat—I did not tear it that I know of—it was not after I had seized him that he said, "Don't be so hard with me, I will go quietly;" it was when I put my hand on his shoulder—it was after he asked me to let him go that I put my hand upon his wrist—I swear that—I did not seize him violently by the coat and tear it; and it was not then that he said, "Don't be too hard upon me, I will go quietly"—it was two or three minutes afterwards that he made use of the expression about lighting his pipe; we were on the road to the Green Man—we did not meet anyone on our way; we passed two parties, but they were standing still—I know a person named Dench; he came out of the Green Man, and called to us to stop; he was not smoking a pipe—he had a pipe with him; I do not know whether it was in his hand, or where it was—I afterwards saw him take it out of his pocket, to let the prisoner have a smoke—he asked him to do so, and he did smoke; it was not then that he said if he had had a pipe with him it might have fallen among the furze, it was before we got to the Green Man, before we saw Dench—what he said was, "I might have been coming down there and lighting my pipe, but I do not say that I <hi rend="italic">do</hi> do so"—he said that just before we got to the pond—there were two women there, they were closer to him than I was—it was light, it was about a quarter past 8 o'clock—the furze is high in some places; on the left of where it was set on fire it is high, on the right it is low—it was about three feet or three and a half feet high where I saw the flames bursting out—this was Whit Monday—there were not many holiday people about, the place was very clear at that time—I had not seen many about that day.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the prisoner say anything about looking for geese until the next day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not in my presence—I saw no gentleman throw away any cigar at the time the prisoner was there—I saw no one but the prisoner in the furze at the time the flames burst out—there were two men standing in the Roehampton-road talking; they were about 200 yards from the furze—the prisoner was not a minute stooping down—he did not look in any other place than the place where the fire broke out that I saw—he did not search any other place—Dench was not near the place where the fire broke out—when I first saw the prisoner he was coming in a direction from his own house—I saw him at a distance of about twenty yards before he got to the place where he stooped down; that was the first I saw of him; there are a great many trees about—I saw him stoop down and rise up again, then the flames came, and he came towards me.</p>

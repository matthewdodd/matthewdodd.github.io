                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Frederick Hart, a brandy-mer<lb></lb>chant, No. 64, Lower Thames-street. In Jan. last we had an order from a customer in the country for a cask of brandy, which order we executed on the 15th of Jan.—we employ Mr. Ayrst as a carrier to bring the brandy from the docks to our cellar, and afterwards to take it to the place to which it was to be sent—Scott was the carman of Mr. Ayrst—the brandy is brought from the docks to our door, to be sampled—the instructions were given to Ayrst to fetch the brandy—I did not give them—I afterwards saw Scott on the pre<lb></lb>mises—I did not see the sample taken from the brandy; that was the duty of Smith, the cellarman—I did not see the brandy go from the premises—I know it was at the door—I did not examine the cask till the following morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carrier; Scott was in my employ in Jan last. In the course of that month I received an order from Mr. Hart to bring some brandy from the docks to his door, and then to the docks again, to go to Newark—I employed Scott on that occasion—I saw the hogshead of brandy in the cart some time after it came from the docks—Scott was then with it—another of my men was standing close by the cart, but Scott was in charge of it—I did not examine the cask to see if there were any holes in it—Scott was standing by the side of the cart for some little time after it came from the dock, until the cask was sampled, and the order given to take it away to its destination—it was sampled at Mr. Hart's door.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable, No.</hi> 516.) On the night of the 15th of Jan., about seven o'clock, I saw a cart in Lower Thames-street—Scott was with it, and Edward Dawson was with him—Lower Thames-street is in a direction between Mr. Hart's and Jolly's warehouse—when I first saw them the cart was standing at Mr. Hart's door—Dawson was not speaking to Scott against the door, but some short distance away from it—I watched the cart when it went on, and Scott with it—I did not see Edward Dawson then—I went round and met the cart at the top of Fish-street-hill—Scott was then in the cart, driving, and another man was sitting down in the bottom of the cart, who turned out to be James Dawson, who is the father of Edward—I followed the cart into Lombard-street—I stopped there for a moment, and Edward Dawson came past me—he was going in the same direction as the cart was going—it was then on ahead—he saw me, and turned in a different road—I stopped and searched him, but found nothing on him—he then went away—I followed the cart into London-wall—I there got another officer, went and stopped the cart, and got up into it—Scott and James Dawson were then in the cart—I found in it a hogshead of brandy and a pipe of wine—I asked them what they had got there—they made no reply—I felt towards the top part of the cart, and there found a wooden spile, or peg, in the cask of brandy—I felt down towards the bottom of the cart, and found this bladder of brandy lying in the bottom of the cart, and this tin pipe was in a hole that was made in the brandy-cask—it was necessary that there should be a hole at the top of the cask, to give it vent—I then told Scott to drive to the sta<lb></lb>tion, which he did—I there searched him, and found this hammer in his pocket—Scott said, "I have only got this hammer; it belongs to him," pointing to James Dawson—Dawson could hear that—he said nothing to it—I afterwards went back to the place where I had stopped the cart—I searched about there, and found these two gimlets in the road, and these four wooden spiles—one gimlet is large, and the other small—the large one is about the size of the tin tube that fits the bladder, and the small one is the size of the place where the spile was—I compared the two with the two holes, and found them to correspond—I afterwards showed the same cask to Vale—I had seen Edward Dawson that day, but not in company with Scott—it was about the middle of the day.</p>

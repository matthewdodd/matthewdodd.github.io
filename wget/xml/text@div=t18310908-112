On the 13th of June, in the evening. I observed his coat hanging up, and having frequently missed property, I examined it, and found in it a quantity of incomplete gloves, which had been stolen from me - the prisoner afterwards returned to the warehouse; I told him he might leave for the evening - I followed him down stairs; on his getting out I called him back, and requested to inspect his pockets, in which I discovered the materials for three pairs of gloves - I asked him whose they were; he said they were mine, but it was the first offence he had been guilty of - I promised him forgiveness if he told me the whole truth, but he said that was his first offence; I requested the keys of his boxes, and gave him in charge - he delivered three keys to me; I asked him again, in the officer's presence, if that was his only offence - I went with Henman, the officer, to his lodgings, in a court leading from Farringdon-street to Snow-hill, and searched his drawers; I saw the officer apply the keys to the drawers, and in them he found upwards of three dozen' pairs of unmade leather gloves - there were four hundred and odd pieces, worth at least 3l.; I returned to my house, where the prisoner had been left in custody - the officer produced to him one of the three keys he had given me, and asked how he got possession of that key; he said he had found it - it was afterwards applied to a chest of drawers in my house, which contained clothes, and opened all the drawers in that chest; after he was in custody I went to Giltspur-street prison - I did not hold out any threat or promise to him; I said I was sorry to find a person in whom I had placed such confidence had committed such a breach, and was sorry I had not an opportunity of finding the receiver - he said he had been induced to steal the property from me, to support himself when out of employ.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you charge him before the Lord Mayor with stealing the leather contained in this indictment? A. I charged him first with stealing three pairs of gloves - this charge was made before the last Session; I gave my evidence before the Grand Jury in a general way, on the indictment for the three pairs of gloves - I stated the whole of the thefts to them, and understood I was dismissed; I did not go before them on the other indictment - he was tried for the gloves last Session, and discharged; I ordered the officer to detain him, and take him before the Lord Mayor on this charge; I found the pair of gloves named in this indictment at his lodgings, and I believe I named that before the Lord Mayor - he was tried last Session for those found in his coat; my servant on that trial swore he believed the marks on the tranks to be his, but he would not positively swear it was his mark; I positively swore it was his mark - he was admitted to bail after being detained; I have been to him once in prison since the last Session, and asked if he had been set at liberty on the Saturday, whether he meant to remain in town or go into the country - my motive was to know if I should rid myself of a person who had committed such extensive depredations on me; I should have persisted in this charge if he had gone into the country; he was a good workman; I produced a bit of ribbon before the Lord Mayor, but did not prefer a charge against him for that - I know the leather found to be mine; they have the marks of two of my men, King and another, on them.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. You gave before the Grand Jury last time a general account of what you had lost, did you suppose you had given all the evidence required? A. I did; I did not mean to abstain from evidence on the other charges on any consideration; it was entirely an error on my part that I did not go before the Grand Jury on the other bills; finding they were ignored, I had him taken before a Magistrate, and stated the circumstance - he was bailed.</p>

            . I am a constable. I accompanied Mr. Watts to the prisoner's lodgings with three keys, which Mr. Watts gave me; I produced the keys to the prisoner, and asked him what they were; he said two of them belonged to his trunks, and the other to a drawer at his lodgings - I went to a house kept by Hodson in Sea-coal-lane, on Tuesday the 7th of June, about eight o'clock in the evening - Hodson showed me a chest of drawers, to which I applied two of the keys, and found a quantity of leather, which Mr. Watts identified; before I went I cautioned the prisoner, and told him if he had no more property of Mr. Watts', but the three pairs of gloves, Mr. Watts would fulfil the promise he had made, (as Mr. Watts told me he had made him a promise;) he then said there would be no more found, none whatever - there was nothing at his lodging, I might go and see; I did so, and found these thirty-eight pair of tranks, and a pair of made-up gloves; there was but one box and one drawer, at the prisoner's lodgings; I could find no use for the third key - I returned to Mr. Watts' house, and said to the prisoner, "You have stated wrong, you have not got two boxes" - he said,"I never said I had" - I said, "You did, what is the use of this key?" he said he had no use for it, that he had found it - he had told me two keys would open his boxes, and one his drawer; I applied the key he said he had found to a chest of drawers at Mr. Watts' house - it opened the whole of them.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. How do you know the lodging to be the prisoner's? A. He informed me he lodged there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the key fit the place the gloves were kept in? A. No; he told me I should find no property whatever of Mr. Watts' at his lodging.</p>
               <p>MR. WATTS. I know this leather to be my property; here is the mark made by the cutter, which I know perfectly well - there are two marks; I lost as many tranks as I found at the prisoner's lodging - there are the cutter's initials on the tranks; there is no mark on this pair of gloves, but I am certain they are mine - the prisoner was never a cutter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are all the tranks in the same state of manufacture? A. Yes, the marks are scraped out of some of them; here is a pair I have no doubt have been defaced - here is another with a K. on it, and something more; here is another mark of another cutter - King is the first cutter; his Christian name is John, I believe.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. On this pair here is a K., has that been attempted to be erased? A. I cannot think how it could<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080061"></xptr>be in this state, unless it had; King had been in my sole employ for about nine months.</p>

            . I was in Mr. Watts' service about six or seven weeks ago, as a cutter - I should not know my marks on the gloves, not to speak positively to them; (looking at a pair) I could not swear this is my mark.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. On your oath, do you believe that it is your mark? A. Why, it is like it; I believe it to be mine, to the best of my belief it is; it is the K. as I used to mark it, when employed by Mr. Watts.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You have left Mr. Watts six or seven weeks, that must have been after this second charge was made? A. Yes; I was before the Lord Mayor six times about this, but not examined.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Why did you leave Mr. Watts' employ? A.Because I received great insults from him, through not swearing to the mark at the last trial.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you not state to the officer, before the prisoner was charged with any offence, that you would swear to the marks on the gloves? A. I never did.</p>

The bills were all charged in the usual way, and made out to the amount given out in these bills to about two or three thousand pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give a bank post bill to your clerk - A. I was not present at the time.</p>

            . Q. Are you clerk to Messrs. Grant, Burby, and Company - A I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember in April, 1812, making up a parcel for London, containing bank notes - A. I know a parcel was made up the evening of April the 11th. I did not make up the parcel. The parcel was made up in my presence, by another clerk, a Mr. Barrs, who usually makes up the parcels.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there in that parcel a bank post bill of fifty pounds - A. I have no doubt it was. That bill passed through my hands for the purpose of being put into that parcel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hand that bill to Mr. Barrs, in order for him to put it in that parcel - A. I am not positive whether I handed it or the partner. It is generally handed by one from him or by me.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that bill - A. This is the bill that passed through my hands; here is my endorsement; it passed through my hands on the 11th of April, 1812, it was handed to me by the partner for the purpose of endorsing it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you see any body for Grant and Burby endorse that bill - A. I cannot say that I saw the gentleman, the partner, endorse it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is their endorsement on it - A. No, there is not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. Was that bill in your possession on the 11th of April, in possession of the house of Grant and Company - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that bill endorsed by them to your knowledge - A. It has my writing on it, and I handed it to the gentleman, the partner. It has the writing of the firm of the house now.</p>
               <p>COURT. It has your writing on it - A It has. I have written,</p>
               <p>"pay Grant, Burby, and Company." That is my writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever endorse bills for Grant, Burby, and Company - A. No, I do not. I have not a procuration.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. When you wrote that upon that bill what did you do with it - A. I made it payable to the house of Ladbroke and Company. That is taken out by appearance now. They are always endorsed to Ladbroke and Company. I have no doubt it was upon that occasion.</p>

               <p>Q. Is there any number upon it, or anything to denote in what order it was in your house - A. Yes, 4780 the number in our books.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got these books here - A. No. This is the hand-writing of a clerk in the office, who copied the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of some intelligence you received did you issue some advertisements in London - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. The number, 4780, is the hand-writing of a clerk of yours at Portsmouth - A. Yes. The number 4780 upon the bill is the hand-writing of Mr. Green, the clerk.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw this bank post-bill either upon the 11th or 12th - A. I saw it in the custody of Grant and Co. upon the 11th.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, look upon it, and say whether you saw the number 4780, when you handed it over to the clerk - A. I have no doubt but I did. When I handed it over to the clerk I saw the number. I have examined it by the bill-book; it agrees in other respects, my name and Macklean.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Dismiss from your mind all considerations of the book, and attend to the question. Do you distinctly remember, independent of the book, that on the 11th of April last year, there went through your hands a fifty pounds bank bill without reference to your books - A. I cannot undertake to say so far as that.</p>
               <p>Q. I scarce need ask you, as you cannot recollect that a fifty pound bank bill went through your hands; whether, independent of your books, you have recollection of any number or date upon such a bank post bill - A. I remember that there was a fifty pound bank bill passed through my hands that day, certainly, by reference at the moment. I recollect that.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether you now recollect that a fifty pound bank post bill passed through your hands except from reference to your books - A. I do not say that I can say as far as that.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you look at that bill, and tell me whether you find any writing of your own indicating that went through your hands on the 11th of April, 1812 - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, what do you find that indicates that it was in your hands that day - A. I find the words,</p>
               <p>"Grant, Burby, and Company, or order."</p>
               <p>COURT. Is it your practice to put that kind of constructive endorsement upon it the day before it is sent to London - A. Only on those days that we charge it to be sent to London.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Do you not very frequent upon bank post bills write</p>
               <p>"pay Grant, Burby, and Company, or order" - A. It has been done.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not often done it - A. Yes, it has been done.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181306020020"></xptr>Q. Now, sir, will you shew me anything that indicates to be written upon the 11th of April, 1812 - The number being in our book.</p>
               <p>Q. You are to dismiss anything from your mind in your books, which we cannot take. You told me you found something in your own hand-writing in that bill. How do you know that was written in your hand in April last year. What is there in the entry,</p>
               <p>"pay Grant, Burby, and Company," which is written without any date, to enable you to say it was written on that day - A. The number of the bill in our book. I can trace it no other way.</p>
               <p>Q.Now, sir, what is there in this endorsement unconnected with your book at Portsmouth, that leads you to say it was done on April the 11th, 1812 - A. That being there.</p>
               <p>Q. You have written on other bills the same - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This endorsement is without date, except assisted by your books you cannot say, and which we cannot look at. I find that enables you to say it was written on that day - A. If the bill was put into my hands at this distance of time I could not without reference to the books.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lockhart. Q. You live with Grant, Burby, and Co. - A. I do, and have access to their books.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing you had gone away, and lived with any other merchant, and such bill had been put into your hand, could you have ventured to recollect it without reference to your books - A. No, I could not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. How soon after the 11th of April, was your particular attention called to the subject of a bank post bill - A. We had an account on the 13th, in the evening, of a bank post bill being missing on the following morning. I knew it at that time, my attention was turned to the circumstance of a bank post bill being missed. That bank post bill had passed through my hands on the preceding Saturday. I then recollected it by reference to the books, I recollected it.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time your attention was called to it - A. Yes, and I recollected that it had passed through my hands.</p>
               <p>COURT. Without the assistance of the book - A. Yes; I knew it was a fifty pound bank bill, because it came in on the Saturday, and I remembered how it was disposed of.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you remembered a bank post bill by something particular attending it coming into your house; was that the bank bill that you handed to Mr. Grant to endorse - A. Yes, certainly. I handed it to Mr. Grant for his signature; and my memory was particularly called to it on the Tuesday. I particularly remember the bank post bill passing through my hands. If that bill was put into my hands a month afterwards I could not say that without reference to the books.</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you known Brady - A. About two years latterly. I knew him some years previous.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Birkett - A. About two years or rather more.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not ask you particularly. You have been concerned with a great number of persons in robberies and forgeries - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. And I think you stated upon those occasions the number of offences such as I have described were so great that you cannot tell the number of them - A. I will not be bound to answer that question unless the Court commands.</p>
               <p>Q. Some time in April, 1812, did either of the prisoners make application to you - A. They did. Brady made application to me about the month of November, I should think. He told me that the Portsmouth mail had been robbed, and he thought he could procure me the property. The property afterwards was sent to my house.</p>
               <p>COURT. What was the expression - A. That the Portsmouth mail had been robbed; that he could procure me the property. He said, it consisted of a great number of half bank notes, among other property.</p>
               <p>Q. What other property did he describe - A. Bills of exchange, and halves of bank post bills, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any whole - A. I believe there was. I received a parcel containing a great quantity of property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say how the mail had been robbed - A. He said the parcel had been stolen from the mail; he did not say by whom. I inferred by whom from the conversation.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. Never mind what you inferred. In consequence of receiving this parcel did you see him again - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that paper, and see if you can remember that - A. There was a bank post bill, which I believe to be this bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Brady and you any conversation what should be done with that bill - A. We had. It was agreed that some of the property should be taken to James Cook. This bill I reserved myself, and took it to Birkett with other notes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was there any other bank post bill - A. Not that I know of, whole. I told him I should take the bill to Birkett, for Birkett to extract the endorsement.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any memory what the endorsement was that was to be extracted - A. I think it was Ladbroke and Company, and Grant, Burby, and Company. It was known to both of us that Birkett could extract these things. It was merely suggested at the time to shew it to Birkett, and to take his opinion on it, as to the endorsement whether it should be extracted or not. I should think that was the case, and what was proper to be done with it for the purpose of negotiation. I accordingly took it to Birkett, at his house, No, 1, Riley-street, Chelsea. I saw Birkett; he said he would extract it. I left it with him for that purpose; he afterwards produce the bill to me, with the endorsement extracted, some days afterwards, with the old endorsement taken out. This was at his own house in Riley-street. The old endorsement was taken out; I think a blank endorsement was substituted to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had made that - A. Birkett I should suppose. I did not see him do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181306020021"></xptr>Q. By blank endorsement do you mean any name put on. By whom was it done - A. By Birkett, I should suppose. I did not see him do it; some name was put: I do not recollect it. There is another I believe on it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. Look at the bill. What has been altered upon it - A. I can speak positively the name of Ladbroker is extracted, Grant and Burby remains.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not the original Grant and Burby - A. I think it is. I am not positive it is.</p>
               <p>Q. He delivered it into your hands, with the alterations he made upon it - A. He did. That alteration was such as it now appears. He told me he would pay 
               <persName id="t18130602-53-person395">Brady</persName>
             a consideration for the bill. He admitted he had altered the bill, and he had paid Brady twenty-five pounds for this bill; twenty-five or thirty pounds. I think it was twenty-five.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see Brady upon that subject - A. They had one meeting at my house, in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q.Where was your house - A.Winterton-place, Chelsea.</p>
               <p>Q. Was anything said respecting this bill - A.There was a conversation ensued, but they did not come to any agreement at that time. Birkett told me afterwards that he had paid this.</p>
               <p>Q.Was this bill particularly named in this conversation - A. That bill and other property was named; they did not agree at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that bill ever again produced from Birkett - A. When it was produced to me with the alteration I delivered it again to Birkett, and accompanied Birkett to a person of the name of Stanley.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you and Birkett and Stanley meet - A. I think in St. James's park. It was delivered to Stanley with other notes by Birkett, for Stanley to negotiate that and other property.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any knowledge from Birkett what became of that bank post bill afterwards - A. Birkett informed me it was paid away.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you about this time frequent occasion to be in company with Birkett - A. I had. I met him sometimes at the Man in the Moon, King's-road, Chelsea, a house kept by a man of the name of Clark, I believe. I met him upon this and other business.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you heard from Birkett that this bank post bill had been parted with; tell me the whole he said - A. Birkett told me, in company with Stanley, the bill was paid away with other notes to a Mr. Miller, a silversmith, in Whitechapel, for foreign gold; doubloons and other gold coin.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lockhart. We have heard the character of you; have you been convicted before now and transported - A. I have.</p>

He gave his name, Captain Henry Hunter. He paid in Bank of England notes that were joined, and a fifty pound bank post bill among them. I objected to the bill at first. I said I would rather have a bank note; he said he had received it in a remittance from Liverpool among other notes; he had no doubt it was regular; upon which I examined the endorsements, and found they were regular, apparently. I afterwards in consequence of what passed took the bill; I looked at it very particular; that is the same bill; I paid it away with the other notes.</p>

               <p>Birkett's Defence. May it please your lordship, gentlemen of the jury, the charge for which I stand before you is such which precludes me any defence. It is a charge of enormity. It is only to be defended by my appealing to my maker, and solemnly to you that I am innocent.</p>
               <p>My lord, and gentlemen, this is not a charge of a robbery on a certain day, where I might prove my innocence. It is a charge of forgery, stated to be committed in April, a twelvemonth ago; were you gentlemen to be charged with forgeries of a twelvemonth ago, what could you say, you could only plead your innocence; what is to be expected from me, more than solemnly declaring before this court, that I am not guilty of any charge in this indictment, Gentlemen, the proof of guilt to any criminal must be established by the testimony of many persons, whose testimony cannot be doubted, before you are called upon to say whether I am guilty or not. Who is Richardson? Is he a man whose testimony cannot be doubted? He is a man who has been convicted at this bar; whose life has been forfeited a thousand times. This man tells you he brought the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181306020022"></xptr>bank post bill to my house to get the signatures eradicated; he might as well say he took it to his lordship. It is from these circumstances my innocence must be drawn. The circumstances are, that Sunday the 12th, or 13th, of April, 1812, a robbery was committed on the Portsmouth mail, and bills of exchange, and bank post bills to the amount of two or three thousand pounds were obtained. Gentlemen, it is acknowledged by Richardson, that as soon as he was in possession of the property he immediately took the same to Cook, his accomplice, who has acknowledged in his deposition before the magistrate at Bow-street office, that he extracted the above endorsements out of all the bills, after they were so extracted they sent to the bankers for payment. Now, gentleman, is it to be credited that Cook and Richardson extracted the above endorsements out of all the bills the day they were stolen, and then to bring this one to my house. Gentlemen, if such testimony is to be credited in a court of justice and such a man as Richardson is to be believed whose life has been forfeited a hundred times, it is better for a man to turn an assassin for an act in this way, no man could be safe in his bed, but he would be liable the next morning he rises of being charged with a forgery. Gentleman, let me remind you of Lieutenant Johnson; he was a man who impeached two innocent lives in order to save his own. Gentlemen, guilt ought to be so clearly established that every by-stander could not entertain a doubt of it. My lord, and gentlemen, I put my case into your hands, and commit myself to your reflection.</p>
               <p>Brady's Defence. I know not why I am coupled with this man, any other man might be guilty; I know nothing of the robbery, therefore I can offer no defence.</p>

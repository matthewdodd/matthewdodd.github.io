                  </hi>. I am a labourer. On the 11th of May I was at work on board the <hi rend="italic">Duke of Cambridge</hi> steamer on the river Thames, off Alderman's stairs, on the Middlesex side, near St. Katherine's Dock—she had brought passengers and a cargo from Cork—the deceased was one of the labooren employed at work on board, discharging the cargo—near seven o'clock, after we had finished, the waterman who was employed by the Company, was not in attendance to put us ashore—the <hi rend="italic">Duke of Cornwall</hi>, another steam-packet, was lying alongside—we crossed over the <hi rend="italic">Duke of Cornwall</hi> to get inside, that we might get the chance of getting into a boat to go ashore—we got on to a deck barge that was moored alongside the <hi rend="italic">Duke of Cornwall</hi>, when we perceived Buckley, one of the men who was at work with us, had got ashore in a boat—we hallooed out to him to bring off the boat to us, that we might get ashore also—Buckley brought off the boat to us, and we got into her—there was then about twelve of us together, and a boy—Lynn, the shipwright,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184306120031"></xptr>
               <p>who had charge of the boat, objected to our getting into the boat—one of the men told him what a long time we were there, that we had not had dinner, that as our boat was not there, we had no other way of getting ashore, and then he allowed us to get into the boat—it was a good-sized boat, what is called a ship's boat—after we had got into the boat I saw the prisoner come to the fore gangway of the <hi rend="italic">Duke of Cornwall</hi>, and call out to Davis, one of the men who was standing in the stern of the boat, to come out of the boat—I did not hear Davis make any reply—the prisoner then jumped down out of the fore gangway on to the deck barge, and said, "You b----s, I will show you the way [or the road] ashore"—he immediately leapt off the barge in among us, and the boat was upset—the force with which he came into the boat sank it, we were all precipitated into the water—I and some of the others swam ashore, others were picked up by the watermen, and Matthew Holland and John Buckley were drowned—I afterwards saw the body of Holland, when it was taken out of the river—I knew the prisoner before—he was acting as second mate on board the <hi rend="italic">Duke of Cornwall.</hi>

A.</hi> Yes; I and others were at work, discharging the cargo of the <hi rend="italic">Duke of Cambridge</hi>—Lynn at first said we should not have the boat—he did not say that he should be fined, nor cry out two or three times to us—I was not the principal man in taking away the boat—I should think seven men were in the boat at the time I got in—I did not threaten to pitch Lynn overboard if he interfered, nor did I hear any one say so—Lynn spoke to us about not taking the boat before the prisoner made his appearance—he spoke loud enough for us to hear—he had no occasion to call out loudly, for he was right alongside of us—Lynn had left the <hi rend="italic">Duke of Cornwall</hi> at the time the prisoner appeared, and run down on the deck bridge, I think to prevent our taking the boat.</p>

                  </hi>. I was working on board the <hi rend="italic">Duke of Cambridge.</hi> In the evening there was no boat ready to take us ashore—we came across the <hi rend="italic">Duke of Cornwall</hi>, and down on to a barge that was lying alongside—we saw a boat going ashore with two of our mates in her, and two or three other persons—we hallooed out to Buckley, who was one of them, to bring the boat off again, to take us ashore—we were from sixty to eighty feet from the shore—Buckley brought off the boat to us—Lynn told us the boat belonged to his employer, and if we took it ashore, his employer might be fined—I told him we were the persons that generally worked on board, that we would take the boat safe ashore, and leave her there, and there were some of the ship's crew ashore that would bring her off again—with that we got into the boat—Lynn seemed partly satisfied then with our taking the boat—at that time the prisoner appeared at the fore gangway of the <hi rend="italic">Duke of Cornwall</hi>, and called out to Davis not to take the boat away—Davis made no reply—he then jumped from the fore gangway down on the hatches of the barge, and came in a hurried pace across the barge—we were then about three feet away from the side of the barge—he <hi rend="italic">sung</hi> out, "You b----s, I will show you the road</p>

            . I am constable of St. Luke's. About a quarter before five o'clock on Sunday morning, the 9th of September, I saw the prisoner coming along the New-road, by the City-road bridge, with a sack on his back; I stopped him, and asked what he had there - he said five geese, two turkies, and five ducks; that he bought them at Barnet, of a waggoner, about eight o'clock the preceding night, and the waggoner's was name Smith. I asked him what part of London Smith came to - he said he did not come to town. The ducks were then dead; they had been strangled, they were tied round their necks.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. About halfpast nine o'clock, on the 7th of February, I was going up Portpool-lane, and heard a conversation in a public-house - I heard a voice say, "Fred carried off these books in one of the milk-pails, and one was a history of the Church of Christ;" the door then opened, and I heard singing -I then heard a voice say "He has sold them to Mother Davie for half a crown;" I made inquiry, and found where the books came from - I inquired who brought milk there; I then went, and took the prisoner - I told him I knew very well the books were at Mother Davie's, and asked what she gave him for them; he said 6s. - I did not then know any thing of these other six books, only the History of the the Church of Christ.</p>

            . I live in Baldwin's-gardens. On the 7th of February the prisoner came, and asked if I would buy some books - I said, "Where are they?" he said outside the door - I got up, and saw him take the books from a very decent young man; he brought them to me, and said they were that young man's books, but there being one volume wanting he could not pawn them; I paid him 4s. for them, and gave him 3d. for himself - these are the four books; on the Friday he brought these other six books, and I bought them for 4s. - I have known him from a child, and his father and mother; I knew he was in the milk trade, but I never had any transaction with him before.</p>

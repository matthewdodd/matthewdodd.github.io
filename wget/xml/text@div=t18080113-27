            . Q. You are a pawnbroker. - A. I am, I live at 134, St. Martin's-lane. On Wednesday the 30th of December the prisoner came to my house between eleven and twelve; he brought three silver desert spoons, on one of the spoons was the letter S, he had a decent appearance then; he asked me to lend him one pound; I weighed them and offered him fifteen shillings; he said that his mother gave them to him, and that he was going to be married. When he gave me the name of Matthews, I told him that was not the name on the spoons; he said his mother gave them to him, I need not be the least apprehensive but that they were his own.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the real value of them. - A. They are worth twenty shillings; I gave him a duplicate. I went to the office from the information of my son; I did not see the prisoner then, he was sent to Tothill Fields. On the Thursday following I went up to the office again, finding the prisoner there; I knew him directly. The officer had some more plate of the same description and the same letter.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you at any time see the prisoner at the bar. A. On the morning of the 30th of December, between the hours of twelve and one, he came to Mr. Winfield's shop, and offered these two table spoons to pledge; they are marked with a crest corresponding to some of the others.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he pawn them. - A. No, I did not take them in; I asked him if they were his own, he said yes; I asked him a second time if they were his own, he said no, they were his mother's; I then asked him what they cost, he did not know; I asked him if his mother could come herself, he said yes, she should come; upon that he went out of the shop, leaving the spoons.</p>

            . Q. You are a pawnbroker, No. 92, St. Martin's-lane. - A. I am. On the morning of the 30th of December, about twelve o'clock, the prisoner offered me a silver sauce ladle, he asked me twelve shillings on it. From his appearance, and the questions I asked him, I immediately suspected they were stolen; I went round to the place he was in and took him into the inner part of the shop and detained him. I sent one of my lads to Bow-street for an officer; the officer found five desert forks on his person, a table fork broken in two, besides the sauce ladle he had offered to me; the sauce ladle is worth about fifteen shillings.</p>
               <p>JOHN PERKS: Q. You are an officer of Bow-street. A. I am; I found the prisoner at Mr. Gordon's house. I searched him, he reluctantly let me search him; on his person I found five desert forks and a four-pronged fork, broken in two pieces.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the ladle. - A. I did, I have had it in my possession. Mr. Gordon wrote his name in the bowl of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of this plate, Mr. Gordon. - A. Two pounds ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. to Read. Look at the desert spoon - first, whose property are they. - A. Mrs. Shum's.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there initials or crest upon them. - A. There is; I am certain they are her property. The others have the initials; these two spoons have the crest; the sauce ladle is Mrs. Shum's. I have not the least doubt of the whole being Mrs. Shum's property.</p>
               <p>Q. You missed them all at the same time. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Bedford-square is in the parish of St. Ann. - A. It is.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to character.</p>

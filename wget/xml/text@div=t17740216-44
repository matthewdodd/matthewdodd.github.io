             . I am a hackney-coachman; on the fourth of January, about four in the afternoon, my coach was called from Aldgate by the prisoner , and a man that he called father: they both got into the coach, and ordered me to drive to the Why-not in Mile End road; there are two Why-not's ; one an old one, the other a new one: the old one has since been altered to the sign of the Globe. I drove to the first, then they told me to go to the further one: when I got there, they directed me to drive down a lane just by that; they ordered me to stop a little way down the lane at a house where one Mr. Milner lives; they went into that house; after they had been there some time the prisoner came out, and asked some of those that were there, whether the key was in the stable door, or the door open; then they went all of them. The prisoner, the father, and one or two others that met at this house, went into a shed adjoining to this dwelling house, they staid there about a quarter of an hour: the prisoner came out first, then the man he called his father came out after him, with a sack on his shoulder; he put this sack into the coach. I did not touch the sack, it appeared to me very heavy; when they had put it into the coach, the prisoner and his father got in, and bid me drive to Gravel-Lane, near Radcliff-Highway; and when we got there he bid me drive to Pennington-Street; I got there about five o'clock in the evening; when we got there, a woman came out with a candle, and then this man he called father, and the prisoner, went into that house; as they were taking the sack from the coach to the house I heard it rattle as if there was copper in it; then they paid me my fare and I went away; this sack raised a suspicion ,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177402160029"></xptr> that they were about coining. I went to Justice Sherwood, and gave information of what I had seen. A warrant was granted; I went with Simmonds, Galpin, Forrester and Sharp, about seven or eight in the evening to that same house in Pennington-Street.</p>

             . On the 11th of January, Baker came to Justice Sherwood's and said he suspected he had been carrying some coiners in his coach, therefore we went with a warrant about nine o'clock; I went first to the house in Pennington-street, where the coachman had set the prisoner down; we did not find the prisoner at home; we broke open a room above stairs ; searching the bed in that room, behind the curtains, I found the very bag Baker had described, with the copper in it; I looked into it; in it there were sixteen sheets of copper (a sheet was produced in Court), of a proper thickness to make halfpence; under the bed I found another bag with these dies (producing them); and in the window I found a copper counterfeit halfpenny (producing it).</p>

            . I am clerk to Justice Sherwood; after the information of Baker, I went to Pennington-street: after the others had been at Pennington-street, I and five others went to Bow Common; I told Milner I came to search his house; I found nothing in his house; but in the kitchen I found a window that led into a little shed, another shed than what was spoke of before, that is at the bottom of the house ; I got from that shed through the window in the kitchen, into this little back shed in the yard; there I found a large pair of shears fixed, and some cuttings of copper, ( producing them ); in that back yard I found a hole that made into the back of the other shed; after I had taken the shears into that back shed, I went through this place and saw a door facing it, which I broke open and got into this shed in the front of the house, and there I saw the small engine with a vice that has been produced; and I found a press with a fly, that is it at the door; it is very large and is fit to stamp halfpence; we took all the things away with us .</p>
               <p>Milner . This little back shed in the yard was let to Field and Palmer with the other place where the shears were found; they said they wanted it to put sand in; about a fortnight ago I went to the prisoner in prison; he said I hope you will not hurt me; I desired he would tell me where to find Field; he directed me to Brick-lane; I went there but could not find him.</p>

             . I have been used to the button business; the halfpenny produced is a counterfeit halfpenny; the press at the door which was found at the shed in Bow Common , is such a press as is used in the mint for coining; some of these things that were found under the bed at the prisoner's lodging are dies, some are punches; the punches are to make dies with, because it would be very expensive to engrave every time they wanted to coin; therefore they have a contriyance to soften the die; and with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177402160030"></xptr> these punches to strike the impression on the die; when they have got the die thus prepared, they stamp the copper so as to make halfpence with these dies.</p>

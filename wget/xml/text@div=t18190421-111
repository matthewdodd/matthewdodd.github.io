On the 3d of March, I saw the prisoner at the Red House, Lower Thames-street.

After that, he said he had got a 10 l. note, but could not get it changed, and asked me to lend him 3 s. or 4 s., and he would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181904210051"></xptr>give me a 1 l. note as soon as he got change. I understood he was to give it to me in advance for wages - I lent him 4 s., believing what he said. A certificate of my being twenty-one years old was drawn up by Mr. Baraclough, a Custom House officer. Next day I went to inquire after the ship, as he said it was moved down to the Dublin Chain - I could find no such ship. The prisoner was at Harding's public-house, and I gave him in charge. He got 16 s. from me altogether.</p>

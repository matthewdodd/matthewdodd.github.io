                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Jones, and live at the George public-house, Stoney-street, Borough-market. There were two indict<lb></lb>ments against the prisoners—one was tried at the Surrey Sessions, last week; and this indictment has been sent here—on the 20th of November, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, Snooks and Lane came into my house, and called for two three-halfpenny's worth of gin and spruce—Snooks, gave me half-a-sovereign; and I gave him three half-crowns, one shilling, two sixpences, and three-pence in copper in change—Lane then said, "What have you changed?"—Snooks said, "Half-a-sovereign"—Lane</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183512140145"></xptr>
               <p>said, "You need not have done that, I have halfpence enough;" and laid down 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—Snooks said, "I will have my half-sovereign again, if it makes no difference"—I said, "None at all;" and gave it to him—he laid the copper on counter, put the silver into my hand, and went out immediately—I expected it to be the same as I had given him—they both left the house immediately—as they were in the act of leaving the house, Malloy came in—I had not seen him before—he was looking through the window, while I was in the set of giving them change—he could see me give the change—he came in, and called for a halfpenny pipe of tobacco—my niece served him—I observed Snooks had given me a bad half-crown between two good ones—Malloy saw it in my hand—he was close by me, and said what a shame it was for them to give me a bad half-crown, and assisted my husband to fetch one of them back—my husband brought Snooks back, and Malloy assisted in bringing Lane back—I accused Snooks of giving me a bad half-crown—he said it was the same as I gave him—I said it was not, and I would send for a policeman—while I was waiting for the policeman's coming, Snocks said he would give me the half-sovereign back, if I would give him the obange, and let them go—I said I would not let them go till the policeman came—when he came, I stated the case, and gave the bad half-crown into the policeman's hand; but be<lb></lb>fore he came, Malloy requested me to let him look at it, but he refused also—Malloy then said, "Oh, what a rascally bad half-crown that is; any body may see that is a bad one;" and he knocked it out of the policeman's hand on the floor—they all stooped together, and Malloy slipped the half-crown up, put it into his month, and slipped a good half-crown into the policeman's hand, with his right hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am niece of Fanny Jones. I had been on an errand, and on coming up the street I saw Mallow looking through the window—I went in—he followed me and asked me for a pipe of tobacco, when Malloy came in they were against the bar—Malloy saw the bad half-crown and said what a had one it was, that it was a rascally bad one—It was in my aunt's hand, he said, "Allow me to look at it," and pretended to be my aunt's friend—my aunt refused to let him look at it, and said it should not go out of her hands till the policeman came—when the policeman came my aunt gave the half-crown into his hand, and Malloy asked the policeman to let him look at it—the policeman said nothing, and he knocked it out of the policeman's hand—he said it had dropped, he stooped to pick it up, and said, "Here it is"—I did not see it fall, I heard it—he picked it up, and gave one into the policeman's hand—the policeman said it was not the same as he had looked at—Malloy said it was the same—the policeman said it was not, that it was a bad one he had knocked out of his hand, and</p>

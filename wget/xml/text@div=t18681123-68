                  </hi>. I am the widow of the deceased, and live at Mr. Chorley's, 13, Eaton Place, West—the prisoner is my son-in-law, and lived with us for rather more than twelve months—he married ray daughter—he was married from our house—it was against our wishes, but it was with our knowledge—after the marriage they left the house and lived together—they were living together on the 11th October, but the prisoner was in the country with his master then, and my daughter was staying with a Mrs. Harvey, in London—I believe they were on good terms—about 9 o'clock on Sunday night, 11th October, the prisoner came to the house where I and my husband were living in service, 13, Eaton Place—he was under the in<lb></lb>fluence of drink—my husband, myself, and daughter, the coachman, his wife and children, were in the kitchen at the time—the coachman and his family left—I and my daughter were then in the pantry—my husband went to let out the coachman and his family, und then came into the pantry—he told the prisoner he could not stop there, it was Mr. Chorley's parti<lb></lb>cular desire that he was not to stay there, and he must take his things up and be off; and he asked what he intended doing with Fanny, he had never maintained her since she had been his wife—the prisoner replied, "You can take your d——daughter and do what you like with her"—my husband said, "I mean to say, Charles, you are a vagabond"—the prisoner then struck my husband in the eye with his fist; it cut his eye open, and it bled very much—the prisoner immediately put his hand under my husband's cravat and collar, twisted him round, and threw him on his back on the floor by the side of the sink, and fell on him—it is a stone floor, but is covered with carpet—I went as quickly as possible and tried to hold the prisoner's hands—I was not quite on the top of him, but very nearly—I was quite on the floor—I got my hand over his shoulder, and held back his hands to prevent any further mischief—I was rather more lying than kneel<lb></lb>ing—I parted them as soon as I possibly could, and sent my husband in the kitchen and locked the door, and I locked the prisoner in the pantry—my daughter ran out and shortly returned with Mrs. Harvey and the boy—Mr. Harvey went into the kitchen to attend to my husband, and I begged and entreated of the prisoner to go away quietly, as it was a disgrace to a gentleman's house—Mrs. Harvey came back and told him it was very shocking he should serve Mr. Broke so, that he had never done him any</p>

               <p>harm—I don't recollect what answer he made—he kept saying, "Let me out! let me out! I will murder the little b——, I will do for him yet!"—he swore several times, and was very much excited—I went for a policeman, and he persuaded him to go out of the house, and he came back again some time afterwards and demanded his wife—she was not there—he searched the house and was satisfied, and went away—I think he came back a third time that night and wished to have his keys, and wished to know where his wife was—he came again on the morning of the 12th, and asked me to go in and ask my husband to forgive him—I saw him again a night later—he was under the impression we were keeping my daughter from him, and I gave him a letter from her to read, to convince him that it was not so—these two letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), dated 12th and 15th October, are in the pri<lb></lb>soner's writing—my husband complained very much this night after he was injured—I put a mustard-poultice on him next day, and sent for Mr. Wool<lb></lb>mer, a surgeon, but he was out of town—Mr. Neal came on the 15th and saw him—he rallied a little, but not much, after the Monday—he was in bed on Monday, but he got up on Tuesday and lay on the sofa—he took to his bed again on the Wednesday, and did not get up again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at 18, Westbourne Place, Eaton Square—I attended the deceased from the 15th October—I found him in a state of great depression—he had a black eye, and a cut on the nose, and had great difficulty in breathing—I examined him, and had the impression that two ribs were broken—I subsequently made a <hi rend="italic">post<lb></lb>mortem</hi> examination with Mr. Woolmer, and found that three ribs were broken—one penetrating the pleura and entering the lungs—the liver is what is generally called a drunkard's liver—his system generally was bad—the cause of death was congestion of the lungs and brain—the congestion in the lungs was brought on from the penetration of the pleura by the rib—but for that ho might have recovered—being a diseased man he was more liable to be taken away than a healthy person—I should say the ribs were broken by a fall such as I heard described—I don't know whether the rib was broken by the prisoner falling on him, or by the pressure of him and Mrs. Brake together—that might have accelerated it—I can't exactly say what part of the violence broke the ribs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective officer of the City—on Friday, 18th November I took Green into custody at his house in York-street, Stepney, about three or four in the afternoon—I told him I had got instructions to apprehend him for stealing a quantity of sugar-sweepings, the property of his late employers, Messrs. Barber and Co.—I said, 'I shall ask you a few questions, you can please yourself about answering them, how often have you sold sugar-sweepings?"—he said, "Three or four times,"—I said, "Do you mean three or four times previous to the middle of last year, July or August?"—he said, "Yes, the last lot I sold was about July last, they realized about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—that his share was 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and that the other money was divided between Phillips and Holman—he said he had sold the sweepings to Pope by Phillips* order—I took him to the station and he was charged—I took Phillips about 24th November, I think, at his house in Grafton-street, Mile-End—I told him that I had instructions to apprehend him for being concerned with others in stealing a quantity of sugar-sweep<lb></lb>ings, the property of his late employers, Messrs. Barber and Co.—about a week previous to that, in company with Sergeant Huggett, I went to Phillips' house and saw him—I then told him that we were officers and that there had been a very large robbery of sugar at Messrs. Barber and Co.'s warehouse, that we were going to put some questions to him, and that it would entirely depend upon his answers how we should act in the matter—I particularly told him that he had better say the truth or else not answer at all—I then took down his statement in my memorandum book which I have here (reading: "Mr. Saunders was above me—I never sold any sweepings, directly or indirectly—I have known sweepings have been collected—I have seen chips collected—I did not receive 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at any time—I never received any money—in 1851 Mr. James Barber gave me a few sweepings—I have known sweepings go out about four, five, or six years ago to the man who bought Fenning's hogsheads—the money was divided among the whole of us on the floor; previous to June Holman gave me some money, but I do not know what it was for—Green has often tried to sell loaves of sugar to Mr. Ferguson at the Duke of wellington the back of Stepney Church, near</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the employment of the prosecutors—the mode of business is this, when goods are coming in, take, for instance, 1270 loads of sugar coming in on 4th July, 1864—it would be first the duty of the foreman Phillips to see what quantity was coming into the warehouse so as to make allowance for room—he then would appoint a tallyman, a man to tally the sugar into the warehouse from the quay—previous to that it would be weighed by the Custom-house officer, who is one of our clerks, and then tallied into the warehouse by the tallyman—that is for the Customs, for the duty, and for our own protection—Phillips would appoint his tallyman in the warehouse, and he would see the sugars tallied, and if there was any discrepancy between the tally in the warehouse and the tally on the quay, reference would be then made to the tally on the quay—if it agreed it would be put into this book, which we call the stock-book by Green or Holman, the under foremen—we should return a landing account, the landing weight of the sugar to the merchant from the quay—in the event of sugar going out from the warehouse; if a merchant requires fifty loads of sugar he would give a delivery order for it to his carman—the carman would take it into our counting-house, which is on the quay, away from the warehouse, that order would be marked by an authorized clerk,</p>

               <p>who has a counterpart of what is in the warehouses in his book, and given back to the carman, who would be told what particular warehouse to take it into—it would be the duty either of Holman or Green to receive the order in Phillip's warehouse, or, perhaps Phillips would receive the order himself, one of the three—they would then see the goods put into the scale and weighed out, and then loaded into a van—the foreman, whoever he might be, would give what is called a cart note to the carman—it is a sort of receiving note—it describes the ship, the date of the importation, and to whom it is going—whoever delivers it signs that for our firm, and the weight is put on the back—those are the counterfoils of the notes which you have there—the same would be on the counterfoil as on the note—sweepings would not be delivered out of the warehouse without an order from the manager—sugar sweepings would not be in our books, because they are waste—the order from the manager would undoubtedly be in writing—I have been in the service about twelve years—the men were never in my experience permitted to take the sugar sweepings—I never saw Green or Holman on the matter of deficiencies until after the discharge of Green—some two or three weeks after his discharge he called at our office—I said to him, "Do you know anything about sweepings?'—he said, "No, I don't know anything about them"—I said, "Did you never sell any"—he said, "No"—I said, "But you received in July or August 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for your share"—he said, "It is a lie"—I said, "Holman told me so"—I then sent for Holman—when he came Green said, "Yes, there were some sweepings"—I said, "How much did you sell them for?"—he said, "About a shilling a hundredweight"—I turned to Holman and said, "It was more than that they were sold for"—Holman paid, "I think it was 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. but I do not know how much they were sold for; I only had 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for my share"—Green then said, "It might have been five or six shillings"—nothing more was said—in the course of the year 1864 we have had to pay a very great deal to merchants for deficiences in sugar.</p>

Butliffe—I read it—we also store butter at our warehouse; the men there have always been allowed to sell the scrapings—the men in the bacon and pork warehouses have had the scrapings and chips until recently, but that, has been stopped since the prisoners wore given into custody—I think it was about the beginning of July that I told the men to collect the sweepings of the sugar—I told Green and Holman that they were to collect sweepings from that time—I asked them previously whether they had collected any, and they told mo that the sweepings were always thrown on the dust heap—I told them, in future they must collect them and put them in Casks—I told Phillips he might have those cheese-boxes on that occasion, but in future he was not to have any—there was afterwards a little parcel, which ho said was given him by a merchant—they had boon lying there some time and I allowed him to take them away—that was the day before ho was sent away, I think—he had not taken anything till then from the time I spoke to him—I gave my evidence twice before the Lord Mayor—I was asked some questions by Mr. Wontner and Mr. Beard—I think I mentioned about these cheese-boxes first when Mr. Wontner asked me the question—I don't think Phillips was asked about this till a month after he was discharged—I did not tell him I would give him a character—I might have told him I would do what I could for him.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COLLINS</hi>). I am an in<lb></lb>spector of labour at Brewer's-quay—I was above Phillips—I attended daily at his warehouse—I could direct him what to do, and what not to do; in tome things, I did—I was supposed to be his master—I controlled his pro<lb></lb>ceedings when necessary—I have been there between six and seven years—I was not always master over Phillips; I have been to ft year, or not quite, perhaps, not before June, 1863—a man named Owen was his master before then; he was in my position—my duty is to attend round all the ware-houses and see that everything is done properly, and to see that there is no waste in the out-door expenditure; that is, in the ware-houses—I am often in Phillips' warehouse; I might be there perhaps twice in half an hour, and I might not ho there for three-quarters of an hour or an hour—I am not aware where Mr. Owen is now; he has left the employment—I don't know that efforts have been made to find him—the number of loaves broken all depends on the parcels—I have known seventy or eighty loaves broken in a hundred—they are wrapped up in paper, and you can't always tell whether they are broken—I have known as many as seventy or eighty per cent. broken, but very seldom—of course there would be a great deal of waste—a quarter per cent, is a liberal allowance for waste—all the pieces that could be possibly put in would be put in and tied up—the paper is not always broken with the sugar, not in the majority of instances—it is passed up through the hands, and there is no breakage—it depends upon how the sugar is broken whether it would break the paper—a thousand loaves an hour is very quick for packing into the warehouse—it is not often so quick as that; from nine hundred to a thousand would be about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you know at all of any sweepings being sold by Phillip and his men! A. I knew nothing at all about it until this dis<lb></lb>covery took place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You knew nothing of sweepings being taken by the men? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I heard nothing of it until this time—I mean that a quarter per cent. would be the waste after collecting all the pieces and putting thorn in loaves</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186501300104"></xptr>
               <p>and tying them up, making them up as well as we could—the final waste then would be about a quarter per cent.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">to</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">EDWARD SAYRE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You spoke of the sum of 1, 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. being paid for deficiencies; over what period of time did that extend! A. From about May down to about September, 1864—about five or six months on goods imported—what amount of goods were imported during that time I am not in a position to say; these losses were on particular parcels of sugar—the gross weight of those parcels might be 60, 000 tons, or it might be 100, 000—it was a very busy time; it might have been 60, 000 or 70, 000 tons, per<lb></lb>haps about 75, 000—we had a receiving stock of about 2, 000 tons in the warehouse, in and out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are they all foreign sugars? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, all foreign—we only take refined sugar—I don't think there is more waste in them—we have had to pay no deficiencies on British sugars, all on foreign.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know anything about the deficiencies you paid in 1863? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We paid no deficiencies in 1863—previous to that the importa<lb></lb>tion of refined sugar was comparatively small—it was after the reduction of duty that we had to pay the deficiency—the reduction kept the coarser quality out—the class of sugar that came previous to the reduction was of a finer description—we have reason to believe that having a fine class of sugar, it was substituted the one for the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Some of these deficiencies you had to pay for in 1864 might have arisen from sugar that came in 1863? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might have done so—no notice was posted up at all forbidding perquisites; we don't have written rules in our establishment, the men know what the rules are—that was a mistake with regard to the butter-scrapings—I can explain with regard to the bacon-scrapings; in the provision-floor a merchant will have, say 200 barrels of pork, he will want them cleaned and put into merchantable condition; he would have the casks turned out, and all the pieces of beef or pork trimmed—he will then say to the warehouseman, "You may have the pieces, they are no use to me"—that is the merchant's allowance—they are allowed by the merchants—the wharfinger does not have to make up any deficiency or loss.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any arrangement as to what should be done with these sweepings that were swept up from these floors? A. No more than putting them on the dust-heap.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you think that Phillips was acting under the impression that he was entitled to those? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can't say what his impression was—the firm certainly had no knowledge of it; they did not recognise any waste except the merchants' perquisites—if the loss did not exceed a quarter per cent. the merchant did not object—I was associated with the late manager of the firm, and he would never allow anything of the kind in the shape of perquisites—I have spoken to some of the officers in the establishment on the subject of per<lb></lb>quisites—if a new man was engaged he would not be told that no sweepings were allowed to be taken, because to allow perquisites would be giving them a <hi rend="italic">carte blanche</hi> to sell what they liked—the dust on the heap was taken away by the parish contractor.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">J. C. HUNT</hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). For aught I know the sweepings went to the Dust-heap; according to the account I had in June they did.</p>

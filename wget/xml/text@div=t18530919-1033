                  </hi>. I am a soldier in the marines, at Deptford. Between 1 and 2 o'clock on Saturday morning, 18th Sept., I met the prisoner near the Old Dockyard—I did not know her before—I went home with her to a house in Old King-street—I had a silver watch, a guard chain, a neckhand-kerchief, and about 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver—I took my watch out of my fob, and put it in my jacket pocket, and my handkerchief in my cap—I put my jacket under my pillow—we went to bed, I slept about two hours, and then the landlady roused me up, and the prisoner was gone—my jacket was on the chair; I missed my handkerchief, money, watch, and chain—this is my watch and chain (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I am single; I live in this house, and was sleeping in the next room—I heard a noise about two o'clock in the morning, looked through a hole into the next room, and saw the prisoner take the young man's jacket from underneath his head, and some coppers fell out; she picked them up, put her hand in the pocket, and took the watch and a sixpence or shilling, put them in her pocket, and walked down—in a few minutes a gentleman came, knocked at my door, and asked me if I had heard anything, and I told him what I had seen.</p>

                  </hi>, Esq. On the afternoon of the 18th of December, about half-past five o'clock—I was in Drury-lane—I observed the prisoner—I am certain he is the man—I saw a gentleman approaching, and the pri<lb></lb>soner was behind him—I observed him take something from his pocket—I called to the gentleman, and told him he was robbed—the prisoner ran across the road instantly—I ran after him into Short's-gardens, and secured him—he was standing still when I took him—I brought him across the street to the light, and there saw him take a handkerchief from his pocket, and throw it from him—I saw a gentleman pick it up—the prisoner re<lb></lb>sisted when I attempted to take him—he became very violent, and drew out his knife, and said, "I will rip up this b----y <hi rend="italic">snot</hi>"—at the moment the policeman came up—I do not know who the person was from whom the handkerchief was taken—I fancy he did not hear me.</p>

No—I threw you you on the ground, because you threatened to kick my shins—I cannot swear that I saw the knife in his hand, but by his action I am sure he drew it.</p>

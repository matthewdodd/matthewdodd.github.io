He asked me which way I was going and said he would go with me. I told him I was waiting there for a man; when the waiter came back to me we set off together; we walked arm in arm; the prisoner had hold of my left arm and the waiter, Nichols, of my right. I had, in the Lion and Goat alehouse, put my watch into my left-hand coat pocket; having a good many seals to it I thought it would be safest there; when we had walked about thirty yards from the alehouse bench I heard the chain jingle; I put my hand immediately to my pocket, missed it, and told the waiter that my watch was gone, and that the prisoner had robbed me; the prisoner still had hold of my arm. He said what did I mean by accusing him; that he was a gentleman and incapable of such a thing? I said if he would not give it up I would charge the watch with him, which I did. He said he would go to an alehouse to be searched, but as we were going along to the watch-house, going through Grosvenor square, he pretended<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130023"></xptr> to be siek; he leaned against the pallisades; he stooped down and unbuttoned the knee of his breeches; when he had gone a few yards after that the watch-chain struck against one of the people's legs who had hold of him, and the watchman took up the watch; I saw it drop from him at the time; it was a darkish night.</p>
               <p>Was you sober? - I had been drinking but was not so much in liquor but I knew every thing which passed, and the prisoner had I believe been drinking too.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You are a gentleman's servant? - Yes, out of service.</p>
               <p>Did not you spend an evening with the prisoner at the Sunderland-Arms? - No, nor any where else.</p>
               <p>Do you know one Smith? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is he? - A weaver I believe.</p>
               <p>Did not you say he was your attorney? - No.</p>
               <p>You never was at the Sunderland-Arms, nor saw the prisoner there; you never sung songs with him and offered to make it up for twenty guineas, nor say that Smith was your attorney? - I was at that gentleman's house and saw Banbury there.</p>
               <p>Did you sing songs there or not? - Not in his company I am certain I never did.</p>
               <p>Did you sing songs in the house? - I might; when the prisoner was in the house I never did.</p>
               <p>You did not offer to make it up and appoint him to meet you at that house the next day? - I never offered to make it up at all.</p>

               <p>Did you send Smith to Mr. Gillam in Clifford's Inn? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Then all this I am speaking of never existed? - No.</p>
               <p>I will tell you fairly the people are all here who heard this, will you say you did not sing songs with this man, shake hands with him, and offer to make it up for twenty guineas? - I never did.</p>

               <p>I am waiter at the Lion and Goat. On the 4th of July last the prosecutor came to our house with a friend, staid and supped there; about one he desired me to call him a coach. I said I believed there was one at the corner of Bond street. He said he would walk to the corner of the street with me; when he came there there was not one. I said I was going to Whitechapel and if he would stay till I went and got my hat I would go home with him, for he was a little in liquor; the prisoner sat down by him.</p>
               <p>Was he very drunk? - No; he was I believe sober enough to know what he did.</p>
               <p>Sober enough to walk alone? - Yes. I was absent about ten or twelve minutes; when I returned the prisoner was setting upon the bench by him. He said is this the gentleman you was waiting for? Mr. Sowter said yes. He said he was going our way and he would go with him; he took hold of his left arm, I took hold of his right arm; when we had walked twenty or thirty yards Mr. Sowter said my watch is gone; this man has picked my pocket of my watch. I looked round and saw the prisoner's hand go into his left-hand inside pocket, and I heard something like the rattling of a chain; I let go the prosecutor's right arm and took hold of the prisoner's, and desired him to give the gentleman his watch and go about his business. I thought he only took it out of a joke. He said he had not got the watch; he would go to a publick-house and be searched. I told him it was not a time in the morning for publick-houses to be open; that if he went to any house he must go to the watch-house. I asked him several times to give up the watch; he would not. I said I would charge the watch with him; the watchman was coming by the Haunch of Venison; I called to him and gave him charge of him; going up Brook-street we met two patrols; I desired them to aid and assist; they did;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130024"></xptr> before we came to the corner of Grosvenor-square I observed him put his left-hand into his left-hand pocket and take something out and put it into his breeches; I mentioned it to the watchmen at the same time as we were going by the Marquis of Rockingham's house; after that, he said he was sick, he begged leave to cast his stomach; he went to the rails, put his left foot upon the kirb-stones and made as if he was going to vomit into the area; he unbuttoned his breeches knee and shook his leg as if he was going to shake the watch out into the area; I desired the watchmen to take him away, which they did; I then desired one of the watchmen to walk behind him, as we had him on each side; in less than ten or a dozen yards the watch fell out of the knee of his breeches upon the flat stones. The man said the chain touched his leg; I saw him stoop and take something up. He said, here is the watch; and I saw it in his hand.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before? - I have seen him before once or twice; I have been at his shop; he was a tobacconist.</p>
               <p>Was you perfectly sober? - I was not at all in liquor; the prisoner appeared to be a little in liquor.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>How came you not to take the watch away from him instantly? - I did not know whether I had a right to do it.</p>
               <p>It never occurred to you to examine his pocket or breeches or any part of his person for this watch? - I did not know that I had a right to do it.</p>
               <p>Did you feel afterwards in his side pocket? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing there? - A snuff box.</p>
               <p>How can you distinguish the rattling of a chain from the rattling of a snuff box? - I do not know that he had snuff boxes in that pocket; he had five about him; I took it to be the rattling of a chain; he was dressed very well, and said he was a gentleman.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman in Lower Brook-street; after I had called half after one I heard a noise in the street; I got out of the box and locked the box door; these people were coming up together; they said they had got a man for stealing a watch. I walked behind them till they got into the square; there he seemed rather resolute; I got hold of the back of his coat and said he must go to the watch-house; when we came to the Marquis of Rockingham's he said he was sick; he went and laid hold of the rails and strained but brought nothing up; he lifted his foot up to the kirb-stone and seemed very busy with his hand at his breeches knee; we took him from the rails, and as we were going a little further the watch struck against my leg as it fell out from the knee of his breeches. I said to the watchmen here is the watch; I stooped and picked it up; his breeches knee was unbuttoned.</p>

Mr. Sowter said he had been robbed of his watch; we took the prisoner as far as Grosvenor-square; he seemed to be sick about the centre of the square. He said he wanted to vomit; he put his foot up against the rails and unbuttoned the knee of his breeches on his left side and endeavoured to shake out the watch, which Mr. Sowter said he had robbed him of; he could not vomit; we took him from the rails, and in about ten or twelve yards afterwards the watch dropped from the knees of his breeches. I actually saw it drop.</p>

I observed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130025"></xptr> that his breeches knee was open. I said you shall not stay here any longer; we pulled him from the rails, and he had not gone above ten yards before the watch dropped from him; one of the watchmen picked it up; we took him to the watch-house and left him there. I did not see the watch drop from him; I was on the contrary side; it fell from his left side, I was upon the right. I heard the man, who had hold of him on the left side, say,</p>

I went to the people; Mr. Sowter said I have lost my watch, this gentleman has got it, therefore you shall take him in charge to the watch-house. The patrol came up; we hauled the prisoner up to Grosvenor-square; he pretended to be very sick; he leaned his head towards the iron pallisadoes and strained much, but nothing came up. He put his left foot down upon the kirb-stones, and was unbuttoning his breeches knee. When I perceived his hand busy I said let us take him away, he is about no good. We gave him a shove away, and before we had got a dozen yards, I perceived the watch drop from his breeches knee. Before it touched the ground, I said there is the watch. Webb stooped and picked it up and said the watch knocked against his foot before it touched the ground.</p>

Banbury came to my house; I said go to my brother's, for there are the attorney and the prosecutor. I went there afterwards.</p>

The prosecutor seemed to wave saying any thing left something should come out against the prisoner; he would leave it to his attorney, one Smith; he said if he had the value of his watch, he would never trouble his head more about it.

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I keep the Sunderland Arms. Mr. Sowter came to my house and staid about an hour; Banbury came in about five minutes after him.</p>
               <p>What passed between them? - I cannot say; Mr. Sowter wanted to make it up with Banbury, but said he would not do it, but his attorney should.</p>
               <p>Did they spend the evening together? - Not then. A week or a fortnight afterwards he came to my house; he sung two or three songs along with Banbury in the parlour; they shook hands together as soon as they came in. They were near three hours together. A chairman held his horse at the time.</p>
               <p>Do you remember what his offer was about making it up? - No, it was to be done by his attorney; I heard the attorney say he would not do it for nothing, he must have something for doing it.</p>

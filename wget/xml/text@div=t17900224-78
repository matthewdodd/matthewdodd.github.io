            , came up.</p>
               <p>Was that all you lost? - Yes; I lost nothing but my handkerchief, a guinea and a half, two shillings and six-pence, and nothing else.</p>
               <p>Had you taken observation enough of these men, so as to be positive to them? - Yes; they had followed me so much, that I could not help taking observation of them.</p>
               <p>Where was it you was knocked down? - Just off the bridge, on the right hand side.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. Where did the watchman take any one into his custody? - Close by the obelisk in Fleet-market.</p>
               <p>So you went the whole length of Chatham-place, and of Bridge-street, before you made the watchman take him into custody; and you and Wix were in custody together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You charged him with the robbery, and he charged you with assaulting him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Jones was not in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240075"></xptr>watch-house that night? - No, he was not; he came the next day.</p>
               <p>What coloured jackets had the people on on the bridge? - The same colour they have on now.</p>
               <p>What coloured jackets had they on? - I cannot go to be put on my oath about that.</p>
               <p>Have you never been at such places as this before? - I never was in such an open place as this before; I can safely swear that positively; I never prosecuted any body before, never in my life.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Sneezby, I know more of your history, than you are aware of; how long is it since you was at Union-hall? - Indeed I can hardly recollect.</p>
               <p>About how long? - I cannot really recollect it.</p>
               <p>Try to recollect how long ago it was, you was at Union-hall? - I cannot tell if you keep me here all night.</p>
               <p>I will not keep you there all night: but if you will not answer my question, you shall spend the night in Newgate? - Would you make me answer to that I cannot?</p>
               <p>Is it twenty years ago? - No, it cannot be so long as that.</p>
               <p>Is it five years ago? - No, it is not so long as that.</p>
               <p>Is it two years? - No, it is not.</p>
               <p>Is it a year? - No, it is not.</p>
               <p>Is it six months; I do not ask you because I do not know; but I want to see a little of your manner; do not hurry yourself; take your time; we have nothing else to do? - I believe it is three months ago.</p>
               <p>I wonder you could not have told me sooner. What was you there about? - It was for no harm.</p>
               <p>Well then, as it was for no harm, let us know for what good it was, that you went to Union-hall; do not hurry yourself? - I do not come about that.</p>
               <p>I know you did not, but I did; now I ask you again, what did you go to Union-hall about? O Lord! O Lord! we shall be here till to morrow morning, if we go on at this rate! - Why now I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Do you think I am such a fool as to be satisfied with such an answer as that; or those twelve jurymen, such rogues, as to suppose you was there at Union-hall about three months ago, and you cannot recollect what for? - Sir, I can tell you what I went there for; there was a neighbour of ours had a few words, and I went in her behalf; but I never prosecuted any one before.</p>
               <p>Was no one ever transported on your account? - No, never.</p>
               <p>At first, when the people came up to you, they took you for a woman of the town? - I suppose they did take me for such, by their pulling me about as such; but I told them they were mistaken in the person.</p>
               <p>So these people treated you as if you was not the virtuous creature you are, but as a woman of the town? - They treated me as such.</p>
               <p>Which of them was it put his hand into your pocket, when you lost your nutmeg grater? - I did not say I had.</p>
               <p>Have you never said, that in the scuffle and confusion, about their pulling your handkerchief, the money rolled out of your pocket? - No, I never said so.</p>
               <p>You never did say, in the hustling, you lost out of your pocket one guinea and a half, and two shillings and six-pence: did you lose a nutmeg grater? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>How came you then to say, that when you was asked about your handkerchief and your money, you never mentioned the nutmeg grater; how happened that? - Upon my word I cannot tell; I know I lost it, for the guinea and a half were in it.</p>
               <p>You live now at Battle-bridge; how long have you lived there? - A fortnight.</p>
               <p>What part of the world did you live in before? - At Lambeth, in Princess-street.</p>
               <p>How long did you live there? - About thirteen months; and I left it because my husband's business lays at Lambeth; I left it with a very good character.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that you was not driven out of the neighbourhood? - No one could drive me out there, because it is my own parish.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect when you was at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240076"></xptr>watch-house, charging any body else with the robbery? - When I was in the watch-house; why they kept me there as well as the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, was not his charge of you, for assaulting him in the street? - I do not know he made any such charge.</p>
               <p>How many other persons did you charge in the watch-house? - There was a man came in accidentally, and they asked me if he was one? I said he might be one for what I knew.</p>
               <p>From whence had you come? - From the Spread-eagle at Lambeth.</p>
               <p>Was you in that house? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>You was not alone, nor with your husband? - I was with myself.</p>
               <p>Who is the landlord; is it Monro? - No, Cushion.</p>
               <p>You was then by yourself; that you swear? - No; I could not be by myself, because there was people in the house.</p>
               <p>Then there was no other person in company with you? - There was only the watchman as I asked to drink.</p>
               <p>What was this watchman's name? - Monro.</p>
               <p>Did not the man treat you with a glass of gin in Cushion's house? - I would not wish to go to swear any such thing.</p>
               <p>Did any body treat you with a glass of gin in Cushion's house, yes or no? - No, Sir, they did not.</p>
               <p>Nor with any other liquor? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you drink any liquor with any body there? - Yes, along with Mr. Monro.</p>
               <p>With no one else? - No.</p>
               <p>How long was you in his company? - Not above five minutes.</p>
               <p>Was you in Cushion's house more than once that evening? - No, I was not; I swear that positively.</p>
               <p>Then you did not go out with the man who had been drinking with you, and come back again, desiring Cushion to take that man into custody for ill-treating you? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>You never came to the door to do that? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>You was perfectly sober? - I cannot say but I was.</p>


               <p>Had you had drink? - Yes, I had drink, but not so much as to hurt me.</p>
               <p>Where else did you call in to drink whilst you was out? - I drank no where but there, and at the Cross Keys at Lambeth, with a neighbour.</p>
               <p>How long might you stop there? - I might stop about three quarters of an hour there; I was along with one Mr. Martin; we had a quartern of brandy.</p>
               <p>Then you went to the Spread-eagle, and there had a glass or two of gin? - No, only one.</p>
               <p>After you had parted with Monro, who walked with you to the bridge? - No one.</p>
               <p>Where had you parted with your husband? - At Battle-bridge; we were to meet at Lambeth, but we missed each other.</p>
               <p>Battle-bridge is at least from Lambeth, six miles? - Yes, it may; I and my husband was at Battle-bridge at six: a young woman bore me company all the way; her name is Sarah; she lived at the Bell, at Battle-bridge, as a servant.</p>
               <p>Where did you lose her? - I left her at Lambeth.</p>
               <p>Did you see your husband at all that night at Lambeth? - No, I did not; I did not go to the Three Compasses, where he was, he was to meet me at his mother's, close by Lambeth Church.</p>
               <p>Did you go to his mother, before you went to the Spread-eagle? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What time did you set out then from your husband's mother's? - It was very near eleven.</p>
               <p>Then you went from Lambeth Church to the obelisk in Fleet-street, in half an hour? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>You was at his mother's at eleven; after that, you took your drop of drink at the bar of the Spread-eagle, with Monro, and staid a little while with him? - I did not stay any great while.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you stay and sit a considerable time? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>You was quite sober the whole time? - Yes, quite sober.</p>
               <p>I have witnesses that have searched the register at Whitechapel Church: do you mean to swear that you was married at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240077"></xptr>that church? - Yes, I can safely take an oath.</p>
               <p>At what time? - I was married at the time that the riot was; when the great buildings were destroyed; that I do swear positively.</p>
               <p>Court. Where was it you was to meet your husband? - At the sign of the Three Compasses; he went to his club, and I was to meet him at his mother's house, close by Lambeth Church.</p>
               <p>Did you go to his mother? - Yes, and he was not there.</p>
               <p>Then not finding him at his mother's, what brought you to Black friars-bridge? - Why, Sir, it is the nearest way.</p>
               <p>You knew your husband was at the club; how came you to go home without him? - I heard the club was done, and so told his mother I should not wait any longer for him.</p>

             following her; and he took and began pulling her about; and she laid hold of him, and began crying out murder! watch! directly I ran across the way to her assistance, and asked what was the matter? she said she had been badly used by four of them; and that he was one of them; and directly the watch came to her assistance; as soon as he came up, he let this bludgeon down; (produced); and it fell on my toes; and I have had it in my possession ever since: we took him to the watch-house, and gave the charge to the constable; one of the patrols happened to be there, and he asked me about them; and I gave him information, and he went in search of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Where was you coming from? - From Sun-tavern-fields.</p>
               <p>Then when you came to the obelisk, you saw that for the first time, which attracted your notice; you know nothing before? - No, nothing before that.</p>
               <p>Then as far as you know, the woman and these men had met before then? - Yes, as far as I know, they might.</p>
               <p>Did you go to the watch-house with them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was she sober? - As sober as I am now.</p>
               <p>What did you see she had lost? - Her silk handkerchief was gone, and her white handkerchief pulled much about.</p>
               <p>It is a very populous place this? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>It is just where those people meet who are coming from the other end of the town, all the houses of diversion being just then concluded; where those are passing from St. Paul's Church-yard, who live that way, as well as those coming from Black-friars-road, and are going there-to? - There was hardly any one passing by at this time.</p>
               <p>When you came to the watch-house, I believe Wix charged the woman with assaulting him? - No, I never heard it.</p>
               <p>How many people did she accuse in watch-house, with having used her ill? - I did not hear her accuse any but Wix.</p>
               <p>You did not know her before? - I never saw her to my knowledge before.</p>
               <p>Had she any friend at the watch-house? - None at all as I know of.</p>
               <p>Did she charge any friend of yours with the robbery? - Mr. Hitchell came up, and said, I will swear the young man hath not troubled himself with her at all; says she, I believe if the truth was known, that you may be one of the party.</p>
               <p>What was this person's name? - His name is

               <p>I was a watchman on this night: as I was calling half past eleven, I heard a woman crying out at the bottom of the Fleet-market; and I found this woman had hold of one of the prisoners at the bar, Wix; and in taking the charge of him, he dropped a stick out of his hand: I took him to the watch-house, and delivered the charge to the watch-house-keeper; I found her with her handkerchief half hung behind, and half before; and she said she lost another outside one: I saw the other prisoner Jones go out of the crowd, and go off.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you remember a man of the name of Hitchell coming up? - Yes, I do know something of the matter: some one asked if this Hitchell was one? she said she believed he was.</p>
               <p>Whether at that time, if Mr. Shepherd had not vouched for the knowledge of this Hitchell, he would not have been taken into charge? - I believe he might.</p>
               <p>How many others did she charge besides? - I cannot tell; because as soon as the charge was entered in the book, I went off to my duty.</p>
               <p>At that time of night, there is a great concourse of people just at that place? - Yes; it is very populous; it is busy enough all hours of the night.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear the woman say at any time, that she believed she was mistaken, and she would call back the charge? - I cannot positively say; I was not long there.</p>

               <p>I was constable of the night, and was present when the woman gave charge of Wix; she said she had been very badly used by four men, one of which was the prisoner Wix; I asked her how? she told me she had been attacked by four men, and robbed of a guinea, half a guinea, two shillings and sixpence, and a nutmeg grater, a silk handkerchief, a shawl, and a pocket handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Do you state this as a perfect recollection of what the charge was? - I do, I have the minute here. (Read.)</p>
               <p>During that charge, did she ever say, that Wix was not the man? - She giving the charge so very strong, I sent Wix to the Counter; when he was gone, she began to equivocate; on which account, I detained her in the watch-house till the morning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What do you mean by her equivocating very much, do you mean she did not stand to the charge so strongly; did she not after Wix went to the Counter, say, she did not know that Wix was the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240079"></xptr>man? - She seemed rather to draw back from what she had said before.</p>
               <p>Did she not charge Hitchell as one of the persons who robbed her? - She did, but she gave it up.</p>
               <p>Then her charge to Hitchel, was as strong as to Wix? - I believe it might, but I set him at liberty; because she said, on Mr. Shepherd's knowing him; then I suppose I was mistaken.</p>
               <p>Court. Then Mrs. Sneezby was dedetained to prosecute this man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was any charge against her? - No, none.</p>
               <p>In what state did Mrs. Sneezby appear to be, sober or not? - Sober, as far as I know.</p>

               <p>I have known Mrs. Sneezby from a girl; I saw her come into the Spread Eagle, with a man, the night of this disaster; I was in the house; the man says, you will pay for the glass of gin.</p>
               <p>The man, I am afraid, was not her husband? - He was a carpenter; after they drank, out they went directly together, and had not been out long before she came and knocked at Cushion's door, and Cushion opened it; come here, says she, along with me; go home, says he, you saucy slut, and get yourself sober.</p>
               <p>Was she drunk? - Very much in liquor, and he shut the door against her, I said to the man, get you along about your business; she got up to Mr. Jackson's corner, and I spoke to her; Sal, says I, pin your shawl, or else you will lose it; and told her to go along home; she was very drunk; her bonnet was off, by her tumbling about, and her cap came off.</p>

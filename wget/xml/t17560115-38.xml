               <p>M' Key. Yes she was, and I left the money in a drawer; there were 6 half-crowns of it.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen it last?</p>
               <p>M'Key. I had seen it not a quarter of an hour before I went out: I had been putting a clean shirt on.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lock the drawer?</p>
               <p>M'Key. I did, and left the key on the drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the prisoner lived with you ?</p>
               <p>M'Key. She had lived with me about three weeks. I came home between one and two the same day, and the money and prisoner were missing; the drawers were lock'd, and the keys where I left them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you meet with the prisoner again?</p>
               <p>M'Key. She had been in a work-house near Little-Britain, so I and a friend of mine went there and found her, in Little-Britain, on the Monday morning; when we ask'd her after the money, she owned the fact directly, and said she had taken it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search her?</p>
               <p>M' Key. No, I did not; I ask'd her if she had any of it left? she said, she had not: sometimes she said she had lost it; at other times she said she could not tell<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175601150036"></xptr> what she had done with it. I sent for a constable and took her before the fitting alderman, and she own'd it there, and said she was very sorry for what she had done.</p>

            . I went along with the prosecutor into Little-Britain, where we took the prisoner; upon her being charged with taking the money, she own'd in my hearing, she did take it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she mention what quantity?</p>
               <p>Taylor. She said there were six half crowns; she begg'd the prosecutor would let her go, and said she would pay it him again: she cou'd give no account what she had done with it. She was taken before the justice and there she own'd the same.</p>

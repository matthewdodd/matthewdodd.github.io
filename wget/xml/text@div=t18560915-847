                  </hi>. I am sixteen years old. I am in the service of Mr. Nicholas Dawson, a linendraper, of No. 17, Crisp-street, Poplar—the prisoner was in his service as an apprentice, in 1854—he then left, and was in prison—on Sunday evening, 17th Aug. last, I saw him at my master's door, about half past 6 o'clock; I opened the door to him—he said, "Is Mrs. Dawson in?"—I did not answer; my fellow servant, Mary Phillips, came up, and answered him—he said he was the brother of Mrs. Dawson—I let him in—Mr. and Mrs. Dawson were at chapel—the prisoner came into the sitting room, kissed the child, and told him he was his uncle—(he is not any relation to Mr. and Mrs. Dawson)—he said he had come from the country—Phillips said he had come quite unexpectedly—he said no, he had written to Mrs. Dawson on Saturday evening—she said Mrs. Dawson could not get the letter until Monday morning—the prisoner then said he would come in and go to bed—I went up stairs after my bonnet, leaving him in the sitting room—I went into a room on the second floor to get my bonnet—I saw the prisoner run up the stairs to the third floor—I then recognized him, and ran down stairs, and cried out "Police!" and said that it was Alfred—I did not recognize him at first—while I was at the door, the prisoner came down; he came as far as the corner of the counter in the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185609150002"></xptr>
               <p>shop, and said to Phillips, "Miss, Miss Gooding sent me for the writing desk"—he had the writing desk in his hand—it had been on the dressing table in Miss Gooding's bed room, on the second floor—he must have passed that room in coming down from the third floor—I had seen the desk in the room when I went to fetch my bonnet—I did not recognize him at first, because he was dressed much more shabbily than when he was there before—I am sure he is the person—this is the desk—Phillips brought it to me afterwards—she is not here—she is still in Mr. Dawson's service; she was before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> If I had come and represented myself to be Mr. Dawson's brother, is it likely she would have let me in? and she the very girl that was there when I was convicted; it does not stand to reason that I should have gone and given myself up as an escaped convict, because I could not get an honest living, if I had made up my mind to get it in a dishonest way; I have tried every means; I was in the militia, and when I was discharged my friends would not help me, and I did not know what to do, and went and gave myself up; I bore an exemplary character while I was in prison, and had a good character when I came out; I beg your lord<lb></lb>ship will give me such a sentence as will send me out of the country, where I may be able to do myself some good.</p>

On the evening of 17th Aug., about 25 minutes before 7 o'clock, I was sitting at my own door, No. 14, William-street, East India-road, Poplar; that is about 500 yards from Mr. Dawson's—I heard a hallooing and hooting at the end of the street, and saw the prisoner come running, with a box in his hand, and as he passed he dropped it on my toes—I made an attempt to stop him, and caught hold of his collar, but he slung himself out of my hand, and ran off, calling out, "Stop thief! it is not me, <hi rend="italic">governor."</hi>

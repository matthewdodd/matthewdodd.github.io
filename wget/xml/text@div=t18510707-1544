                  </hi>. I am a comedian. On 23rd June I was at Vauxhall-gardens—between 10 and 11 o'clock at night I was near the Rotunda—I had a watch, chain, and key, when I entered—there was a great rush, and I suspected I had been robbed, because I saw an individual, who had been near me for a quarter of an hour, suddenly go; but having a child, I could not attend to it—I had noticed that person for twenty minutes—I believe the prisoner is the person, but I would not swear to him, because he had then mustachios, which he has not now—I put my hand to my pocket when I got inside, and missed my watch and chain—I heard nothing about my watch that evening—on the Wednesday evening sergeant Goff showed me my watch, chain, and key—they were what I lost on that Monday evening—these are them.</p>

I was in Vauxhall-gardens on Monday evening 23rd June—I saw the prisoner in custody of Hayes, by the side of the barrier, between 10 and 11 o'clock—I desired Hayes to search him—the prisoner then put his own hand into his pocket and took out this watch, and was about to put it on the stand—I took it from him, and said, "Is this yours?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Has it any name or number on it?"—he said, "No"—I found there was both—I saw Mr. Howe on the Wednesday evening and he claimed it—I have known the prisoner for about a month before—his appearance is just the same as it was.</p>

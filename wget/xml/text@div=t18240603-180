On the 30th of April the prisoner came to match a piece of silk; I could not match it - she staid there some time. I went behind the counter, and saw her looking at some lace, with one piece in her hand; I turned as if to look on the shelf again, and saw her put a piece of lace under her shawl; she said,</p>
               <p>"Will you give me a pattern of this silk," and asked if we had gauzes to match it; I said, Yes, on the other side - she would not turn round for some time, but at length she turned, and said,</p>
               <p>"I will call again." I followed her, and in Berner-street I found this piece of lace under her shawl.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you accuse her of it in the shop - A. No; there were other persons in the shop. She said she was going to bring it back.</p>

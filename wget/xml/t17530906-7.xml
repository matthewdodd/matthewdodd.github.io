I turned in again and missed my drawer, with a 27 s. piece, a guinea, half guinea, and upwards of 30 s. in it, on which I ran to the prisoner's house, and afterwards to an acquaintance of her's, but could not find her: then I returned and found her at her own house. I asked her what she wanted at my house; she said she had not been at my house since breakfast time. I said I would swear she was, and that I had lost my drawer and such pieces of money. I took her up on the Thursday following, she would not confess any thing.</p>

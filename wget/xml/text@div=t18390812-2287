                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Thomas Cutts, a law writer, in Tooke's-court, Chancery-lane. On Saturday night, the 10th of August, about half-past ten or a quarter to eleven o'clock, I went into the shop of Mr. King, a pawnbroker, in Holborn—it is a pawnbroker's on one side and a jeweller's on the other—I went to the jewellery side—I saw both the prisoners in the shop—they made way for me to stand between them—there were several other persons in the shop—the prisoners stood near me—I was not there many minutes when I put my hand to my pocket, and my purse was safe—I put my hand in my pocket again, with in three minutes, and the purse was gone—I turned round, and saw Bird, the other prisoner was gone—I took hold of Bird, and accused her of having taken my purse—she said she had not—I then asked her where the other girl was—she said she was gone round to the boxes—I took Bird to the boxes, and Clifford was not there—I asked Bird where she lived—she said she would show me—I took her across the road, and gave her in charge—she told us Clifford lived on Saffron-hill—we went and found her there at play with other children in the street—I said to the constable, "That is the girl who was standing behind me"—she attempted to run away. but he caught her—I said, "You have taken my purse"—she said, "I have not"—I afterwards said, "What have you done with the purse?"—she said she had thrown it away in Holborn, that she had changed the five shilling piece and half-crown, some she had spent and some she had got—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty in Holborn last Saturday night, and Mrs. Cutts gave Bird into my charge—I afterwards took Clifford playing in the street with some girls—she attempted to run away—a policeman caught her and brought her back—Bird, when she was first charged, said she had not committed the robbery, but she thought the other one had, as she ran away and left her, and she knew where she lived—she could not give us the number, but she would show us where it was, and she went with us—Clifford said Bird tapped her hand against the lady's pocket in the shop, as much as to say she had money, and she (Clifford) then put her hand into her pocket, took it, turned the money into her own pocket, and threw the purse away in Hol born, as she always did do—when I got hold of her, I asked her where the purse was—she said she had thrown it away in Hol born—that she had changed the fire shilling piece and a half-crown, and spent some, and the rest she had—Bird heard this, but said nothing to it.</p>

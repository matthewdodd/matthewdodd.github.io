                  </hi>. I am a bookseller, and live in Old Caven<lb></lb>dish-street. On the 18th of January the prisoner came to my shop, and said she came from Lady Morrison, of Cavendish-square, to borrow the third volume of "Charles Tyrrell"—I said I had not got it—Lady Mor<lb></lb>rison does occasionally send to me for books—I gave her the first and se<lb></lb>cond volumes of "The Old English Gentleman"—she brought them back,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was sent for to Mr. Marsh's, and saw the prisoner there—he said, "This woman has been obtaining a quantity of books from me in the name of Lady Morrison"—I asked what she had done with them—she said a female who was standing on the step of Lady Morrison's door had sent her for them, and if I went with her, I should see her standing there; that she was dressed in a green satin bonnet, and a red plaid shawl—I went with her there, but could see nobody—she gave me her name and address, "Ann Davidson, No. 14, William-street, Hampstead-road"—I went there, but could find no such person—I afterwards found she lived at No. 10, Hereford-street, Lisson-grove, and is married.</p>

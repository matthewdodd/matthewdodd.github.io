             two years; I have heard her say she did not want to hurt the prisoner, for she was innocent, and was not high the man when he was robb'd; and if she was taken up, it would be upon the accout of the Thief-catchers. When I heard the Sessions-paper read, Hawkins was there, and said she knew neither man, woman, nor child, was near him, but Bulger and Spencer.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Mary Hawkins? what is her character?</p>
               <p>Harris. Her husband is a coal-heaver, he has had many wives, and she as many husbands (as they call them); I have nothing to say to her character.</p>

            . The prisoner has lived by me these two years, I never saw any ill by her.</p>

               <p>Clark. I never heard any thing ill of her; she is a very honest woman, and gets her living by buying and selling of old cloaths.</p>

Upon the purchase being made a March warrant was granted, and on 26th August I went to the before named address, where I seised 7,189 copies; amongst them I found No. 10, which is included in the 3rd Count—I saw the defendant—the warrant had been read to him—I said "I am a police officer of the City; are you the proprietor of Quiz paper?"—he said "Yes"—I said "You have seen the warrant; it has been read to you?"—he said "Yes"—I then said "I shall take away all the numbers I find in your place"—I am sure he said he was the proprietor—I made the seizure and brought away 7,189 copies.

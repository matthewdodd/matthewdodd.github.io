On the 23rd of Nov., alter the pri<lb></lb>soner was charged, I went with him from the station to his own house, to see if we could find the brush and shovel—on going down into the cellar, in a corner, I found two pairs of upper leathers for laced boots—I said, "What, an these?"—he said, "They are mine, it is all right, I bought them of a man named Pearce"—I found a mark on them, which I believe to be Mr. Ken<lb></lb>dall's—at the same minute almost, Bingham, who was with me, found three pieces of leather, two of them cut out as for soles, with the name of Kendall marked in full on them, and an odd piece used as an inner sole, with Ken<lb></lb>dall's name stamped in full—I said, "What do you say to these?"—he said, "Oh, they are Kendall's"—I said, "Yes, they are."</p>

                  </hi>. My father is a shoe manufacturer. On the 10th of Nov. last I delivered to Edward Pearce, one of the journeymen, six pairs of upper leathers—these are two pairs of them—there is my handwriting on them—the other three pieces of leather I know to be my father's, by his name being stamped on them—I do not know to whom they were given—they had been given out to be made—they are worth 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. altogether.</p>

                  </hi>.

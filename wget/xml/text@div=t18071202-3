Yes, I marked them with a knife; I marked two half guineas, fourteen seven shilling pieces, and two guineas; I put them in the till and locked them up in the iron safe, on Wednesday last, about eight in the evening. On the next morning I came about nine o'clock; the prisoner was there before me; I unlocked the iron chest, I counted over the money, I found there was a half guinea, thirteen seven shilling pieces, and two guineas; there were a half guinea and a seven shilling piece missing; the money was all marked.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the prisoner apprehended. - A. On the Friday. On Thursday the prisoner told me he had lent his small change to Mr. Turner; he said he had got the half guinea and the seven shilling piece in change of a note.</p>

               <p>Q. On Thursday morning last did you ask the prisoner to lend you any money. - A. I did; I asked him to lend me half a guinea; after that I considered that was not the money I wanted; I then asked for a seven shilling piece; he lent me them.</p>

               <p>Q. Perhaps you left the desk. - A. Yes, but there was no person came in the accompting house from that time till Alden came in.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley to Alden. Look at that money, and see whether that is part of the money you put in the iron chest. - A. Yes, it is, I marked it with the knife.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. What is it marked with. - A. A cross.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that to be your hand writing. - A. No, I had no pen; I believe it to be my marking.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. There may be a hundred like it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The way I came by that money Mr. Bennington gave it me in change of a five pound note.</p>
               <p>RICHARD BENNINGTON. - Mr. Gurney. Where do you live. - A. At No. 11, Bennet's-buildings, Old Bethlem. The prisoner lodged with me; I gave him change of a five pound note; I have the note now in my possession. To the best of my recollection there were four half guineas and a seven shilling piece amongst the change.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you would not swear to a half guinea. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Pooley. Was it marked. - A. It was not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Might not such a mark as this have escaped your notice. - A. It might. Was I receiving a guinea, I might have looked more closely into it to see whether it was good.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. Of course you looked at them before, to see whether it was good. - A. Yes; I might have some of this money by me a month; if it has any particular mark on it I might have forgot it.</p>
               <p>Jury. We would wish to know whether there were any other person that went to that iron chest. - A. No. I had the key; it was locked when I went to it, and there is no other key as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got any of the other money. - A.Yes,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180712020006"></xptr>I have the whole.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any person that saw you put the money in. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor no person saw you take the money out. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it entirely rests upon your evidence. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you undertake to say that is the money that you marked. - A. I can.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney (producing another half guinea.) Can you swear to that mark. - A. It is like it; perhaps you marked that yourself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. If it is a mark exactly alike the other, how can you swear to that.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

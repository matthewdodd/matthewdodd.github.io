On the night of the 4th of September, I was going home at a quarter past nine o'clock, and looking round my premises I saw the large shed-door moving; I cried out, "Who is there?" I got no answer - I called to my daughter, and she brought a light; we saw the prisoner standing at the door, and pulling this truss out of the shed; he had come up with the boats of hay that day, but he was not in my employ, and had no right to take my hay; we found five trusses of hay ready for taking away - he said he was going to stop there, because his boat leaked.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you never given leave to any persons to sleep there? A. Yes, at haymaking time, but not lately - there was no young woman with him upon the hay; and I had given no one leave to sleep there; I fastened the shed myself, bolted, and pinned it.</p>

            . My father called for a light; I saw the prisoner, and knew him directly; I saw by his hat that he had been carrying hay, and told him so; he said, "No, I have done no such thing" - we found one truss inside the shed, and five trusses outside the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then this young man spoke to you, and you to him? A. Yes, my father took hold of him; he could not run.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Huggett, who keeps a coffee-shop in North-place, Lambeth.

                  </hi>. My wife came to me about a half-crown—I examined it, and thought it was not good—I cut some notches in it with a knife—here are the marks I made—I afterwards went with my wife to where the two prisoners were—I charged them with tendering the half-crown, and asked where they got it from—Miles said she had received it in change for a half-sovereign in the Lambeth-road—I said, "If that is the case, you can have no objection to letting me know where that is, or accompany me there"—I went in search of a policeman, leaving both the prisoners in the coffee-room—while standing looking for a policeman, Hart left the coffee-room, and ran away—I ran after him, brought him back, and detained him—I went to the back part of the shop to send a servant for a policeman, and he ran away out of the coffee-room a second time—I at last secured him, and gave him to Pearse the constable—the policeman, Edgar, asked me to let him see the half-crown in the prisoner's presence—I did so, and also showed it to Pearse, and while in his band, Hart made a snatch at it, put it up to his mouth, and swallowed it.</p>

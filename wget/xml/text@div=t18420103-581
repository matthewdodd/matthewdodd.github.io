                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Joseph Tilley, a pawnbroker, in Mile End-road. On the 22nd of December, about noon, the prisoner brought twelve thimbles—he asked me 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on them—I forget which—I said, "Are they silver?"—he said, "Yes, I bought them for silver"—I suspected they were not—I tested one of them, returned them, and said they were not silver—he said, "Are they not? I had them left with me for a debt"—my testing one of them left a mark on it, which it would be inconvenient to get off.</p>

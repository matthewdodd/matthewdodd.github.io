The woman was pulling off her petticoat, a very greasy dirty petticoat; in the room were laying some halfpence, in a pocket, a paper, and in a waistcoat some more, they were all counterfeits; in the breeches that were laid by very dirty and greasy, was one of Rothwell's knee-buckes.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you know that? - He was buckling the fellow one, and I compared them, the breeches and waistcoat appeared just to be taken off.</p>

               <p>I rung at the bell, and was answered by a young woman in the one pair of stairs, I bid her open the door, she said she could not and would not; while I was arguing with her, I heard the window break, and Carpmeal cryed out, here they all are, they are come out of the cellar; we got in at the parlour window, I went into the cellar, there was a hole at the bottom of the stairs, there was a quantity of halfpence, 5 l. or 6 l. worth, (the half-pence produced.)</p>
               <p>Court to Clarke. Are they counterfeit halfpence? - I should think they were.</p>

               <p>Court. Nobody knows better than you do, you know the business of coining, pretty near as well as any of them? - Yes, my Lord, they were, the large press was in one cellar, the small press in another; the large press was fixed in one cellar, and that blank between the dies, and a candle burning by the side of it; there were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178209110106"></xptr> several more pair of dies which are here, ( produced) in the other cellar there was a cutting-out press, and these pieces of copper laying near the press, and only one row of cecils cut out, a quantity of blanks, together with some sheets of copper; somebody must have been at work, as nobody was in the house but them; where they cut out the blanks there is generally four or five.</p>

               <p>I acknowledge myself guilty; the young man came to see his sister, and Mrs. Child was in bed.</p>
               <p>To Clarke. Did any part of the house seem to belong to Mrs. Child? - That was doubtful to me, when we came to go away she took and locked up all the things in one room, and gave us the key; her apron was dirty, I do not say she had been at work.</p>

               <p>Jury How was the bed? - It was unmade, this was in the afternoon.</p>

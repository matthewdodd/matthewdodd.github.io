               <p>MR. JOHN ADDISON NEWMAN. I am the keeper of Newgate. The prisoner at the bar was confined in Newgate on the 25th of 
               <persName id="t18160918-46-person444">August.</persName>
             I did not see Monk come into the gaol; the first I heard of it was that a visitor had been robbed, and in consequence of that, I came to the gates, and Monk seized the prisoner, and one of the principal turnkeys assisted in bringing him out. The watch was afterwards handed through the rai1s.</p>

            . I am one of the turnkeys of Newgate. Monk come in to see a friend that was in confinement, as soon as I let him in, he had a bason with some meat in it. I examined it and let him go through; as soon as he got in, he was immediately shoved against, by this Levi, and Monk directly put up his hand, and caught hold of him. I directly said to the gatesman, bring him through, what is the matter. Monk instantly complained of having lost his watch, and the gatesman brought the prisoner between gates to me. I had observed the ribbon hanging out of the prosecutor's pocket when I was examining the meat. In about twenty minutes or half an hour, the watch was found.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was standing in the yard close by this young man when he missed his watch, and he caught hold of me, and said I had stolen it; Mr. Davis immediately searched me, and there was nothing found on me.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner called two prisoners from the Goal, to prove he had not stolen the watch, and they declared they knew nothing at all about it.)</p>

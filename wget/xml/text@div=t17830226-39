               <p>I saw the prisoner drop the hammer cloth on the 15th of January, between seven and eight he rushed by me with a bundle under his arm, he went about two yards from me, and I saw his face, I knew him before I followed him two or three steps, he made a bit of a run, I cross'd the way, thinking to have caught him in my arms, and after running about forty yards I headed him; I crossed the way again about four or five yards off, he perceived me, and threw down the bundle, and made his escape; I took up the bundle and followed him to Lamb-alley Bishopsgate-street, I cried out, stop him! and two butchers boys stopped him.</p>
               <p>Had you any information of this hammer cloth being lost, at the time? - No, only I looked upon him to be a suspicious person, I took him into custody, and the hammer cloth was advertised.</p>

               <p>The last day of last sessions I was brought up before Mr. Recorder, and I was discharged, and about three quarters of an hour after, Mr. Wade met me, and took me again, he said he found the property in Bishopsgate-street, I was walking in Moorfields when he took me, and he said I dropped the bundle.</p>
               <p>Jury to Wade. Was the prisoner over out of your sight? - Yes, the value of two minutes.</p>

I returned her the same change again, and she put down the guinea; I did not miss the guinea till Mr. Wood, a grocer living opposite, came in, not many minutes after she was gone; he asked me what change I had given the woman that was gone out; I told him for a guinea; he asked me if it was a good one; I looked for it, and it was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any body else been in the shop? - A. There had been several people in the shop; I went out after the woman, and asked her for the guinea; she told me that she had not got it; Mr. Webb came up, and she delivered the guinea into his hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the guinea again? - A. No; I know it was a good looking guinea, I cannot say it was the same guinea again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Are you sure that nobody had been near the counter to take that guinea? - A. There were several people in the shop, but I never saw the guinea afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. There had been several people in the shop at the counter? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Any one of them might have taken the guinea for what you know? - A. They had not gone out of the shop before Mr. Wood came in.</p>
               <p>- WEBB sworn. - I was in conversation with a friend nearly opposite the prosecutor's; I live in Threadneedle-street; I saw the last witness running as if she was pursuing of a woman; I did not know her at the moment, I followed to see what it was.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance had she got? - A. About fifty or sixty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner running? - A. No, walking very quietly; I came up to her when the last witness taxed her with the fraud; she denied it, and I told her for certain I should take her back to the shop: going back, after we had gone about ten yards, she said she hoped she had not made a mistake; she put her hand into her pocket, and seemed as though she felt herself very much astonished, and gave me the guinea.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You say, she was walking very gently? - A. Yes, and she went back very readily with me.</p>
               <p>NAHUM WOOD sworn. - I suspected the prisoner, and I went over to Mr. Lemon's to inform them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have a large family, and my husband is serving the King.</p>

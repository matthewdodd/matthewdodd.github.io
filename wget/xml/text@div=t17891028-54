            ; when we came into Hyde Park, the prisoner bid them go farther; and as soon as they were gone, he knocked me down; and he said, give me your money? I said, I have no money; he put his right hand before my mouth, and put his left hand into my pocket; and took out four shillings and a pocket handkerchief; afterwards, when he took his hand from my mouth, I cried murder; and he said, if I cried murder any more, he would run his knife through me; I called murder several times, and he ran away; he was going to take my bonnet; he had it in his hand, but he threw it down; and when assistance came, he ran away.</p>
               <p>Who came? - The patrol came over the wall; they took the other man; I have spoke the truth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp, Prisoner's Counsel. Where was you married? - I was married at Stratford upon Avon, in Warwickshire, three years, come next Christmas; I have been an unfortunate girl of the town three months.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178910280052"></xptr>Was not it dark? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many persons were there by you, at the time when he came up to you? - Only this girl, and the other soldier; the other soldier came with him.</p>

               <p>Then, you agreed together to go into Hyde Park? - Yes; he gave me no shilling.</p>
               <p>You agreed to go with him, on consideration of his giving you a shilling? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did the other man come to your assistance, when you cried murder? - No; they neither of them came, till such times as the patroll came over the wall; he took my bonnet from my head, and threw it down again; he took my four shillings, and my old pocket handkerchief; I had no more money in the world.</p>
               <p>How late did you know what money you had in your pocket? - I had it from another gentlemen not half an hour before; I had the money, and put it into my pocket, as soon as I left the other gentleman.</p>
               <p>This money was loose in your pocket? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was down on the ground? - Yes, because he knocked me down.</p>
               <p>How often did you cry out murder? - I cannot tell whether it was five or six times.</p>
               <p>And though there was a man and woman in your company, that had gone a few yards from you, nobody heard you, or came to your assistance? - No one came, till the patrolls came.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you receive from that man a shilling, which he promised to give you? - No, Sir, I had not a farthing from him, or any body else, but the gentleman I had been with, from whom I had four shillings.</p>
               <p>At the time this man came up, how came you to be so positive in knowing what money you had in your pocket? - Because I had it from the other gentleman, four shillings.</p>
               <p>It was dark, I suppose? - Yes; it was after night, before ever I saw the other gentleman.</p>
               <p>How long was you crying out murder? - I cannot tell you how many minutes; we were but just a quarter or an hour in the park.</p>
               <p>Did you ever recover your money again? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>How long afterwards did you charge this man? - He was not taken till the next morning; the other man that was in company with him, told of him at the Justice's.</p>
               <p>Court. Could you know the man again? - Yes, Sir; that is the man; I knew him the next day at the Justice's; he was dressed in the same clothes he has on now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Was not you told now, before you went to the office, that there was a person in custody, that it was supposed had robbed you? - No, Sir, I was not.</p>
               <p>Was not you told in your way, going to the office, what you was going for? - No, Sir, we were not; we were going to appear against the other man; I did not know this man was there, till I saw him at the Justice's.</p>
               <p>What became of the other man? - He was taken to the watch-house with us; he was kept in the watch-house all night.</p>
               <p>It was perfectly dark? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen this man before? - No; but I can swear to the same man.</p>
               <p>Court. What did you mean by being taken up? - We were all taken together in the Park.</p>

               <p>Did she appear to be ill used? - She seemed to be very much frightened.</p>
               <p>Did you see any body run away? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you observe whether she had a bonnet on or no, at that time? - No, not then; but at the toll-house, I saw her have a bonnet.</p>

               <p>Had she any marks of violence upon her? - When I took her to the toll-house, she shewed me her arm, which was very black; I saw no other mark of violence about her.</p>
               <p>Did her head dress appear much tumbled? - No; I did not take any notice of her hair being rumpled, or her her clothes rumpled, only she shewed her arm; she said she had been knocked down; they were all together; and the woman, Smith, was saying, why did not you come to my assistance.</p>
               <p>Who was the man that you saw with this woman at that time? - He is at the door, belonging to the same company and barracks as the prisoner.</p>

             at all, did she complain of having been treated ill, and robbed? - I immediately asked them, and she made me that reply, that she had been very ill used by a man that was run away, and robbed her of four shillings and her pocket handkerchief.</p>
               <p>What sort of an appearance had these bruises on her arm? - Why, it appeared that some person had clinched her round; she said she had a mark on her breast, but I did not ask her to shew me that, because there were many people in the turnpike-house.</p>
               <p>She seemed to be much agitated? - She did indeed; she was very much terrified.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prosecutrix before? - No; I never saw either of the girls, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>They appeared to you to be common prostitutes? - I knew that by their own discourse; I asked them what business they had in the Park at that time? and they said they went with the men; the next morning, I went and fetched this prisoner out of the barracks.</p>
               <p>Did the women themselves, give you any account of the man at that time? - They said he was a very tall man, and appeared to them as a gentleman.</p>
               <p>You got your intelligence from the other soldier? - Yes.</p>

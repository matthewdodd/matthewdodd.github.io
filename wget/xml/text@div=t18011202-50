             sworn. - I am a sack-maker, No. 70, Houndsditch, behind the public-house; I saw some canvas, which he said was their's; I did not buy it; the prisoner brought it to me to sell on the Tuesday or Wednesday night; I have seen the prisoner three or four times. (The wrappers produced.)</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. (To Pettit.) Q. Do you or not know that that wrapper was lent to the prisoner? - A. They gave him leave to take two or three to cover some furniture; I believe that wrapper he could have no intention of keeping.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the others were not sent out with goods? - A. I don't believe they were; we use them for packing goods for exportation.</p>
               <p>JOHN-EDWARD HOLMES sworn. - I will not swear to these wrappers any further than there are marks that come from the different manufacturers, who, I will not pretend to say, have not sent goods to other houses; we never sell canvas or cloth but wholesale.</p>

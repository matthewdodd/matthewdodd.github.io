I am in partnership with Henry Green—the prisoner was our carman—I cut some pieces of paper, and my partner in my presence put them with some oats in sacks in our granary on Thursday 17th Oct.—next day, in consequence of what Thornton told me, I went to the police court, and found these oats in a sack (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have examined it, and found some of the papers I had put in.</p>

In consequence of information on the Friday morning, I went to the prosecutor's premises in Upper Thames-street and watched—and about five minutes after seven o'clock I saw the prisoner come out with his horse and cart, and the cart had a number of sacks in it which turned out to be corn—I and Smith followed him through various street to the Vauxhall-road, where he stopped and got into the cart—I was some distance behind it, and it was a very foggy morning, Smith was very close to him—I came up to him near the Ship, and saw him open one sack, take corn from it, and put it into one on his left, which is the one produced—he continued to take corn from his right side, and putting it into the other sack till he came near the Horns at Kennington, where there were two constables near him—I then followed him to the White Horse in the Brixton-road, where he stopped, spoke to a man there, went round the cart twice, and went into the stable—we followed him, told him we were officers, and asked what he had done with the sack—he said it was in the stable, he had left it there till he came back to bait his horses with—I brought the corn to the station, and showed it to Mr. Sedgwick—there was only one horse to the cart.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at 67, Bryanstone-street, Portman-square—the house is my property—it was furnished—I had to let it, and the prisoner made application to me with reference to it—it was about the middle of March; I do not remember the day—he stated that he was an agent, and wanted a furnished house for Dr. Davis, M.P. for Cambridgeshire, and that mine was just such a house as would suit him—he said, "I am his man of business," and that he formerly lived in Cavendish-square—he gave me his address, and he mentioned some bankers as Dr. Davis's bankers—he said I should inquire there—he said he had known him for years, and he was a gentleman of large property—Dr. Davis came next day by himself—he said he was Dr. Davis; he looked at the house and approved of it—the prisoner called on the following day, in the evening—he said he had seen Dr. Davis, that he approved of the house, and that he should like me to give it up to Dr. Davis as soon as it was convenient—I said, "I cannot let you have it before 30th March." A few days afterwards the prisoner and Dr. Davis came together about 9 o'clock in the evening; I cannot say what day that was—I signed an agreement which the prisoner took away and said he would get it stamped at Somerset House—I saw the prisoner again afterwards repeatedly, and on 30th March he came to the house and brought a man that he represented was his agent, to take an inventory—Dr. Davis came about 9 o'clock at night, and I agreed to let the house to him for twelve months at 260<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year—I delivered up three keys, the front door key, the area door key, and the area gate key, to the prisoner's man—there was one small room which I did not let, a store-room which was not included in the agree<lb></lb>ment—I had in that room a quantity of Brussels carpet, candlesticks, a sofa</p>

               <p>cover, a table cover, and a pair of boots—the door of that room was locked, and I kept the key—I did not deliver up the key of that room nor any key that would open that door—Dr. Davis came about 9 o'clock that night, and the clerk and the prisoner were there—I went away about 11 o'clock—I then left the prisoner alone in the house—he promised he would let me have a quarter's rent in advance the next day, which was Wednesday—I promised to meet him at 13, New Quebec-street at 11 o'clock, a Berlin wool shop, kept by some persons who I have known for years—I went there about 11 o'clock and waited all the day; the prisoner did not come—I went about 7 o'clock in the evening to 67, Bryanstone-street, and could not get in—I went again on the Thursday and the following evening; I could not get in, and the house appeared to be empty—I had a latch-key belonging to the front door—I went to the police-station, and on Saturday, 4th April, I went with a policeman and got into the house—the store-room was broken open, and everything valuable was gone—I never saw them afterwards—they were worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How often did you see the prisoner before you gave up the house to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Half-a-dozen times—he was alone every evening, but on 13th March, Dr. Davis came to look over the house, and he came with the prisoner to make the agreement—I gave up the key on Tuesday, 30th March, to the clerk; he left and said he must go to shut up the office—the prisoner did not say ho came from Mr. Cruse, he said that he was Mr. Cruse—he gave me a card—I did not think anything of it, and took no care of it—I have looked for it, and tried to find it—when the clerk left, the prisoner and I were alone in the house—there was no dispute about the rent—I asked him for the rent, and he said he was to pay it for Dr. Davis—I had not said anything to Dr. Davis about it—he told me he left Mr. Cruse to transact the business—there were three charwomen in the house; I had sent them to clean it up—they were in the house all day—I sent for them the first thing in the morning early—I opened the door and let them in—I knew them—I was living there—I slept there the night before—neither of the charwomen had a key of the door—one of them came in with a key, but that was before 9 o'clock, when she went out for 3lbs. of rump-steaks for Dr. Davis and the men—when she came with the steaks, she let herself in with a key of my own—she returned that key to me that night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know that a woman was seen leaving the house the next evening with a box? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe it was two boys and a box who left the next morning—I did not see it—I heard it from a lady next door who saw them—there were fenders and other articles that I was to supply—I kept a copy of the agreement; I have not got it—the banker I was to refer to was Sir Claude Scott in Cavendish-square—I arranged to give the prisoner five per cent. for letting the house—I have never got the keys back, I have never seen them since—the prisoner wanted to know what I had in the private room, so I showed him—it was about 7 o'clock in the evening of the next day when I went to the house; I knocked at the door and rang, I expected to find the servant—I expected to get the rent the day before—they kept me till 11 o'clock at night, I could not stop longer—I understood that the rent was to be paid before Dr. Davis came in—I expected to see Dr. Davis there the next day, he said he had not got his luggage from the Ship Hotel—I went with the policeman on Saturday, 4th April; the door was merely on the latch—we walked in, and found the room door broken open—the three women were women I had often employed; I</p>

               <p>knew where they lived—I did not tell the policeman when he went into the house, about the charwomen—when before the Magistrate I told their names and where they lived—one of them was at the police-court, the other was ill, and could not come—one of them attended provided she was called—I had told a policeman about them before; I can't say when; it was after the prisoner was given into custody—I told him the charwomen knew about taking my carpet and things in the room—it was in consequence of that he asked me to give him the names of the charwomen and where they lived—I gave the names of two, the third one was up-stairs and knew nothing of it—it was not her who went for the rump-steaks, it was one of the two.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MARSHALL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It was arranged that you should give five per cent. to the prisoner, did he ever apply for that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, he asked me where I kept my private room, I took him and showed it him—I showed him what it contained—he did not go in, he looked in at the door—the card he gave me was similar to this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), it had the same writing on it, "Mr. A. Cruse, surveyor and land agent, 7, Maddox-street, Regent-street."</p>

I accompanied Mrs. McLean to the house in Bryanstone-street, but not when she went in first—that was on Saturday, about the 4th or 5th April—she showed me the store-room—the door was opened from the back parlour; it had been forced open by violence, and between the back parlour and the store-room I found it had been forced by these tongs, which are broken on one side and the other side is bent—six or seven boxes in the room had been broken open.</p>

            . I live at No. 43, Old Bond-street - I know the prisoner, Evison. On Monday evening, the 4th of May, he called on me, said he had a commission to purchase a carriage for Mr. Smith, of Southampton, and was ordered to go as high as 150l. I shewed him one at 120 guineas - He said he would call in the morning to see some others. Next day he called, and agreed for the carriage at 120l., and said he would give me a bill on Francis and White, who he believed were very respectable people. He said he did not know who was the drawer-he wrote the particulars down on a piece of paper in the counting-house. I saw him write it-(looking at it) this is it (reads) "Smith, Esq., Southampton. Bill accepted by Francis and White, Merchants, &amp;c. Nine Elms, Vauxhall. P. Evison." He said he did not know the amount, for Mr. Smith was to remit him the bill, and he had no doubt but it was a very good one, as Mr. Smith was very particular in money affairs. I said I would give it to my brother, and we would let him know next morning, at No. 14, Grosvenor-place.</p>

On Wednesday morning, the 16th of May, the prisoner, Evison, called-this was the first time that I saw him. He asked me to shew him the carriage which he had purchased, and asked me if I was satisfied with the reference he had given me with respect to the bill? I said I had made inquiry, and found Francis and White were the

             people, and I was perfectly satisfied with the names of the parties, as I understood they were very respectable people, and that a bill on them was as good as a bank note - He said he understood so. I said I would take their acceptance in payment for the carriage.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that all you said with respect to the persons who were to be the acceptors of the bill - A. I told him my brother knew Francis, and often met him at Lloyd's coffee-house. I asked him the amount of the bill? he said he did not know the amount; that he expected Mr. Smith in town, and he would bring the bill with him. I asked him who was the drawer of it? he said he did not know. He said he would let me know when he should want the carriage. I left him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him again - A. On Thursday, about three o'clock, the prisoner, Dickinson, brought me a note, he gave it to me-this is it (producing it) - I read it, and told Dickinson the carriage should be got ready for him, and that I would either go with it, or send somebody. I accompanied the carriage on horseback to No. 14, Lower Grosvenor-place, on Friday, the 8th of May, at two o'clock. As I went I saw the prisoner, Dickinson, in the turning which leads to Pimlico, and inquired of him where No. 14, Lower Grosvenor-place, was? he directed me there-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181806170017"></xptr>I met him about six yards from the place; he was walking towards Buckingham-gate, in a contrary direction, from Lower Grosvenor-place. I found the house according to his direction. When I got there I found Evison in the parlour, and was introduced to him.</p>
               <p>Q. State what passed - A. He asked if the carriage was all right? I said it was. He then produced the bill-this is it-(looking at it) - He said Mrs. Smith was taken ill at Guildford, and Mr. Smith was detained there on that account, and that he was going there with the carriage to meet him. I remarked that the bill was for 139l., and the carriage only came to 120l. He said Mr. Smith would draw on me for 19l. at his leisure. He then rang the bell for a pen and ink, and took down the particulars of the bill, that Mr. Smith might draw on me, to come due about the same time as this bill. I then looked at it - He said they were very respectable people. I told him I had made inquiry, and understood that Francis and White were very respectable people, and I considered it as good as a bank note. He said he understood they were very respectable people, but he did not know anything of them. He wished me to sit down; I told him I was busy, and left him. I immediately rode over to Nine Elms, Vauxhall, with the bill; it was about a mile and a half, I gallopped all the way. I went into the counting-house, presented the bill to one of the clerks, and found the acceptance was forged. I rode back as quick as possible to Lower Grosvenor-place, and found the carriage was gone. I inquired at the toll-bar, went to the Post-master, and learnt which way it had gone, went to Esher, and sent for a constable. I saw the carriage at the first inn that I passed at Esher. The constable came. I went to the inn, into the parlour, and found the prisoners, Evison and Dickinson, sitting at the table, just going to dinner. I recognized Evison, and told him he had given me a bill which was forged. I told Dickinson he had brought me a letter, and that I had supposed him to be Evison's servant-Evison replied, that he had a friend with him, who would soon settle the business-that he was gone out, and would return and satisfy me that every thing was right. I told him if he could do that I should be satisfied, but if he was a rogue I should take him to town. A person of the name of Bennet came into the room, and offered his assistance. I left Evison and Dickinson in the charge of the landlord. I then saw Entwistle in the room - He went into the room of his own accord - I followed him in, and asked him if he came in the carriage with those gentlemen? he said he did. I then gave the constable charge of all three; they were secured in the house. Tilley put Evison and Entwistle into the carriage, and drove with them to Kingston-the constable took the other in a post-chaise.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any conversation pass between you in the carriage - A. Yes; I held them out neither promises nor threats. Entwistle said, if I would stop at Kingston he would settle every thing. Evison said he had given Entwistle instructions to settle every thing. I said if they would convince me that they were honest men I should be satisfied. When we got to Kingston I went into the parlour with Entwistle; he then proposed that if I would let them go, he would pay me for the carriage and all my expences. He said that it was a fraud committed by Evison, but that he knew nothing of it-that it would very much hurt his character, for he was going into business with a Mr. Needharn, and if this was exposed it would hurt his family, his father being a methodist preacher and a man of great respectability. I told him it was a public affair-that I should call Mr. Bennet in to hear what was said, for I should not compound felony. Mr. Bennet came in; I told him of this conversation. Entwistle said it was not right to call Bennet in - I said I considered it was. I went to Bow-street, they were examined.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. When he brought you the bill he did not profess to know who the acceptors were - A. He did not - He left me a paper that I might inquire about them.</p>
               <p>Q. Knowing there were Francis and White, of Vauxhall, you supposed it to be them - A. I knew no other. I made inquiry, and was told there were no other. I made inquiry before I saw him a second time and could find no other. At the second conversation I told him I had made inquiry, and was satisfied with the bill, as they were respectable people - He then told me he was going to Guildford.</p>

            . I am an inn-keeper. I was present when the prisoners were secured at Esher, and assisted in securing them. Entwistle at first refused to be searched, but afterwards consented. They handed the things out of their own pockets - They were sealed up in paper. I made the prisoners put their names on the papers. There were several letters and bills found on Entwistle. I went in the chaise with Dickinson and the constable to Kingston. When I got there, Evison put his head out of the carriage to me, as I stood by the side, and said, "Are they coming? I have empowered Entwistle to settle it with Mr. Powell." - I went into the parlour. Before we got to Bow-street, Evison said he was sorry Entwistle was not permitted to settle it, as they would not be able to prove a forgery, and he knew it to be a fraud. He afterwards said if it was a forgery he knew the person that committed it, but it was not him. We took them to the Brown Bear, in Bow-street. Entwistle said it was a pity it was not settled, as they would not be able to prove the forgery, and it would hurt their characters, and do no good. When Evison was questioned about drawing the bill, he said he was brought up a gentleman. He said he drew the body of the bill, and Dickinson wrote the bottom part, "Dickinson and Co." He was sent out, and Dickinson was called in. Mr. Birnie asked him if he knew anything of the bill? he pretended to know nothing about it at first, but afterwards said, in the presence of Evison, that he and Evison were in partnership together. Mr. Birnie made<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181806170018"></xptr>some remark upon the spelling of the name. He said the plate on their door had not been altered. Entwistle was asked what he knew of it? he said all he knew of it was that he had received a letter from Evison to come and ride with him into the country to buy the carriage of them. He said he knew nothing of the bill. Evison then said he had given the bill to Entwistle to get accepted, and he brought it back.</p>

            . I am constable of Esher. I took the prisoners into custody, and found a number of papers on Entwistle, which were sealed up before his face. I found none of any consequence on the others - I produce them. There are three bills of exchange, one of which is accepted by Francis and White, drawn by 
               <persName id="t18180617-39-person378">G. </persName>
            Dickinson and Co. - the other two are drawn on them, but not accepted, and drawn by another name.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Francis and White, of Nine Elms, Vauxhall, wharfingers, merchants, and Roman cement manufacturers-they carry on business in the name of Messrs. Francis and White. I have lived seven years with them, and know their hand-writting very well(looks at the bill)-Francis and White on this bill is not the hand-writing of either of them. I know of no other Francis and White in that neighbourhood. There is a Mr. White, a coal-merchant, at Nine Elms; he has lived there nine months, and carries on business in his own name, and not in the name of Francis and White - He lives about forty yards from us. I do not know that he keeps any wharfs. I do not know a Mr. Francis.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Letters have come to our house for him by mistake. There is no clerk authorized to accept for Francis and White.</p>
               <p>EVISON'S Defence. Mr. Powell and Bennet are false-no questions of the kind were asked me. Powell never asked me the amount of the bill; the bills were brought to me by Entwistle, who said that a house of the name of Francis and White were anxious to have accommodation bills drawn. I put the signature of the drawer to it. Dickinson is my partner. I know nothing of Francis and White.</p>

               <p>DICKINSON'S Defence. I know nothing of the business. I never saw the bill before it was produced at Esher.</p>

            . I am a jeweller, and live in Grey-street, Blackfriars-road. I know Mr. White, of Nine Elms, Vauxhall, a coal and timber-merchant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time draw an agreement of partnership between him and a Mr. Francis - A. Yes, I produce a copy of it. White informed me he was going into partnership with 
               <persName id="t18180617-39-person381">
                  Peter

            ; on the 20th of April I copied the agreement, and saw White and Francis execute it. White was in possession of a wharf at Nine Elms before this. I knew Francis before, but never saw White before. It was signed at the ship, in Wormwood-street, London-wall-(looks at the bill). - I believe it to be the hand-writing of Francis, who executed this agreement.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. NORTON. I have lived four months in Grey-street. I lived with Messrs. Rundle and Bridge two years ago - I was fourteen years with them. I first saw White on the 20th of April. I have seen cards calling him a coal-merchant - I have known Francis two or three years. When I knew him he lived at Camberwell. I think I could tell his writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoners - A. I never saw Evison or Dickinson till I saw them at Bow-street. I have known Entwistle a short time. I believe he has given Francis credit to some amount - They are acquainted. I do not know whether he is in the habit of accepting bills for him, or not.</p>

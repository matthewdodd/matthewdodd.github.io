                  </hi>. I have a stand in the Borough Market. The prisoner delivered these three bills to me, dated 18th Oct., 25th Oct, and 22nd Nov.—I paid him the amounts that are down here—I saw that the bills were correct, and I kept them on my file—I have frequently seen the prisoner since then, and he asked me to destroy some of those bills—that was after 24th June this year—he said I could very easily do so—I declined to do so.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk and solicitor to the Trustees of the Borough Market. Mr. Tomkins is one of the trustees—the prisoner was appointed to collect the tolls in June, 1856, and so remained till June, 1857—it was his duty to account to me—it was his duty, when tolls were received, to put them in this book, and it was his duty subsequently from this book to make out the bills for the customers, and afterwards to enter the weekly result in the ledger, and to produce that to the trustees—it is entered in the ledger</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Has this matter ever been inquired into before a Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—the prisoner was known to me in his capacity of beadle before he was appointed collector—if he had not conducted himself in a very exemplary manner he would not have been appointed collector—I believe this day book is the prisoner's son's writing—I should not say the prisoner is very illiterate; he cannot write very well—there is not another book besides those I have here which was used in the first instance when tolls were collected—I presume this one to be the toll book—the goods are carted by porters—the porters report to the prisoner the goods to each party, and he enters it in this book—I never heard of another book called the toll book in which such tolls are entered—here is a book called the rent book—these amounts are collected by the prisoner—he was to receive casual rents as well—these sundries mean sundry rents—a certain number are regular standers, week by week; he takes their tolls by name—other persons come casually; he does not know their names, and he puts "Sundries"—the sundries comprise the amount of tolls he receives from casual persons, not standholders—this name "Levy" is, I believe, a porter, who made a return to the prisoner—this entry, "Cases and rail," are cases which come by rail—the rents are entered in this part—we have no means of checking the prisoner with respect to the sundries—they might be double what he enters for what we know—the sundry tolls are very trifling—some are a halfpenny a basket—these amounts are made up of the small tolls—when this matter was first investigated it was before a committee—the prisoner attended as a matter of course, as beadle—he was not in custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When this matter was mentioned, did not the prisoner say, "Every shilling I received I always paid in"? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know that he said that, but he justified himself—I believe he said that he had accounted for all he had received—I think there were about three meetings that he attended before he was taken into custody—I forget whether it was in Sept. or the latter end of Aug. that he was taken, but he was not given into custody till some time afterwards—I gave intimation to the prisoner of these charges, when I knew what they were; I wrote him a letter—that was on Saturday—I did not tell Mr. Solomon before that notice that I should proceed with this indictment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you a good opinion of the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I had no reason to suspect him till this was discovered, or a little time before—a committee was appointed to inquire—there were two or three charges entered into, and it was understood there would be others—I presume the sundries would be paid for at the time—Mr. Monk's was paid once a week—I</p>

               <p>cannot explain how it happened, that if a mistake was made by putting more into the sundries than he ought to have done, that a larger amount was put into his bills—I have looked at the bills which Mr. Monk has got; the amount of them is 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the amount of the prisoner's accounts is about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

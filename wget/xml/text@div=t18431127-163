                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Bradley, of Chelsea. On the night of the 23rd of Nov. I was in Grosvenor-row, Pimlico—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soners together opposite the window of Mr. Hollings', the cheesemonger's shop—they then came to the next shop, to Mr. Notley's—I heard Irish say to Riddle, "Now is the time"—I saw Irish pass a little white handled knife to Riddle, and Irish said, "Now is the time, I will watch, it is all right, "then Riddle took hold of the string of a hat and began to cut it with the knife—I saw some cheese found on Irish, and I saw them come from the cheesemonger's shop.</p>

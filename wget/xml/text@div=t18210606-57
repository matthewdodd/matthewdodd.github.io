No; I am not certain that he brought the first note; I believe him to be the same, but did not notice him at the time; he came with this note, but I cannot swear to him. The person asked for a black silk waistcoat, which came to 5 s., he tendered me a 1 l. Bank note; I begged of him to write his name and address on it - he did so - I could not read it, as I can neither read nor write. I carried it to Mr. Harrison's shop, over the way, and delivered it to Thomas, the shopman, for change, he wrote on it, and put it into the till. I immediately stepped over the way, gave the person 15 s., and he went away directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the prisoner, and say whether you are enabled to say he came on any day to your shop - A. He did; it was the next day, or the next but one, but I think the next day; he asked for a blue coat, I asked 1 l. for it - he gave me a 1 l. Bank note, I said,</p>
               <p>"Please to write your name and address;" he did so. I then carried it to my wife to write on it. She read what he had written, he said that was right; she put her name on it, and put into her pocket. He went away immediately with the coat - he had not got the silk waistcoat on. The evening after we took it we went to No. 8, Baltic-street, Old-street-road, to enquire for the prisoner, but could not find him - there was no such person there - we enquired for

               <p>"I am the man, Sir, but don't hurt me." I do not recollect his saying any thing else. We went with him along Grub-street, and in Grub-street, he gave me a 1 l. note, and I believe his words were</p>

I told him I had been to No. 8, Baltic-street, and I think he said in his flurry, he put down the wrong direction. I did not particularly notice what he said, as I was flurried myself. I did not use him roughly when I collared him.</p>

            . I am an inspector of the Bank of England, and have been so about seventeen years. (looks at the note, No. 70159) It is forged in all parts, it bears the signature of</p>
               <p>"R. Clough;" there was no such signing clerk at the time the note is dated. We had such a signing clerk of 1 l. notes, but at this time, he was a signer of 5 l. notes - it is not his writing; (looks at 70161, uttered on the 24th of April) this is forged in all respects, the same as the other - they are off the same plate, the same paper, the same date and signature, and both indorsed</p>

            , No. 8, Baltic-street." I have no doubt but the indorsements are the same hand-writing; the note found on the prisoner is also forged in every respect. I cannot make out the signature - it is off the same plate, and the same paper, and bears the same character of hand-writing, but the name is not the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are they forged sufficiently well to impose on an ignorant person - A. They may - they are badly executed. I is not the same sort of wove paper as the Bank use.</p>

            . I was a signing clerk, and am now a cashier. On the 20th of February, 1821, I signed no notes under 5 l. I have signed 1 l. notes for many years, I left off in 1818. The signature on the notes is not mine - there is no other clerk of my name.</p>

I gave him one of the notes - he asked me to put my name on it; my father was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182106060038"></xptr>moving, and I did not know where to, so I put the name the gentleman gave me, and next morning I was in Barbican, Warner tapped me on the shoulder, and said, I passed a bad note at his shop; he took me to his house, and asked if I had any notes. I said, I had one, but did not know whether it was bad or no; he said,</p>

                  </hi>. I deal in household furniture, at Crown-court, Golden-square—I have known the prisoner two or three months—I supplied him with some furniture, for which he was paying me at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he is a porter at the Western Literary Institution. On Thursday, 2nd Nov., he called on me before half-past twelve o'clock in the day, and proposed that we should go out together—we went to a public-house, and had two quarterns of gin—I drank one small glass; he drank the remainder with some water—we went to two or three shops—he made purchases at each—he said he would pay me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. then, instead of between three and four, which was his usual time—we drank a quartern of rum—I drank about one-third of it, and he the remainder in water again—we then went towards Leicester-square—he was not sober, but was far from drunk—he walked very well—he asked if I would be answerable to a loan society for him for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and if I would he would give me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the accommodation, and pay me 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more off my bill, which Mould be giving me one out of four—I declined—he bit his lips, and appeared confused, and said, "You certainly might do that, for it is a small amount"—I said, "I will do it on no terms whatever," and he was not to ask me such a question again—when we got to his house he went down stairs—I followed a few yards behind him—he was at the kitchen door before I got to the bottom, he stooped down, as I suppose, to put the basket out of his hand at the kitchen door, but he turned round and struck me over the left temple with an instrument between two and three feet long—it was a similar instrument to this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it struck me on the left temple—I have the mark now—it staggered me at least two yards, but did not strike me to the ground—I recovered myself, and grappled with him by the hips, to try to throw him back on the mat by the kitchen door, but my strength failed me, and he threw me off, lifted his arm again, and the blow fell on my left shoulder—it broke my collar-bone, and I fell down and lost my senses—he did not say one word before he attacked me in this way—I became insensible—after some time I partly came to myself, and in about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes I contrived to get home—I then fell on the bed and fainted—my head and clothes were covered with blood—I was afterwards seen by Mr. Harding, a surgeon.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I saw the prosecutor on the day this happened—he was in bed—his head and face were bloody, and on washing it I found a cut over the left eye, and a very considerable bruise and swelling, showing that he had received a severe blow—the skin was divided—it might have been inflicted with such an instrument as this—I examined his shoulder next morning, and found a fracture of the collar-bone, which I think was very likely to have been the consequence of a blow with the same instrument—he is still suffering from the effects of the injury—he is pretty nearly well now.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Was the wound from a blow or a fall? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could not tell—it might have been occasioned by a fall—I think that the fracture of the collar-bone was not from a fall—it was broken near the shoulder joint, and a fracture in that situation is generally considered to be occasioned by direct force applied—a fracture from a fall generally takes place in the centre of the bone—I would not say it was impossible.</p>

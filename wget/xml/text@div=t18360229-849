                  </hi>. The prisoner was in my service eight or nine months—I lost two petticoats, a table cloth, a broach, and a breast-pin—I have seen the broach since—the prisoner left me without notice in January, I think—it is above month ago.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Luxford. The prisoner sold me the petticoat, now produced, for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., ten weeks ago, and this table cloth three or four days after—I gave them both to Chiteenden, the constable she told me they were both her own.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of Woodwich, I apprehended the prisoner, and told her I took her on a charge of stealing several articles from Mr. Hudson, of Warwick-street—she denied all knowledge of them—I receives a petticoat and table-cloth from Luxford</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183602290213"></xptr>
               <p>next morning—I read over a list of articles to the prisoner—she said she could account for how she came by them, and would do it before the Magistrate—I afterwards asked Mrs. Hudson, in her presence, if she authorised her to dispose of them; and she declared she had gives her nothing, and did not know she had any thing—the prisoner did not contra<lb></lb>dict her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. The witness took me to the prosecutor's house, and asked his wife if she gave me leave to part with anything—she denied it—I said, if she denied it, it was no use my saying any thing—I asked her if I had not procured her different comforts which her husband would not allow her, and she acknowledged it. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. She did not admit that the prisoner had procured articles unknown to her husband—she said she had brought in some small quantity of food, but not at her request—the prisoner was a nurse at the workhouse, and she was in the habit of supplying herself at times with things the house did not allow, but not for Mrs. Hudson; she asked her to take part of them—when I asked Mrs. Hudson, I said, "Have you authorised the prisoner at any time to dispose of any articles for sale or pledge, to procure any sustenance whatever, which your husband does not know of?"—she said, "I have not at any time allowed her to take any articles, nor has she with my knowledge she brought a little bit of pork and sausage into the house, but not at my request, nor for my sup<lb></lb>port; I always had victuals of my own."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I went to nurse the prosecutor's wife, and was there better than seven months—he is a miserly old man, and almost starved his wife—I frequently, with my own money, got the old lady nourishment—she is given to drink, and lives more on that than on food—when she wanted nourishment, he used to say, where was he to get it, and said she might starve—I have frequently procured her several things, as roast pork, sausages, and ham, and half-quartern loaves without number—she was never contented but when she had liquor—I have made away with my own things for her—I would pawn any thing rather than starve as she did—I had to go the workhouse, the parish-officers kept me till twelve o'clock—I then went to dinner, and when I went to the prosecutor, he had got another nurse, and I came away.</p>

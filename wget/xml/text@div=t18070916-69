Yes; I got up about six o'clock; I missed my pocket apron, a gown, two silk handkerchief's, a shift, and the money, two guineas and eight shillings; the prisoner is a brother in law of mine; I slept in his room; the prisoner and his wife laid on the bed; to the best of my knowledge he only took off his coat, because about a little after one he asked for his coat.</p>

            . On the 5th of August, about eight o'clock in the evening I was going up Dean-street, Soho, with my brother officer; I heard a noise in the street; when I came up, I heard the prosecutrix charging the prisoner that he had robbed her; she gave me charge of him. I took him to St. Ann's watchhouse; the prosecutrix said he had got her handkerchief on his neck; I took it off. The prisoner said I believe it was his own; here is the shift that was taken out of the crown of his hat, by my brother officer.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury, this charge is totally false, I went to my room, I found it distressed of all the things; I took this old handkerchief and the shift, or rather a shift without a tail. If Mrs. Walker was here she could contradict her; if I would have married her sister this prosecution would have never been.</p>

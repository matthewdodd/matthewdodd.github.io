               <p>Q. Was any enquiry made to you about the road to London - A. They never asked for the road to London. We conversed a little while, when I asked them for the toll, he said he would pay me when he came back; I asked him who the cart belonged to; he told me the cart belonged to Mr. Dodd; then I said you shall not go through without paying me the toll; he said I must give him change - what is your change - a shilling; I told him to hand me over the money, I would give him the change; he gave me the shilling; I put my hand in my pocket and gave him sixpence, then I released him and away he went. His toll was sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. From your observations of him, do you know that he was the person that drove the cart - A. Yes; he told me the cart belonged to Mr. Dodd. It was harnessed up in an odd kind of manner; I can say that I can swear to the horse and cart; I have seen the horse and cart through my gate three times a week; that is the horse that was in the cart that is in the yard, I have seen it; it was harnessed in an odd way, with rope under and over the back. I stood by the harness while I was discoursing with him, and put my hand upon it.</p>

               <p>COURT. Can you swear to the horse - are you certain that horse in the yard is the horse that went through your gate - A. I am sure that is the horse that went through the gate; I did not mind the marks; I know that it is the horse that went through my gate, seeing it so many times.</p>
               <p>Mr. Curwood. You have but few horses come through your gate - A. Some nights none; I had just let a team through before, but not a horse and cart; only that horse and cart; I saw it next at Hatton-garden.</p>

               <p>Q. What reason had you for not liking it - A. I was loth to swear to him; I was sure he was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Why were you loth to swear to him when you saw him at the office - A. I never did take an oath before.</p>
               <p>Q. No doubt of that - if you knew he was the man why were you loth to swear to him, when you were sworn to tell the truth - if you had no doubt of his being the man why did not you not swear that he was the man - A. I did not choose.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us your reason for not choosing - A. I did not like to take an oath to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you like to swear to him if you knew him - if you had a doubt you did right, but if you had not a doubt, why did not you swear to him - A. I did not choose.</p>

               <p>Q. Do not other carts make so much noise as your brother's - do you mean to swear that no other cart made so much noise as your brother's cart - A. I cannot swear that, but it made a lumping noise; I used it three or four times a week. I got up, I saw the cart, I had a great suspicion by the noise that it was my brother's cart; I saw two slimmish young men in the cart. It was moon-light, a; bright as day; I thought I knew it by the noise.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know it by looking at it - A. I thought I knew it by the noise; there were two slight young men in it, one of them seemed to lay back in the straw; they seemed to be as near the size of the prisoners, as nigh as I can tell.</p>

Yes; I was going to my horse up Maiden lane; I observed about half a mile up the lane, a cart drawed into the ditch and the horse of the other side, tied to a bush, grazing in Mr. Dennett's field.</p>

Near two o'clock in the day, I cannot tell exactly what time it was, it was very late in the day; I came down Maiden-lane to get some victuals; I saw that small boy bring the horse out of Mr. Dennett's field; he tied him to the wheel of the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Were either of the prisoners about the cart then - A. No; I never saw them any more till I saw them at Hatton Garden.</p>

            , my master (he lives in Maiden-lane, St. Pancras) sent me after his horses, between nine and ten in the morning; I went up the lane to bring the horses to go to work; I saw a boy and I saw a cart in a ditch in the lane, by the side of a bank, and the horse was in Mr. Dennett's field.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the horse today - A. Yes; it was the same horse that is in the yard; and I have seen the cart to day over the way. Between five and six in the evening my master ordered me to bring the horses again to work, after having turned them out; as I was coming down the lane I saw the little boy again and the two prisoners, they were all three together, they were going up the lane towards the cart and horse, the horse was then in the field; I asked them whether they would take the horse out of the field, or else they would get it pounded; they said (all three) we are going off at five o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did all three speak - A. I did not take notice which of them said it; one of them said we are going off at five o'clock; I do not know which it was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Are you sure the answer was we are going off at five o'clock - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Curwood. You say you did not take notice who gave you the answer - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you saw the little boy - you are not quite certain who made the answer, it might be him - A. It might be.</p>
               <p>JAMES PETERS. I live in Maiden-lane, about a mile up. On the 6th of March, about six o'clock in the evening, I saw a cart and a dark brown coloured horse, almost a black. I saw the cart to day, and the horse I saw yesterday in the yard. The cart was standing on the road side, with one wheel drawed in the ditch against the bank; the horse stood of the opposite side of the lane, grazing in the lane, almost opposite of the cart; I took notice of the cart; my little boy was with me; I saw these two prisoners and a small boy in the lane, they were apparently to me playing at marbles about an hundred yards from the cart. I went towards the bottom of the lane, I met two men, I assisted in taking the prisoners.</p>

            . I am an officer belonging to Hatton Garden office. In consequence of information I apprehended the prisoner on the 6th of March, a little before seven in the evening, in Maiden-lane; I was in company with Davies, from whom I received the information; I came to the cart, one wheel of which stood in the ditch on the left hand side of the lane, it was pretty well full of loose straw; I felt in the cart and I felt these two prisoners legs, and a boy there was.</p>
               <p>Q. You felt the legs of three persons - 
               <persName id="t18090412-45-person464">A. </persName>
            I did, and it turned out to be the two prisoners, they were covered with straw; I first felt them and called out to know who was there; I said who have you got there; they jumped up and shewed their heads; I whistled for Davies; and the boy belonging to these prisoners attempted to get out of the cart; I made them get out of the cart, and I secured them; the horse was then in the field on one side of the cart, just a little over the bank, which the horse might get up, as there were very few bushes; I secured them; being dark I put some knives that I took from them in my pocket; I found a dollar and a few shillings on Ezekiel. After their examination they wished to have their knives; Robert owns one knife, and 
               <persName id="t18090412-45-person465">Ezekiel</persName>
             the other. They have asked me several times for the knives; yesterday I was down below in the yard where the prisoners were, I shewed them both the knives; Robert said the old knife was his, and Ezekiel owned the new one.</p>
               <p>Q. When you apprehended them did you ask them who they were and where they lived - A. I did; they told me that they lived at Mrs. Norris's, Porter's-buildings, Twister's-alley, Bunhill-row; and that they laid down in the cart for half an hour; I enquired according to that direction, I was not able to discover that they lived there; I went to the house that they directed me to; the people of the house told me that they did not know them. I searched the house there were only two rooms.</p>
               <p>Mr. Curwood. It was a very cold night - A. It was coolish and very dark.</p>

               <p>Mr. Curwood. Do you know when you lost that knife - A. I know I had that knife on that day; I never saw it after; I make no doubt the knife was taken when my tools were taken; the cart was gone from my house that night as I used the knife in the day; I lost the tools in the night, and the knife at the same time, I make no doubt; I am not able to say whether the knife was left in the same place as the tools or not; I believe it was; I used it on the 5th in picking the dirt from under the heels of my boots; I used it in my own house part, and part where my tools are.</p>

               <p>Esckiel Lockleader's Defence. We were walking up the lane in the morning to meet my sister, she was gone up to Highgate, and we walked by the cart; I said to my brother we may as well sit down on the cart till my sister comes up; we sat down in the cart; it was very cold, we laid down in the cart, and throwed the straw over us, thinking we should hear her come by. My brother's knife was a round pointed knife; when Mr. Hancock shewed it us, I told him it was too far off, I could not tell.</p>

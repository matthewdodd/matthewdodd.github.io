                  </hi>. I am a baker, living in Halfmoon-street, Piecadilly. The prisoner was my servant for eight months, up to the 24th of March—in consequence of suspicions I went to her box in the kitchen—it was unlocked—she was not present—I found a large bag of flour in it, weighing ten pounds and a half—I let it remain—I had not missed any flour—the foreman and my two sons compared it with what was in the sack which we were using—I found the quality was equal.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an umbrella-maker. I saw Groves and Freeland together on the evening after the robbery, at the corner of White Horse-court, Whitecross-street—a party passed them, and Groves asked him if he would have anything to drink—Groves put his hand in his pocket, and pulled out more than one sovereign and some silver—I saw no more of them—they had some<lb></lb>thing to drink together—the next evening I saw them together, and Groves had money then—he was in conversation with others, but not the prisoners—I heard Freeland say he had let Groves in in the after part of the day, and con<lb></lb>cealed him in the beer cellar; and during that time be fed him several times with provisions, and when the time was appointed for the robbery, Groves let them in, and Freeland said he got in at the window, and got the things out of his master's bed-room; that he got the keys and opened what doors required opening, and young M'Carthy was there at the time—he said he did not like it, and he would go and get a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> or barrow to take the things away—Groves did not say whether it was so or was not, he could hear what Freeland said, but when the coat was mentioned he was not there—he said, he had pawned a coat for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I did not hear him say where he got it—four or five days after the burglary, I saw <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> M'Carthy with the Burkes—he and <hi rend="italic">Andy</hi> Burke said they had done a good thing—I heard cloth mentioned—I in<lb></lb>formed Mr. Clementson—I heard old Mr. M'Carthy say he had had a good <hi rend="italic">flare up</hi>, and I heard another party say to him; "Well, you may have a good <hi rend="italic">fare up</hi> because it comes easy to you"—I think this was on the Tuesday, in Whitecross-street; his wife was with him, and two strange men.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

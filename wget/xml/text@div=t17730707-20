            . I am a constable: I was called up between two and three o'clock. I live close to the watch-house; I took them in charge; one had a brown coat on, the other a black one; they desired to be taken to New Prison; I asked them the reason why; they said they had rather go there; I took them there; when we came there, one of the turnkeys said, have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177307070032"></xptr> you searched them; he searched them but nothing was found upon them; Murray had the great coat on and Holmes the black coat; I ordered them to come up to the Justice's; when we came there a turnkey brought the great coat upon his arm; I said to Holmes you had a black coat on; the turnkey went to fetch it; he said he had left it in gaol. Here are the great coats (producing them).</p>
               <p>Q. Have you kept them ever since?</p>

               <p>Massey. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the anniseed delivered to you?</p>
               <p>Massey. Yes, by two watchmen; and the table cloth has been in my custody ever since. (They were all produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>I was going down to Deptford to work; I saw these things lying on the ground; Holmes smelt at the cask, and said it was good liquor, and it was a pity to leave it behind; I said we had better take it with us to serve our shipmates; we were going to work at some ship. The watchman stopped us as we were going through Featherstone-street.</p>

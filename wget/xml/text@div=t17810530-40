               <p>Before I went to bed I saw the house was fast: I fastened the doors and windows with my own hand. In the morning I found my chamber window was opened, and a piece of it broke off: the sash was down, and whole, when I went to bed; I was in bed at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300039"></xptr> time; I take it to have been done between one and two o'clock; I was waked by the noise; I pulled by the curtain, and I saw my gown half out of the window; when I went to bed, I laid it on a chair back. We had a great wash; there were seven-shifts in the platter, that had not been put by. I saw the platter was empty; I was in such a fright, I could hardly open the door, but it was God's mercy he did not kill me.</p>
               <p>You was not waked with the breaking the window? - No, with the going out. I burn a rush-light; that was blown out; the maid went and fetched my daughter, who lives a little way off. I had some handbills printed, and dispersed. The prisoner was very ragged the day before; the next day he had good clothes on. The keys were taken out of my pocket, and the beaufet opened, and the tankard, pint mug, and spoons taken out. I lost all the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) The dollar I had had above forty years: my husband gave it me before I was married; and the housewife and dollar were found on the prisoner when he was taken: I saw them at the justice's.</p>

His breeches pocket being turned, he put his hand into his breeches pocket, and took five guineas and some silver and this dollar out (producing it).

               <p>I took the prisoner into custody, in Red-Lion-street: he was pretty resolute. I got a coach, and brought him down to Shadwell; the justice was not there; he was at the Rotation-office. Farrell came up to me, to Whitechapel, and searched him in the parlour, and found five guineas, that housewife, and that dollar upon him. I knew the prisoner, and seeing him with new clothes, I suspected he was concerned in this fact.</p>

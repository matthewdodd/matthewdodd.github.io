             BAILEY. I am the prosecutor's wife; his statement is correct: nobody but the prisoner had access to the house - the box was locked safe; I had seen it half an hour before - the purse has not been found; it was a red net one - the notes were at one end of it, and the gold at the other.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Are not the lodgers frequently in the parlour? A. The lodger is a respectable old lady, and was not in the room for three hours before.</p>
               <p>MARGARET HERBURT. The prisoner came about half-past eight o'clock on the morning of the 30th, to my house in Bull-yard, Broad-street, Bloomsbury; she said she had just left her place, and wanted a room for her clothes - I had a room to let; I saw her with a red net purse, with gold at one end of it, and some paper at the other end - she gave me a sovereign out of it to change.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Newman, a linen-draper, of Little Russell-street. On Friday, the 30th of October, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner bought some articles, amounting to between 3l. and 4l., and paid for them in gold; I saw her with a red net purse, with some paper in it, but cannot say they were notes - she tendered me a 5l. note before she gave me the gold, but I would not take it.</p>
               <p>MR. BAILEY. I got one of the notes from Bristol - here it is.</p>

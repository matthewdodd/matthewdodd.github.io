               <p>Q. What past after this? - I don't know, I did not see him any more, the door was shut, and I never see him again.</p>
               <p>Q. What door? - The outer door of the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Who shut the door? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. After this what was done to the house? - I was in at the neighbours. The minute the door was shut I ran backward to my house, and ran in and fetched a key, and locked another door at the end of the passage, nor joining to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Does your house stand up a passage? - Up a long passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Then by the door of the passage, you mean the door at the outer end of the passage in the street? - Yes. I went in to search a key to lock another door that is at the end of that passage.</p>
               <p>Q. You went in doors into your own house? - Yes. Before I came into my yard, I tried my neighbour's door at the side, to run into their house, but it was fast.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lock that door of your's? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You tried your neighbour's at the side that is in the passage, I suppose? - Yes; and I stood in the yard about a minute; while I stood there, the inner door was burst open, the pannel burst through; the second door of the passage that I locked; I thought then I must make my escape, and I went up one pair of stairs, I could not come out but at a window.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you at the time that the pannel was burst through? - I was in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean the pannel was broke? - Yes, a wide pannel. I then went up stairs of my own house, and I was lifted out of window over the boards of a small parlour, into a neighbour's house, and assisted into their house, and I saw no more of the men.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you were being lifted into your neighbour's house, who were about the house? - Immediately as I got out of the house, the mob came in; the servants of the house cried out, Mrs. Ostliff will be killed, and people came and helped me out of the house.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160137"></xptr>Q. Did you see the mob? - I did not get up to look at them.</p>

               <p>Q. When the mob went away how did you find your house? - They were above three hours and upwards I think before the gurards could come.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what damages were done. - There was a great deal of damages, the furniture was all broke.</p>
               <p>Q. Never mind the furniture. What damage was done to your house? - The windows broke, the bricks a good deal hurt by throwing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the window frames? - Some of the window frames were entirely out, and I had some gentleman's property that were going out of England, with books, and trunks of wearing apparel, and my own clothes, every thing was taken away; these things were taken out into the street, and broke to pieces and tore.</p>
               <p>Q. I think your husband was not at home at this time? - He had not been in town for these seven months.</p>
               <p>Q. You lived in the house? - I lived in the house all the time.</p>

               <p>Q. How long has your house been without a licence? - It is three or four years; I cannot tell exactly. It had no licence before my husband came to it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not Mr. Ostliff carry on the recruiting business for himself, before he went down in the country? - He did, but not after.</p>

               <p>Q. Then serjeant Steward, at that time, did not belong to colonel Blake's regiment? - No, he did not.</p>

               <p>Q. You, letting the house to colonel Blake, was permitted yourself to lay in a bed chamber there? - Yes; I let the apartments for a guinea a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Then was the house colonel Blake's or your's after you had so let it? - I was the mistress of it, I lived in it; I only let the lodgings to colonel Blake.</p>

               <p>Q. What rent do you yourself pay for the house? - Two and thirty pounds a year.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, the parlour, bed room, and dining room that you keep, do you keep them entirely to yourself; not your bed room, but your parlour and dining room? You told us there was a recruit drinking tea with you. Did they, or did they not use any one of the rooms in common with you? - If they are gentlemen I let them eat, dine and breakfast with me. I never had any body but what was very quiet.</p>

               <p>Q. You say that your house was down a long passage from the street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Does any part of your house come into the street? - No, only this door at the end of a long passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing paid to you for any assistance you gave to these men? Did colonel Blake give you any thing for furnishing these men with victuals, or any thing of that sort? - No; I had nothing but a guinea a week of him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that passage to your house? - I cannot say how long; it was the depth of a house, two rooms in depth.</p>
               <p>Q. Somewhere about ten yards perhaps? - There was a room in the front and another room in my yard.</p>
               <p>Q. There are two doors in the passage, and both of them must be past before your house could be come at? - Yes, they must.</p>
               <p>Q. Your house had another door besides these two doors in the passage? - There is another door, but then you can look over it.</p>

               <p>Q. You are enabled to form a plan of the premises on paper, so that you can explain the form of the house to his lordship? - I have just done it. The outer door of the passage, you enter it from Charing Cross, that is a covered passage by one or both of the houses adjoining, on the one pair of stairs floor, each of the houses adjoining to that passage have a door in it; that passage, I believe may be about twenty-four feet long, at the end of which there is a door, which goes into the yard belonging to Ostliff's house, that yard, I believe, may be about fifteen feet square, at the further side of the yard is the door of the dwelling house; on the left hand side is what was called the tap room, and on the right the kitchen, each of them having a window looking into the yard; on the left hand side of the yard there is a small room, to which you enter by a door from the yard only, and in which room there is a window which looks into the yard; on the right hand side of the yard there are two small rooms, to the first you enter from the kitchen, and to which there is a window looking into the yard; to the inner room you can only enter from the last room, and that is lighted by a sky light; these rooms on the right and on the left side of the yard are one story high only, and it was over there where, I presume, Mrs. Ostliff made her escape, into one of the back windows of her neighbour's house.</p>
               <p>Q. So that the house of Ostliff is perfectly distinct from the others that have their doors in that passage? - Clearly so.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160140"></xptr>Q. Was any answer made? - The answer was made that there was none fold in the house; it was made by me for one, that there was none fold in the house, nor had there been any for some time; he said, he would be d-ed but he would have some. I went to the young man that came with him, Hollis, and desired him to walk out, not to breed a riot there Lewis got up and -</p>
               <p>Q. Had he been sitting? - Yes, he was sitting at the same time. Lewis got up, and the lad said, he would go out, he did not mean any offence.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Lewis got up from his seat? Yes. Hollis was going, Lewis took the lad Hollis by the collar and brought him back again; he then swore he would be d-ed if he should not come back and have some porter. We then told him again that the licence was lost, and there was no porter, nor any other liquor sold there, Lewis said he did not care for that, he would have porter I then told Lewis if he did not go, I would acquaint his colonel of him to-morrow; he then said he did not care a d-mn for that, he belonged to the third regiment of guards; and shewed me the buttons at the same time; he then said that we were a set of knidnapping thieves. Steward then took Lewis by the collar and led him to the street door.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say the street door, do you mean, the door coming out of the house into the yard, or the door at the end of the passage? - The door at the end of the passage the further end against the street.</p>
               <p>Q. That which goes to Charing Cross? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did any thing pass between them in the passage, that you heard, of any consequence? - Nothing that I heard of any consequence.</p>
               <p>Q. When Steward got him to the end of the passage, what became of him? - A recruit that we had in the house, Galway, was shutting the door, Lewis then turned round and kicked the recruit on the thigh, and said, he was one of the party.</p>
               <p>Q. After this what became of him? - A short time after that, about five or six minutes, when the door was shut -</p>
               <p>Q. When was it shut? - He immediately shut the door, and shut both Lewis and the lad that came with him out.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the lad come along the passage, from the room of the house to to the end of the passage, out at the street door? - He went before Lewis, by himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the recruit immediately shut the door? - Yes, after he received the kick.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you say Hollis had gone down the passage before Steward took Lewis down? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Then Galway shut the door, and Lewis and Hollis were both shut out into the street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the door remain shut before any thing else happened that you will have to relate? - I believe it was about five or six minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way was it shut, when Galley had shut to the door? - There was a spring lock, I believe, on the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other fastening? - There were bolts.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these bolts bolted on the door being shut? - Not then.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of you after the door was shut? - We all went back into the house, and about five or six minutes afterwards I went to the door to open it, I went by myself; when I opened the door Lewis was standing in the middle of the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it by accident that you went to open the door, or did any thing happen to occasion you to do it? - Nothing happened<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160141"></xptr> that occasioned me to open it, it was generally kept open.</p>
               <p>Q. You observed Lewis in the middle of the road? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by the middle of the road? - In the middle of the street, by Charing Cross.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the lad? - He was standing there, and Hollis, the lad near to him.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see any people then about? - None at all; he comes up to me, and struck me, and said, d-mn your kidnapping eyes, there, take that; there were two grenadiers that were standing by they got before the door, and prevented me from going into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they interfere? - They did, they swore that if I attempted to come in they would knock my eyes out.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they standing when you said so? - At the street door, both of them, they got between me and the door.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you said that you see no people by at the time? - Not before he struck me, they came up while he was striking me, and got between me and the door.</p>
               <p>Q. What past after this? - I was obliged to defend myself for some considerable time against Lewis.</p>
               <p>Q. When those grenadiers prevented you, did Lewis do any thing? - He came up to strike me, and repeated striking me for some considerable time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing more to you? - Not then.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you say you was desending yourself as well as you could against Lewis? - Yes, till such times as a gentleman belonging to the next house adjoining to the street door, went to get into his house, he assisted me in getting me from the door; I was obliged to get into his house, the grenadiers prevented me from coming into the passage; as I was going in Lewis called out, stop the kidnapping thief; he then told the mob -</p>
               <p>Q. Did the people begin to assemble then? - A very great number, there were then several hundreds before I could get in doors.</p>
               <p>Q. How many, speak within moderate compass, might there be about this house, before Lewis spoke to that mob? - Two hundred. He told them there were people chained down in the cellar, and one nearly dead; I heard him myself, he spoke these words as I was trying to get in.</p>
               <p>Q. In what cellar did he say? - In the King's Arms, in the cellar belonging to the house; he said there were back ways to escape by water.</p>
               <p>Q. This was spoke to the multitude that was there? - They were all there, and he spoke it out loud in order that they might stop me. I then got into the door of the house adjoining the passage, and got through the passage into our own house; the front door adjoining the street was then shut and bolted; I don't know who fastened it.</p>

               <p>Q. The front door of the passage you mean? - Yes, I went up and see it myself shut and bolted; I then sent for a constable to search the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you send? - I don't know any name in particular, but any one I could find.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went for the constable? - The landlord's daughter of the next house adjoining; I desired that somebody would go for a constable in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. There being a house on each side of the passage, they could hear you desire that somebody would bring a constable? - There were several people with me then in the passage; I desired somebody to go that was in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Was a constable brought? - There was one immediately,

In the mean while they broke open the front door, but there are two other doors before we came to the house door, and they were all fastened.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you do any thing else to any other door? - I shut one of them to, somebody else shut one of the others.</p>
               <p>Q. Which did you do yourself? - The last door in the passage; there is a middle door in the passage, then there is the passage door from the yard to the passage; I shut and bolted it myself, I don't know which it was.</p>

               <p>Q. What other doors were shut and bolted? - The middle door prevents us from going into the next house, that comes into our passage.</p>

               <p>Q. But they do not all shut up the passage of Ostliff's house? - Yes, they do.</p>
               <p>Court. At the end of the passage there is a door that opens into the yard, that was also secured? - Yes, it was, it was pushed to, but I did not lock it myself.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you see them rather on this side of the passage? - Yes, in the yard; some of us got out of the house before they came into the yard, after they made these oaths.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay before you made your escape yourself? - I staid a very short time, but they were all gone before me, I got out and assisted them out, and got in again.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did you assist them out? - I got on to the leads, there was a little parlour a little distance, adjoining to the house.</p>

               <p>Q. By which they made their escape? - Yes, I remained in the yard a short time, till they came into the yard, some of them.</p>
               <p>Q. You made your escape at last the same way? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you made your escape were you in any situation where you could see what happened in Ostliff's house? - Yes. I was up in the house where we made our escape, in the top garret, and which overlooks the place.</p>
               <p>Q. Now what past within your opportunity of seeing it? - I see him go into the house, and bring out the goods, linen, furniture, and bedding.</p>
               <p>Q. Not the whole of it? - No, there was a little left in the top garret, which they could not go to, they brought out linen and boxes with clothes, and the furniture, nearly all that was below; it was entirely destroyed in the streets.</p>
               <p>Q. Having this opportunity of looking at them, to speak within moderate compass, how many people might come into your house? - The first I see was two little boys, I believe two little blue coat boys.</p>

               <p>Q. Describe particularly; how did they begin, and what did they do? how far did they go with the windows, and window frames? - They took the pieces<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160144"></xptr>of the door that they had before broke open, and beat the window frame in with it.</p>
               <p>Q. When they got these piece of doors, what did they do with them? - Broke the windows and frames.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they knock them out? - Yes, frames and glasses, altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you think you continued in this position, where you had the opportunity of overlooking? - I continued till the horse guards came, sometimes looking in the street, and sometimes looking there.</p>
               <p>Q. What, your situation enabled you to look into the street as well as to the house? - Yes, there was a front garret to the house, from that I could get into the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see any thing further about the house? - Nothing further.</p>
               <p>Q. Either in the one place or the street, or the passage, did you see any thing of Lewis, the prisoner? - Not at all, I see nothing of Lewis after the door was shut, as I mentioned before.</p>
               <p>Q. You see nothing of him after you went into this gentleman's house adjoining the passage? - Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. And then the horse guards came? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it from the beginning of this affair, to the time that the horse guards came? - I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>Q. It might be two or three hours? - Yes, I dare say it was, as near as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing when the horse guards came? what time did you get to examine the house? - Nearly eleven, or twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came into the street did you observe any thing of Lewis then? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you came into the street? - I did not go into the street directly, there was such a mob round the door; I got into the house the same way as I got out.</p>

               <p>Q. When you had any opportunity of examining the house, about eleven or twelve o'clock, what observation did you make on it? - It was a mere skeleton, the furniture was all out.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any part of the brick work loose? - I do not remember.</p>
               <p>Q. How were me cases of the doors and the cases of the windows? - All entirely broke to pieces, there was not one lost at all at the bottom part.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the inside of the house, the partitions? - Torn about very much, all broke to pieces, nearly so.</p>
               <p>Q. Now the prisoner and Hollis came into the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no door shut, but they came in at once? - Yes, the door was always kept open in the day time.</p>
               <p>Q. It was five o'clock, in the month of July when they came? - Some where there abouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any the least pretence for such a tale as this man had put, of their being men chained down in the cellar, and of their escape by water? - None in the least, nor never was to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Was their any other recruit but Galway? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. And that man helped to put him out of the house? - He shut the door after him; Galway came back to the house, and got out of the window likewise, to make his escape, the same way as I did.</p>

               <p>Q. I believe you are a constable? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sent for to this house on the 6th of July? - On the 12th of July Mrs. Ostliff's servant came up</p>
               <p>Q. You was sent for to this house? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day? - Half after six, to a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. You came to the house? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search the house? - I did, at Mrs. Ostliff's request, to see if there was any body confined in the house, as the mob said there was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any person confined? - Not a soul, but a little boy about fourteen years of age, a servant girl and a recruit.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any confined in the house? - None, and the boy and girl were servants of her's.</p>
               <p>Q. These persons, were they confined or imprisoned? - None in the least; all frighted out of their wits.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any trap doors in the house? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search with a view to discover whether there were any trap doors or not? - I did, all over the house, at her request.</p>
               <p>Q. And you found none at all? - There was none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you made this search, were there many persons about the house? - A number of people assembled, I dare say to the amount of two hundred.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they peaceable and orderly at that time? - No, very riotous.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way were they riotous? - They said it was a kidnapping house, and there were a number of people confined, and I contradicted them, and said it was no such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had searched the house, did you tell the people on the outside what appeared to you? - I came out and said, I am well known in this parish.</p>
               <p>Q. When you said that, you contradicted them; was it after you searched the house? - It was, and I offered to resign myself to the mob, if I did not tell them the truth, and if any one of them would go in with me, I said I would take any one in with me, but I would not go in with more; repeatedly I said to them, where is the drummer, the man that has made this riot? they told me he was over the way; I went over the way to him, and I found him sitting in the Ship, in the kitchen, at Charing Cross, with a pot of beer before him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that drummer again if you was to see him? - That was the young man at the bar. I said to him, young man you have been guilty of a very great indiscretion, in making a riot about this woman's house, without any foundation; says he. I suppose you belong to the kidnappers, and you are come to vindicate their cause; no, says I, young man, here is my authority, and I had my truncheon, I took out my truncheon; I said, you see I am a parish constable; now young man, you have acted exceedingly wrong, come into the house, and testify to the mob, all to be false, that there was nothing in it, and let us try to disperse this mob if we can, before more comes; he refused going, he told me that I wanted to serve him the same, to take him in.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he mean by taking him in? - In order to trepan him; I offered him my address, I said I lived in Chandos-street, you know where to find me if<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160146"></xptr>any thing amiss comes of it; you know there is justice for me as well as there is for them; a number of people all sitting in the box, began to say they would go in if he went in; he would not go without I would take all the rest in who were sitting in the box; I said, if you will not go, young man, and assist me in dispersing this mob, worse will come of it; a number of people that were in the room, and about the door, began to hustle me, and use me extremely ill, and I was glad to make my escape; he did not use me ill himself, but the people that were sitting in the box did, and the people about the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they begin to use you ill? - They told me I was a crimp and a kidnapper, and come to defend their cause. I escaped then to the horse guards, and begged of the guards to go along with me; a sergeant and twelve soldiers could have quelled the mob at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you go that time to the horse guards? - For to get a guard to protect the house, and we would have kept the house from being hurted, I dare say.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did it from apprehension of danger to the house? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. This hustling that took place on the outside of the door, was it within sight of the mob that were assembled about this house? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see any more of this? - I went to the horse guards; they told me they could not grant my request, I must go to a magistrate; afterwards Mrs. Gitliff's boy came running over to me, and I went to see for a magi strate, but there was none; so I brought up two constables from Queen's-square, and the mob were then breaking into the house; the constables said they would go and fetch Serjeant Kirby, at Knights-bridge; do you stay here, Broadfield, and to the best you can. A great number of the mob then began to ill treat me, and said I was come to have a watch over them.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they doing at this time? - They were going in in a great force; I could not get up into the passage, but at last I escaped, and got home, and shut up my own house, for they said they would be at my own house.</p>
               <p>Q. Just as you came the door of the passage was broke open? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the mob in the passage? - They were in the passage, and in the house, full.</p>
               <p>Q. During the tumult were you enabled to distinguish any person in particular? - Yes, but I had no force, I was frightened to get away as fast as I could, because the mob told me they would be at my house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. When you went to the Ship you found this young man with a pot of beer before him? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Being drunk he got that to sober him a little? - When I see him he certainly was rather in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. You told him very truly, that he had been guilty of a great deal of indiscretion, and you wanted him to go along with you? - I did, and shewed him my staff.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you shewed him your staff, he did not like to go along with you? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. He had so much sense as to give you a'frational answer? - He said he was not sorry for raising the tumule about the house, and the house deserved to be pulled down.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his expression? - He was not sorry for what he had done.</p>
               <p>Q. This was at the Ship, was it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what it was he had done? - He said there is this young lad coming in just now, I went with him to have some porter, and he said they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160147"></xptr>wanted to trepan and kidnap the lad.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he say they wanted to trepan and kidnap? - The lad that was with him, John Hollis; he said it had been a kidnapping house, and they wanted to kidnap the lad that was with him, that he went in to have some porter with. With that I made answer, if I can make nothing here, I must go as quick as I can to the horse guards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. The prisoner continued sitting in the box of the tap room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you were afterward surrounded and bustled with some people outside of the door, consequently the prisoner was not with them, nor they with the prisoner? - They were not.</p>
               <p>Court. Where was it you were hustled? - At the Ship door.</p>
               <p>Q. And that was in sight of the mob that were collected together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the people come from that hustled you there? - Different bystanders that were about the door, that were collected by my telling them that they had no foundation to stand there.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts is this Ship situated? - Nearly facing this gentlewoman's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the room where these people were sitting, the room that leads this way? - No, it is the room that is backwards, the kitchen; the tap room is in the front, but this was in the kitchen.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you a daughter of Mr. Marshall? - Yes, he keeps a green grocer's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him on the 12th of July? - Yes, between five and six o'clock I see him in Mrs. Ostliff's yard; he came in and asked for a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him after that at any time? - Yes, I see him jump on the goods, between seven and eight o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. Were there any persons about the house when you see him jumping on the goods? - Yes, a mob about the house.</p>

               <p>Q. Will you be so good as to tell my lord and jury the state of the demolition; when was it you see it? - I believe it was on or about the 29th day of August. The outer door next Charing Cross seems to have been forced off its hinges; it then lay in the passage with all the six pannels broke; the door at the other end of the passage seemed likewise to have been forced off its hinges, and was not to be found; the upper pannel at the door in the house, was likewise broke; most of the sashes, and of course the glass was destroyed, and some of the internal doors, as was likewise the door in the small room on the left hand side of the yard, and the sash of that room, as well as on the right hand side of the yard, there was a very little left of one of the sash frames. These were the most material damages that were done to the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding to Mrs. Ostliff. You are on your oath; how soon was it after this evening, that you had an opportunity of looking at your premises again? - I never went into the house for two or three days.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it when you see it then in the same condition as when Mr. Craigg looked over it? - Yes, it was.</p>

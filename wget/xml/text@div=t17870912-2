             was put into the house as a guard to sleep in it; on Thursday, the 16th of August, about nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner knocked at the door, under pretence of taking away the rubbish from the top of the house; he is a bricklayer's labourer, and had been at work in the house two days before; I opened the door, and asked him what he wanted; he told me he came for some rubbish that he left upon the house top the night before; they had finished their work the night before.</p>
               <p>There was nobody else in the house but you? - No, I let him go up stairs by himself, as he had done the day before; Gun's box was in a room adjoining to the room that the prisoner went through to fetch the rubbish; he opened the box with this false key. (Producing it.)</p>
               <p>You did not see it? - No, he came down with a basket, but I did not perceive any thing in it at that time; he went away, and did not return till the next evening about six o'clock; he then knocked as before, I let him in; he then said he came to fetch a brush and trowel belonging to the bricklayer which he had left; the room door where Gun's box was, was locked; it was locked on Thursday, but it was on Friday; I went up with him on Friday, and found the door was locked.</p>
               <p>There was a window open in the room? - Yes, and he put a ladder up for the trowel and brush; I came down stairs, and left him there; I had a suspicion that he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120005"></xptr>was the person before; I intended to detain him in the house; the prisoner's master detained him, till I could get a constable, a constable came, and took him to the watch-house; when he came down he had a great deal of property about him.</p>
               <p>What property? clothes or what? - Men's clothes.</p>
               <p>Did you know whose they were? - Yes, I can swear to them, because I washed some of them.</p>
               <p>(Repeats the things mentioned in the indictment.)</p>
               <p>You know those things belong to Mr. Gun? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you observe whether any thing had been done to the door? - No, the key was in the door withoutside, that he could unlock the door without breaking it.</p>
               <p>Did you go to see if the box was open? - No, I did not, the young man locked the box in the morning, and took the key with him.</p>
               <p>You said it was the first day that the coat was taken? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How do you know that? - Because the young man went up stairs, and missed it, and charged me with it.</p>

               <p>(Repeating them.)</p>
               <p>What time in the morning did you go out? - At six o'clock to work; the box was then in the room, and I locked the door myself, and left the key in it; the box was picked with a false key; when I came home, I found he had been taken with the property upon him.</p>
               <p>These things were taken out of your box? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Adams. Had you been up stairs on the 16th, in the morning after Gunn went out, and before the prisoner came in, and went up stairs? - No, if the door was left locked by Gun, it was locked when the prisoner went up, for nobody had been in the house, nor up stairs, but myself to make the bed in an adjoining room, but I did not go into this room at all.</p>
               <p>Did you take notice whether the door was shut or not? - It was shut, but I cannot say whether it was fast or not.</p>

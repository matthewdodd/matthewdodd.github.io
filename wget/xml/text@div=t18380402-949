                  </hi>. I am an engraver, and live in King William-street, West Strand. I occupy the whole house—my family consisted of my wife, two female children, and the prisoner—we occupied the drawing-rooms of the house, and slept in the front attic—the prisoner slept in the back attic—the partition between the two rooms is lath and plaster on both sides—on the night of the 12th of February I went to bed, after fastening the street door, and seeing all safe in the house, and also seeing that the prisoner was safe in his room—I had two bolts placed outside his door, to keep him in the night, in consequence of his being addicted to thieving—in the morning I was awoke by the barking of a dog, and, fancying I heard somebody in the room, I got out of bed, and found my bed-room door opened, which I had fastened inside overnight—I then thought I heard somebody go down stairs, and on going down myself I heard one bolt after the other of the street door drawn back, and the door open—I went down as fast as I could, and found it wide open—I was in my shirt—I thought it was some stranger had got into the house—I shut the door, and went up stairs to discover whether any thing was missing—it was between five and o'clock in the morning, and quite dark—I am certain it was before six o'clock—I got a light, and discovered a box, in which I used to keep some jewellery, had been broken open—that box was placed under my bed, and a great quantity of articles were taken away—I then discovered that I had lost from my trowsers pocket a purse, containing thirteen sovereigns and some silver—I called in a policeman, and called the prisoner's name, but got no answer—I withdrew the bolt of his door, which was still fastened, and tried to get in, but the bed had been removed from its place, so that the door would hardly open—I was obliged to push bed and door to get in—I then discovered his jacket, waistcoat, shoes, and cap, but he was gone—on look<lb></lb>ing behind the bed, in the corner where it usually stood, there were two holes, one sufficiently large to admit him through into my bed-room—I also found a saw, all over whitening, from the wall, and a loaded pistol on the table—on turning up his bed, between the bed and sacking I found a great many articles which had been taken from the box which was broken open—we then searched the inside of the bed, and found a quantity of coral beads, and some other articles—I gave information to the police—I missed a number of pencil-cases, four diamond rings, and some other things—I had seen the rings and pencil-cases safe about a week or ten days before—the box was all safe then, and the things all right in it—there was no way of getting from his room except through the window or the hole in the wall—there was no way of getting into my room except through the hole in the wall—I have not found any of the property—I saw nothing of the prisoner till he apprehended at Liverpool—I saw him again last Saturday week—I do not know any of his acquaintances or friends.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of Bow-street. On Thursday morning, the 22nd of March, I found the prisoner in the Bridewell, at Liverpool—he was delivered up to me on this charge—I informed him who I was, and that I was going to take him to London—he asked me whether his father intended to transport him—I said I did not know—he said he had been trying to get rid of him for the last four years, and now he had an opportunity of doing so—he said he had let a boy named Reynolds into the house two nights—that he concealed him the first night, then took him up stairs and concealed him under the bed—that the night before he stole the jewellery, and put it under the bed, and the night before the boy brought a skeleton key and auger—that they staid till his father came home in the morning, which was about one o'clock, and when they thought his father was asleep, they crept through the hole and picked his pocket of the sovereigns, and then the dog barking, awoke his father, and they had just time to escape from the house—that on the road to Birmingham they bought the pair of pistols which were found on him—he said Reynolds had brought the pistol to the bed-room, which was found there—I have made inquiry, but cannot find that there is such a boy as Reynolds—here are some necklaces, rings, neck-chains, work-box, and ear-rings of coral—the pencil-cases have not been found, nor the thimbles or money—he told me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and some silver had been found on him when he was first appre<lb></lb>hended, which was returned when he was discharged, and he had spent it before he was taken again.</p>

                  </hi> I live at 25, York-street, Commercial-road, and am a porter. On 8th Feb., at a quarter past six o'clock in the evening, I was coming down Holborn-hill—I saw the prisoner following a gentleman, and a young lad of the same size was by his side—the prisoner caught the tail of the gentleman's coat with one hand, and with his other took a handkerchief from his pocket, and placed it in his breast—I told a policeman—the prisoner saw me speak to him, and ran away, and the officer after him—I told the gen<lb></lb>tleman—he said yes, he had lost a handkerchief—he did give his name or address—he said he should not trouble himself about it.</p>

I was in Holborn on Tuesday, the 8th of Feb.—I saw the prisoner lift a gentleman's coat up and take a handkerchief out—he put it in his bosom, and walked on one side—as soon as I saw him do it I spoke to the first policeman I saw—as soon as the policeman went up to the prisoner he ran away right up Holborn, and down Fetter-lane—I had him in sight till he got round a court—I could not run quite so fast as him—I am sure he is the same person—I had never seen him before—it was not a minute after I lost sight of him before he was taken.</p>

            . I was pot-boy to Mr. Baker - I saw Conner give the sovereign to the prisoner, and heard him say, "Take for the pot of beer, and bring me change;" after a while he said to me, "Where is the change;" I said, "You did not give it to me;" he then said "It was your fellow-servant;" I went to the bar, and he had not been there - I saw him on the Saturday following in East-street, and took him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I took the sovereign, went to the bar, and put it down, and a person was there who told me he knew of a situation; on the Saturday following I was going down to Mr. Baker's to get some things, which I had left there, when I met the two persons who have been examined.</p>

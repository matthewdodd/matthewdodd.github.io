            . I am apprentice to Midford John Spring, who is the only owner of this house. Last Monday morning, about half-past seven o'clock, I opened the shutters, and left the front door ajar; I went down to the back kitchen, and in about ten minutes mistress sent me out for some milk, and as I came up the kitchen stairs I saw the shadow of somebody in the passage - I went to the door, and saw the prisoner running with a coat sleeve hanging down out of a bundle by his side; I called Stop thief! - nobody was in view but the prisoner till Mr. Wood saw me; I followed with him to Cutler-street, Houndsditch, and secured the prisoner - I only lost sight of him in turning the corner, and am quite sure of him; the parlour door had been opened while I was in the kitchen - I am quite sure I had closed it; Orr's room is on the same floor as the parlour - both rooms lead into each other; he had to go through the passage, and open the front and back parlour doors to get to Orr's room - before he was secured he tried to throw the clothes into the Cutlers' Arms public-house; I took him there, and while Wood secured him I got back all the clothes - I never saw the prisoner before.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WOOD. I stood in my yard in Camomile-street, and heard the cry of Stop thief! - I ran to the gate and saw the prisoner run by, and Evans in pursuit of him; he never got out of my sight, only in turning the corner - I am certain of his person; when I got within about five yards of him he flung the bundle down into the cutlers' Arms - I followed, tripeed his heels up, and fell on him; he laid a little while, then jumped up, struck me in the face with a brush, and hit me three times on the shoulder - I threw him down, and he said he would go with me, but when we got a few yards he struck me again two or three times, and tried to throttle me; he resisted a good deal, but I secured him, took him back to Spring's house, and gave him in charge of Sapwell.</p>
               <p>THOMAS SAPWELL. I know Mr. Spring's house is in the parish of All Hallows on the Wall; I took charge of the prisoner, and the property was in a chimney soot cloth.</p>

               <p>MR. ORR. These are my clothes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I throw myself on the mercy of the Court.</p>

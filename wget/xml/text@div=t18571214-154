                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Wilkinson, of No. 101, East Street, Lambeth Walk. I have known the prisoner about twenty years—I knew that she was married to Thomas Alexander, because I saw them coming out of the church, about eighteen years ago, and she had told me that she was going to be married to him—I was on the church steps, but did not see the wedding inside—I saw them come out arm in arm—it was St. Andrew's, Holborn—I knew them both afterwards—they lived together as man and wife, and parted about twelve or eighteen months afterwards—they have not lived together since—I saw a mob in West Street, and saw Alexander pushing his wife out of a house of ill fame—he said that it was a pretty sight for a husband to see his wife in bed with a man—she is charged</p>

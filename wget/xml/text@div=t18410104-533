                  </hi>. I am a jeweller, and live in St. Giles's—it is my dwelling-house. On the 2nd of January, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the shop, and heard three or four heavy thumps at the window, and then a smash—it is very thick plate glass—I went out immediately, and saw the prisoner running across the road from my shop window—he ran against an old woman, knocked her down, and I caught hold of the skirts of his coat—he fell himself—after he was brought back a boy picked up a watch close by, and brought it into the shop—I gave him in charge—the watch must have dropped from the prisoner—there was no other person running—this is it, it is mine—I found the window smashed to atoms, so as to allow a hand to be put in and take the watch—a great quantity of jewellery was dragged out on the pavement, which I after<lb></lb>wards picked up.</p>

            . On the 10th of June I found this knife and scissars in the possession of Isabella Brown - they were taken from my glass-case, and had been there about a month before.</p>
               <p>ISABELLA BROWN. I live in Well-yard. The prisoner gave me this knife and scissars about a month or five weeks before she was taken up: I have know her three or four months - I have seen her going on errands; I knew she lived with Mr. Ryley, and knew he was a cutler, but did not know that he made or sold these articles; she told me her master's brother gave her them. I heard she was taken up, and I told Mr. Ryley of it two or three days afterwards.</p>
               <p>MR. RYLEY. I knew this child was an intimate acquaintance of the prisoner's, and went to her house to ask her about it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Can you say that these articles had not been sold - A. No; but the prisoner has acknowledged before that she took them.</p>
               <p>GUILTY. Aged 15.</p>

On Saturday, the 2nd of Oct., between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came for half a quartern of flour—it came to fourpence farthing—I put it on the counter—she put down a crown—I did not think it was good, and took it to my son, who said it was a bad one, and took it back to the shop to the prisoner.</p>

I then mentioned the coarse wrapper; she said she had none, but that she had had some cotton, some irish, and some pocketing, but that the prisoner had taken them away again; I desired her to take the coat to the prisoner, which she did; I then asked the prisoner how she could deceive me, in saying she never robbed me of any thing; that I had found a coat, and that it would have been better for her if she had told me of it. Her sister begged of her to tell the whole, of what was become of all the property that had been taken away; telling her, that if they could be redeemed for five guineas she would assist her with the money; and asked her, what was become of the cotton that she had taken away from me, together with the irish, and the pocketing? she said she had sold the pocketing and the cotton, and she took me to the house of one of the witnesses, who lives in Turner's-court, Bedfordbury, where I found the cotton and the pocketing: she declared that was the whole she had taken. The magistrates advised me to have her brought up on a future day, as they thought I might find some more of my property; she was brought up on a future day, and then I charged a woman who used to wash in my house with being a party concerned, and told her I would punish her, if she did not discover what she knew of the things; she took me to a pawnbroker's in Long-acre, where I found a suit of cloaths, which the pawnbroker had lent her two guineas upon; they were taken out of the warehouse, and three pair of corderoy breeches; some of these things are not in the indictment; I found the Russia sheeting at the house of an acquaintance of the prisoner's, the breeches I found at a pawnbroker's in Burton-street, they were taken from the coat and waistcoat which were in the warehouse; the coat I had from the prisoner's sister; she has absconded.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner say when her sister brought the coat? - She said she was very sorry, she must confess she was guilty, and begged I would be favourable to her; I told her I would if she would tell me where the rest of my property was.</p>

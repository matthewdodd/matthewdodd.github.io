                  </hi>. I am a letter carrier, living at 7, Swinbourne Road, Upton—on 1st September I saw a light in Emanuel Church—Corner was With me—we went to the church, and saw Smith standing still, near a broken window—I then went into the church and saw Johnson concealed under one of the pews—several of the window panes were broken—the iron bars that went across were taken down—there was a hole big enough to admit the body of a man—a silk scarf was picked up close to where Johnson was lying down—the knob had been wrenched off the iron safe, and was lying close by, and a large street door key was lying by the knob—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the scarf, it belongs to the Rev. G. W. Meggy, the curate of the church—I hung it up in the vestry the previous morning—they would have to get over a fence to get where they were—the gates were all locked.</p>

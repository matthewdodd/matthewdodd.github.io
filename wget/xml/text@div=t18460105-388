                  </hi>. I am a seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">Cybelle</hi>, in the West India Docks. The prisoner shipped on board that vessel on the 18th of Dec., and came to work on the next day, Friday, the 19th—I had a watch in my chest—I took it out, wound it up, put it into the chest again, and locked it up—the prisoner saw me do so—he took it into his hand, and looked at it—the next morning, the 20th, he turned to with us, and then he went on shore for a short time, and came back again—the mate then told him to go into the hold, and instead of that, he went into the forecastle—I had seen my chest was locked that morning, and I went to it at ten, at the breakfast time—I found it had been broken open—the marks of a marline-spike were on it, and the marline-spike lay by the side of it—my watch was gone—the prisoner had then absconded, and he never returned at all—on the morning of the 26th of Dec. the mate came on board, and sent me to the station—I found the pri<lb></lb>soner there—I do not know what the watch was worth—it was given to me by my father—I have never seen it since.</p>

I sent word down, after he was dead, and I had an order not to part with the money till farther orders; since that time there is a trial depending in the Commons. I had counted the money, and put it into a bureau in my parlour, under a great weight of cloaths, and told nobody where it was, not even my own child: on the 5th of May instant I took it out and counted it, and found there were eleven pieces looked to be very bad gold: I desired a gentleman that was in my house to count them; there were then but fifty-three guineas and eleven medals: the prisoner was my <rs id="t17650522-25-deflabel161" type="occupation">servant</rs>

She said she had taken it, and begged for mercy. I said, why did you put the medals in? She said she put them in to deceive me, that I might think they were guineas, but she intended to put the money there again; she gave me a guinea of it back, and said, if I would give her three weeks grace she would pay me all the money. I sent my son-in-law for a constable, and she was sent to the Round-house: I asked her why she took it: she said she had made away with much of my linen, and she took some money, in order to fetch it back again: some she made presents of to the nurse that had her child, some to her child, and some she lent to a soldier, to fetch his cloaths out of pawn, who was confined in the Savoy.</p>

            . On Sunday, the 5th of May, I was at Mrs. Lamb's; she was counting over a purse of guineas; she seemed very much confused, and desired me to count them over for her: I did, and found no more than fifty three guineas five shillings and eleven medals; there was sixty-five guineas wrote on the paper with them: so I found there wanted one guinea or one medal. I desired her to put the money in the same manner as before, and let it lie till I came the next evening; she followed my advice: when I came the next evening, she desired me to count it again: I did, and found the medals had increased from eleven to fourteen, and there were no more than fifty-one guineas five shillings: then Mrs. Lamb said to the prisoner, Molly, I think you are a very bad girl, to use me so: she was asked when she took the first money out of the purse: she answered she took it out that very day Mrs. Lamb's son-in-law came there and mended a box: she was asked what she had done with the two guineas she had taken out between the Sunday evening and the Monday evening; she did not say what she had done with it, but returned one guinea, and begged for mercy, and said, if her mistress would let her alone for about three weeks, she would endeavour to get her the money again; then she seeing her mistress very angry with her, said, if she would let Mr. Burford, the son-in-law, go with her to the Globe in the Strand, she would raise her two guineas and a half: she said she had taken some of her mistress's linnen, and she made use of some of this money to fetch them out of pawn.</p>

The prisoner was out, and staid out all night; the next day I saw the money counted, and there were but fifty-one guineas, fourteen medals, and five shillings: when the prisoner came home. and was charged with this, she confessed she had taken them, and returned one guinea, and said, if we would let her go to the Globe in the Strand, she would get a guinea and a half more, and if we would allow her time she would get it all again; she said she had pawned things unknown to us, and she took the money to get them back again, and that she took the first money on Easter Monday: we lost many things while she was there; here are two aprons which we had from the pawnbroker, which she owned she pawned, (produced and deposed to.)</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Vaughan: I went to Mrs. Lamb's on the 6th of March. Mr. Burford came to our house, and said there were some very improper people got about Mr. More, and he was afraid they had trumped up a will; he desired I would go with him: I did, and Mr. Hitchcock went with us: I got there about ten in the evening; the deceased's door was locked: I heard Mrs. Lamb had got some money, which was the deceased's, in her hands, in his lifetime: I desired her not to part with it till things were settled in the Commons: I had entered a caveat. I went again on Sunday, the 6th of May, by desire of the attorney who carries on the suit, to Mrs. Lamb, in order to take down what the prisoner could say as to the capacity of the deceased, the day the pretended will was executed. I thought proper to get sight of a lottery ticket, which belonged to the deceased, to see whether it was a blank or prize: Mrs Lamb went to look for the ticket, and she found it not in the same place: then she looked at the money, and the discovery happened.</p>

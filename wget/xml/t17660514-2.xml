On the 14th of last month about 11 in the forenoon, I just went out of my house to go to Isleworth; in about a minute's time my wife called me back, and said she believed the prisoner had robbed me; I found him in my shop behind my counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176605140003"></xptr>Howard. I never saw him before to my knowledge; I challenged him with having taken something; he said he had not, and gave me liberty to search him.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you think he could get into your shop in so short a time?</p>
               <p>Howard. There is an ale-house next door, and I have reason to believe he was sitting on the bench at the door when I went out. I desired my wife to withdraw, and made him strip; at that time I missed a watch from off a peg in the window; he had two waistcoats on; upon throwing one down, there was something fell heavy; I said, I believe I have you now. No, said he, it is only my knife. I took and looked in the waistcoat, and found my watch in a little pocket, seemingly made on purpose to conceal things in, at the bottom of one of the hind lappets of his waistcoat, (a silver watch produced in court) this is it; it is put into my hands to sell for a person, and I am accountable for it if lost. We took the prisoner before a magistrate, and there he confessed he did take it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I went into the shop to sell a button which I had found, the gentlewoman took it and would not give me any thing for it; this watch was lying on the counter, I took it up and said, I would have something for the button; I had never been in London, but was coming up from Devonshire.</p>

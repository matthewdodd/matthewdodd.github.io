               <p>- PRICE. I know the prisoner. On the night before the robbery he was about with me, and went to bed at half-past nine o'clock - we slept in the same bed at Mrs. Salmon's, near the water side; I left him in bed between six and seven in the morning, when I got up Mrs. Salmon saw us there - she is not able to come here; her daughter also saw us - it was on Tuesday night the, 20th of February.</p>
               <p>RICHARD HEDGES re-examined. I swear I saw him at the house. I was close to him, and spoke to him; he goes by the name of Doggey: I said "Master Doggey, I have caught you at last" and he ran away - I told Mr. Dark who it was - there is a gas-light opposite.</p>

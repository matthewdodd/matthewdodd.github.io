                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Watson; we lire at Ilford, On the afternoon of 20th May, I went to a field where I had a cow—I drove the cow home, and milked it—I had a pony in that field—I left the gate open, and about a quarter of an hour after I saw the pony in the road—I went afterwards to look for the pony, but could not find it—I saw it next day, about 1 o'clock, at the Red Lion stables, at Ilford—the policeman came and told me—it was mine—it was worth between 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I was on duty in Barking-lane on the evening of 20th May—I saw the prisoner riding a pony with this bit of cord tied to its mouth, which drew my attention—I asked him how far he was going—he said, "That is my business, not yours"—I asked him whose pony it was—he said, "It is my pony, and d—d well I know it, for I gave 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it"—I took him into custody, and the next day I told the last witness—she went to the Red Lion, and saw the pony, and claimed it.</p>

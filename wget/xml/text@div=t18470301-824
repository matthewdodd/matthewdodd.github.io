               <p>On the night of the 4th Feb., I met the prisoner Weston, near Greenwich College—I had never seen her before to my knowledge—she begged relief, and said she had just come from the Union—I asked what relief she wanted—she said, "A drop of gin," and we had a quartern of gin at the Red Lion, then we had another quartern—M'Lochlin came in while we were having the first quartern—they appeared to know each other—I was nor then rather the worse for liquor—I did not say I was in good "sailing trim" at that time—I was when I went home with them—I went with them to a house in Queen-street—I said I would go and have a cup of coffee—the woman of the house said she would make me a cup of tea—I then had about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver and gold—I had three sovereigns—I know I had it safe about seven o'clock—when I went home with them I sat down by the fire—while they were light<lb></lb>ing the fire and blowing the fire, I fell asleep—I awoke, I think, between ten and eleven, and <hi rend="italic">mother</hi> M'Lochlin was then taking the handkerchief off my neck—I then found my purse with two half-crowns and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it—my sovereigns were gone—I gave M'Lochlin in charge, but I had given Weston in charge first—I had met her on the staircase, and told the policeman the other woman was up stairs—I am sure I had my sovereigns when I went there—my pocket was cut, not cut off, it was only just nicked, and the purse taken out—when I found Weston on the stairs she was eating raw bacon and onions—I said, "Where did you get that, you told me you had no money?"—she said she got it as Mr. Green's, on <hi rend="italic">tick</hi>—the policeman brought her up stairs, and she put her hand into her bosom, and <hi rend="italic">hauled up a paper of money</hi>, 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

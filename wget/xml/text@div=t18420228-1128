                  </hi>. I keep the King's Arms tavern, Peckham-rye—the prisoner was my pot-boy for about seven months—it was part of his duty to carry out beer and spirits to my customers—sometimes I supplied him with the goods, sometimes my wife, and sometimes my barmaid, he never was allowed to supply himself—on Sunday, the 13th of February, is consequence of information, I went to the back-kitchen, about one o'clock I saw there a soda-water bottle and a ginger-beer bottle with gin in them, on a shelf, covered over with an old tin dish-cover—I tasted both of them—nobody had any right to have gin there—about eight o'clock in consequence of what Coombes said, when the prisoner came up out of the kitchen, I stopped him, and said to him, "What have you got?" he said, "Nothing"—I said, "What, nothing?" he said, "Yes"—I searched hit, and out of his coat-pocket I took the soda-water bottle containing half-a-pint of gin—he said "That is mine, I have paid for it"—he did not say who he had paid, or when—I said I would take the risk upon myself, and I took it into the bar—he went out with his beer—about nine o'clock I sent for an officer and gave him in charge—I had previously sent for one, but could not get one.</p>

The prisoner was also in his employ, and slept in the warehouse, last Wed<lb></lb>nesday night, about half-past nine o'clock, I came into the warehouse—I had been out for some beer—when I came in, I saw the prisoner in the corner of the warehouse, by the silk laces—he had got the silk laces in his right hand, putting them under a wrapper—there were boxes at his right hand, putting them under a wrapper—there were boxes at his right hand which contained the laces—they were French white laces in the top box, and underneath they were silk-there was a white paper hanging out of the box—I did not say anything to him—we went and sat down by the fire, and drank out beer—about twenty minutes after that, as I was reading, he left me, and went to the staircase, took the wrapper and put it into the gas-meter cupboard—he than came and sat by the fire again—I said nothing to him till the clerk came, at about a quarter past ten o'clock—I had previously made a communication to the clerk and when he came in, I winked at him to send the prisoner away, which he did, and while he was gone—Mr. Machu afterwards came in with a policeman, and said, there was an alarm of thieves in the places, and asked the prisoner if all was right—he said it was, that he had been round the place, and there was</p>

I am a silk-manufacturer, and live in Twisters-alley, Bunhill-row, St. Luke's I have heard the statement made by Nelson—it is correct—I said, "Every thing is not right here, there is some thieving going on," or something to that effect—the prisoner, with others, was sitting round the fire at the time—I took a candle, and went towards the gas-meter cupboard—I said, "Come here this moment"—he did not move—I said, "Ben, came here"—he then did not move—I said again, "Come here"—he then came, and I said, "Pull every thing out of this place, "Which he did, but I thought rather reluctantly—I said, "Come, every thing out" and he pulled out with ropes and dirty paper that was there, a wrapper containing the silk laces—I said, "How came they here?"—he made no answer—I said, "You rascal, you put them there"—he still made no answer, but appeared very much confused, and I saw a tear dropping down his face, and when I went in he turned exceedingly pale, and put up his arms—the value of the laces is 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

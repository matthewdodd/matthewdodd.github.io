At the time I was examined at the Police Court I lived at 11, Agar Street, Strand—I come from Melbourne, Australia—I am a native of England—on 10th February, this year, before I left Melbourne, I saw Mrs. Counsel hand a cheque for 925<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to her husband, to be applied to the purchase of a house on the Ballarat gold diggings—I went with Mr. Counsel to his bank to have it changed—it was changed first into 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and after into gold—I can't say when that was, I was not present—about three weeks before I met the prisoner, I was with Counsel when the prisoner was present—he proposed that the three of us should go to England</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187008150050"></xptr>
               <p>—he said he was a very clever wizard; but that he would never perform in Australia, as he wanted to perform in the best parts of the world, if he only had the money to buy his apparatus—he mentioned England and the Con<lb></lb>tinent—he said he could do tricks that no man ever did before, that he could cut a man's leg off, and throw it to the audience—Counsel said that he would go; but he would not go without me, and that we could all three go together—Counsel then took two 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes out of his pocket-book, and banded them to the prisoner, to take the passage—I was present—the cost of the passage was 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, total 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the ship was the <hi rend="italic">Kent</hi>—the pas<lb></lb>sages were taken, and I Counsel, and the prisoner went on board on the evening of 16th February—all the money was placed in this box—it was changed into Australian sovereigns—the prisoner opened the boxes and showed us the gold, and said "It is all safe"—the money was placed in a large nest of boxes, one within another, I believe there were nine altogether—we put it in the innermost box—it was in either three or four chamois leather bags—this box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the smallest of the nest—it is the box the gold was in, and this is how it was broken open—it is still locked—I saw the money counted on the ship—I could not swear exactly how many sovereigns there were—I should think there were about 850 at that time—the box was deposited in our cabin—all three of us were in the same cabin, which was confined by a door—after we had been on the ship some little tune the prisoner said that he wanted to say "Good-bye" to his friends—he was going to tell them he was going to Queensland, and Counsel agreed with him to go up in the town—I said "Don't go, let us stay on board while we are safe"—the prisoner then called in the storekeeper, and he said "Ned, what time will the ship sail?"—he said "She won't go away until to-morrow, I am sure, and very likely not till Friday, because the captain won't go away until he gets the mails"—Counsel, the prisoner, and myself then went to Melbourne, about four miles from where the ship lay—the prisoner left us at our hotel, where we went to have tea—he said he was going round to see his friends, to say "Good-bye," and he appointed to meet us at the corner of the Charlton Gardens, at 9 o'clock—we went at 9, and waited till 11.30, and he did not come, and we then walked to a place called Sandrich, and there slept—when we woke the next morning we found that the ship had cleared that very night—we went to the telegraph office, and afterwards took a special steamer, and reached the ship at the Heads—we found the prisoner on board—we counted the money, I think, on the follow<lb></lb>ing day, and it was all right—we were all three present—we counted it, I believe three times before 29th March, at intervals, and found it safe—on the afternoon of the 29th we counted it, and missed fifty-one sovereigns out of the bulk—we did not mention it at the time, we thought we might possibly have made a mistake in the counting—in June two of the crew of the ship were tried here for stealing the money, and we re<lb></lb>covered back 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—their names were Chalk, Daley, and Randall—one was acquitted, and two pleaded guilty. (<hi rend="italic">See page</hi> 135). On 30th March I had a dream—I dreamt that the gold was stolen, and that I saw a portion of it in a certain man's hands, the one that received the twelve months last Session—I awoke at daylight, and the dream was so impressed on my mind that I felt for the box with the gold in it, and it was gone—I felt for the prisoner and he was out—he was gone and the money too—the box had become smaller—some of the larger boxes had been taken off to put clothes into, and there were only the smal<lb></lb>lest</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187008150051"></xptr>
               <p>three or four remaining, and they were deposited in a large clothes box, and I felt in that box to see if the smaller ones were there—I then woke Counsel, and asked him a question—at this time the prisoner made his ap<lb></lb>pearance, from the direction of the storekeeper's room, from the ladder, and shouted out, "Arthur! Joe! get up, we are robbed!"—(Arthur is me; Joe is Mr. Counsel)—we went outside the cabin—the boxes were lying on the table outside our door, broken open—there were six sovereigns lying in the bottom of the box, and two others were afterwards found on the ladder leading up to the deck—nothing further occurred during the voyage—we searched the ship and posted a notice—we arranged to watch the ship every night in turns, to see if we could observe anything—we made out nothing, and we eventually landed in England—we were somewhere about the Cape of Good Hope when this robbery took place, I can't say exactly where—on reaching England the prisoner Counsel and myself lodged at the same house, 10 and 12, East Road, City Road, up to the trial of those men—we con<lb></lb>tinued in England until we had spent all the money that we recovered out of the first robbery, 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—after that I and Counsel took shipping at Gravesend, in order to return to Australia—it was about 16th of June, I think—the prisoner told me that he would be able to borrow some money from a rich uncle of his to take us out—he suggested our going out, not for any purpose, only that Australia was our home, and we had no means of subsistence in England—he went with us as far as Gravestnd, and returned back to London—Counsel and I went to Plymouth, and on the vessel reach<lb></lb>ing Plymouth Mrs. Counsel came to us—Mrs. Counsel and I came up to London by ourselves; we left Counsel' behind, as he was ill—we went to the prisoner's uncle, Mr. Underwood—I watched at the house all night, because, by the way his uncle spoke to me, we believed the prisoner was in the house—he would give us no information at all—the following morning I saw the prisoner at his lodgings, and Mrs. Counsel came in after me—I did not hear what she said—she charged him with the robbery—the prisoner came in and said to me, "Oh, my God I she is going to arrest me; what shall I do, Arthur? I can't stand it, I'll bolt!"—he said that to me, in his uncle's presence—he was jumping out through the window—I said "It is no use your bolting, for she will have you"—he jumped over the fence and hedge and went away.</p>

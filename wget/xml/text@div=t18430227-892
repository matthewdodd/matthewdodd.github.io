                  </hi>. I am a sergeant of the police. On the 28th of Jan. I saw the prisoner and Bryant in company in St. John-street—I saw the priso<lb></lb>ner hand something to Bryant which I believe to be copper—I heard it sound—on the 11th of Feb. I went again to St. John-street with another officer, and saw them under the archway of the Eastern Counties Railway—they ap<lb></lb>peared in conversation—they came from under the archway—I laid hold of Bryant—the prisoner instantly ran away as fast as he could—I called "Stop thief," and Barker stopped him—they were both taken to a public-house—I searched the prisoner, but found nothing on him—I went in the direction he had run, and beyond where Bryant had been, as near the spot as possible where Barker stopped the prisoner I found nine bobbins of silk, which I pro<lb></lb>duce—the prosecutor gave me this stamp—the impression on the bobbins are exactly similar to that stamp—I said to Bryant on the way to the station, "This has been going on some time; it is high time it was stopped"—Bryant said, "Yes, it was him put me up to it, or I should never have done it; he has been the ruin of me"—I consider that the prisoner was near enough to hear that—I found out Bryant's master by what he said—Harris claimed the silk—I found some copper money on Bryant—I brought a bobbin with the same mark from Harris's shop.</p>

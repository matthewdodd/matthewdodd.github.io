I am manager to my father, who keeps the Feathers public-house, Commercial Road, Lambeth—Henry Russell was our barman—on 13th January, between 8 and 9 o'clock that night, I saw him serve the prisoner with a pint of half-and-half; he paid with a shilling, which Russell immediately handed to me, and said, "Here is another bad one, Mr. Henry"—I tried it and bent it, and it was bad—I sent for a constable and gave him into custody.</p>

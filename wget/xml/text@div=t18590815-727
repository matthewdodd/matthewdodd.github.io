                  </hi>. I am barman at the Elephant and Castle, Newington—on 2d July I was barman at the King's Head, Gerrard-street, Soho—the prisoner came about half-past 2 o'clock, and I served him with twopenny-worth of gin—he gave me a shilling—I bent it, and told him it was bad—he gave me a good one—I gave him change, and he left, taking the bad shilling with him—about a quarter to 6 the same evening I served him with three halfpenny worth of gin, and he gave me a bad shilling—I recognised him, bent it, told him that it was bad, that he had been there before, that that was the second bad one, and that I should send for a policeman—I did so, and gave him in custody, bent the second shilling, which was a Victoria one, gave it to Mr. Rolf, and saw him give it to the policeman—the first shilling was a George.</p>

I took the prisoner at the King's Head on 4th July, and received this shilling from Mr. Rolf, the landlord—he gave the name of Edward Walker at the station, and of Frank Webb before the Magistrate—I searched him at the station, and found on him 5 half crowns, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

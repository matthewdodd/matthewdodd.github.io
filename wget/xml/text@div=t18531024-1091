I was awoke about 4 o'clock in the morning by a side door in the shop opening—I jumped out of bed, went into the back shop, looked through the window and saw a man at the back of the premises making his escape; that was Jackson, who has since been tried here and transported (<hi rend="italic">seepage</hi> 207)—I went to the next house, undid the door and saw three men coming out of the next gateway, Carpenters'-hall—there was a policeman about twenty yards off, and I called his atten<lb></lb>tion to them, by calling "Stop thief!"—two of them went on one side of the policeman, and one on the other—he was in the middle of the road, and the two went on the pavement about two yards from him—I cannot identify</p>

               <p>the prisoner as one of them—I found two hats on the premises, which I gave to the policeman—the shutters of the first floor were riddled with a great number of holes, which had been made by a stock, and the roof of the plate, room had been lifted up—I found this chisel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the roof, and fitted it to the marks under the lead work, they were the exact size of the chisel—the premises were all secure when I went to bed at 11 o'clock—the house is in the parish of All-hallows On the Wall.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 16, Brook-hill, Clerkenwell, and am now a repairer of furniture. On 16th May I was in the City Police, and on the morning of that day, about 4 o'clock, I was on duty in London-wall—ail was by Sadler's-place, London-wall, about twenty yards from Carpenters' Hall, I turned to the right towards Mr. Grant's, and saw Neave at the door in his shirt; three men were in front of him, advancing towards me—I did not see where they came from—I advanced towards them; they looked at me full in the face, and the prisoner, who was one of them, made for the Circus, which is on the opposite side of the way, nearly facing—the other two pasted one on each side of me, and made down London-wall into Bell-alley, where I lost them—the prisoner had a brown coat on, and no cap or hat—the other two have since been tried and convicted.</p>

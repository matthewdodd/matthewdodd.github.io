I heard the tiles rattle a little before one; in a short time I heard a bolt draw of the back-room that comes into the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard one bolt of the back door drawn - A. Yes, and I heard the other bolt drawn; afterwards the latch gently lifted up, and the door opened; I heard a light footstep close by the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when you are through that door are you in the house - A. Yes. I heard the button that fastens the bar-window undone; I ran out of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181307140010"></xptr>bar, at the bar-door. I ran backwards to the place where I heard the noise.</p>
               <p>Q. When you are in the bar and look into that window, where does it look into - A. It faces the back-door; that window is between the parlour-door and the kitchen-door.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the back-door open into the house, or into the yard - A. Into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Then as soon as you are through the back-door you are in the house, are you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You ran round to the place where you heard the noise - A. Yes; I ran up against a man. it was dark; I had no light, nor he had no light. I seized the man as soon as I run against him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you keep fast hold of him - A. Yes, I did; and it was the prisoner now at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say whether the prisoner was in any part of the house - A. Yes, he was in the house; the outside of the bar-window is within the house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you heard a light footstep could you tell where that footstep was - A. Yes, close by that bar-window. When I seized him, he said it is me Mr. Berry.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you knew him before, did you - A. Yes; he had been employed about the house some time ago. I brought him into the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing about him - A. Yes, a piece of wire, match, astick, and a tinder-box. These are them. I sat him down in the tap-room, and underneath where he was sitting I found the tinder-box.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that tinder-box within the tap-room or not before he came in - A. No, it was not. This piece of wire was to force the bolt back from the outside. I said, I was sorry to catch him; we were robbed a great many times.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Is this your house or Sullivan's - A. It is Sullivan's house. I have the tap to myself; I have nothing but the tap; Sullivan has nothing to do with the tap; I sell beer by commission for him; I have so much a but; I pay no rent. There were four gimblet holes, and through them holes that wire was put in, it forced the bolt back.</p>
               <p>Q. This man formery kept the house himself - A. Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>COURT. Had you examined the bolts of the back-door; do you know whether the back-door was bolted or not - A. It was bolted a little before eleven. I know that of my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. As soon as ever you go through the back-door are you under the roof of the house or not - A. No, there is a light; it is not covered up; it is open all the way up to the sky; the bar-window is under cover, and within the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing you were coming in at the door you heard him unbolt, as soon as he came in there where would he be - A. Under the roof; as soon as he got through he was within side of the house; he might have gone anywhere in the house that he liked.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask the prisoner what he wanted, or was anything said what he came there for - A. He said, now, Berry, I will hang myself, I have got rope in my pocket. I had got hold of him then.</p>
               <p>Q. He never said why he came in - A. Not a</p>

               <p>Sarah Matts. On the 3d of March, I was sent to the Gate-house for pawning some Bed-Curtains; I was lock'd up at 9 that Night, and so I was the second Night; but about 12 or 1 o' Clock, the second Night, the Prisoner, and one Sylvester, unbolted the Door (for it was bolted on the outside) and came into my Room. The Prisoner came in his Shirt, with a Candle in his Hand. I asked what he wanted? he bid me get up, and go to the common Side; and so I got up, and put on my Petticoat, and then he swore, by G - d, he would lye with me; for he said I was a Street-walker, and might as well lye with him as with every Body else. I told him he should not, for he was my Aversion; and with that he made no more to do, but knocked me down, 2 or 3 Times, and thump'd me, and bruised my Breast, and made my Face swell, and then he flung me a-cross the Bed, so as my Head hung down, and he tore my Legs asunder, and lay with me against my Will 3 times. I scream'd, and cry'd out, Murder; but he would lye with me. He did as other Men do, when they lye<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173112080022"></xptr> with Women, and I suppose that needs no explaining. He staid three Hours, and when he went away he lock'd Sylvester in with me, and Sylvester us'd me, if possible, worse than the other had done, for he forc'd me into the Bed, stamp'd upon my Breast, and made me lye with him all Night. They have since kept two Women out of the way, that they might not appear for me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She came to me afterwards in my Lodge, and taking up a Glass of Wine, (before the Turnkeys) said, Here's to you John, you are no sumbler , for you have lain with me 20 times.</p>

            . I was sent to the Gatehouse for striking a Woman a blow with a Frying Pan. The Prisoner came up, and ask'd, how I did, and swore he would lye with me. I told him he should not; but he swore there was no Woman came there, but he would lye with her, if he pleas'd; but by good luck he did me no harm. The 2d Morning that Matts was there, I went up into her Room, and found her crying. Sarah, says I to her, I hope he han't - yes, says she, but he has, and beat and bruised me too. And so she told me the whole Story.</p>

And about a 11 or 12, the Prisoner and Sylvester came and took a Candle, and the Keys, and went up the Stairs on the Master-Side, which lead to where the Prosecutor lay. Her Room was in the Gallery; there's a Lock to the Gallery Door, but the Doors within the Gallery are only bolted on the out-side. He stay'd an Hour, or more, and leaving Sylvester behind him, came to Bed to me; for he us'd to lye in the Lodge where I lye. I went up to her Room in the Morning, and found Sylvester in Bed, and she with her Clothes on was standing and looking stedfastly at the Window; but she made no complaint to me. This

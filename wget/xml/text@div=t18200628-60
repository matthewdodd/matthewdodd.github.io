We had some Camellica Japonicas on our ground - they grow nearly to the height of twelve feet. On the 17th of May, in the morning, I missed thirty-eight. I saw them safe at seven o'clock the night before; they were in the green-house, growing in pots, and were about two feet high - (looks at one) - this is one; it is about four years old. I grew it from a slip, and know them all - one plant is worth 2 l. They were taken out of the pots, and the pots left behind.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Hackney. On the 16th of May, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, Reading and I stopped the prisoner at Homerton, about half a mile from the prosecutors', with twenty of these plants under his arm. I asked what he had got - he said he had a parcel of laurels which he had picked off a dung-hill. We took him to the watch-house, as the roots were fresh, and I was satisfied they had just come out of the ground.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chemist and druggist, and live in Crosby-row, Walworth—Weatherhead is in my service—he came the latter end of Oct., or the beginning of Nov.—I received information, and spoke to him on the 13th of Feb.—on the day after he made a communication to me, and in the after<lb></lb>noon I went with the officer, to a place called Camberwell-gate, where we saw the prisoner with a stall, containing cocoa-nuts—I gave him in charge—he asked me what for—I told him my name was Fuller, and he knew my boy better than he knew me—I left him with the officer, and went to his house with the sergeant—I found there this bottle of oil of lavender—I can swear to this bottle as mine, and I had oil of lavender of this description—there was about a shilling's worth of oil of lavender in it—on going to the station I said to the prisoner, "Where have you been in the, habit of getting your essences?"—he said, in the Borough, near a street which I understood was Trinity-street—(he would want them to put into his sweetmeats; they use a great variety of essential oils in sweetmeats)—I asked if it was at Mayne's—he said he didnot know, but he thought it was—I said, "When did you get it there?"—he said in the autumn of the year, mentioning, I think, Oct.—I said, "Where have you got them lately?"—he said Mr. Fuller's boy had brought him some—I said, "That is what I wish to know"—he then said, "I have paid for them."</p>

                  </hi>. I am fourteen years old. I was in the employ of Mr. Fuller—I have known the prisoner for the last two years—I had known him before I went to Mr. Fuller—he sells sweetmeats about, and keeps a machine called a dolly—I saw him when I had been about a week at Mr. Fuller's, but he did not say anything to me then—I saw him again a little time afterwards—he then asked me if I saw such things lying about as essence of lemons or cloves, and oil of lavender—I said, "Yes"—he said if I got him such things as he wanted to use in his trade, he would put 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my way—I did not say anything to that—I know this bottle—I saw it in my master's cupboard—I put into it some oil of lavender, which I found in a small bottle on the shelf—I took it to the prisoner—I do not know on what day—I did not say anything to him, but I gave it him—he did not give me anything then, but on Christmas-day he gave me a sixpence, and on boxing-day</p>

               <p>he gave me another sixpence—that was all the money he ever gave me—I have played at the dolly—I did so about the second Sunday, when he came to the shop, which he kept on Walworth-common—it was before Chirst<lb></lb>mas—when I lost I used to pay him, as I used to have a few halfpence on a Sunday—I did not pay him in any other way—when I won he used to pay me with peppermint, or anything in the shop—my master charged me with robbing him, and then I made a communication to him—the prisoner knew that I took this lavander from my master, because he asked me whether I saw such things about—he did not say anything about paying my master for them.</p>

I forgot my own safety, and when I was got about a yard into the alley; I turned back to see if they stop'd these two gentlemen, intending if they had so done, to call the watch; the two fellows met me body to body, one of them threatened me saying, if I spoke a word I was a dead man, he would blow my brains out if I moved an inch; I found my self in bad hands, so I turned back and set myself against the wall in the alley; the evidence placed himself on one side me, and the other person on the other, the evidence had a pistol and held it to my head, threatening as before mentioned. They took from me a gold watch, with a gold chain and seal to it, and I believe they took some silver, but I am not quite certain what I had in my pocket; the man on my right hand had his hand in my pocket about two minutes, he seem'd much concern'd and behav'd in so remarkable a manner, that the evidence took his pistol from my head, and levell'd it at his, and swore if he did not rifle me, he'd<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175101160020"></xptr> blow his brains out; he left half a crown and a shilling in my pocket; the evidence put his hand in my other pocket, and his finger in my sob; but he was in some concern, for he left half a guinea there ; then they order'd me down the alley, and they ran down Mark-lane : by the behaviour of the other fellow, I did think he had some knowledge of me, from his reluctance to hurt me; for my part I do recollect his face very well, but I cannot tell where I have seen him, nor who he is. As to Applegarth, I saw nothing of him, I saw but two persons; Soss seems to be about the size of the other man, (that was present) but I will not swear to him; but he took great pains to hide his face from me, but the evidence did not. There was a lamp about a yard from my face, it shone in my face, I had not an opportunity of seeing them as they might me. I make no doubt of the evidence being one, by answering every question I ask'd him. Soss denied knowing any thing of the evidence, but afterwards confessed before the justice, he was in bed with him that same night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Spurling. I am brother to the Prosecutor, I know nothing of it, but what came out at justice Fielding's. I attended at the examination of the two prisoners. Mr. Fielding ask'd the prisosoner Soss, whether he had any acquaintance with Brown the evidence; he absolutely denied having any before he was imprisoned with him, and mentioned this particular word, (before he turned buck or stag) which was interpreted an evidence. Mr. Fielding said, he had got this cant word very readily; there happened to be a person in company, who said he remembered him formerly being an evidence. Afterwards Soss confessed, that he lay that very night the robbery was committed, in bed with the evidence, and parted with him the next day at 8 o'clock; and also there was a woman lay in the same bed with them, but he confessed nothing of the robbery.</p>

            . The two prisoners and I went out with an intent to rob; coming along Fenchurch-street we stopped at the end of Mark-lane; we saw this gentleman coming up it; there is a little alley. We ran round and stopped him; we left Applegarth at the head of the alley. He said he would look out to see if any body came. Soss and I robbed the gentleman of a gold watch, two shillings and some halfpence; I attacked him, and Soss searched his pocket; he gave me the watch as soon as he had taken it: after we had robbed him,

               <p>DID this Minous lend you a pistol?</p>
               <p>Brown. He ask'd me five shillings for it, and I left half a crown in his hands, and I brought it back again the next morning and delivered it to him, and told him it was good for nothing: he told me he would go and buy me shot and powder, because I was afraid to buy such things.</p>
               <p>Hen. Peal. I was in a public house when Applegarth was brought in; the evidence Brown sat in a box; he said, he was not afraid of what could be done to him, for he was never concerned in but one robbery, and then he had none of the money.</p>
               <p>Applegarth's defence, I know no more of the thing than the child unborn; the evidence thought me an unfortunate man, therefore he had me put into the information.</p>
               <p>Soss's defence. The gentleman have sworn falsely against me, and that only for the sake of the reward.</p>
               <p>Manassah's defence. I have nothing to say; but let him bring a person to prove I paid him the money for the watch.</p>

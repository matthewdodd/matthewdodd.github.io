               <p>THOMAS CAWKWELL. I live at Hoddesdon, in Hertfordshire. On the 11th of December, at half-past ten o'clock at night, I met the prisoner on this side the Cock, at <placeName id="t18190113-85-crimeloc483">Edmonton</placeName>

               <p>"For what?" he said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181901130043"></xptr>" Your money!" - he spoke plainly, I could hear him distinctly. He collared me, and said,</p>
               <p>"I will have your money, or I will blow your brains out, for I have a pistol." He did not produce one. I collared him, struggled with him, and said I wanted money as bad as he did; that I had a 1 l. note, and he should have half of it - I showed it to him. I looked in his face, and said,</p>
               <p>"I thought you was an Irishman, but I see you are an Englishman, and shall have part of it. If you will go with me I will give you some beer, and will join you for the note. He refused going to Edmonton, but at last he did - we went to the Bell public-house, the landlord pushed us out. When we got out he said,</p>
               <p>"D - n you, what do you mean by asking for the landlord? if I thought you meant to betray me I would mill you directly." I said,</p>
               <p>"If I meant to betray you I could have done it before now." We then went to a watchman, and asked for a house - he directed us to one - we could not find it. I met another watchman, and gave him in charge.</p>

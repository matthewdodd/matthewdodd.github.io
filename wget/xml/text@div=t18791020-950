                  </hi>. I am a builder's material dealer, and now live at 4, Wickham Road, Tottenham—when this took place I resided at 65, Old Bethnal Green Road—I was too ill to attend here at the last Session—the prisoner is my sister; she is four years older than me—on 7th August she was living with me and my brother as housekeeper—we were moving our goods that day from 65, Old Bethnal Green Road to 4, Wickham Place—she went away for about half an hour about dinner-time, 1 o'clock—she had not dined with us—she had been in and out the whole of the morning—I had not had any quarrel with her up to dinner-time—on the recommendation of my brother I never spoke to her the whole day except in the early morning—I did not annoy her by word or gesture; I never took the faintest notice of her since 6 o'clock—she made an attack on me then with a chopper, but. it was fruitless—I had had words with her before—she had the chopper with her the previous night, and threatened me with it—she is an habitual drunkard, and my brother and I were simply watching her—we always treated her with the utmost kindness—she had a most dreadful antipathy to me—r had remonstrated with her the night before about her habits—in the morning she attacked me again with the chopper, and with the assistance of my brother and the man that was helping us to move we got it away from</p>

               <p>her—I treated that very lightly; she was intoxicated—between 12 and 1 I went out to get my dinner, and when I returned she was standing in the parlour leading to the shop—a man who was assisting us in moving took up a glass containing some stuff from the window-sill or table and put it to his mouth to drink, and it burnt him most fearfully—he came running into the kitchen to me, and I said, "I suppose that was meant for me"—the prisoner must have heard me, and as I was passing from the kitchen through the parlour she had the glass in her hand—she said, very quickly, "What's that, what's that you say, you b——if you won't have it inside you shall have it out," and with that she dashed it in my eyes or in my face, and I believe the glass followed—I believe she meant it for my eyes—I turned my head aside, and received the contents on the side of my face—it ran down my neck like quicksilver, and burnt both ears most shockingly, and under the throat and the side of my face—I could not see; I was thoroughly dazed, I scarcely knew what I was doing—I was taken to the London Hospital, and am an inmate there now—I kept my bed for some weeks; it has caused a general shock to my system.</p>

I am now living at 4, Wickham Road—I did live at 65, Old Bethnal Green Road, with my brother and sister, the prisoner—on 7th July a young man called my attention to some liquid in a glass; it looked like pale brandy—my sister came into the room and said, "Give it to me; that is mine"—I said, "No, I shall not give it to you till I know what it is"—I took it from the table and had it in my hand—I said, "Look at that man, his mouth is burnt"—she turned round to him and said, "What a fool you were to touch it without knowing what it was; I am very sorry for you"—she asked me again to give it to her—I said, "No, not till I know what it is"—she said, "It is only something that I got to clean some gloves with"—I then laid it down on the table, and saw nothing further—she was excited, and saturated with gin at the time—she has been with me about three years—she was never sober, she was continually under the influence of drink, morning, noon, and night; her nature was brutalised with drink—it is not in her nature to have done anything of this kind—I was outside</p>

I was house surgeon at the London Hospital on 7th August when the prosecutor was brought there—I examined him; he was goffering from excessive destruction of the skin—the skin and superficial structures at the back of the neck were destroyed by some corrosive fluid of an acid nature—his life was never in any danger from the immediate effects of the injury; there is always danger from remote causes—he was kept to his bed—it will result in permanent disfigurement and disablement; his neck in the course of time will be contracted, and the eye is injured; he is now unable to close his eye; it will result in the course of time in chronic ophthalmia—I believe it will prevent his being able to work—as years go on the contraction will increase—in the course of months he will be unable to close his eyelid over the eye, and so protect it from dust—the wound has nothing like healed yet—if a drop of this stuff had gone into his eyes the sight would have been destroyed immediately.</p>

About a month previous to this, when my eldest brother was out, ha kicked me in the stomach, and I could scarcely stand for a week afterwards. I complained to my eldest brother on his return, and he said I should have kept out of his way, knowing his violent temper. I said I would give information at Scotland Yard of his betting habits, and the gambling hell he intended to keep at Tottenham. He kept everything from me. I wanted a glass that belonged to my mother, and he took an inveterate hatred to me after that. On the morning of the 7th ha asked me if I intended to give him the glass, I said 'No.' He said, holding a knuckle-duster within an inch of my nose, that he would gouge my eye out if I did not return it About three hours after that, as I passed him he spat a mouthful of fluid in my face, and said,' Now, you b——sow, will you give me the glass V and if I laid a hand on anything there, he would kick my face in. He is a card-sharper and associate of the lowest scums of the earth. He goaded me to that extent that I threw it at him I got the vitriol to clean the scales, not the gloves; my eldest' brother has made a mistake. He was taunting me the whole morning through."</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live when I am out of a situa<lb></lb>tion at 12, St. George's Road, Shepherd's Bush—on 24th April, about half-past eleven, I was in Mitre Lane, on my way to St. George's Road—that is in the direction of Wormwood Scrubs—two men came out from behind some pales—the prisoner is one of them—the other man said, "I want your money"—I said, "I have none"—the prisoner snatched a veil from my face, and said that he knew I had money; he also said, "You must take the purse from your pocket and give me what you have"—the other man took a knife from his pocket, and said if I did not give him my urse he would stab me—in consequence of that I gave him my purse—it contained 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. three postage stamps, four keys, and a steel ring—the prisoner said he knew I had some in my pocket, as he heard it <hi rend="italic">jink</hi>—I turned out my pocket, and then they said they were perfectly satisfied and walked down Mitre Lane—I was afraid to follow them, and waited two or three minutes until they were out of sight, and then I went on I in the same direction—they ran down Mitre Lane, and turned to the left towards Harlesden Green—I met a policeman and told him—he went round by the public-house, and told me to go on to Willesden Green—he went in the direction the men had gone—I next saw the prisoner at about twenty minutes to ten in custody, and at once identified him—he said he was as innocent as a young child—on Friday I found part of my purse in the Harrow Road, near Harlesden Green—that would be about a mile and a quarter from where I was stopped—I am positive the prisoner is one of the men.</p>

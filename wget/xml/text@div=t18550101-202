                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs. Eyre and Spottiswoode—I knew the prisoner to be in the employ of Messrs. Leighton, of Harp-alley, Shoe-lane, bookbinders—about 7th Dec, he came to me and said that he had a friend going to Australia, who wished for a good family Bible; I gave him a catalogue and a specimen of types; he went away with them, and returned in half an hour, saying that his friend wished a really good Bible, and would I lend him one or two for his friend to select from; he said that he was not particular about the expense—I said I was very busy then, and he said he would call again—he returned in about half an hour, and I was not ready for him, having been much occupied—he said that he was going to Messrs. Leighton's, in Harp-alley, where he should be about half an hour, and then he would call again—he came again—I sent one of the men up stairs to get the Bibles—one was worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the other 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—while he was bringing them down, I asked the prisoner if he was still in the employment of Mr. Leighton; he said, "Yes"—I asked him if he liked being in the warehouse better than in his old situation; he said he did; that he did not like the in-door employment at first, but now he liked it much better than the out-door occupation—I then delivered the two Bibles to him; one was to be returned, and the other paid for—I never saw him again till he was in custody on the morning of the 19th—if I had known that he was not in Mr. Leighton's employ, I certainly should not have allowed him to have the Bibles—I believed the statement that he made, and that he was in Mr. Leighton's employment—inquiries were made at Mr. Leighton's—I then gave information to the police, and the prisoner was apprehended—I was not present, but I was sent for, and he said, "Mr. Gray, I meant no harm, I could return the books in an hour"—the books were returned last Saturday afternoon by the Parcels Delivery Company—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of them; it is worth 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to the trade—"25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." is marked in the corner of it.</p>

The</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">considered that if the verdict of the Jury in the former case was founded on the belief that the prisoner did not intend to keep the books when he obtained them, but that he afterwards retained them with a view to deprive the owner of them, then it would not be right to ask them to come to a directly opposite conclusion in the present case: but if not, and if they believed that Gray was induced to part with the books by the false pretences the prisoner made, it was still open to them, on the clearer evidence now given, to find the prisoner guilty of larceny</hi>.)</p>

The prisoner at the bar was taken into custody on the 7th of March last; I was in the upper part of my father's house at about a quarter past seven in the morning of that day; the maid servant, who is not here, called me; I went into the shop; it was open; our shopman, named Back, had opened it. On my going into the shop, I saw the prisoner; the shopman was there also; no other person was there. The prisoner presented to me a list of books, which he said, he wanted. I examined the list, and wrote on a piece of paper the prices of such as we had; it was a very long list of books. I went to the back part of the shop to shew him one of the books; I went, and he stood where he was; he desired me to fetch it. I shewed him some books from the back part of the shop; I did not shew<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030017"></xptr>him any from any other place. He staid in all, about five minutes after I came. He did not buy any: he said the books were for the Earl of Kingston, land said, he would call again, and give me an order. After he came, I missed one volume of twenty of a set of books of Cicero; the first volume was separated from the rest. I did not miss any thing else then. I went out, and saw the prisoner in custody of Mr. Setchell, and also a little boy. The one volume I had missed, was found in his bag, and the others which I had not missed also; they were Homer, three volumes, a complete set Juvenal, one volume, complete; Herodotus, complete. Fide took charge of these books, and I knew them to be my father's.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Hayes. I don't sell in the shop; I go out with books occasionally. I remember the prisoner coming to my master's shop; I let him in myself; I went down for some water; I had opened the shop, and shut the door, and when I came up with the water, I opened the door, and let the prisoner in; he shewed me a list with the prices of books, and enquired if we had them, and I said, I would send the servant to call my master. I just went to the back door of the shop for that purpose; I left nobody in the shop besides the prisoner, at that time. When I returned, he was still in the shop, and no other person there; no one else came into the shop before my young master came; when my young master came, I believe I went out to sweep the passage. I returned again into the shop before the prisoner went away. I can't say whether I was there when he went away; I was in and out while he was there. I did not see him take any thing.</p>

            . (A little boy.) The prisoner lodged at my mother's; I don't know how many weeks or days he lodged there; it was for some weeks. I went out with him the morning Mr. Setchell took him into custody; I took a pillow-case with me; I took it out empty; the prisoner bid me take it, and go with him. I don't know Mr. Hayes's shop; I know King-street, Covent Garden. The prisoner and I went to Covent Garden together. The prisoner left me a little way off from the shop where he went in, I saw him go into Mr. Setchell's; he left me a little way off from the shop where he went in. The books that were in the bag, he brought me at twice; he went away twice at one shop; that was before he went to Mr. Setchell's. I don't know the books he brought me the first time, nor how many there were; he brought some books the first time, and some more the second; he put them all in the pillow-case, and left me a little while, and went to Mr. Setchell's, and brought three more back, and he put those in the pillow case at first, and afterwards put them into a handkerchief; the pillow case was full. He kept the others i the pillow case, until Mr. Setchell came and took me back into his shop.</p>

               <p>Q. When was, it you lost these notes - A. On Friday the 12th of June; I was out at the time the robbery was committed; I did not miss it till the morning about twelve or one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you leave your money. - A. In the bed room, locked up in a table drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you accuse him of it. - A. He did not come in his quarters till near ten o'clock, and then he was very drunk indeed; he went to bed. About one o'clock, when I fastened the house up and went to bed myself, I unlocked this table drawer; I found this money deficient; I suspected the prisoner, he being drunk. I went up stairs, I found him on the bed with his clothes on; I awoke his comrade that was with him, and then I awoke him; I asked him what money he had got about him, he said none at all; I searched him. In his fob pocket. I found four one pound notes, a half guinea, two shillings, and two sixpences; in his jacket pocket I found a screw driver, with which he forced the lock; it exactly corresponded with the hole where he had been forcing the lock; I asked him how he came by that money, he said it was not his, nor had he it in his possession; I put him in the watchhouse. On the following morning I found all the remainder of the money except sixteen shillings and sixpence. I told him if he would return me the property I would forgive him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Mills; I live at 46, Georgiana-street, Camden-town. I went to the shop of Mr. Anderson, a trimming-maker, 76, High-street, Camden-town, about a quarter after six o'clock, to purchase some braid and buttons—I had a bag on the counter—I had a pone in it—I took it out of the bag to pay for the articles—after paying for them I had one shilling and a penny change; I put them into my glove—there was then some bills in one end of my purse—my purse was on the counter when I took out the half-crown to pay for the articles—I noticed a person looking at me while I was paying—there was a little girl about twelve years old between the person and me—I was not able to see his face, only his eyes—I noticed them; they were fixed on my purse—I heard him ask for three-eights of alpaca—Mr. Dale served him, and about three minutes after<lb></lb>wards I left the shop—I had put my purse in my bag—I went round Greenland-place—as I came to a post, the prisoner was there with his back towards me—he seemed to come from the road to Bayham-street—when I was crossing, he sprung round and snatched at my bag; it was twisted round my hand—I had not so much opportunity of seeing his face as his figure—he pulled my bag, and struck me at my throat—he dragged me three or four yards down Greenland-place—he then gave another tug, and the strings broke, and he left the strings with me and ran away—I could not scream until I got halfway down the court, and then a person in shirt-sleeves came up and pursued him till he was lost sight of—I did not see the prisoner again till he was brought to me on the Monday night by the officer—I noticed the eyes of this man fixed on my purse in the shop, but it was so instantly done I had not an opportunity of seeing his face—the prisoner is the person that robbed me—I say that from his appearance</p>

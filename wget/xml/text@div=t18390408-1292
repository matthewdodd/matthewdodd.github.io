                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live at Acton. The prisoner was in my service up to the Saturday before the 30th of March—he was in the habit of taking out bread and receiving money—In January I sold Mr. Lambourn, of the King's Arms, a sack of oats, which came to 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—an other man took them there, but I told the prisoner afterwards to ask for the money—it was his duty to pay cash to me every night—I keep the cash book, and he names the persons who pay him—I asked him if he had re<lb></lb>ceived this sum—his reply was, Mr. Lambourn wished a little more time, as trade had been so bad ever since Christmas, he wished it to remain a little longer—that was his reply more than once or twice—he has not accounted to me for it, or it would appear in this book—I told him about a fortnight before he left that I wished he would ask Mr. Lambourn for the money, and he made the same reply as before.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the King's Arms, at Acton Bottom. I purchased some oats of Mr. Billington, for which I paid the prisoner about the 25th or 26th of January, and he gave me this receipt—I never told him trade was bad, and I wanted time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife.

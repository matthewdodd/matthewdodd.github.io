                  </hi>. I am secretary to the Metropolitan Saloon-omnibus Company; I produce the certificate of registration—the prisoner was employed by them as one of their conductors—he was paid by a salary daily, I think it was 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a-day—these two account-books were handed to me by the police-constable who took the prisoner in custody; one of them seems to have a quantity of bets in it, the other portion has reference to various way-bills—I have compared the way-bill of Friday, the 30th July, with an entry I find in this book—it is the up journey from Putney to London—there were four journeys in a day performed by that omnibus—I compared the entry of the last journey in this way-bill (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) with this book—on the up journey from Putney to London here are 5 inside and 9 outside passengers, and here is 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in small figures; that has nothing at all to do with that journey—it was the duty of the conductor to make a return for the journeys of the day, on the following day, on the first journey out, and for the money at the same time; that is the rule, to account for the previous day and to return the money to the boy Church.</p>

               <p>there are no more after that—the previous omnibus starts at 10 minutes before 7, and this one at 7-10—this omnibus was due at Sloane-street at 7 minutes to 8, and at the White-horse-cellar at 8 o'clock—I know there was a slate found on the prisoner—there is a time to wait at each place, and there would be time then to make the entries if they were not made in going along.</p>

I am a clerk to the Metropolitan Saloon-omnibus Com<lb></lb>pany—the prisoner was conductor of the omnibus No. 7,154, from Fulham to London—I produce the bill of 30th July—it was the prisoner's duty to receive money—I received a bag from the prisoner on the morning of 31st July; that bag should contain the bill and money of 30th July—the bag was opened by Mr. Hart in my presence, it contained 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in money and 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for contract tickets and this way-bill—this was in Davison's bag—I gave the money and bill in this condition to Mr. Hart—Cook, the conductor of the previous omnibus, accounted to me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you know that these are made up at the end of the day by the conductor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I suppose they are—he has to start from Putney-bridge, and when he arrives he has to go back in a few minutes—there are four up and four down journeys each day—when he gets back to Putney-bridge he sometimes may wait half an hour—he has his dinner or his lunch to get—it takes about an hour and a half to go from Putney-bridge to London-bridge railway-station—there are some persons who travel free, the company's servants, but if they ride free their names are indorsed on the back of the bill—the railway servants and persons engaged in work ride free—the contract tickets are in the bag—I don't know whether Mr. Argles charged a man of the name of Butler—I don't know that Cook was charged with this; I know he had a summons sent him; I believe it was about this matter—there are some omnibusses belonging to a man of the name of Hughes, they go part of the way on our line; I believe our directors are friendly with them, and take up passengers for them—the Chelsea and Islington omnibusses ride on the same road from Brompton to the Regent-circus.</p>

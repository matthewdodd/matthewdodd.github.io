In consequence of suspicion, my clerk, in my presence, marked some half-crowns, shillings and sixpences on the 5th of July; they were put into the till the first thing in the morning - I counted them at twelve o'clock, and they were all right; I counted them again at two o'clock and four shillings were gone - we sent for an officer, and found some shillings on the prisoner, three of which were marked - the other marked shilling has not been found; I produce three which were marked in the same way.</p>

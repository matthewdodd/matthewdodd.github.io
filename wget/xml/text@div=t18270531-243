In consequence of suspicion I marked 28s. in half-crowns and shillings - it was marked on the tail; there was no more in the till. I went to Mr. Hems, and gave him four half-crowns and two shillings, marked money, to send a person to my shop, to lay out, on the morning of the 1st of May - there was then 16s. in the till. I went out, leaving the prisoner in care of the shop - I examined the till about ten minutes past nine o'clock, and found 34s. in it; I had seen other customers at the shop; there was but 23s. of the marked money. I went to Hems - he returned with me; I called the prisoner into the counting-house, and told him I missed money out of the till; he appeared confused, and denied having taken any - I called Hems in, who said to him, "I know all about it - come pull out what money you have in your pocket;" he then pulled out two of the half-crowns which I had marked; Hems said, "I can swear to these;" he had other money, not marked in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Had you put any marked money into the till the day before? A. Yes, and spoken to Hems that day, but I found all right that day. I cannot say what other customers had paid.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was there any gold or notes in the till? A. No; he could not have given change.</p>

            . I am a headborough. I received this money, in the prisoner's presence, from Hems; it has been in my possession ever since; the prisoner said he had put some other money into the till instead of the two half-crowns.</p>
               <p>MR. GARDINER. It was his duty to put the money into the till immediately. I know these half-crowns by the marks.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Did not you find some small silver in your till? A. Yes.</p>

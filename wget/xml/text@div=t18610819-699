I am a constable, attached to the post-office—on 12th July, I received instructions to go to the West Central Office, in Holborn, and placed myself in a position to command the water-closets, in the base of the building—I could not be seen from the water-closets—about half-past 6 in the morning, the prisoner went to closet No. 5—he bolted the door, sat down on the seat without undoing his clothes, and took five or six letters from one of his pockets inside his coat, and placed them on the seat by his side—he took one up and examined it, took a piece of rag from his waistcoat pocket, wetted it with his mouth, and tried to wet the gum on the outside of the envelope; he then took his knife and tried to open it with the blade—he succeeded in opening one or two, without tearing the paper, and one or two he broke open and tore the letter and envelope into small pieces, and then threw them down the pan—those which he succeeded in opening I afterwards saw in his hand, refastened, and he put them in his coat pocket, after remaining there twenty minutes—I communicated with a plumber, named Blackburn, about half an hour after the prisoner left, and I afterwards saw the fragments of a letter, addressed to Miss Kemp, in Lia possession, and of two or three other letters—they were all given to Mr. Gardiner—when the prisoner had concluded his evening delivery that day, I followed him, and took him in custody on another charged took him to the Post Office, searched him, and found these three pieces of crotchet in his waistcoat pocket—one piece was stained, apparently with wine, as it now appears—he was asked, in my presence, where he got them from, and said that he found them one day when he was on his walk betweeen Frederick-street and Hampton-street, Gray's-inn-road—I asked him when—he said, "About a month ago.".</p>

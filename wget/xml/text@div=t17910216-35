               <p>I am a carpenter. As I was coming from the pay table Saturday week past, between seven and eight in the evening, I heard a great noise in one of the buildings belonging to my master; I stepped up and saw this bit of wainscot leaning out of the passage, half way in and half way out, with a rope round it; I heard a great noise as if it was cracking of wood; I walked backward and forward, and waited till the prisoner came out, which after a little bit he did, and took this bit of wainscot, and moved it from the door; I directly ran up to him and took it from his arms, and called a man to assist me, and took him down to the pay table; I then put it in the cellar, and when we came back again we put it in another house, and locked it up: I am sure it is the same piece; I have not the least doubt: I gave it to the constable on the next Tuesday afternoon, and it has been in his care ever since: the constable's name is

               <p>What occasion had that door to be open at that time? - I cannot say any thing about that.</p>

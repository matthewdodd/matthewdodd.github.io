                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Allen, a hatter, and live in Swan-street, Dover-road, Borough. I saw my cloak safe on Friday, the 24th of January, about five minutes before it was stolen, across the back of a chair, in the front parlour, where I had put it on the previous evening—Ellis gave an alarm—I went to the door, and he had the prisoner there with the cloak—I went into the parlour, and it was gone from there—I did not know the prisoner before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live twenty or thirty yards from Allen. On the 24th of January, I was sitting at work at my house opposite Allen's, and saw the prisoner and another lad loitering about there—I watched them, and saw the prisoner go to Allen's window, lift the sash up, open the builds, lean himself in, and take the cloak off the</p>

                  </hi>. Lane was in my employ eighteen months, and left me three weeks after Christmas—while he was with me I lost several sacks—these are some of them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I was present on 27th June, when they were found at Neale's house—two policemen went with me there, and asked if he had any sacks of mine—he said he had one or two, and pro<lb></lb>duced them—he was then asked if had any more, and he said, "No"—the policemen went up-stairs with Neale's wife and brought some more down—Neale said that my servant <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>, by which name Lane goes, brought them one Sunday morning about Christmas.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>.) On 27th June I went with Mr. Hobbs and Holland to Neale's house—I told Neale we had come respecting some sacks, and said, "There is one of them lying on the floor now"—I asked him where he got it, he said, "Mr. Hobbs's man left it"—I asked whether that was all he had got, he said, "Yes"—I said, "You have got some more, for I saw some outside"—I found two outside the shop, and three in the stable—I asked if he had any up-stairs, he said, No, he had not got any more, unless there were any outside—Holland went up-stairs, and returned with seven more—I took Neale, and told him he was charged with receiving these sacks, the property of Mr. Hobbs, knowing them to be stolen—he said <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> had left them there one Sunday morning, some months ago—in conse-road, quence of information I got from Neale, I found Lane in the Whitechapel-and told him I came to him respecting some sacks Neale had got—he said he knew nothing about it—I said Neale was in custody, and said that he had them of him—he said, "I did sell him some sacks, I had them of a man in Smithfield"—I told him the sacks belonged to Mr. Hobbs, his former master, and I should take him into custody for stealing them—he said he had left Mr. Hobbs's some months—I told him I knew of this some months ago—he said, "You might have let me known, I would have squared it up.

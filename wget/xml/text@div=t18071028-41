               <p>Q. Did you lose an axe, a square, a box pin, and a brush - A. Yes, on the 25th of September; I lost them all at one time, out of a shed in Mr. Whitehead's fields; I had put them in the shed on the over night at a quarter after six; I went to my work; I missed them, I saw them about nine o'clock at Mr. Clarke's; the prisoner was in the watchhouse; I knew they were my tools.</p>
               <p>- BUTTERWORTH. I am an officer of Bow street. On the 25th of September, twenty minutes past twelve at midnight, the prisoner Saunders was sitting on a basket; I asked him what he had got in the basket, he said he was going to take the things in his basket to Isleworth, one Mr. Phene had given them to him to take there, he was gone on in a chaise; I did not believe the story, I put him in the watch-house; I kept the tools. Then he said he would tell me the truth, and shew me the place where he took the things from, which he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to be sensible. - A. Perfectly sensible.</p>

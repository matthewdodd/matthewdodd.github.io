I took some goods to the house of Mr. Young, in James-street, Oxford-street, on the 14th of Dec.—I received them from the prisoner—the bill was inclosed with them—it was between dinner and tea time—I saw Mr. Young, and delivered the goods to him—he returned me part of them, and paid me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5 1/4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there is a parcels' book kept at our house, and the prisoner was what is called parcels' clerk—on my return I handed the whole of the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5 1/4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to the prisoner, on the same evening—there were two sovereigns and the rest in silver.</p>

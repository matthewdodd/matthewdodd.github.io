There came one Fennel into the house, whose wife keeps a broker's shop, and hearing we had lost a tea-kettle, he said, such a tea-kettle was offered to his wife the night before to be sold, with about a pint and a half of boiling water in it. The Prisoner came into the house some time afterwards, and I asked her, if she wanted to steal another tea-kettel;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174509110035"></xptr> she said , she never was in my house before , and used me with ill words, though I used her with very good words; I said, I would send to the woman that she offered it to; and if she did not say, she brought the kettle to her, she should go about her business: I sent for Mrs. Fennell, and she said, she was the person; then she begged and cried and desired to be excused; and said, she had sold it for 2 s. 3 d. at a Brazier's shop , but could not tell where, for she had not been in town above three weeks. I found it at one Mr. Beardman's a Brazier's in St. John's Street.</p>

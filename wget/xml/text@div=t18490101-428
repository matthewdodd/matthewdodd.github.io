                  </hi>. I am a coal-merchant, of Jamaica-wharf, Upper Ground-street. I am in partnership with James Neal—there was a barge, laden with coals, belonging to us, lying off our wharf, on Christmas-day—the coals pro<lb></lb>duced by the policeman, to all appearance, are the same as those in our barge—I could not say that I missed any, because a quantity of rain had fallen.</p>

On Christmas morning, between eight and nine o'clock, I saw the prisoners on some barges at the prosecutor's wharf—Goodwin jumped into his boat—I rowed down, and found some coals in it—he said they were sweepings—I said, "These are not sweepings"—he said, "Yes, they are"—I saw the Ludgroves crossing the barges, and took them—I saw the other boat of coals—they said they had got them out of the craft there—I looked, and there had been no craft recently swept, and the craft were not on the place where they were—there were no barges there but the prosecutor's—we weighed the coals—those in Goodwin's boat weighed about five, and those in the other about six cwt.—they were quite dry.</p>

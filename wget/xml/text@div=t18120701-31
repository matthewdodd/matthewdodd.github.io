               <p>Q. When was it you lost these two notes - A. Between twelve and one o'clock this morning I was coming home from the west end of the town. I was on the pavement of <placeName id="t18120701-31-crimeloc184">Moorfields</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18120701-31-crimeloc184" type="placeName" value="Moorfields"></interp>

She said, she hoped I would not be so hard-hearted as the man she had met before. She lugged me along until she got me into Ropemaker-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You went with her into Ropemaker-street - A. Yes. She slipped her hand down, and I thought she had hold of my watch-chain, instead of that she slipped her hand into my pocket, and took the money out.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was it - A. Two pounds two shillings. I had the two one-pound notes of my master, in the afternoon, to go and buy three pair of boot legs. Immediately she parted with me I found my money was gone. I ran after her, and said, give me my money: you have got my money. She denied it. There was another girl alongside of her; and when she came to the watchhouse she was searched, and only two shillings were found on her. I suppose she had conveyed it away to the other girl. I saw her speak to the other girl. The other girl went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. RAVENHILL. I was officer of the night. I searched the prisoner in the watchhouse. I found nothing on her but two shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Between twelve and one I was talking to a gentleman in the square. That gentleman came and took hold of me by the arm, and gave charge of me. I never insulted him at all, so help me God.</p>

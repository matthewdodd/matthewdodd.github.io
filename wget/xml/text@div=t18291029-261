            . The day before yesterday I was going home to Walthamstow, and called on my daughter at Newington. I and my wife had two pints of porter at the Three Crowns - we left at half-past seven o'clock in the evening; I was perfectly sober: when we got to <placeName id="t18291029-261-crimeloc1463">Tile-kiln-lane</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18291029-261-crimeloc1463" type="placeName" value="Tile-kiln-lane"></interp>
                  <interp inst="t18291029-261-crimeloc1463" type="type" value="crimeLocation"></interp>
                  <join result="offencePlace" targOrder="Y" targets="t18291029-261-off1462 t18291029-261-crimeloc1463"></join>, I met three men - I saw them before they came up to us; the prisoner was one of them, and he had a pack at his back - a man on his right-hand struck me, and I fell; in getting up the prisoner's hand was close against my watch; I called out Watch! my wife then said she was struck, and I cried Murder! the men made the best of their way off - I am certain the prisoner was one, and he was in the middle; it was star-light - the prisoner went forty or fifty yards, then came back, and said, "What the devil is the matter?" we called Watch! Watch! he ran, and called Watch! Picket came up, and he had hold of the prisoner; I said that was the very man, and he had been in the centre of the three, with a pack at his back - he is a bird-catcher; neither of the others had a pack - I saw his face quite plain; the officer took charge of him, and he was taken to the watch-house - I did not lose my watch; he put his hand against it, but the seals were in my clothes, and there was nothing for any one to lay hold of.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. He was quite a stranger? A. Yes; there was a lamp in the lane - there were no trees near us; I swear to him both by the fact, and the man himself - I was not muddled; the man who ran away, called Watch! the man who struck against my watch, went away, and came back - he did not say any thing, till he came back; no hand had been thrust into my fob.</p>
               <p>MARTHA WILBEY. I am the prosecutor's wife. In Tile Kiln-lane, we met three men; they knocked my husband's hat off - the prisoner put his hand to my husband's watch; he had a pack on his back - I saw it as I picked up my husband's hat; I said, "How dare you insult my husband, he said nothing to you;" one of the others then struck me in the eye.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined Q. Had you been with your husband all the afternoon? A. Yes, and drank a little, but not to hurt me - I drank at a grocer's shop, but not at the Three Crowns, only two pints were drank there - I saw a large bunch of onions.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PICKET. I am an officer. I went into Tile Kiln-lane, on my way home; I met three or four men running, who said, "They want you - a man and woman have been insulted down the lane; have you met a man?" I said Yes - they said, "Had he any thing on his back?" I said No - I ran down the hill, and saw the prosecutor; his wife was holding her handkerchief to her eye - I said,"Which way did he go?" they said, "Down the hill;" I ran and overtook the prisoner, who was walking towards the bridge - I said, "You are my prisoner;" he said he was willing to go with me, but he knew nothing of it - the prosecuter said he was the man who tried to take his watch; the prisoner had some onions, and a large package of bird-cages - the prosecutor said he was one of the three that had insulted him, and had put his hand to his watch</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say he was the man who clapped his hand to his watch? A.Something like that; the prisoner had a large load - he had some sticks, or poles, and some nets; that is a very common place for bird-catchers on Sundays - there had been several parties of bird-catchers that day.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Were your watch and seals entirely concealed? A. Yes; no one could take hold of it - he put his hand against it; he did not strike me in any other way - I told Henry Watts how we had been used, and he told the officer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I got to the high bridge, one hundred or two hundred and fifty yards before the prosecutor - I heard the woman cry out; I turned back and said, "Mistress, what is the matter?" I then went on, but I had lost a little dog, and went back to see for him - I then turned to go home, and met the officer.</p>

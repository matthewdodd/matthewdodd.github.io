               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hart. Q. Did you drink any thing at Smith's before you went to Fairclough's? - A. Yes, a pot of beer; then we went to Fairclough's, and had two or three pots of beer, and a couple of glasses of gin; I don't know whether the prisoner was drunk, but I was; Fairclough said, I was groggy, and had better call for the change.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the prisoner that you would come and live with him when you were not at sea? - A. I don't know that he had a house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where about in the street was it that he took the money out of your pocket? - A. Near to Mr. Philips's brewhouse-gate, a couple of hundred yards from Fairclough's; I saw the money not half an hour before; I was afraid to cry out, thinking, if I did something, worse might happen; it is a public street, but I saw nobody; I never said I gave it him, upon my oath; I then went home; I did not go to Smith's again that night, but, on Sunday, I did, and asked him if I had left my money there.</p>
               <p>Q. If you knew the prisoner had taken it all from you, how came you to go there? - A. I did not thoroughly recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you don't recollect now? - A. Yes, I do, and am very sorry I do.</p>

             sworn. - I am a waterman and lighterman, and know the prosecutor: On Saturday I saw him at Mr. Faith's; Smith's is opposite to Mr. Faith's; I went to Mr. Smith's, and got the note changed; that Smith's is a liquor-shop; there are two Smith's; I took one pound four shillings for one of his ship-mates, who lodges with me; I left him at Smith's, the liquor-shop, nobody was with him then; about ten minutes after, I saw him at Smith's, the public-house; I don't know the numbers of the notes; the prisoner was there; I left them together.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hart. Q. The prisoner was not by when the prosecutor received the change? - A. No, he was at the other Smith's; the prosecutor called on me on Sunday morning, before I was up, and asked me if I had any money; I said, I had; says he, I want a little; I asked him what he had done with all his money; he said, he had lost it; I asked him where he parted with the prisoner; he did not say where, but said, he had been drinking at Fairclough's and Smith's, and two or three more houses; we then went about to enquire after it; I asked what time he had been at Smith's, the liquor-shop, on Saturday night; he said, he had been there sometime at night, and had something to drink, but he had no money; I then went to Smith, the publican, and asked when the prosecutor went from his house; I heard they both went away together; we then went to Mr. Donnell's, the Black Bull, New Gravel-lane, to enquire after the prisoner, where we heard the prisoner had wanted change for a ten-pound note; then the prosecutor said, "Anthony had his money."</p>
               <p>WILLIAM FAIRCLOUGH sworn. - I keep the Swan and Lamb, and know the prosecutor and prisoner; they came to my house about ten o'clock on Saturday; they were rather fresh in liquor; they had some beer, and Martin sent for steaks; after dinner, he called for the reckoning; they had two pots of beer, two half pints of gin, and four or five half pints of rum; they gave some of it away; he gave me a two-pound note, and Kidman asked me for the change; I told him Martin gave me the note, and I should give him the change; I saw Martin was so much in liquor, and that he had a seven-shilling piece and half-a-crown, I thought it was money enough, and told him to call to-morrow for the change; I saw no more of them that day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hart. Q. The prisoner was not so drunk as Martin? - A. I have known the prisoner some years; he is very well when solid and sober, but, when drunk, he is like a mad fellow.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180110280067"></xptr>PETER DONNELL sworn. - I keep the Black-Bull, in New Gravel-lane; I saw the prisoner on Saturday, between eight and nine o'clock in my house; he had a pot of beer, and offered me a ten-pound note to change; I said, I had not change; my house is close to Fairclough's; it was changed in my house.</p>
               <p>- WATES sworn. - I am an anchor-smith; I was at Donnell's house on Saturday night paying my men; the prisoner tendered a ten-pound note to Donnell for change; he could not, and I gave him two five-pound notes for it; he asked me to take care of one for him, for he should lose or spend it; but his wife took it; he took it from her, and brought me both of them to keep for him, for fear he should spend or lose them; I put them in my pocket book, and have them now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hart. Q. How long have you known the prisoner? - A. I have known him eleven years; he has worked under me when I was journeyman to Mr. Perry; I have trusted him with above a thousand pounds of stock around him, and always found him honest; when drunk, he collects the boys together, and exercises them.</p>

             sworn. - I and Davis apprehended the prisoner at the Rising Sun, in Sir William Warren Square; I told him I wanted him on suspicion of robbing a man; he said, he would not go with a dozen such as me; then he would not be searched; and I drew a pistol out, and told him, if he made any resistance, he should have the contents; then he submitted to be searched, and I found two half-guineas, three seven-shilling pieces, and one pound fourteen shillings and six-pence, in silver, on him.</p>

               <p>ANTHONY BURTON sworn. - I keep the Ship, at Blackwall; I asked Martin how he came to lose his money; he said, he had treated the prisoner with beef steaks, and they got in liquor together; and he did not know whether he did not give him the notes to take care of for him; when he spoke of the prisoner, he called him mad Anthony; I have known the prisoner twelve or fourteen years; he is a hard-working man, and is considered as an honest man.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t18011028-79-verdict430" type="verdictDescription">

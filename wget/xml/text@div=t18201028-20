On the last Wednesday in September, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I was in the Harrow-road, in a single horse chaise, alone; a little beyond the two mile stone from London, three men came up to me - the road was repairing, and I was driving very gently - it was very dark. They came from the footpath, rushed up to me, and cried</p>
               <p>"Stop!" One took hold of the reins at the horse's head, another came on the left, and got into the gig; the other came on the right and got on the step. The man who got in presented a pistol at my forehead, and demanded what I had. He took from my left breeches pocket one 10 l. and six 1 l. notes; he desired me to be quiet and he would not hurt me. The man on the step took my gold watch from my fob, which had two gold seals, a gold key, and a ring; he also took 15 s. or 16 s., and from one of my pockets I lost a gold lancet-case, containing two lancets; he took a silk handkerchief, and demanded my box-coat - I begged for it, saying I was a medical man, going a great distance, and that the weather was very cold. The one who held the reins called out,</p>
               <p>"Blow his b - dy brains out, if he does not make haste!" They took the coat, and the one on the left looked to see if he had dropped anything in the gig, and finding my glove, he gave it to me, and told me to drive on. They went through a field. I have since seen my pocket handkerchief at Bow-street on the Monday after I was robbed, or the Thursday following. I will not swear, but I really believe Eaton, by his voice, to be the man who presented the pistol, and Hughes, by his voice, I believe to be the man who came on my right. Hunt I will not swear to, but it was a slender man who held the horse.</p>

            . On the 30th of September I was out with other officers - we took the prisoners; Hunt was the foremost towards the country. I told him to stop, for I was an officer, he immediately ran towards London. I told him if he did not stop I would fire at him, he pulled out a pistol. I secured him, and found two 1 l. notes, three half-crowns, a sixpence, four-pence, a steel purse, a handkerchief, and a comb on him. The pistol was loaded with swan-shot and powder.</p>

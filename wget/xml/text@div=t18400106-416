                  </hi>I am the sister of Sarah Wood. I was present at her marriage to the prisoner, on the 22nd of October, 1838, at Shoreditch church—they had been acquainted nearly two years—they did not sleep together regularly every night afterwards, but he visited her until March—he generally came two or three times a week after the marriage—Mr. De Coster, who brought the prisoner up from infancy, was to put him in busi<lb></lb>

               <p>ness, and he arranged with my sister that she should stop at home until he did put him in business—I did not hear that from the prisoner—I knew it from my sister—I have frequently heard the prisoner say, Mr. De Cos<lb></lb>ter was to put him in business—the interviews between him and his wife took place at the house where I lived with my sister—they were in a pri<lb></lb>vate apartment, in the front parlour—I was not present at all times—they usually sat alone.</p>

No, nor any of the family—I was at the wedding—we all returned home—the prisoner lived with his aunt, in Clifton-street—my sister ac<lb></lb>companied him to Mr. De Coster's—she came home again that day, and the prisoner with her—he did not sleep in our house that night—he never slept there—my sister lived in the house—I never saw the second wife till she came to us—I saw her at our house before her marriage—she inquired of me whether the prisoner was married to my sister—I fully satisfied her that he was married—I called my sister down to satisfy her of that, and she satisfied her she was his wife in every respect—I did not hear what she said to her myself—I told Miss Riseley they were married.</p>

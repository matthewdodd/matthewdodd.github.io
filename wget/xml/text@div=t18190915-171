On the 6th of September, he asked me for a holiday or two - he said he would return on Wednesday the 8th; I said I would spare him. On the 7th, about three o'clock in the morning, I went to my field and found my haystack down - it appeared to have fallen down: it must have been cut away underneath. The prisoner had no orders from me to cut or sell it - I meant it for my own use; I found the prisoner there binding some hay. The stack had fallen into a ditch, and part into another field. I asked him what he had done with the hay that he had bound that morning? He said he had not bound any. I repeated the question two or three times, but he said he had not bound any. I called Smith forward - he had given me information, and asked the prisoner, in his presence, if he had seen any hay bound about twelve o'clock? He said Yes, he supposed that he saw more than a load. He asked the prisoner if Tom had been there that day, for he understood that he was not coming; the prisoner said he had been there, and was gone sometime. I then asked him what was done with the hay that was bound and gone away that morning? and told him he had better tell me. In consequence of what he said I went with him to Bumpstead. He had no authority to deliver hay.</p>

            . I live in Vine-street. On the 7th of September, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I was passing the prosecutor's field - the stack was then standing, and above a load of hay bound - no one was in the field. I returned about half-past twelve; the stack was then down, the hay that had been bound was carried<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181909150058"></xptr>away. The prisoner was in the field, and said he was going to Holloway, and that some boys had jumped on the haystack, and thrown it down. I said,</p>
               <p>"You have sent away a load of hay." He said Yes, he had. I said,</p>
               <p>"Why, Tom has not been here to day." He said Yes, he had, and had been gone long ago. I told Mr. Cossey, and returned to the field with him.</p>

            . When the prosecutor arrived at Portsmouth, he set off the next day, he arrived in London on the 12th or 13th of December, and met with the prisoner; he asked him if he had any knowledge of the sack; he said, no; after being interogated; he said the sack was in the birth in the ship. We found the sack in the ship, but the pistols were not in the sack. The custom-house officer told us that Bravo took the pistols away in a handkerchief; I went to Bravo's lodgings, and took an officer; the prisoner denied having the pistols.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find the pistols - A. Yes; about the 15th of January, in London Wall, at Mr. Read's.</p>
               <p>- MENDOZA. The prisoner was brought to my house by Lumbazy; he said, here is a young man, a mate of a ship, he has a pair of pistols to sell. I said I was no judge, I would shew them to the trade.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive the pistols of the prisoner - A. I did, on commission to sell them; I sold them to Levy for three pounds, and took the prisoner the money; he gave me half a crown for my trouble.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am in a destitute and unfortunate situation. My passage to the British shore was totally unavoidable. I am a native of Sweden; owing to the conscripts made by the French government I left my home. I have no qualification for being a soldier, being subject to fits. My father proposed to send me to Philadelphia; having procured for me money he sent me to embark in an American vessel. Not being able to go in the American vessel I was recommended to take a passage on board a ship bound to England, from which it was told me that I might easily go to America. I am not only destitute of a communication to my father, but prevented from my voyage to America. Fortunately my destitute case is made known to a gentleman, this gentleman knows my father; it is from the kind munificence of this gentleman I am obliged to for my existence.</p>

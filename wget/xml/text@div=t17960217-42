               <p>Q. Where were these upper leathers lying? - A. Upon a cross bench behind the counter, one upon the other; he came to work about seven in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. His business is to open the shop? - A. Sometimes; but it is the business of the younger porter to open and shut shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the course of his business that morning lead him to the place where these upper leathers laid? - A. He must go there to unscrew the screws.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in the shop that morning? - A. I came a little after seven, and found him there; he went out to breakfast between eight and nine; I had missed them before he went out.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any directions from your master, did you sollow the prisoner? - A. I did; he was got about two doors, I called John, he returned, and I advanced; I said, you must come back; he said,</p>
               <p>"why, what is the matter?" I said, John, there is an unfortunate circumstance happened, I have missed two pair of upper leathers, and you must go back; he hesitated, and rather refused to come back; but when I seemed determined, he came back with me; Mr. Jackson was waiting in the shop; we went up into the ware-room, and Mr. Jackson said, you must, or you shall be searched; I laid hold of his coat pocket, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170080"></xptr>prisoner, in a very affecting way, said, I have got them; he took one pair out of one pocket, and another pair out of the other, and gave them into my hands; I have had them ever since, (produces them).</p>
               <p>Q.Are there any marks upon them? - A. There is my name upon them.</p>
               <p>Q.Where they marked before you took them from him? - A. There is the mark of the currier's man upon it.</p>
               <p>Q.Was there any further conversation between your master and the prisoner? - A. No more than the unfortunate man went down upon his knees, and begged for mercy, and he would do any thing if he would spare him; he said,</p>
               <p>"no John, I will hear nothing, say nothing, I have caught you."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did any such thing as this pass - the man said, he was in want of shoes, he had taken them and meant to account for them? - A. Not a word.</p>
               <p>Q.Was any promise made him, if he would tell any thing about it? - A. None at all; Mr. Jackson was very guarded.</p>
               <p>SILAS RANCE sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the foreman that sells the leather; I happened to be there when the prisoner was brought back; they shut the door, and Mr. Jackson desired me to bear witness; that he had some suspicion of his robbing him, and he had some property about him; I left my work, and Mr. Jackson desired Cooper to search him; he first denied that he had any property about him, and then, he said, I have some of your property, Sir, and he put his hand to his right hand pocket, and pulled out one pair of upper leathers, and then to his left hand pocket, and pulled out another pair; I went for a constable.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, I did not disown having the property about me; but I did not mean to wrong him of them; I never did wrong any body in my life, to my knowledge; he has entrusted me with a great deal of property; I leave the rest of my defence to my counsel.</p>

               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>JOHN COOPER called up again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. This man has been in better circumstances, I believe; he was a horse dealer, in a considerable line? - A. Yes; since I have known him he behaved as a willing servant, and always did what he had to do cheerfully, and has sometimes done a job at over hours; he has a wife, a very honest woman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a draper's assistant, at No. 70, St. Paul's—churchyard. On 20th Feb. I met the prisoner near Savage-gardens, Tower-hill, about a quarter to 9 o'clock in the evening; she said something about the weather, and asked me in what direction I was going; I continued to walk on, and turned down a street which was in my road—she followed me; I stopped immediately, and while I was standing there, which was about two minutes, I felt her fingers or my purse go from my pocket; two men came round to prevent my securing her, and asked me the way to some place—I ran round them, and pursued her, having missed my purse, which was safe when I left St. Paul's-churchyard, 20 minutes previously, and I had not taken it out—it contained two half crowns, one shilling, one sixpence, two receipt stamps, I think, and one postage stamp, and two or three cards—I overtook the prisoner rather more than 200 yards off; I kept by her side, and demanded my purse; she gave it me empty as I thought, but I found a sixpence in it, and the stamps—I am sure it was the same purse, it has my name on it—two men from the crowd tried to prevent my keeping with her; I believe they were the same men, but cannot swear to them—the prisoner got away from me some 12 yards in consequence, but I called a constable, and she was taken in my presence.</p>

I saw the prosecutor in a crowd of 150 or 200 people, holding the prisoner—she got away from him, and I went after her, and took her; she said that she knew nothing about it—a shilling and a farthing were found on her at the station.</p>

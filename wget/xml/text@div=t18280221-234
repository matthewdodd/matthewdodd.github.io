On the 16th of January, at night, about eleven o'clock, I was rather the worse for liquor, and had been at Mr. Maxwell's public-house, near Leather-lane - I do not know whether the prisoner was there - the watch was in my fob; I missed it while I was at Maxwell's - the prisoner might have been there without my knowing it; I looked at my watch at ten o'clock - whether I put into my fob, I cannot say; I might have dropped it; I went into the yard - I mentioned it in the house when I missed it; the next day I saw it at Hatton-garden - the prisoner was in custody; I never knew him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You might have left the watch in the yard? A. Yes; it is more likely that I did than not. The prisoner said at the office that he had found it in the yard.</p>

             I am an officer of Hatton-garden. I received information, and apprehended him; I asked where the watch was, and he said his mother had it; I was searching him, and he pulled it out of his right-hand pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you hear that he had shown the watch to anybody? A. No; I received my information from the landlord's brother.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

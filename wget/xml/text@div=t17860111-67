               <p>Was not it dark? - Yes.</p>

               <p>How long did you remain on the ground? - They left me on the ground, and as soon as they left me, I arose from the ground, and by the light of the lamps I saw them pass, and I followed them, I never lost sight of them, till they went into a house, it was a private house, in Virginia-street; they went into a door which was marked with chalk, I went and told a gentleman at the next door the case, and he got a constable immediately, and he went up stairs and took them; I was with him, they were sitting in a chair doing nothing; I gave charge of them, they said; they were not the men, the man that keeps the house, was in the house, but no other man that I saw; the officer searched their pockets, they owned they came across the hill.</p>

               <p>How long was it before you got a constable? - As far as I can tell about ten minutes.</p>

               <p>Do you know their persons? - Yes, I am sure of the men by the light of the lamps, and the candles of the pastry-cook's shop, I took observation upon them.</p>

               <p>Now, remember the lives of these two men depend upon what you say, can you take upon yourself to swear to these two men by that light? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowles, Prisoner's Counsel to Jones. Were you quite sober at that time? - Yes, as sober as I am now.</p>

               <p>The night very dark? - Yes, it was dark.</p>

               <p>You went to the Justice's the same evening? - Yes.</p>

               <p>How happened you to mistake one of the Justice's men for the constable you took with you? - O! Sir, no such thing, I knew the constable.</p>

               <p>You was knocked down? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Stunned by the blow? - Yes, for a small space of time.</p>

               <p>No light near you when you were knocked down? - No more than the lamps.</p>

               <p>Do not you know when these men were searched, there was nothing found upon them? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did not they say, they were ready to go with you any where, that they were not the men? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Who admitted you into the house? - The door was chained, and when I knocked, the door was opened by Mr. Hinde, and the prosecutor said, these are the two men that robbed me; the men were sitting in a chair in the room next the fire place, in the second floor.</p>

               <p>Were they drinking? - No, nothing at all, they came from on board a ship, they said, for some linen to be washed, I searched their pockets, and found no property upon them, I took them to the Justice, and the prosecutor swore to the men.</p>

               <p>Was the prosecutor drunk or sober? - Upon my word, I am not able to say, he might be in liquor, or he might not; he said he never lost sight of them, the men behaved very civil, and were willing to go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110165"></xptr> to the Justice's, they said they were not the men.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowles. When you went to the Justice's did Jones know you? - Yes, Sir, he knew me, but however some people say he was in liquor, and that he did not know me from one of the runners; I had a coat on, and a handkerchief about my neck, like one of the runners; that was the opinion of the people that stood about, I did not observe myself.</p>

               <p>From what place did they come? - From a brig that was at Horsely-down-stairs, the other side of the water, I have known both the prisoners since they have been now in the river, one of them is my brother in law, I have known him for years, he bears as good a character as any man in the world; I did not expect them that night, Brewer often comes to our house, my wife washes for him and his sister, and the other man came along with him.</p>

               <p>Court. Is the direct way from Horsely-down-stairs, to Virginia-street, over Tower-hill? - Yes, they came over the bridge, they had not money to bring them over the water, so they came to save expences across the bridge.</p>

            . I am a clerk of the Bank of England. I produce a 50l. and a 40l. note, paid into the Bank on the 21st January, by Leaf, Son and Coles.</p>
               <p>MR. OSBORN. This 40l. note I am certain is what I received from the prisoner - my own hand-writing is on it; the 50l. note agrees with the number of the note I took when I sent it to Leaf and Co.'s - I found it in my cash-box the name of Cotton which she gave me is on the 40l.</p>
               <p>MISS OSBORN. I am sure of this being the 50l. note; I put it into the cash-box.</p>
               <p>MR. OSBORN. It is the 50l. note I found in the cashbox - there was another 50l. note there, but this was the only one I sent to Leaf and Co.</p>

            . I received the 40l. note from Thackeray, and the 50l. from Cresswell; I do not know the identical notes, but I am sure I put the same notes as I received from them into the cash-box, on the 18th and 20th of October, and never had any others of those amounts during the whole time; when I lost them I took every measure to discover the thief; the prisoner lived with me at the time, and was well acquainted with my loss.</p>

            . The prisoner was examined before Mr. Broughton, and what she said was taken down - the signature to this examination is Mr. Broughton's writing. -(read)</p>
               <p>"The prisoner says she found the two notes in the prosecutor's passage; she did not know that they were part of the money he had lost - she did not know the amounts; hearing her mistress say she had lost four notes and some receipts, she did not know these were part of the notes she had lost."</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was sweeping the rooms one morning, and picked them up in the passage, and nine or ten days after I heard mistress and master saying something about missing something in a parcel, I said to myself these papers I found must be some money, and somebody must have dropped it who has come to the house; I kept it nine or ten days, then heard a great noise about four notes being lost out of a parcel; master said at first there were six notes in it, and then four, but there were only two papers in the parcel I found; mistress said she had them in her hand on the Monday before the Friday she lost them, and I had had these a long time before that; I went to Chatham and gave them to a woman to read, she said it was a 5l. and a 10l. and wanted to go out and get them changed - I said I would go myself; I went to a grocer's and bought a few articles, and asked them to change a 5l. note; he said, "Good woman, this is a 50l. note;" I showed him the other, he said it was 40l., and said, "Never mind paying for the things now, take them to the public-house where you lodge, they will take care of them for you." I went and began to tell the publican's wife how I got them - she said, "Never mind, go over to that shop, and you will get change for it - never mind who you are." I went; I did not know it was master's money; I never took the money out of the drawer; mistress said there was 40l. in sovereigns and 40l. in silver, if I took any thing I should take that.</p>
               <p>MR. SILVERTHORNE. The prisoner left me without notice.</p>

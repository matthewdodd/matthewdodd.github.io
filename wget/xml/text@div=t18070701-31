            . Q. On the 31st of May last were you in the road from Hampstead to London. - A. I was, sometime between half past ten and eleven o'clock on Sunday night, I was near the lane leading up to <placeName id="t18070701-31-crimeloc189">Chalk farm</placeName>

I rather think I was going to speak; he said be silent, give me your watch, sir; I took out my watch and gave it him; I think I said to him, it is a metal watch, you had better not take it; he repeated be silent, your money; I took out my money and gave it to him, it was loose in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give him. - A. I gave him two guineas, to the best of my recollection, and one or two shillings I said at the time, the money you are welcome to, but you had better give me my watch, it is a metal watch; he still repeated be silent, and held up his stick. The other man who kept close to me, put his hand upon the outside of my left hand breeches pocket, I told him there was nothing there but trinkets of no value, he had better not take them; I had forgot at the time that I had these ducats in the pocket, but they were packed up with some trinkets; he put his hand into the pocket and took them out.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the value of these ducats. - A. I understand about nine shillings a piece, they are Dutch coin. He then asked me for my pocket book, I told him that I had no pocket book; he repeated his demand, I told him I had none; he then quitted his hold of me, and said be off, sir; accordingly I stepped on two or three steps on the road, they urged me still to go on.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night was it. - A. It was a fine night, but no moon.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there light enough to distinguish; and to see<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180707010033"></xptr> the persons of the men that robbed you. - A. There might have been; if I had not been a good deal agitated, and the transaction took place a very short time, not above a minute or two. I can only speak to the impression it made in my mind.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity during the time this transaction happened, during the flurry you were in, of seeing the features of the men. - A. No, his features appeared to me small, and rather pale-faced.</p>
               <p>Q. What size in bulk. - A. He was not large made.</p>

               <p>Q. On looking at the prisoner, can you say with certainty that he is or is not the man. - A. I cannot say with certainty that he is the man.</p>

            . Q. You are servant to Mr. F. Salkeld, 202, Fleet-street, a pawnbroker - have you any watch with you. - A. Yes. On Monday the 1st of June, about two o'clock, the prisoner pawned it; on the 1st of June he came again, and said he had lost the ticket. From information I had from Bow-street office I had him taken in custody; when the constable came I told him what I had taken him for, that the watch had been stolen; he said he bought the watch; he did not tell me when nor where he bought the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. What name did he pawn the watch in. -

            ; I told the prisoner he must go to the Compter; I went to the door for a coach to take him; the constable and he followed me. While I was opening the coach door the prisoner shot off and run through Temple Bar; the constable run after him and called stop thief; he was stopped and brought back; we took him to the Compter. When the prisoner pledged the watch he had a bricklayer's jacket on; I cannot recollect the colour. When he was taken up he had that coat on.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. You say it was on the 1st of June he came to pledge it. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And on Tuesday week he came, not to redeem the watch, but to tell you he had lost the ticket. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There had been an information given to you that this man had lost his watch. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the poor fellow when you charged him with a felony and took him in custody, he attempted to slide away. - A. He did slide away.</p>

               <p>Q. What time of the day did you see him there. - A. Between eight and nine in the morning; I called in the house and had a pint of beer, I saw the prisoner sit there, and another person was sitting with him; they had got a watch looking at; the other man said to me, I have got a watch to sell, do you want such a thing; no, said I, I do not, I have got one.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that openly said, or in secret. - A. It was said in the tap room. The prisoner said I want such a thing myself, but I do not think I have got money enough to purchase it; the prisoner said how much do you ask for the watch, he said about four guineas, he said he had not got money enough to purchase it now; perhaps he might pledge it and make up the money. I saw him pull out two pounds myself, I saw the watch opened, I had it not in my hand, to the best of my recollection; I saw Cornhill inside of it; that is the watch, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

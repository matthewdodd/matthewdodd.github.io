                  </hi>. I am assistant to Messrs. Muncaster and Warre, pawnbrokers, Skinner-street, Snow-hill—I know the prisoner—I have seen him at the shop—he came into our shop on the afternoon of 23d February—he produced a box containing six dozen pairs of kid gloves, and offered to pledge them for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had no particular idea of the value of them—I asked him whose property they were—he said, they were his own—I asked him in what way he became possessed of them, what he did with gloves—he said he dealt in them—I said, if that was the case, would he be kind enough to show me his card, or a bill-head—he said, he had neither a card or bill-head—I asked him. if he carried on business, dealing in these kind of goods, how it was that he had neither bill-head nor cards; but if he had neither to show me, to give me satisfaction, he could, of course, show me a bill or invoice by which he bought the goods, as where he would buy them they would of course give bills—he said he could do so, but he had not got it with him—I said, I should require him to go and fetch it—he had given</p>

               <p>me his address as in Hosier-lane, near Smithfield—I said, it was not far for him to go and fetch me the bill of the goods—he hesitated about doing so, and said, if I did not like to advance him the money on the goods, I could return them to him—I said, I should decline doing that; but I should require him to fetch that bill which he said he had—seeing that I would not yield to him on any other terms, he assented, and went away to fetch the bill—I kept posses<lb></lb>sion of the gloves—I watched him out—he went in the direction of Hosier-lane—I did not see him go down Hosier-lane—he returned in about half or three-quarters of an hour—it would not have taken him above five minutes to have gone to Hosier-lane—when he returned, he brought me back this invoice, bearing the name of "Dent, Allcroft, and Co.," and headed "Mr. Fraser, Hosier-lane; bought of Dent, Allcroft, and Co."—he said his name was "Fraser, of 9, Hosier-lane"—I asked him if that was the invoice by which he bought the goods—he said, It is"—I said, "Were they paid for?—he said, "They were"—I said, "If they were bought and paid for, this is the receipt of them?"—He said, "Yes"—I said, "How is it that such a firm as Dent and Allcroft give you a receipt for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. without a stamp on it?"—he said it was usual in a transaction down in that department—I said, "Who gave it?—he said, "The party in the French department made out the receipt"—I said, "What was the amount you gave for them?"—he mentioned the price named in the invoice, 39<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per dozen, which at six dozen amounted to something like 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but the bill head having on one corner a cash discount of two and a half, he had made 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. mistake in subtracting that, besides making a mistake in the pence—after talking with him for some time, I left him in the shop and went towards the front door to see for an officer, and while doing so the prisoner made his way out at the side door—I immediately communicated with the police, and gave up the box and gloves to them—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I also produce another box containing one dozen gloves, pledged by the prisoner on the Saturday evening previous, the 19th, for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked him on that occasion whose they were—he said they were his own; that he dealt in them; that his name was William Fraser, of 9, Hosier-lane—on looking through the warehouse, I also discovered another box of gloves pledged in the same name on the 16th, but I did not see him on that occasion.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman,</hi> 203). On the morning of 26th February, in consequence of information I received from a pawnbroker named Walters, in Aldersgate-street, I went there and saw a person of the name of Robson taking out one dozen pair of gloves—the prisoner was not present—I took the prisoner in custody on Saturday, 26th, at Messrs. Dent's warehouse—I told him that we were two detective officers, and he must consider himself in custody for stealing one dozen pair of gloves, the property of Messrs. Allcroft—I told him he had no occasion to answer me any questions without he thought proper—he said, "I decline answering any questions you put to me"—we took him to the station—Gisby searched him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 2, Netting Hill Square, and am warehouse-man in the employ of Dent, Allcroft, and Co.—the prisoner was one of two porters who lodged in the warehouse—his name is William Forty—he has been in the employment about eighteen months altogether—the glove warehouse was quite open to him—he had charge of it during the night—he would leave in the morning when the other porters came—there were two of them there at night, he and another—these gloves (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) have all our mark on them—these are our manufacture, and these are from France, each pair stamped with a mark which is peculiarly our own—they formed part of our stock—I am able to say they have not been sold—if they had been sold there would have been marks upon the box of the prices, and also a mark of the entering-desk, which they have not—that enables me to say that they have not been sold—this is one of our bill-heads—I do not know the handwriting—it is not the writing of any one in our establishment—we have no person named W. Franklin in our French department—it is not such an invoice as would be sent out by us.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman,</hi> 245). I went to Messrs.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">In custody</hi>). I am an owner of organs and live at Brentford—on the 27th December, about 10 p.m., I was in my house—I had Taken my boots off and was going to bed—I had seen Christof that evening About 8 o'clock—he came to my house about 10 o'clock and said "I want To kill you all," so I went out and said "I never had any quarrel with you and I don't want to have a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> to-night; you go to bed and I will go to bed"—he then struck me with some instrument which went into my bones and knocked me down—I became insensible—when I became sensible Christof came a second time with a piece of timber in his hand and broke all my windows both down and upstairs—part of a window went on the bed where my child was—it cried and has since died—I was taken to the station and the prisoner said he was stabbed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am 15 years of age—I live at Old Brentford in the same house as Guanneri—on 27th December Christof came to our house about 10 p.m.—Joe Guanneri spoke to him at the corner of the house in a language I do not understand, when he caought Joe round the neck and threw him against a cart, then the threw him on the ground and began punching him—Joe's wife came out, threw Christof off and took Joe indoors—Joe's eye and nose were bleeding—a third man was there—he did nothing—I did not see any nstrument of any kind in either of their hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was no light, and if Guanneri had a knife in his hand I could not have seen it—the yard is where they keep carts—it is all gravel, but that is hard.</p>

                  </hi>. I saw Guanneri on the same night I saw Christof—he was suffering from a small punctured wound beneath the right eye, leading to a great deal of haemorrihage from the nose, and the bones of the nose were injured—the wound may have been caused by some sharp instrument, or by the man falling upon something sharp in the road.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The bones of the nose were fractured—that is more consistent with falling on something hard than being struck with a knife, but it is consistent with a man's fist coming in contact with it—it is quite possible that the two injuries may have been caused by a fall.</p>

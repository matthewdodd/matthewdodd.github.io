                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Parslow, of Upper King-street, Bloornabury. The prisoner came into the shop, and took three waistcoats off a brass bar which runs across the window—I distinctly saw him take then—he turned out of the shop—I followed and gave the alarm—I saw several</p>

I went to the prisoner's lodging, in Hopkins-street, and told her I had lost my money - I neither threatened or promised her: she immediately said she had robbed me, between nine and ten o'clock that night; and if I would let her go she would find the money, for her husband had all but 3s., which were found on her. She said next morning all that she had taken was 1l. 10s. 6d.</p>

               <p>THEODOSIA O'KEEFE. I keep this house. On the 4th of June, after eight o'clock at night, I was laying down in the back room first floor, very ill - somebody asked for a light, and about nine o'clock I saw the prisoner sitting on the stairs; I asked if she was the person who had asked for a light - she said Yes, that she wanted to go into Connolly's room, for she was sent to finish some work; I asked if she was sent to do it when they were out - she said that was no business of mine; I asked how she could get in - she showed me a key, which I knew was not the right one- she asked if I could lend her one - I refused. We went up-stairs; I tried the key, but it was too small - she said Mrs. Connolly gave it her; she sat down on the stairs, and was there till past ten o'clock.</p>

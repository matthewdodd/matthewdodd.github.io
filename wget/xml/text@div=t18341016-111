On Wednesday, the 1st of October, the prisoner came about a quarter before twelve o'clock, to pawn a pair of spectacles - I received them from him, and went to the back part of the shop - and, on returning, I saw him tuck his hat between his knees, and then put it on his head - I said to him, "You have nailed a waistcoat," as some hung by his side - I took his hat off, and found the waistcoat in it - I turned round to a boy, and told him to call Mr. Stafford, and he ran away - I gave information to Tyrrell, and saw him next day at Worship-street, and knew him - he was in the habit of pawning at our shop.</p>

I went to the shop to pawn a pair of spectacles - during the time I was there, another person came in, behind me, and touched me - I turned round, and went to another part of the shop - I saw a waistcoat lying down at my feet, and, in stooping down, I had not exactly room to stoop, my hat came off - I picked my hat up, and had my hat and the waistcoat in my hand together - the witness said, "You have nailed a waistcoat" - I said, "I have not" - he took it out of my hand, not out of my hat - he said, "I shall send for Mr. Stafford" - I said, "I shall not stop for Mr. Stafford," knowing myself innocent, and I walked out of the shop - I did not run out - I heard no more of it till next morning, when the officer came - if I had intended to steal it, I had plenty of time to escape.</p>

I saw the prisoner on the 4th of July, at the post opposite my door, about twenty minutes past nine o'clock in the evening; I did not see him do anything, but a neighbour pointed him out to me - I went up to him, and took hold of his coller, and said "You know the boys who have been taking the snuff-boxes;" I had been to my window and missed three boxes, and one cigar-tube - the prisoner said "They have run down Union-street;" he said he knew the name of one of them was Michael - he pulled away from me, and then Mr. Dunn took hold of him, and I turned away- I made my complaint at High-street, and have seen some of my boxes since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was there any mark on the boxes? A. Yes; I had marked them myself - I can swear to them.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Mary-le-bone. I got a box from the watch-house-keeper - the proseuctor claimed it; the prisoner was present, but I do not think he saw the watch-house-keeper produce it - at half-past two o'clock in the morning I found another box in Union-street; there was nothing found on the prisoner in my presence - the watch-house-keeper is not here.</p>

            . I am a shoe-maker, and live opposite the prosecutrix. I saw the prisoner standing by her shop with two snuff-boxes in his hand; I saw Mrs. Ashdown sake hold of him - he got from her, and I stopped him in Union-street, between Nos. 37 and 38; he threw down two snuff-boxes, and I took up one - Mrs. Ashdown saw it, and owned it; I gave it to the watch-house-keeper.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You said at the office, you did not know whether I dropped it or not? A. No; I said I saw him throw down two boxes, and I took one up.</p>
               <p>COURT to MRS. ASHDOWN. Q. Is the box now produced, one of those you lost? A. Yes; it is the one that was found by the watchman the next morning - this is not the one Mr. Dunn took up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. They said they found two boxes, but they have brought but one; I came out of the country on the 4th of July, to get a situation - I met my consin, and stood talking with him; the prosecutrix came up and laid hold of me, and said she was informed I had been stealing some boxes - I said I had not, but I had seen some boys near her window, and they had run down Union-street.</p>

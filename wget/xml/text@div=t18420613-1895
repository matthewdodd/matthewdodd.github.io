                  </hi>. I am porter to Mr. Evans, in Pall-mall. I was employed to remove the prosecutor's books from the London Hospital to my master's premises—the prosecutor unlocked the bookcase, and pointed out these books to me—there were several bundles tied up, before I got there—I put them in bags, and the bags into the cart, and took them to Mr. Evans—it was stated ion the newspaper after that one of these bags was stolen from the cart, but I am positive it was not from the time they were put into the cart, till I got to the end of Aldgate, as I walked on one side, or behind the cart, and from there, to the best of my recollection, I got into the cart—I should think there was no opportunity for any one to steal them while I was in the library, unless they were stolen after I bagged them, and went out to get some refreshment—to the best of my belief there were none untied from the time I went out—I deposited the books in my master's premises, locked the door, and gave the key to Mr. Evans.</p>

               <p>I sorted the whole of the books, which were brought by Gorman—there were a great many valuable works—after that was done, I prepared a catalogue, and sent it to the prosecutor—I know Ritson's Scotch Poems very well—the two volumes would produce 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in a sale—the Byron, in the condition this is, would be worth about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it is six volumes, bound in green morocco; and Butler would be worth about 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

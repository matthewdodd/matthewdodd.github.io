               <p>Cheveny . On the 29th of January, I had been at a Club, at The Black Hog in St. Martin's-Lane, and as I was coming home about Ten o'Clock at Night, I met the Prisoner at the Bottom of King-Street, Westminster; she took hold of me, and said, - Master, will you treat? I told her, I could not afford it. Well, says she, if you'll treat this Time, I'll treat next. Upon these Conditions, I said, I did not care if I did. Then she bid me come along with her. So she carry'd me to the House of one Stark, in <placeName id="t17390221-15-crimeloc86">King street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17390221-15-crimeloc86" type="placeName" value="King street"></interp>

She told me she would not part with me so, and followed me out to the Door; we stood talking together about a Quarter of an Hour, and in that Time she picked my Pocket, and then ran in Doors, and shut the Door upon me. I told her she had got my Watch, and called to have the Door opened, but it was not opened. Then I called the Watch, and they made them open the Door. There were other Women in the House, beside the Prisoner, so the Watchmen asked me, which of these Women had robbed me? I told them I did not see her, I believed she was got off, and the Watchmen said, they could not search the House without a Warrant; but the Man of the House telling us we might search, tho' we had no Warrant, we did search, and found the Prisoner hid in a Closet; so she was carry'd to the Round house for that Night, and next Morning we had her before Mr. Frazier. Before him, she said she knew nothing of the Watch, but it was produced at the same Time, by the Prisoner's Husband, and then she told the Justice she had found it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him whether he felt me take it?</p>
               <p>Cheveny. No; I did not; but there was no one at the Door, or in the Entry with me, but the Prisoner.</p>

            . The Prosecutor came to my House, and desired me to take his Watch in Pawn 'till next Morning. I refused to take his Watch, but told him I would let him have a Shilling or two 'till the next Morning. D - mn it, says he, if you won't take it in Pawn, I'll go out of the House. I believe the Prisoner and he might have a Pot of Beer together, and then they went out together, for about five Minutes: After which the Prisoner ran into the House again; he followed her and said - G - d d - mn the Bitch, she has picked my Pocket, and he called the Watchmen, who took the Prisoner, but but they found no Watch upon her. However, in about half an Hour after she was confined, her Husband came and said, I have the Watch, - take it and carry it down to her. I would have nothing to do with it, so I bid him carry it down and deliver it himself, so he took the Watch from between the Window and the Window-shutter. When she was before the Justice the next Morning, she said she knew nothing of the Matter, but she desired me to go and speak to her Husband about it; and I went up accordingly into her Room, and there the Watch was found between the Bed and the Sacking, and it was carried to Justice Frazier. She lodged in Cabbage-Lane, Westminster.</p>
               <p>The Constable. This is the Watch that was brought to Mr. Frazier.</p>
               <p>Stark. I can't swear to it, nor do I remember what she said before the Justice, when the Watch was brought.</p>
               <p>Constable. This is the same Watch which was deliver'd to me before the Justice. Stark brought it in, and the Prosecutor swore to it.</p>
               <p>Cheveny. This is my Watch.</p>
               <p>Stark. I can't swear to it; but I deliver'd the same Watch which I found in her Lodging to Mr. Frazier.</p>
               <p>Constable. And Mr. Frazier deliver'd it to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never saw the Watch to my Knowledge. I was going home, and this Man came up to me, and clapp'd Two-pence Halfpenny into my Hand, to go and drink with him. I did not care to drink with a Stranger any where, so I went to this Mr. Stark's, because I was afraid of him, but I never drank of the Beer, nor did I sit by him. <rs id="t17390221-15-verdict87" type="verdictDescription">

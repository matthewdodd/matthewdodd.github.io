                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Chester. On 29th Sept. I had an eating-house in Woolwich—the prisoner was lodging in the house—I had these two watches at the bottom of a large box in my bed-room—they were in this small box which was broken open—this is one of them—I missed them on the 18th Oct.—I removed from that house—I spoke to the prisoner and said I had missed them, and all I had to depend upon with my children and my sick husband was my two watches, to sell to open another shop at Greenwich—he said, "Never mind, your luck' will all turn at once"—he wanted breakfast that morning—I would not let him have it—he had not above 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. when he came to my house, nine days before—he owed me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I went out, and when 1 came back he pulled 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of his pocket—he said he had been to his barracks and sold his boots; and he bought himself tome civilian clothing that afternoon, and disguised himself—he was taken to the barracks with those clothes on—there was no other soldier in my house but him—he went in my bed-room to get these.</p>

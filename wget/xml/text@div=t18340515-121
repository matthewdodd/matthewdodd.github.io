               <p>Prisoner. Q. I wish you to state positively whether I was standing at the window, or whether you saw me passing the window, and stopping as I passed? A. No; you were standing at the window - I did not see you break the glass, but heard it break, and saw you draw your hand out - the house is two houses from the entrance of the street - I was within two doors of the shop in the street, and pursued you - you went into the middle of the street.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was there any other person so close to it at the time? A. No; I am certain I saw him draw his hand from the broken pane, and the watch was in his possession when I took him.</p>

On Saturday, the 26th of April, I was in my shop about a quarter past eight o'clock - I heard a tremendous crash of the window, and saw the watches falling from the hooks - it was not plate glass - I immediately rose from my seat, ran into the street, and called "Stop thief" - I followed the people whom I saw running round into Church-street - I there saw a crowd collected, and found the prisoner in the custody of Whiteley - I am the sole occupier of the house - it is my dwelling-house - when I got up to the prisoner, I saw him throw the watch away - it fell into the area of No. 30 or 31 - I did not pick it up - I knocked at the door, and it was brought up to me by the landlord - I went down with the landlord to look in the area, but I did not see it lying there myself - he produced the watch, which is mine - the lowest real value of it is about 4l. 10s. - there was a ticket attached to it of my own writing - I had hung it in the window in the morning - it could be reached from the broken window - the hole was sufficient to admit the arm of a man.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I beg to trespass on the Court while I relate the cause which excited me to the act which placed me in the disgraceful situation in which I now stand; an act which is as opposed from my natural principle, as night is from day - at the time it occurred I was under extreme embarrassment, and most afflicting oppression - my wife was on the point of her accouchement, and I was without the means of providing her with the common necessaries - I had, my Lord, endeavoured to exert myself to the utmost of my power, to alleviate her painful situation, without effect - I have sought assistance from those who I have received great kindness from, but which has been withheld from me, on account of it being considered we had a right of claim on an individual, who would not assist us; on the day named in the indictment I had undergone extremely fatiguing exertions, and met with aggravating disappointments - in the extreme distress on my mind, I accidentally met a person who kindly prevailed on me to take a glass of a rum with him, which he thought would cheer my spirits - not having broken my fast during the day, and being never accustomed to spirits, it overcame me in a manner; I scarcely knew what I was doing, and while on my way home I was passing the prosecutor's house, and having the thoughts of home across my mind, I, without the least thought or premeditation, committed the act which places me before your Lordship an unfortunate being - I have entirely provided for myself from the age of thirteen, under the greatest disadvantages, from family troubles and afflictions - I leave my friends to say the rest.</p>

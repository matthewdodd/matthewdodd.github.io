                  </hi> I live in Baldwin-street, St. Luke's, and am a carpenter. On the 2nd Dec. I was at the bar of a public-house—Salter and a man were there—I treated them to some gin, and they invited me to their home—they were quite strangers to me, but I went with them—I had had something to drink—I found Barnett in bed in the bed-room to which Salter aud the man took me—after they gave me something to drink, I asked them if they could find me a convenient room to sleep in—they said they could, and told me to go to a room up stairs—I took a light and went up stairs to the top room—I went to bed there—I put my watch, chain, and keys, under the pillow under my head—when I had been in bed a short time Salter came into the room and pretended to be sick, but whether she was or not I cannot tell—she came to the side of the bed, and was standing there—she went away in about five minutes, and when she was gone I felt for my watch and could not find it—I put on my clothes and came down—I found Mrs. Barnett in bed, and the man and Salter were gone away—I went into Goswell-street—I found two policemen, and Salter was taken and discharged—I had left a truss behind me in the house.</p>

I took Salter into custody, and she was discharged the next day—I saw her on a subsequent day, and told her she had got the watch—she said she had not—I said, "I think you have got the watch you robbed that man of?"—she said, "I have got the keys, and likewise the chain, but not the watch"—I said, "You go along with me to the station," and then she gave me the watch-chain and key—she said Barnett gave it her for her child to play with—when I took Barnett she said it had been left in her house nine months ago by a man who owed 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and that she gave it to Salter for her child to play with—she thought it was of no use—the prosecutor described the watch—there were two keys and a steel chain to it, and a small glass in the centre of it—I found a truss in Barnett's house between two beds, and this handkerchief, which is the prosecutor's.</p>

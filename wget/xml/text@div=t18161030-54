On the Sunday morning, I was there when he came home; I was down in the cellar. When he came in, his wife and the prisoner were at home at the place. On Sunday night, the 14th of September, he went to an Irishman's wake; he was an Irishman. He staid there until about three or four o'clock in the morning; he was in liquor when he returned. I did not go home with him. He went out the next morning at about seven or eight o'clock; I was there. Then he went out with a man who invited him to drink. He came back about eleven o'clock in liquor; his wife was selling a pair of shoes at the door; the man said one was larger than the other; her son, the prisoner, was then down in the cellar. Upon these words, the deceased man was coming into the kitchen, and he said, he knew very well what business was going on. He and his wife had some words about the money; it is supposed that it was the prisoner's wages he wanted. I supposed they were speaking to the money that was due to the prisoner. The prisoner's mother told the deceased, that he always wanted the handling of her sons wages. Then they had some words about it, and she went up stairs, and the deceased man followed her up stairs, as if in anger; he had nothing in his hand. I went after him, and brought him back again. The deceased man then said that he had a great mind to give it to the prisoner. The young man tried to defend myself, and then they both grappled together, and I could not tell which caught hold first. A little time after, in the bustle, the young man fell down against the wall. Then the deceased man went up stairs again to his wife. Then the young man came up. I should have said that the knife dropped from the prisoner's hand; he picked it up, and followed him. The knife had fallen on to the working board. He followed him up stairs, and said, he would stick him through if he touched his mother. The deceased had not said any thing about that before he went up. I remained in the cellar. A little time after that. I heard the deceased man cry out for to take the knife. This was a very short time after the prisoner left the cellar. Then he came down in a very short time with his hand covered with blood. I asked him if he had stuck Manaix he made a kind of a groan, and his mother came down. Then the prisoner's mother bid me go for a doctor; and I went to the top of the cellar stairs, and saw the deceased man carrying down towards St. Giles's. I went in the next morning to the Hospital to see him.</p>

            . On the Sunday morning, at about eleven o'clock, I heard a bustle, and I opened the middle door from the shop. When I went up stairs, I found the deceased's wife standing there. I asked her what was the matter, and she said, she ran there for fear of her husband's beating her. The moment I spoke to her, up came Mannix; he spoke to her very pleasently, and I advised her to come down. At that moment that I was speaking, the prisoner came up with a knife in his hand; he made a rush at the deceased, and presently there was a cry, and the blood begun to run about, and the cries alarmed the people. At any time I did not see any blows pass from any one. I must have seen it if such a thing took place. There was no blows whilst I was on the stair case. I tried to get the knife from the prisoner, and I could not, but at last by persuasion he threw it over the balusters.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and attend the Middlesex Hospital. I remember a person of the name of Manaix being brought there on Sunday, the 15th of September. There were two wounds on the fore part of the arm. I did what was necessary for his safety; one wound was about two inches; it had wounded the main artery of the arm. There were two wounds. The other was comparatively slight; he lived exactly a month. The larger wound was certainly the primary cause of his death; mortification ensued; but the man was labouring under a constitutional disease of the lungs at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ascribe his death to the wound or to the disease - A. That is rather a difficult question to answer. He had that disease previous to the wound, and there was a great deal of inflamation on the lungs after the death. If the wound had not been given, I should have ascribed his death to the lungs; but the wound having mortified, he had two causes of death. There was a bleeding at the arm at the time he died, which most probably proceeded from the aggravation of his coughing. I think his death was hastened by the inflamation of the lungs; probably that occasioned the mortification.</p>

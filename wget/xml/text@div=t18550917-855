In June, 1854, I attended at No. 11, Waterloo-place for the purpose of making an advance of money—Mr. Kirby acted as my agent in the matter—I believe he is a conveyancer—on that occasion I saw Mr. Coape and Mr. King at Mr. Kirby's office—No. 11, Waterloo-place is Mr. Kirby's office, it is the office of the Albert Assurance Company—on that occasion Coape and King executed a deed—after the execution of certain deeds, I paid over 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Mr. King by direction of Mr. Coape—there was conversation, but no fact strikes me par<lb></lb>ticularly—Mr. King was talking, Mr. Coape was talking, but nothing that I am aware of that bears upon this question—I paid over the money upon Mr. Kirby's advice, ho acted entirely—I was relying entirely upon Mr.</p>

               <p>Kirby being satisfied in the transaction—there was conversation between Mr. Coape, Mr. King, and Mr. Kirby—I was induced to pay over this money to Mr. King by the direction of Mr. Coape, from statements made to me through Mr. Kirby of Mr. Coape's property.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Kirby, his office is at the Albert Insur<lb></lb>ance Office, Waterloo-place. He is a conveyancer—I am the subscribing witness to this deed—the parties to it are James Ewesby King of the first part, Henry Coe Coape of the second part, Henry Porter Smith of the third part, and George Goldsmith Kirby of the fourth part—it is dated 3rd June, 1854—(<hi rend="italic">The deed was put in and read in part; it recited the will of Henry Coape, Esq., the father of the defendant, by which it appeared that certain lands therein named were bequeathed to the defendant with other property, which lands were assigned to Mr. Smith, as security for the advance in question</hi>).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What part, if any, of that deed was read to the parties before it was executed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To the best of my recollection, I read nearly the whole of it, if not quite—I do not remember reading the part describing the parcels of property intended to be conveyed, as distinct from any other, but to the best of my belief I did read it; I am nearly certain that I did so—I made a memorandum on the draft of having read and explained the deed, and those parts that I did not read at length, I explained—I have got the draft with me (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I went through the deed, and either read every clause, or explained the clause as I came to it; for instance, the probability is that I stated at first that it recited the father's will—I think it must have been in that way, without reading through the whole of the will-besides Mr. Coape, Mr. King, Mr. Kirby, Mr. Rogers the solicitor, was present on that occasion—he was solicitor for Mr. Coape—he represented Mr. Coape—I think nobody else was present at the reading of the deed—Mr. Smith and Sir John Wilson came in before the completion—Mr. Rogers was present as solicitor for the two parties, Mr. King and Mr.</p>

               <p>Coape—I do not think any body else was present—Mr. Smith and Sir John Wilson were in the room at the time of completing it, but I think not during the reading of the deed; it occupied, I should think, nearly two hours altogether—a warrant of attorney was also executed at the same time—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was executed by Mr. Coape and Mr. King—Mr. Rogers acted as the solicitor for Mr. Coape, in the execution of that warrant of attorney—there was also a statutory declaration made by Mr. Coape—the filling in of the amount of rents is in my writing, and the residence of Mr. Coape at the commencement—the other parts of the writing, I think, was done by the stationer's clerk—I did not fill in the names—in the sentence, "And I further declare that each of the heredita<lb></lb>ments are of the annual value of 1,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>", the words 1,300 are in my writing, and also the 1,700 as the annual value of the life estates—I drew the declaration, leaving the sums blank, for the purpose of obtaining them—I cannot say whether I handed it to Mr. Rogers to get the information, or whether I obtained it from Mr. Coape direct—it was either from Mr. Rogers or Mr. Coape—I obtained the information in the room during that two hours' interview, at the time of completion—it was declared at the time—the declaration was handed by me to the parties to read over and give the information, and no doubt it was read over.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185509170014"></xptr>
               <p>King required the money—I do not know that it was said he had debts of honour—Mr. Rogers, I believe, supplied Mr. Kirby with the chief part of the information for the bond—when Mr. Kirby required information, he wrote to Mr. Rogers for it—I went down to Maldon, in Essex, in May—I went to make inquiry upon the subject of the allegations contained in the deed—I went with the agent of the Albert Insurance-office, just to check the statement of the parties—the negotiation for this loan had begun in February.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The names of all the farms had been given to you, and you were directed, were you not, to go down into Essex to make inquiry upon the subject? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it was not precisely so—a copy of the will was obtained by us, and I was directed to go to the agent of the Assurance Company, and ask him if his knowledge permitted him to say that Mr. Coape had property to that extent—I went to make inquiries—it was not my duty to make fall inquiries upon the subject—it was my duty to ask the agent of the Company to whom I was directed, whether he knew Mr. Coape, and whether he was known to be a person of property in that neighbourhood—I was not sent to ascertain the value of these securities, it was to ascertain whether it was known that Mr. Coape was a gentleman of property there—whether it was a fiction or not whether he really had property there—I should say that Mr. Coape did not know that the inquiries were made, till afterwards; he knew, at the time he signed the deed, that I had made the inquiry—Mr. Smith had been a client of Mr. Kirby for some years—I can scarcely say for what purpose he was employed by Mr. Smith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you the least doubt in the world that it was your duty to make inquiries on the subject of the property, and that you grossly neglected your duty? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I did what I was directed to do, and no more and no less—all my instructions were to go to the agent of the Assurance Company—Mr. Kirby directed me merely to go to the agent of the Assurance Com<lb></lb>pany, and I performed the duty imposed upon me—I was not directed to go round to the farms—they were not in the immediate orbit—I was informed that they lay in various directions, and that certain parts of the river or sea would prevent my getting at them—I do not know how much Mr. Kirby got for his advice and assistance to Mr. Smith in this matter—I have heard, of course—I believe it was 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not receive the money, but I have heard in the office that it was 200 guineas in each case—that would be 400 guineas—I do not know whether Mr. Rogers got the same—I do not know what he got—various inquiries were made at the Tithe Commutation Office, and a copy of the will was bespoke at Doctors' Com<lb></lb>mons, and the stamps,' I think, you will find amount to 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Kirby paid for the stamps—we made all the inquiries that we thought necessary.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When was it you went down to Maldon? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On 11th May, 1854—I do not know whether that was at a period of the trans<lb></lb>action when a gentleman named Gregory was making an application, or after that had ceased—the Albert Office have an agent at Maldon—I went down, and took an extract of the will with me—I went to make inquiry whether there was such a person as Mr. Coape there, and whether he was reputed to be a person of property—I found that to be so—this was not a transaction by the Insurance Company.</p>

               <p>had expressed myself satisfied with the security proposed—this was given in answer, as it were, to some inquiries about it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at several letters</hi>) this letter, beginning "My dear Coape", I understand to be Mr. Teesdale's writing—he is a solicitor—the others are Mr. King's writing—all of these letters reached me through Mr. Rogers—there seems to be one here from Mr. King to myself—that I received from Mr. King, the others I received from Mr. Rogers—I was present when this matter was completed and the money paid—it was on 3rd June, last year—I do not think I can tell what parts of the deed were read before it was executed—I was in and out of the room while the matter was being settled, but I was there when it was actually completed, the deed signed, and the money paid—I do not think I was present when the blanks in the statutory declaration were filled up, because I remember being asked a question about the amount filled in, and as to the rents of the leasehold property, afterwards—my clerk came to me, and said that the sum had been put in—that was before the business was over, before the cheques were signed, or the money paid—my clerk came to me when I went into the room, and said the amount of rents Mr. Coape had put in was 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the leasehold property, instead of 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as had been represented, and Mr. Coape came up to me, and said, "Yes, it was a larger amount, 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before; but I sold some of the leases, and the mortgage debt was reduced by the payment of the purchase money, to 2,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>".; not reduced to the extent of 2,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but reduced down to 2,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Coape personalty gave me that explanation of his leasehold property; that is the Pamlico pro<lb></lb>perty—he gave me no explanation whatever with respect to the freehold property—he made one observation as to his freehold property, that there was much more of it than I had been able to find out—that was said at the same time, at the time of the meeting—he said that his property was larger than I had been able to find out, larger than I had been able to discover—I had not made out satisfactorily the whole 1,100 acres at one time—I think I made some observation of that kind to him, and he said there was a good deal more than I had been able to find out—I had sent my clerk down into the neighbourhood of Maldon to make inquiries as to the acreage of the property generally, and the value of the rents—I furnished him with the extract from Mr. Coape's father's will for that purpose—I suggested that he should apply to Mr. Bridges, of Maldon, to whom he told me he went—Mr. Bridges happened to be one of the agents of the Albert Life Office—we made a great number of searches at the Tithe Commutation Office to ascer<lb></lb>tain the parcels, and extent of the property of Mr. Coape, and we found Bridgemarsh, and Plumes, and Westwicks mentioned, or rather the parishes in which they were stated to be in, and the number of acres—I did not find there were such names, but the acreage Mr. King gave agreed with the acreage we found at the Tithe Commutation Office in those parishes—the acreage would not appear in the Tithe Commutation Office, whether the property was sold or not—they were under Mr. Coape's name—I did not make any such inquiry as would have enabled me to ascertain whether any part of this land had been sold—it never occurred to us that the property could have been sold.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185509170017"></xptr>
               <p>the business of a conveyancer is to investigate titles, and to prepare deeds—I think it is a conveyancer's business to send clerks into the country to make inquiry.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you knew that Mr. Teesdale was the pri<lb></lb>vate solicitor of Mr. Coape? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I believe Messrs Teesdale's to be a highly respectable firm.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you make any inquiry of them before you advised your clients to advance 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the morning of the settlement I sent to ascertain whether the letter that had been produced to me was written by them—I did not make any inquiry of them respecting the title to the property upon which I was advising my clients to advance the 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was restricted from that—I made no inquiry except whether the letter was in the hand<lb></lb>writing of Mr. Teesdale—in loan cases there are generally great objections to being allowed to make inquiries of the tenants or on the premises; it is a common thing to have that restriction imposed—that was the reason I did not make inquiry of Mr. Teesdale—I think if I had gone down to Maldon myself, I might have made some inquiry of the tenants, but my clerk thought he had got sufficient information—he told me he had gone to two persons, one of whom he was referred to by the person of whom I had directed him to make inquiry; they, professed to know the property, to be aware of the acreage and the rental of the property at Maldon, and I was satisfied—they were apparently disinterested parties—hearing that there is a mortgage upon a portion of property, would certainly make one desirous of knowing to what extent it was entangled, and I wrote a letter to Mr. Rogers stating that I could not dispense with inquiry of the first mortgagee—I did not do so, but in lieu of permitting me to make that inquiry, Mr. Rogers furnished me with the letter written by Mr. Teesdale to Mr. Coape, for the purpose of showing that there were no other incumbrances than those that he stated, namely 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not make inquiries of the first mortgagee; they brought me that letter to prevent my doing so—that did prevent me—they stated that those inquiries could not be made without Mr. Teesdale being made acquainted with the transaction—of course I now wish that I had made inquiry of the teuants of these farms, if I had, I have no doubt I should have learnt the full particulars.</p>

I rather think—Mr. Rogers introduces persons wanting money—he applies to me to borrow money on behalf of persons by whom he is employed—there is very rarely a bill of costs in annuity transactions—I did not tell Mr. Smith or Sir John Wilson that I had got 400 guineas; I have not been asked—it has not yet occurred to me to return it—the statutory declaration was not for the purpose of catching them by the criminal law, in the event of matters turning out wrong—the great object was to test the accuracy of their statements—that was the only value of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And to force a settlement from their relations by a threat of criminal proceedings? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never did so yet—I never proposed to anybody that the matter could be settled by this gentleman's relations paying the money—it has been talked of by two or three persons to me—several persons have asked me whether it would be settled—Mr. Semple asked me—he is one of the parties who lent Mr. Coape money before—I do not think Mr. Semple had taken a declaration, he did not tell me so—I do not think that Mr. Smith has spoken about it—Mr. Smith and I have not talked over this matter with a view to a settlement—I have never received any instructions at all from Mr. Smith—I have said to Mr. Smith that I should be very glad if it was settled—that was not a suggestion, I do not know what it was—I should have been very glad to get rid of the business—I do not know any other way of getting rid of it than by repurchasing the annuities—the annuities are repurchasable—that would have got the money back—I should have been pleased to have got rid of the thing—I have no interest, except in taking care of Mr. Smith—I have not said to Mr. Smith, "Why, Coape arranged with Semple, and we shall get the money too"—I do not think I have said anything to that effect—I will swear I have not said it—I think I have not said anything to that effect—I told Mr. Smith, of course, of Mr. Semple having had his money, and I hoped they would get him his, or something of that sort; that they would repay him; that they would repurchase the annuity—that must have been after the indictment, because the indictment went on directly it was known—I should have allowed the annuities to be repurchased after the indictment was found, if it could have been done with propriety, safely—the same sort of thing has not gone on between me and Sir John Wilson—I have not seen much of Sir John, he has been away mostly—I was acting both for him and Mr. Smith in this transaction—it was in respect of both the transactions that the costs were</p>

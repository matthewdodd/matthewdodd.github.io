             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a manufacturer at Glasgow, in Scotland.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in the London coffee house of the evening of the 30th of September last? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Hudson and Mr. Pigot there? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time did you first observe them in the coffee house? - I suppose about seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the first thing that attracted your thoughts, respecting the prisoner? - When they came into the room Mr. Hudson called for a news-paper, and sat down in a box in the open coffee room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there many people in the coffee room, or was it empty, or how? - There were a good many in then, but there were more came in afterwards, the coffee room was not so full then as it was afterwards. Mr. Hudson he began reading the defeat of the Dutch troops in the paper; the first thing that attracted my notice, was that he wished the Duke of York and his army was either sent home, or sent to the Devil, he did not care which; there were a good deal of things spoke respecting several characters afterwards; I believe this conversation was between the prisoner and Mr. Pigot.</p>
               <p>Q. How far off was you from the prisoner? - I was in the next box, sitting in a chair at the end of the next box.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of this conversation was the King mentioned at all? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. By whom? - By Mr. Hudson.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as to tell us what part of any thing was mentioned by Mr. Hudson? - He said, 'The King, what was he, George Guelph, a German Hogbutcher, a dealer of human flesh by the carcase, and sold his Hanoverian subjects to his British subjects for thirty pounds a piece.'</p>
               <p>Q. Will you utter the words just as he uttered them? - I think it was, 'The King, what is he, 
               <persName id="t17931204-54-person613">
                  George

            , a German Hog-butcher, a dealer in human flesh by the carcase, he sells his Hanoverian subjects to his British subjects for thirty pounds a piece, and that he was not satisfied with that, that he was partner with the Prince of Hesse Cassel.</p>
               <p>Q. Speak the words in the manner he related them? - And not content with that he goes partner with the Prince of Hesse Cassel, and has fifteen pounds a head for each of his carcases.</p>
               <p>Q. In what tone of voice was this said? - It was in a sharp tone of voice, and rather felt noisy by the gentlemen that were sitting along with him; it was louder than the common conversation.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know in point of fact whether it was heard by those persons in the neighbouring boxes? - It was heard very plain by the gentlemen that sat with him, and several others.</p>
               <p>Q. After he had made use of these expressions what followed then? - There was some conversation took place between Mr. Pigot and him, Mr. Hudson took up the paper, and read of the King's going a hunting, and seemed to reflect much on his Majesty's doing so, at the time that his country was in such calamitous war.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any toast given by any body? - In the time of conversation they had drank two glasses of punch each, they called for a three penny glass, and hurried it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179312040140"></xptr>Q. Were they tumblers or small glasses? - Large glasses such as they charge sixpence a piece for; as soon as they had got them Mr. Hudson drank aloud, The French Republic or Constitution! I cannot say which exactly, and Mr. Pigot said, I will join you in that with all my heart, on the doing that, the gentlemen in the room got up on their feet, except them two men, he and Pigot, and The King! The King! was called from all quarters of the coffee room, to my knowledge it was; when that was the case Mr. Hudson got up his glass and in a very loud voice called out The French Republic, and may it triumph over all the governments in Europe!</p>
               <p>Q. In what tone of voice did he call out that? - In a very loud tone of voice, much sharper than he had said any thing before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You said it was about seven o'clock in the evening when I came into the coffee room? - I have said so.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you think I was in the coffee room from first to last? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you think? - He kept the room for I suppose half an hour after the business might have all been over.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not an answer; How long do you think I was in the coffee room? - I suppose you might be two hours, I took no particular notice of the clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I address myself to you in any part of that two hours or not? - As an individual you never addressed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I address myself to the company at large? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You swear that positive? - I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray how was that manner of address made? - You said, when the gentleman got up and drank the King, you got up and said, what are we all?</p>
               <p>Q. How did I address myself to the whole room? - You asked them what were they all? - That was immediately after you had drank the toast.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you think I might have been in the coffee room before I addressed the company with that question? - I don't know, perhaps an hour or an hour and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it was an hour? - I don't think it was quite so much.</p>
               <p>Q. What had past before I had asked that question? - The drinking of the toast.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray in consequence of what was it that I made that address? - When they drank the King.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, Mr. Buchanan, did you see any body attempt to interrupt me previous to this address? Mind I ask you positively to speak to that question, because that you must know? - Yes, I think Mr. Newman did.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positive that Mr. Newman did? - I think so.</p>
               <p>Q. You seem to be extremely positive in some other things why not in this? did you or did you not see some person interrupt me? - Yes, they drank the King.</p>
               <p>Q. That did not interrupt me? - It was done to that effect.</p>
               <p>Q. Was nothing else done? - I see Mr. Newman interrupt you.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this before or after I addressed the company? - It was before.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, Pray what was the manner of that interruption? - He told you you was a bad man or you would not have been guilty of giving that toast. I don't know whether he did not call you a rascal.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, sir, did not you hear him call me a rascal, if you can recollect one part of the conversation, so much against me you surely can recollect the other, or else your's must be a very accommodating<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179312040141"></xptr>memory? Did not you hear him call me a rascal? - It was thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it words to that effect? - I think it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they opprobrious terms? - There were words on both sides</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you positively whether he did or did not call me a rascal? - He did to that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you have supposed that any other man was called a rascal? - I know the words he said to you was calling you a rascal.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he do any thing else? - When you called him a rascal he seemed to have an inclination of striking you on the head with his came.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Mr. Newman call me a rascal? What did he call me? - I told you he called you something to that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Newman do any thing to me than call me opprobrious names? To cut the matter short, did not you see him put his fist to my face? - He did put it very near to you.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had applied to you in that way would you have supposed that he meant to strike you? - I had not given him a provocation to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Would not you have supposed he was going to strike you? - Mr. Newman and you both were in a passion, and you called out to the whole room that he was an aristocrat and a rascal.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you see him put his fist in my face before I addressed the company? - He seemed inclined to strike you over the head.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not all this previous to my having addressed myself to him or the company? - It was in consequence of getting up and drinking The French Republic and may it triumph over all the governments of Europe!</p>
               <p>Q. You say you heard me call the King, a German hog butcher and other words; are you sure that these were all the words that I uttered, are you sure that I never uttered any words by way of comparison, such as he was no better? - I have told every thing to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know what past previous to my making use of these words? - I remember a great many scurrilous things said of different characters, but they are put off here by the court, and I am not to mention them.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray at what period of the evening was it that I gave a toast to the French Republic? - At the time that Mr. Newman and you seemed to have a scuffle, when you got the third glass of punch, not before that as I can recollect, and you sat by me all the time, I was not far, I was a great deal too near you.</p>
               <p>Q. You was not I think before the alderman when I was first taken up? - I never was before any body till I came here.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you applied to come before the alderman? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to come here to day? - Mr. White subpoened me here.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not in consequence of a paragraph appearing in one of the papers, stating that this country had to pay for so many Hanoverians killed at thirty pounds a head, that I made these remarks? - I did not hear you read that.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I keep the New London coffee house; this gentleman, Mr. Hudson, and Mr. Pigot, came into the London coffee house, between seven and eight o'clock, the 30th of September last, it was on a Monday evening, they had been in the house more than half an hour, and they had had three glasses of punch and began to be noisy, they called for several papers, in fact I believe all the papers, and as they called<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179312040142"></xptr>them they read different paragraphs from them and commented on the paragraphs as they went on, there was nothing called my attention till they gave some toasts as were thought, by the company present, very improper ones, as equality, The French Republic! they both drank it, I believe that gentleman gave it, he then drank An overthrow to the present systeem of government throughout Europe! I am not sure whether Mr. Pigot drank that, that gentleman gave it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect any other toasts that were given by the defendant? - There were several others, but I cannot take on myself to recollect any others; these were both given by Mr. Hudson.</p>


               <p>Q. Had he a glass in his hand, was he standing or sitting? - He was sitting at that time, he gave it in a friendly manner but very loud, in short he called the attention of all in the room and the gentleman pressed me to turn them out; I told them I would thank them if they would make it a business of their own, as I did not wish to interfere in it, and told me I ought not to suffer such behaviour in the coffee room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that heard by Mr. Hudson? - It was not. These toasts, I have mentioned must be heard by the gentlemen; by this time Mr. Newman came in, he walked up the room and he heard the toasts, and he said Mr. Leech why do you suffer such behaviouras this in your room? by this time Mr. Hudson had spoke so very loud as to cause Mr. Newman to call for a glass of punch and give the King, and every body in the room got up on their feet and gave The King! The King! ten times or more; this rouzed Mr. Hudson, he got up on his legs and gave the French Republic! he had a glass in his hand; Mr. Newman then went rather closer to him and seemed to shew great indignation at the toast which he had given; Mr. Hudson persisted in it and gave it again and said he would drink it, and held up his stick in a posture to provoke Mr. Newman to strike him, Mr. Newman seemed very warm but was persuaded by the gentlemen present not to strike him, I believe no blows passed on either side.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember whether he held up his stick in that menacing posture before he was threatened by Mr. Newman? - I should rather think it was after Mr. Newman had reproved him for giving such a toast, but certainly before Mr. Newman offered to strike him.</p>
               <p>Q. What followed on that? - Several gentlemen called to me and desired I would turn them out of the room; I told them I had observed their conduct for some time and I did not think I was justified in turning them out of the room, but I certainly would deliver them into the hands of the police; I sent for an officer, there was twenty minutes elapsed or more before an officer came, during that time they behaved very riotous, particularly that gentleman offering his stick in the face of two or three gentlemen, Mr. Pigot made an attempt to go out, but I pulled him back again and had all the doors fastened, and when the officer came I gave them into his custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Pray Mr. Leech what hour in the evening was it I entered your house? - I suppose it might be about seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might I remain in your house? - Till near nine.</p>
               <p>Q. You think it did not exceed nine before I went out? - I think it was about nine.</p>
               <p>Q. How came I to go out of your house? - I ordered you out, I gave you in charge of the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. What authority had you for that? - If you had not said any thing I should not have ordered you out by an officer.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179312040143"></xptr>Q. What period might I have been in your house when I drank the French Republic? - It was near eight.</p>
               <p>Q. How many glasses of punch did I drink in your house? - Three.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the first, second, or third? - The third.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I address myself ever to you? - Yes, you called me a fool.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body attempt to interrupt me before I addressed myself to the company? - Yes, you was clearly interrupted before you addressed the company, because every body was so hurt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you hear Mr. Newman call me a rascal? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You swear positively that Mr. Newman did not call me a rascal? - You heard me, I answer no.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not see Mr. Newman put his fist into my face? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not that previous to my having addressed myself to the company? - No, it was afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, what part of the room was you in when you heard me drink these toasts? - Not a great way from you, a little farther from you than I am now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I drink them as toasts to the company at large or to my friend? - You drank them to your friend at first, but you drank them so loud that they could be heard all over the coffee room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not after Mr. Newman called me a rascal and put his fist in my face that I gave the toast on my legs? - It was, I said so before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I seem to have given Mr. Newman any provocation to induce him to put his fist in my face and call me a rascal? - No doubt of it, he was the first man that came up to you, and then you held up your stick in a menacing posture.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not approaching my box in a menacing posture? - No otherwise than shewing indignation at your behaviour.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not hear me call the King a german hog butcher? - Perhaps that question may as well not be asked me. Certainly I did hear you call the King a german hog butcher, that he had sold his troops at thirty pounds a head; that is as near the words as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Court. What were the words? - That he had sold his subjects for thirty pounds a head.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what subjects? - I was not close enough to hear, he said the prince of Hesse Cassel did the same.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Pray Mr. Leech, where these all the words I uttered? - I cannot answer that question; I wonder you should put it.</p>
               <p>Q. You have seemed to select them very nicely however. Was it not in consequence of some paragraphs in the news papers that I made these observations? - That I cannot say; it did not appear to me that these were observations that could be made from any thing in a paper.</p>
               <p>Q. The jury want to hear nothing of you but evidence. Did I not read the news-paper aloud, and were there not paragraphs tending to that effect which induced me to make use of some of these expressions? - When you read the newspaper so very loud I was not in the room; you had read your paper aloud, and had two glasses of punch before I came into the room, and I begged to keep out till I was forced in.</p>
               <p>Q. And you came in very apropro when I was uttering these words. Did you hear the whole of that conversation concerning the King? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. At what period did you come in? - I had been out of the room half an hour.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179312040144"></xptr>Q. Was it after you came into the room sometime, that I began to speak about the King? - I only heard by piecemeals, except when you exerted yourself.</p>
               <p>Q. There is nothing else you can swear to, only what you have mentioned? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. At what period do you think, that I drank, The overthrow to the present systems of Government throughout Europe? - Towards the latter end, at the last glass of punch.</p>
               <p>Q. And are you sure these are the very words I uttered? - Yes.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Newgate-street, with my father. I was in the London coffee-house on the 30th of September, I went in there between eight and nine; the prisoner at the bar, and another gentleman were sitting in a box, opposite to where I sat down.</p>
               <p>Q. How many do you think there were in the coffee-room, at that time? - I should suppose a dozen, not more; they were talking very loud, but I did not hear any of their conversation, till they gave, The French Republic, as a toast aloud; I mean, the prisoner gave it to the person that was with him; it was as loud as I speak now; I heard it distinctly, and I believe, every gentleman in the coffee-room did; I got up, and went to Mr. Leech, the master of the coffee-house, who was at the upper end of the room; I asked him, if he suffered that toast, The French Republic, to be drank in his coffee-room? I don't know, whether Hudson heard me, or no. Mr. Leech said, it was, too had; I called for a glass of punch, and drank his Majesty's health, and the Royal Family, which was repeated, I believe, by every gentleman in the room, and immediately, the King! the King! the King! resounded from all parts of the room, except from the prisoner. Then a dispute arose between the prisoner and myself; he gave it repeatedly again, The French Republic; he was sitting, when I went to him; I said, he had no right to drink that toast in the public coffee-room; he called me a rascal and scoundrel several times, and held his stick in my face, and I held mind, but we neither of us struck one another. When I said he had no right to drink that toast in a public coffee-room, he drank that toast again, and said, that I was a rascal and scoundrel, and had no business with; he made use of very ill-language to me, to with me to strike him, but I said my stick on the opposite box, and told him I was determined not to strike; there was a great dispute in the coffee-room; he said, I was a rascal, he had Lavater, he could read it in my face; and an officer was sent for, and he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You say, you came into the coffee-room between eight and nine o'clock. Can you recollect what period between eight and nine? - I suppose, it was near the half hour as could be.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I address myself to you, when you came into the room? - You did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I appear to be addressing myself to the company? - You drank that toast aloud.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I desire the company to join with me? - You did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you come up to me, and call me a rascal? - Not before I went to Mr. Leech.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not call me a rascal before I spoke to you? - By no means in the world.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you put your fist in my face? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What induced you to come to my box at all? - Why, your giving the French Republic.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no other provocation from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179312040145"></xptr>me; how long do you think I gave this, after you came in the coffee-room, before I was conveyed out of it? - I think, it may be three quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it must be past nine o'clock? - I think, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear me give any other toasts, than those you mentioned? - I did not, I heard riotous behaviour.</p>
               <p>Q. I think, when you was before the magistrate, you said, you heard me call his Majesty, a German Hog-butcher? - No, I did not; I came in afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you conceive, that I was taken out of the coffee-room for? - For breeding of a riot.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I strike any body? - I did not see you.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not I desire the constable to take a gentleman into custody, whom I swore positively had struck me? - You did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he taken into custody? - He was not.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure, that I did not connect any other words with the toast that you have sworn to? - I did not hear any other.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Bristol, I am a merchant there. I was at the coffee-house this evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you be so good as to tell us, whether you heard any toast given by the prisoner, and what it was? - I heard many toasts given, and drank, I heard two particularly given by the prisoner at the bar, Equality! The Republic of France, may it triumph over Europe! there were many toasts, and some repeatedly given; but these two, I have a perfect recollection, came from the prisoner, or words to a similar import.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect any expressions relative to the King? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any such expressions as these used by the prisoner at the bar, that the King was a German hog-butcher, that he sold his subjects of Hanover to the government of this country, to be butchered at thirty pounds a-head, and that the Prince of Hesse Cassel did the same by his subjects; and that he had no doubt, but the King of England was in partnership with him, and received fifteen pounds a head back again of it, from the Prince of Hesse Cassel? - He said these words.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What hour might it be, when I came into the coffee-room? - A little after seven.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you think I remained there? - For more than till half after eight.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think I remained there till three quarters past eight? - I don't think you was taken away till nine.</p>
               <p>Q. Was I taken away before nine? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the coffee-room was it you sat in? - In the next box to you, with my back against your's.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Newman sitting with me? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Buchanan? - He was sitting at the end of that box.</p>
               <p>Q. Then perhaps, Mr. Buchanan sat nearer to me then you did? - No, I don't think he did, because my back was close to you.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time did I drink the French Republic? - You drank several toasts of that nature.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you think I had been there, before I drank the toast you charge me with? - Perhaps, an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect, how many glasses of punch I drank, while I was there? - You drank three.</p>
               <p>Q. How many glasses of punch do you think I had drank, before I had made use of these expressions? - You was drinking the second.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure of that? - I have said it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179312040146"></xptr>Q. Have not you sworn, that I drank, The French Republic? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And now cannot you fix on any period at all, that I did drink it in? - Not within five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. You recollect how many glasses of punch I drank, or how many had I drank before I used these words? - I can charge you with drinking a great many toasts, some of them in the first glass, and some in the second.</p>
               <p>Q. Answer that question, at what glass of punch was it, I drank the toast in question? - At the last glass.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body attempt to interrupt me, in the course of my being in that coffee-room? - Not till you had drank the French Republic, in opposition to the toast given, and generally received, the King.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body interrupt me then? - Yes, Mr. Newman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I address myself in any period of this discourse to you? - No, not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see me address myself to any body else? - Yes, 
to Mr. Newman, and to several persons in the room, after the toast was given.</p>


               <p>Q. Did I give the toast to Mr. Newman? - You gave it generally; you gave it very loud in opposition to the toast of, The King, which was the sentiments of the company.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Newman put his fist in my face, or attempt to do it? - I did not, I see him hold up his stick to you, and I came to him, and desired him to put down his stick.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that Mr. Newman holding his stick up to me previous, or after my addressing him? - After.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Mr. Newman call me a rascal? - I did not, I heard you call him one.</p>
               <p>Q. But before I addressed myself to him, did not you hear him call me a rascal? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. And if he had done, you must have heard him? - Probably I should.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, in the conversation you have stated, hear me make use of any other words than these you have mentioned? Were these expressions not mixed with other words? - Yes, there were several general expressions afterwards; as that, none but a German Hog-butcher could be guilty of such practices.</p>
               <p>Q. I wish to ask you a serious question, whether I did not apply the words, none but a German Hog-butcher could be guilty of such practices, instead of the King being a German Hog-butcher? - Both I believe; I charge with the first positively, and I believe, you spoke the last.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose it is not possible, you could be mistaken in these words? - I am pretty confident.</p>
               <p>Q. You receive no kind of emolument for appearing against me this day? - I expect to be paid my expences.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not applied for any part of the Credit Loan? - I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe your circumstances are not in the best situation? - They are not.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you are either in a bankrupt state, or making up your affairs? - No, I am not; I have no other end, then a man of honour, and the common rights of mankind.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positive, that I drank an overthrow to the present systems of government throughout Europe? - I am positive you did, and you proposed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you in a former examination, say, that I spoke in a language, that you did not understand? - It was so in the beginning of your conversation; I much wondered that two men sitting so close together, should talk so extraordinary loud, so I looked round to see what sort of people they were, in consequence of which, Mr. Pigot noticed me looking at you; then a sort of conversation in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179312040147"></xptr>French, or some other language, passed between you; so you went on in another language for some time, and you entered into an argument in a language which I did not understand; I suppose you spoke in that language when you found it necessary, to put an end to the argument, that had attracted attention.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the conversation at first, originate from a paragraph that I was reading in the newspaper? - I believe you was reading that the King had been a fox-hunting, and Mr. Pigot expressed great surprize, that the King should take diversions of that kind, while his subjects were engaged in a war; then you began exclaiming, that The King was a German Hog-butcher.</p>
               <p>Q. You said, that I said, none but a German Hog-butcher could be guilty of such practices? - That was by way of explanation, you generally summoned up pretty fully. I believe you meant all that the words could convey, that I have given before.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you hear me say about the Prince of Hesse Cassel? - That you had no doubt, but he was in partnership with the King of England, and that he received fifteen pounds a-head, as half the consideration.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that I used these words, in partnership with the King of England? - It was, or words to that full meaning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear me make use of the term, King of England? - You said the King, meaning the King of England.</p>
               <p>Q. That is your meaning, I suppose? - You had expressed the King of England before.</p>
               <p>The prisoner replied for near two hours to the charge, and founded his defence, first, on the illegality of his first caption in the house of Mr. Leech, there being no law allowing Mr. Leech to order him into custody for mere words.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That when he drank the French Republic, and an overthrow to all the present governments in Europe; by the French Republic, might be understood, the good of the French people; and that as an Englishman, when he drank the overthrow of all the present systems of government throughout Europe, it might be naturally supposed, he excepted his own country.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, With regard to his saying, the King was a German Hogbutcher, it was a comparison he used, in which, he saw no great harm; and with regard to the King's selling his Hanoverian subjects to the British government, and what he said about the Prince of Hesse Cassel, he was warranted, if he did say it, from existing treaties sanctioned by parliament.</p>

The prisoner was brought in, and the prosecutor charged her with stealing his watch; he gave me this watch, and said it was the one he had been robbed of, and a young man had seen her put it into his pocket; he said he had been robbed of 15s., I took the prisoner into another room to search her; she said, "I might and be d - d;" 4s. 6d. fell from her as she took off part of her clothes.</p>

            . I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner together as I was passing by; the prosecutor was calling watch! and I saw the prisoner pull him on one side, and put the watch into his pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor came and asked me where I was going; I said to Westminster; he asked to bear me company home, which I declined: he came to me again as I was crossing the Green Park; he gave me a shilling, and asked if he should see me across the Green Park; I said I would go another way; he then asked me to have something to drink, which we had; we then went and had some rum, and I went with him as far as Tattersal's-mews; he asked me to go down the mews with him, and said there was a house at the bottom where we could have something to drink; in going down he accused me of having robbed him of his watch; I said, "I am sure I have not got it." Two or three persons came up: I sat down and turned out my money into my lap; I had seen the prosecutor put something into his coat pocket; I do'nt know what it was.</p>

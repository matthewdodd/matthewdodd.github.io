            . On the 13th of March I was in Cranbourne-passage a few minutes after twelve o'clock at night, and met the prisoner, Watson - I did not know her before; she came up, spoke to me, and requested me to go with her to her private lodging, which she said she had in Long-acre. I said as they were her private lodgings I would go. When I met her I was going towards Long-acre. I walked with her to Long-acre, we turned up <placeName id="t18210411-16-crimeloc98">Legg-alley, in Long-acre</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18210411-16-crimeloc98" type="placeName" value="Legg-alley, in Long-acre"></interp>

I said I do not think this is a private lodging, and I had rather not go in. She insisted that it was, and I went in with her, and followed her up stairs. When I saw the room I felt certain that it was not a private lodging, and said I would leave the room, for she had deceived me. She said</p>
               <p>"If you leave the house you must give me some liquor first, likewise pay for the use of the room, and give me some money." I refused - she went to the top of the stairs, and called,</p>
               <p>"Betty, fasten the door, and let no one out." She went down stairs, I followed her, and found she and the other woman had placed themselves against the door to prevent my going out. I asked why they would not let me out - she then pushed me back, and said, if I offered to stir, or to open the door, she would tear all my clothes to pieces; a man then made his appearance at the further end of the passage; she called, to him</p>
               <p>"Ned, come and see me righted." He came forward, and asked what the row was, and said he was the master of the house (it was the prisoner Garratt.) I said, if you are the master of the house, you had better let me out - these women are detaining me against my will, and if you suffer me to be detained it will be at your peril. He said, you had better pay, Sir; you must know before you came into the house, it was nothing more nor less than a b - dy house. I said I would not pay; he said, if that was the case he must go, and leave us to settle it among ourselves. He then turned away. I endeavoured to make my way between the two women, to get out, but they both pushed me back with their hands. I turned my head, and saw Garratt standing by my side - he then said</p>
               <p>"You will not pay, Sir, will you?" I said</p>
               <p>"No, I will not;" he struck me a violent blow on my body, which stopped my breath, and I fell speechless against the wall; he caught me by the arms, and forced me along the passage to the further end, when one of the women opened a back door, and I was forced through it into a back yard, the door was bolted after us. He then endeavoured to push me down - I said,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake do not murder me;" and as soon as I found I had recovered my strength I called out Watch and murder! as loud as I could. He put up his hand to my mouth, and said</p>
               <p>"I will soon stop your calling." I pushed his hand from my mouth, and called out, a second time, Watch and murder! and directly after a watchman came at the door I was pushed through, and took him into custody. I found my hat was gone off my head, and told the watchman of it, and on searching for it, found it concealed under a water butt, in the back yard - I believe it went off in the scuffle. It was on my head when the scuffle began.</p>
               <p>COURT. This is not a robbery, your hat fell off.</p>

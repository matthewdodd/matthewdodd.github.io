I was in High-street, Southwark—on the 2nd of May, as near twelve o'clock at night as possible, I met the prisoner—she asked me to go with her—I said I did not mind, and asked if she was going far—she said, "No, a very little way"—she took me up a court, which I find is Chapel-court—we went to a house, and went to bed—I awoke about two o'clock, the prisoner was gone, and I missed my watch and the silver, which was in my pocket—I was sober—no one had been in the room to my knowledge—I had fastened the door when we went to bed—I had some half-crowns, six shillings, and three sixpences, in my poceket, which I lost—I had in a secret pocket 73<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but that was all safe—after some search we found the prisoner—I am sure she is the person—I have not seen the watch since.</p>

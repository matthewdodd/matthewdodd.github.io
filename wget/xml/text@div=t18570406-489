On 12th March, at 7 o'clock in the evening, I was in Fleet-street, and saw the prisoners standing together within four or five doors of the station, and ten or twelve yards from Brandt's shop—I fancied I knew Clark, which caused me to stop—they looked right and left, as if watching an opportunity, and a third man crossed the road and gave Smith a <hi rend="italic">porte monnaie</hi> which he put into his pocket without looking at the contents, and the man went away; in a minute or two Smith opened the <hi rend="italic">porte monnaie</hi>, and showed the contents to Clark—I was three or four yards off—imme<lb></lb>diately after that Smith went into the shop; I passed, and saw him being served with some tobacco; I went in, and saw Miss Brandt with a half crown in her hand; I said, "Allow me to look at it;" I bit it, and said, "It is bad, I shall be back immediately"—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I went out, and followed Smith; he crossed over to the opposite side of the road, and I kept my eye on them both as far as Farringdon Street, where I saw a policeman; they were a very few yards in advance of each other—I kept</p>

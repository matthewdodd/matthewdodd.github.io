About half-past 4 on Tuesday morning, 18th August, I was on duty in Essex-street, Bethnal-green, and saw the prisoner jump over the wall at the rear of the parsonage-house, Mr. McGachen's—I questioned him as to his business there, and he said he went over to ease himself—I detained him till a sergeant, who was at the corner, came up, and then searched him—we found these two ink-bottle stoppers, a silver ring, a table-cloth, and two towels on him.</p>

I was called by the last witness—he had hold of the prisoner—I got over the garden wall of this house, and found this cabinet round by the water-closet—it had been broken open, and all the contents strewed about on the ground—we searched the prisoner before I got over, and found these things in his pocket—at the station he was further searched, and this table-cloth was found wrapped round his body under his waistcoat—one towel was in his trousers pocket, and one in his coat pocket—I also found some lucifer matches on him—I went into Mr. McGachen's house, and found a piece of candle lying on the floor in the drawing-room—the drawing room window was open, and the shutters also—they open like doors—a person could easily get in.</p>

I am a clergyman residing at the parsonage-house, Essex-street, Bethnal-green—on the night of the 17th August, about half-past 10, I saw the doors and windows secured—about half-past 4 the next morning I was called up, and found the shutters in the drawing-room open, and the window up—they were safe the night before—I missed this cabinet—it was safe and sound when I saw it; it is broken now—all these other things are mine; the knife also—they were all safe in the house the night before—the knife was found by the cabinet in the garden—I don't know where it was the night before—I know nothing about the piece of candle.</p>

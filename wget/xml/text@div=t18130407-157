               <p>JOHN HERBERT. I am an officer. On the 25th of March, about five o'clock in the morning, I stopped the prisoner in Old Gravel-lane, with this bag of oats. I asked him where he had got it. He said unlawfully. I asked him where he worked. He said at Mr. Johnson's; he was a sand-moulder; he had been at work there from three o'clock in the morning. I asked him if he brought the corn from there. He repeated that he had got it unlawfully, and he hoped I should over look it. I told him I should take him into custody. He said if I did, he should be transported. I took him in custody; he made great resistance. I got him as far as Mr. Johnson's foundry-gates; he said he worked there. I took him in there with intention of putting a pair of handcuffs on him; he made his escape from me in the factory; he got over some gates, at the back of the premises. I then went to his house; his lodger told me that he had gone to work; his wife came down stairs; I told her I was an officer, and I had apprehended him for felony; and I must go up stairs to see whether he was in the house, or not. I was going up stairs; he stood on the top of the stairs, and swore if I offered to come up, he would blow my brains out. He pointed either a pistol or a blunderbuss at me; I am not certain which. On seeing fire-arms presented to me, I drew back. He told me all the officers in London should not take him, without killing some one. His wife went up to pacify him. He told me if I would take a one-pound-note and settle it, he would surrender to me. I directed a watchman of the office, to fetch me firearms. He then, by the intercession of his wife surrendered himself. I took him in custody again, and searched him. I found in his possession a key which unlocked Mr. Johnson's corn-bin. I then searched his house; I found about a peck of the same kind of oats in a tub in the washhouse, and two chissels for cutting iron. The blunderbuss and pistol were laying on the chest on the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Have you compared that corn - A. Yes; and it corresponds with the corn in my bin. We lost the lock and key of the corn-bin about three or four months ago. I had this lock put on it; and this key found on the prisoner, would open it, and I verily believe every article here is mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to call one of my shop-mates up, and as I came back, I found this bag of oats.</p>

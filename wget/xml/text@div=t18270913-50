            . I lived in James-court, Featherstone-street. On Sunday evening, the 29th of July, between six and seven o'clock, I was sitting in my room; the prisoner called me over to her apartment, and told me to look at

The prisoner said if she came up there drunk, she would break her neck down stairs, or chuck her out of window; the prisoner was not sober herself. Davis had lodged in the prisoner's room for four or five nights, but was treating the people below; they had not quarrelled at all that I know of. Soon after this I was sitting at my door, and saw Davis come out of the house; I persuaded her to go up stairs again - she went up, and as soon as she got to the top of the stairs, she fell down again; I ran across to pick her up;

             and another helped me up stairs with her into the prisoner's room, and we put her on the bed - I did not know that she was dead for some time afterwards - she never spoke. I did not see whether she got to the top of the stairs before she fell; when we got her up into the prisoner's room, the prisoner was there with a man who had been with her (the prisoner) all night and all day; there was but one bed in the room. I believe the deceased had been out all night; but before that they had slept in the same bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner when you went up? A. She was walking about the room, saying she would chuck her down stairs again, and break her neck, not knowing then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130054"></xptr>that she was dead. We took no more notice of the deceased for full an hour, but let her lay, thinking that her being in liquor made her not speak. I staid in the room about an hour, then went to the bed-side, and found she was dead - she was not cold. I directly sent for Mr. Smith - he came, and while he was looking at her, the prisoner tied up her clothes, and went away with the man; he had said she was dead before she began to tie up her clothes. After she had tied them up she took a pint pot, and said she would cut the deceased's head open - Evans and several more took it from her; she went away with the man - I have not seen him since - he had never been there before. Mrs. Evans lodged in the lower room, under the prisoner. I found the prisoner in a wine-vaults in Whitecross-street, about five o'clock the next morning, drinking rum - she was neither drunk nor sober. I asked what made her leave her room when she knew the woman was dead - she said, I could not say she had killed her; I said it looked very black of her to leave the room in the manner she did; I persuaded her to come home, and when she came, they asked how she came to murder the deceased; there was a watchman and several more in the room - she said she did not push her down, but dashed her down stairs.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Had she not a black eye, and a black spot on her right arm a week before this? A. She had a black place on her arm, but she was hearty and well; it was a bit of a bruise - I believe she had fallen out with a young man whom she lived with - neither of them were sober; whether she had got to the top of the stairs, or whether she fell, or was knocked down, I cannot tell; her head struck against the street door as she fell.</p>

            . I live at No. 5, James-court, Featherstone-street. I do not know where the deceased lived - I had seen her backwards and forwards in the prisoner's house, two or three times. On Sunday afternoon, about half-past five o'clock, I saw her come in, and go up stairs to the prisoner's room; she was very much intoxicated - I was in my own room, on the ground floor; she was no sooner up stairs, than I heard her fall down - I ran to her assistance, and called somebody to help her up. Turner, and one Bradham came and helped me up stairs with her: we laid her on the prisoner's bed, not knowing then that she was dead; the prisoner was in the room, and a man sat there, who was a stranger to me; they were drinking porter - I continued there all the time, and in about three hours, we found she was dead; we had not spoken to her, when we took her up stairs; being intoxicated, we laid her down, thinking she was gone to sleep, and took no more notice of her - I went to awake her, but receiving no answer, I felt her forehead, and found she was very cold. I called to the prisoner, and said, "This woman is dead;" they immediately came to the bed-side; the prisoner was very much in liquor indeed; she seemed much alarmed at the woman's death, as she had known her some time - I made an alarm: two medical men came; the prisoner stopped there some time; she then got a cap, gown and shawl, and went away - I think she took them more for security than any thing else.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went up stairs with the deceased, did you hear the prisoner say any thing? A. I heard her say nothing at all; she was very much in liquor, about an hour after, and had been out, she took up the quart pot, and said she would strike the corpse; she attempted to strike it, but I knocked the pot out of her hand, and threw it under the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she attempt to strike, or only say she would? A. She did not attempt it; she was very much in liquor; she went away, and was brought back about half-past five in the morning, by Turner; she had only lived there about three weeks - I never heard her quarrel with the deceased.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I was desired by the Coroner to inspect the body previous to the Inquest - my apprentice had been fetched on the night in question: I found the neck dislocated between the first and second vertebrae - I considered that sufficient to account for her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130055"></xptr>death, and made no further examination - extreme violence would occasion that dislocation; falling down stairs was as much calculated to produce it as any thing - it might happen whether she fell or was thrown down; but the greater probability would be, that it would happen from being thrown down with violence.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing she had fallen backwards, from the top to bottom of the stairs, and struck her head against the door, would that occasion it? A. Not if she fell flat - it was represented to me, that she had fallen with her head doubled up with the body - if she fell against a surface hardly equivalent to the length of her body, I consider the consequence would be the same, whether she fell or was thrown backwards.</p>

On Sunday, the 29th of July, as near half-past six o'clock as possible, I was sitting outside the window, and saw the deceased coming down the court; she was very much intoxicated, and put her hands against the wall to save herself from falling; she got up into the prisoner's room, and after being there not more than ten minutes, she returned, and came down stairs - she was within five stairs of the bottom, and pitched her head right up against the corner of the door-post, and in falling, dropped her money out of her hand, which was 13s. and 1/2d. - as I sat, I could see up the stairs; I never saw a soul near her - I could see further than where she fell from - I kept my seat; my wife and Turner went and helped her up - the witness Turner was very much in liquor - I heard that she was dead in about two hours; I then went up into the room, and saw her lying on the bed; I said, "This poor creature is dead;" I came away; they were all very much in liquor together - she pitched right on her forehead, and bent her neck under her.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness; when the deceased fell down stairs, my husband called me to help her up - I went and helped her; I was coming away directly, and they called me back to count the money which fell out of her hand - I did not know she was dead - Turner was not sober; the prisoner and the deceased were very much in liquor - I heard of her death two hours afterwards,</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and board at No. 21, Featherstone-street. On the Sabbath evening in question, I was at the table going to partake of supper; the prisoner came in, and said, "A person had dropped down dead in my room" - I got up, went to the room, and the scene of iniquity was beyond description; they were swearing - I could not be heard; several of the witnesses for the prosecution were in the room; all of them in the state I have described - at last I found one who was able to answer me - I asked if a medical man had been sent for; they said Yes, and I returned home, seeing I could be of no use. Hearing the prisoner was to be tried, I thought it my duty to state what I knew.</p>
               <p>Q. She had brought her clothes to your house? A. Yes; she appeared in a flagrant drunken state, and all her person exposed.</p>

            . Q. You saw her go up stairs, and think she had not time to get into the room? A. She could not; she was no sooner up than down; when we went to her assistance, her two feet were on the stairs, and her head bent on one side towards the door; she laid on her back.</p>
               <p>MR. SMITH. The fall described by the witness, agrees with the state I found her in - it would arise from the manner she states she fell.</p>
               <p>Q. Would the dislocation have been the same if she had fallen forward, as the other witness describes? A. Yes; there would have been a different separation of the parts.</p>
               <p>T. WILD re-examined. Evans was intoxicated; all the witnesses were not drunk, but several were; Turner was drunk; Goff lived servant at our house - her name is Liberty, not Jane - she followed me to the room and I left her there - I did not see Buck or Steele there; my stay was short.</p>

So that at last she gave the Change to Dun, who told it over several times. She lighted them out, and shut fast the Hatch and the Door after them, and went backwards; but soon after, some body knock'd at the Door; and when she opened it, she saw 2 of her Neighbours with Vaughan, the Prisoner, and a Parcel of her Goods which had just been taken out of her Shop.

             depos'd, that going to drink at a Friend's House, they saw 2 Men and a Girl whispering together at the End of an Alley, opposite to Norman's Shop. Says Hall, I don't like the Looks of those Fellows; I believe they are Bailiffs. Prithee, John, step over and observe 'em. It being a Moon-light Night, he went by them, looked wishful in their Faces; and returning to Hall, told him, that they looked more like Thieves than Bailiffs. Upon this they watch'd 'em, and by and by they saw Vaughan go along with a Bundle upon his Shoulder. They stopt him. He cry'd out, Thieves! Rogues! do you design to rob me? They told him they knew who those  Goods belong'd to. Are they yours, says he? No, said they, but we can bring you to the right Owner quickly. Gentlemen, be but easy, and you shall go Halves. No, we will have all. All? What won't you leave me one Cap? Pray, Gentlemen, let me have but a Cap, and take the rest betwixt you. They carried him back with the Goods to Mrs. Norman. Quin ran away; but he and Dun were both taken next day. The Prisoners then made their Defence. Vaughan own'd that he had the Goods, but said that he found'em under a bench next Door to Norman's. Quin said he was at Ipswich when the Robbery was committed, but brought no body to prove<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172501150005"></xptr> it. A Picklock was found in his Pocket; and he was an Evidence at a former Sessions.

On the 29th of July I had been out, when I was returning home in the middle of the day, I met him with a large bundle coming out at the back part of my house, which comes into Strand-lane, the fore-part is in <placeName id="t17750913-18-crimeloc95">Surry-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17750913-18-crimeloc95" type="placeName" value="Surry-street"></interp>

I asked him where he was going with that bundle: he said, he was going to his washerwoman's with a few things to wash. I could not think that was true; because a few weeks before he was very poor in shirts, and borrowed some money of me to redeem some he had in pawn. I took hold of the bundle, and bid him come home with me: he struggled with me; but I made him go into my office, there I made him open the bundle; the first thing I took out, was a pair of thin stockings that were made a present to me at the Isle of Jersey; I never wore them above once; they are very curious; I have been told they were worth a guinea and a half: he said they were his, and asked me if I would presume to swear to them: I looked at them, and said I would. The next thing I took out was the coat I now have upon my back; I asked him if he was going to have my coat washed too.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure it is your own coat?</p>
               <p>Eyres. I am.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177509130013"></xptr>Q. To the Prosecutor. Was you about to discharge him at this time?</p>
               <p>Eyres. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these things worth more than his wages?</p>
               <p>Eyres. I had paid him his wages before he had borrowed a guinea and a half of me, and just before this another half guinea, which exceeded his wages.</p>

            . I was fellow-servant with the prisoner at the time he told me he was going out to pawn the things, till his washing came home on Monday; he did not tell me what things.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him go out with the bundle?</p>
               <p>Atkinson. I saw him go out; I did not take notice of the bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not see him go out of the door?</p>
               <p>Atkinson. Yes, I did, he went out at the back door.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it?</p>
               <p>Atkinson. I cannot swear to the hour, I believe it was between five and six in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you live with Mr. Eyres now?</p>

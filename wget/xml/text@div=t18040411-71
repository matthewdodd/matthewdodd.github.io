             occupies a part of that warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he any partners? - A. None: On the 20th of March, a merchant bought fifteen dozen of shawls, and nine pounds of silk twist; I packed them up myself in a wooden chest; they were both in the same chest, with other articles.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a package were they in? - A. They were in an iron-bound package, and the iron was screwed down on the package.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the dimensions of the package? - A. About eight feet wide.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you yourself see this package perfect? - A. I did, it was quite perfect.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of this package on the morning of the 21st - was it taken by itself, or with others? - A. With four others.</p>
               <p>Q. How was this package marked? - A. I marked it myself P. A. B. I saw them all put in the cart, and safe down to the Guillotine; I saw that with the other packages, one was marked N, with a diamond, No. 91.</p>
               <p>Q. You accompanied the cart yourself? - A. I did, I went with it to the Guillotine.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of it there? - A. I then saw it taken out of the cart; the Guillotine is near the Custom-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of them then? - A. They were taken out of the cart, and put under the care of Mr. Mackenzie, the lighterman.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this? - A. A little before ten o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them put on board the boat? - A. I did not; I saw them after they were on board the boat.</p>
               <p>Q. What boat was it? - A. A lug-boat of Mackenzie and Gray.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it when you last saw this boat? - A. Near eleven in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the packages appear then? - A. Quite perfect; in the same condition as I left them.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. That boat was close to the Custom-house? - A. Close by in the water.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other packages in the boat? - A. There were about ten more.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they put on last? - A. Yes; they were to be put on board the ship Kingston, bound to Boston, laying at Wapping Old-stairs; the tide had then run down about half an hour; the tide served about six hours good tide.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What are you, Sir? - A. I am an importer of British goods to Boston, in America.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not a navigable man? - A. I have crossed the Atlantic twice.</p>
               <p>Q. Some tides you go very expeditiously - do you know how the winds were on the river? - A. Very adverse winds.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know what time the lug-boat set sail? - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it so late as two o'clock when it set off? - A. No, it was not; I saw the packages safe; they were uppermost in the boat.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not know whether you have been up and down the river? - A. I have in a boat, as far as Blackwall.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Your packages were large? - A. Yes, and the others were small, in proportion to ours.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the prisoner at that time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore whether he had any charge of that, you do not know? - A. No; upon the day the goods were re-landed, I saw him.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180404110070"></xptr>Q. He came forward voluntarily? - A. No; he said he had not done it, he had never left the boat, and was not concerned in the plunder.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You are foreman and inspector to Mackenzie and Gray - is it your business to attend the quays to receive them on board the craft? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 21st of March, did you receive these five packages that came from Mr. Pratt's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they put on board the lug-boat? - A. They were, I saw them on board; as near as I can recollect, it was about eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did they continue in your care on board the lug-boat? - A. About two hours.</p>
               <p>Q. Who came and took charge of them then? - A. The prisoner; that was near one, or thereabout.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did he go off from the quay? - A. As soon as he received the order from me; he left the quay about one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time were these five packages safe in the boat? - A. In all appearance to me they were, at the top; I saw them, they appeared safe; I have no doubt about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any other person go with the prisoner? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you see the boat go off? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it to go with sails, or with oars? - A. With paddles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You are foreman to Mr. Mackenzie? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If the wind happened to be a little east, whether it was most condusive to the service he was employed in, to go down to Blackwall first, and work up, or whether to have gone first to the Kingston? - A. He stopped as he went down, and delivered at New Crane.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You did not see him do that - which would have been the best to have delivered, the packages at Wapping, or to have gone to Black-wall first, and then work up? - A. If he had found no difficulty of stopping, it would certainly have been his duty to have stopped there, could he have got the goods into the Kingston without stopping.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Was the wind north or east? - A. It blew east.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think, if he had gone to the Kingston first, he could have got back? - A. I am confident he could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course it would have been best to have gone to Blackwall first, and then to have worked up? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you come on board the boat? - A. I was not on board all the whole time after it left the quay, after I had put them on board.</p>
               <p>Q. Then between eleven and one o'clock there was not any body on board the boat? - A. There are always people belonging to Mr. Mackenzie and Gray about; there are two watchmen and myself.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was it possible, that when you had put it on board the craft, for any person to take it out and pack it up again? - A. I believe it possible, I cannot say it is likely.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Did the prisoner tell you when he came back, whether he stopped at the New-Crane going or coming back? - A. Going down.</p>
               <p>Q. Could not he have stopped and left these packages in the Kingston at Wapping Old-stairs, as well as to have stopped at New-Crane? - A. You may have one single box in a boat, or skiff; sometimes people are engaged in stowing away the holds, they may be so engaged as not to be able to deliver their cargo; it depends upon circumstances.</p>
               <p>Q. What length of time would it have delayed him, to have stopped at the Kingston without impediment? - A. It would have detained him half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that the delay of half an hour was such, that he could not get to Black-wall? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You packed these things on board the lug-boat; is it your usual custom to pack things that come last at the top? - A. Yes, it is; when I put those goods in I did not know of these goods.</p>

They appeared to be in a suspicious state, one was an iron bound case, it was the smallest of the three, marked P. A. B. one of the iron hoops was loose, and the ends had been rivetted on; it appeared loose by losing its rivet, and losing some screws; there was another marked N, and a diamond, the battens were some of them broken, that was corded; to all appearance they had been opened; there was some discourse with the mate and the prisoner concerning the state of these chests; the prisoner said, they had struck against the windlass; something about coming at the end of the windlass.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing of their coming at the end of the windlass? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they put that night? - A. Down in the hold, they were locked up, and the mate had the key; I staid on board all the night, I cannot say whether the hold was open in the night or not; the next morning I saw the hold open, I waited for that purpose; they did not come out of the hold till the day after, during that time they were under my care.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they brought up on deck the day after? - A. They were; and they were in the same state as they were when delivered on board the ship by the prisoner. In the morning, as soon as the hatch was open, I went down to inspect them; I found there had been formerly screws, and in the room of the screws that were taken out, there were put old nails which would not fit the holes; the smallest case that was iron bound, which is marked P. A. B. some part of it seemed to be very much broke indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not open them at that time? - A. No; the next morning I made a report, after they were put on board.</p>
               <p>Q. The morning of the 22d of March, you made a report? - A. Yes; and on the 23d, I put them on deck, and sent them on shore.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had parted with them, were they in the same state as when delivered by the prisoner? - A. There was some little difference made by Mr. Raines's men, who had been opening them, after Plumrage had been on board; Plumrage was present at their opening.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner came with the chests, did you hear any thing done when he came along-side of the vessel? - A. I heard him hammer.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the hammering that you heard was in the boat? - A. I suspected that it was at first, but I afterwards found it was upon the deck, as they came over the bows.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it as he was delivering you the package as he came over the bows? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were on board the ship, how many seamen were there? - A. Several, and two mates.</p>
               <p>Q. The head mate has the controul of every thing on board the ship? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the mate give a receipt to the prisoner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he assign any reason to the prisoner for not giving the receipt? - A. I do not believe he did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Was the chief mate on board when the things were delivered? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no answer made by the second mate to the prisoner, that he would not give him a receipt, that no one but the first mate should give a receipt? - A. I did not hear that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Evans on board at the time these things were delivered? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. He might hear it? - A. I did not hear it.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not mean to ask you whether any of you had not access to it, the property was under lock and key; now the second mate shipped the packages, and kept the key; had you no access to the property? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that you had not? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you sleep? - A. Aft.</p>
               <p>Q. Aft is a long way, that is one half of the ship; Whereabouts did you sleep? - A. Near the cabin.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you sleep in the cabin? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you slept on the deck? - A. I slept in the fore hold.</p>
               <p>Q. That is below stairs? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They might get from the cabin to the half deck, and from the half deck to the hold; if there was any secret they might get there without a key? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore this place, locked up, if a man got into the cabin, he might get there? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the chief mate come on board that night? - A. He did.</p>

               <p>Q. What day of the month was it? - A. The 21st of March.</p>
               <p>Q. Quite dark at seven o'clock at night? - A. Yes, it was; I should not have been able to have seen then without the assistance of the moon.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it darker on the Thames than in London, were there are many houses? - A. I could not see to take the marks without the light of the moon.</p>
               <p>Q. Yet you could see they were broke when they came into the ship? - A. Yes, apparently.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not your duty, not to have received<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180404110072"></xptr>things that appeared to have been broke? - A. I did not see it till they were upon deck.</p>
               <p>Q. That is no answer - I ask you whether it is or not the duty of the chief mate, or the person who is superintendant of the ship? Is it not the duty of a Custom-house officer to refuse taking in goods that appear to have been plundered, aye or no? - A. I do not know how far that may go.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been a Custom-house officer? - A. Five years.</p>
               <p>Q. And not know your duty yet - you keep accounts on board a ship? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got that book here to-night? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not your duty to have entered in your book, that night, that these things appeared to have been plundered? - A. We are not so particular; if the captain and the mate receive it, we do not so much mind; when I had examined them more particularly the next morning I made a report.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. What part of the entrance to where the things were put was it that the mate locked up? - A. The hatch.</p>
               <p>Q. After the hatch is locked down, is there any access from the cabin to there? - A. There is a door that leads to it opposite the cabin-door.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were in possession of the cabin? - A. The chief mate, and the second mate.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Erabraim. I am a Custom-house officer, a searcher: When I got on board the Kingston, on the 22d of March, I went down into the hold, I saw one package marked P. A. B. with an iron hoop round it; they appeared to have been screwed, but the screws were drawn, it appeared to me to have been plundered.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did it appear to you that it had occurred by accident or by design? - A. By design: I opened it, and there was a little box with a hat, some red cotton, red and blue thread, that was all that I found in this case; the one marked N and a diamond, it appeared to have been broke, it appeared to have Irish linens, I did not take the lid off quite; I saw there was a cavity in which were some birch broom stuffed in it; there was another package, it did not appear that there was any thing taken out; I left them in charge of the officer.</p>

               <p>Q. How long would it have took them to have opened the case in a regular manner, without doing the case any damage? - A. I cannot say, they were broke in such a manner; they might have compleated it, as it was done, in the space of twenty minutes.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. When you saw them they appeared to have been broke; where they were broke you cannot tell; on board the ship, or elsewhere? - A. I cannot.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the 25th of February, about half-past eleven o'clock at night, I stopped the prisoner in Rosemary-lane, near Blue Anchor-yard, with a jacket and a pair of trowsers, a shirt and a pair of braces, under his arm. I asked him how he came by them? he said he had had a few words with his landlady, and was going from his lodging. I took him into custody: when we got before the Magistrate, he acknowledged he had stolen them; he stated he was a pensioner of the Navy, and had 16 l. a year.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have lost my hand. I met a man who had been a fellow-prisoner with me in France, and drank rather too much, and did not know what I did. I do not know how I came by the things, but when the patrol took me, I told him they must be the prosecutor's. I have not a farthing pension.</p>

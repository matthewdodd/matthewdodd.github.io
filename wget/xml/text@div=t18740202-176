                  </hi>. I am a silk mercer, carrying on business at 9, Regent Street, under the firm of Howell &amp; James—Brewer was an assistant in my service—he would serve customers, and make out a ticket to deliver to the porter when he sold goods, so that the goods might be delivered, having first made out his bill and duplicate of the transaction—he was taken into custody on the morning of 14th January, and in consequence of information I went with Beechey, the officer, to Rochester, on the 15th—we went first to the Chief Superintendent of Police and then to 31, Burridge Street, where Wingrove lived—he is Brewer's step-father—he was in bed up stairs, at 12 o'clock in the day—the Superintendent went up to him, and I did not hear what conversation took place between them; he came down stairs afterwards, and I asked him if he was Mr. Wingrove—he said "Yes"—I said "I may as well tell you that your step-son is in custody on a charge of embezzlement, and he has forwarded parcels to your house," and I requested to know what he had got there—he first denied having anything in the house, and then subsequently said "It is all my fault"—I asked him to explain—he said "I have been a soldier, I have kept a public-house, I have lost all my money, and I have been in difficulty"—I asked him if he had got any employment, and he said "No, I have tried to get employment, and the only employment I can get is hard work, and that I am not accustomed to"—search was made on the premises, and the things produced were found, Scotch plaids, serge, and cashmere goods, in various drawers and cupboards in the house—I have examined those things and identify them as my property—I said to him "What has become of the silks, Mr. Wingrove?"—he said "I have had altogether five lengths of silk"—I said "What lengths?" and he gave me the number of yards for the different lengths, which I cannot repeat from memory, but I took them down on a piece of paper, and it amounted to about 100 yards of silk—he said he received them from his step-son—I asked him what had become of the silk—he said he had sold it—I said "To whom?"—ho replied "To Mr. Dunning, a pawnbroker"—I went to Dunning's, and he produced a piece of silk of 24 yards, which I identified as my property—it was worth about 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard.</p>

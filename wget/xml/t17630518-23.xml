On Saturday morning last, between 9 and 10 at night, the prisoner came into my shop under a pretence of buying a shirt-buckle; I shewed him some, I saw him conceal one in his hand, which was a garnet one set in gold; I looked so close after him that he could not put it down again without my seeing him; he said, he had one at home he would make an exchange with me, he said it cost 17 s. He went out of the shop, and told me he would bring it; I followed him, and overtook him in the passage to the Post-office, I took him by the collar and led him back to my shop, and said, he had stole a shirt-buckle from me and I should punish him. A constable was going by, I called him, and gave charge of him. The prisoner said, he hoped I would not expose him, and begged for mercy, and would have down'd on his knees in the shop, and put down two shirt-buckles on the counter; I only saw him take one, but he had taken a paste one set in silver, and a garnet one set in gold, I know them both to be mine, by my private mark.

            . I was charged with the prisoner. As I was taking the prisoner to the Compter, he said, is there no means by which I may get off? I said, no; he said, I can give you 5 guineas if you will let me run away; he acknowledged he took them, but said it was by mistake.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I have seen him in my shop before; he was servant to Mr. Jackson, in the secretary's office at the Post-office.</p>
               <p>The prisoner in his defence said, he had met with an acquaintance who had made him drink three glasses of rum, and he being fuddled, took them by mistake.</p>
               <p>The prosecutor, upon being asked, said, he did not appear to him to be in liquor.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Henry Moses, at No. 41, Tri<lb></lb>nity-square, Tower-hill, in the precincts of the Tower Without. My brother has a wine-cellar at the back of the premises—he keeps the house—I do not know whether it is in any parish—I believe not—he pays poor-rates—I was going into the cellar, about twelve o'clock in the day, and observed some holes in the wine-cellar door, which appeared to be burnt with a redhot poker, as large as my hand, and afterwards cut away with a knife—on going into the kitchen, to examine the pantry, a lad who was with me saw a hat—I locked the pantry door, and ran up stain—I heard the pantry door burst open—I could see, through the back parlour window, a man running across the garden—he jumped over the wall, which leads to a piece of waste ground, belonging to the Trinity Company—I afterwards saw the prisoner in Hodge's custody—he had lived in my brother's service, as footman, at one time—the prisoner is the man—I saw a table-cloth taken from round the prisoner's body.</p>

                  </hi>. I am beadle of Trinity-square. I know the house of Henry Moses—it is close to the edge of the City, in the precincts of Old Tower Without—I found the prisoner in the custody of Hodges, in Mr. Moses's house—I searched him, and found a table-cloth round his waist, and two glass-cloths round each leg, at the top of his boots—when I took the table-cloth from him, I said, "Have you got any thing more?"—he pulled his trowsers up, and I found the two glass-cloths round his legs—I found 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him.</p>

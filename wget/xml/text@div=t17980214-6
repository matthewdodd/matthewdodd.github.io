             sworn. - On Tuesday last, the 13th of February, I suspected I had lost some money, and I marked copper halfpence to the amount of 4s. 6d. out of which I missed two; I am a <rs id="t17980214-6-viclabel39" type="occupation">publican</rs>

               <p>Q. How long had she lived with you? - A. I said before my Lord-Mayor, almost two years, but I find it was not quite one year, she lived twice with us, once she went away sick, I had a very honest character with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you lost money before to any amount? - A. I cannot say to what amount, I stamped them in the officer's house, in his presence.</p>
               <p>Ceoss-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This is a prosecution for one penny? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And if she had asked her mistress's pardon, she would not have been sent to the watch-house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. She came to you with the character of having lived seven years in one place? - A. No; she lived at other places between that and her coming to me.</p>
               <p>Q. You marked all these halfpence with the same mark? - A. Yes; I marked them between three and four in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any customers in the course of that afternoon? - A. Yes, a good many.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mix these halfpence with others? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Does any body else serve in the bar besides yourself? - A. Yes, my wife; she is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know she might not have given change out of these halfpence that afternoon? - A. I am sure she did not.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner went away sick the first time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not a good opinion of her then? - A. Yes; or else I should not have taken her in again.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has got all the money that was found? - A. The constable has got it.</p>
               <p>Q. To the amount of several pounds-you having lost but one penny? - A. Not that I have sworn to.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this girl employed to buy wood to light the fire in the morning? - A. Sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you buy a pennyworth of wood at a time? - A. Yes, sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether this girl had a penny from your wife to buy a pennyworth of wood, you cannot tell? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q.Is it good money? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Sherwood. This is the money that I marked, here is the instrument that I marked them with.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you ever mark any halfpence before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you pay your servant her last year's wages in halfpence? - A. No; I paid her 10s in halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. You have a club, I believe, held at your house? - A. Several.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this girl in the habit of getting pence from those clubs? - A. She might.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that there were no halfpence among them with such marks as these? - A. I should think not.</p>

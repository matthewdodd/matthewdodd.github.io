                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and live in Cannon-street-road. The prisoner was in my service—I directed my wife to look after him—I marked ten or twelve penny pieces, and some other money, and on the Sunday morning, previous to the prisoner's leaving to go home, I asked how he was situated for money, whether he had any—he said he believed he had 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. he was not aware that he had more—I asked if he had any copper money—he said, "Not a halfpenny?"—I said he must turn out his pockets to satisfy me—he turned out six sixpences and the other money stated in the indictment—part of it was marked, and I know it was mine—this cork-screw was found on him—he heard me ask for it on Saturday night.</p>

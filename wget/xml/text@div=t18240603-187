On the 25th of December, about 5 o'clock in the afternoon, we went out, and left nobody in the house - it was dark.

I found the window-shutters torn away at the bottom and forced open; they had tried to force the lock of the door, but did not succeed, I found the door open - on going up, I found a box, which I had left on a shelf over the staircase, was put on the bed, wrenched open, and the property stated in the indictment taken out, and quite gone - the bed and bedding were taken off the bedstead, rolled up, and put on the head of the stairs.

            . I am a brewer's servant. On the 25th of December we went out about 5 o'clock, locked the door, and left every thing safe - it was dark then - we returned about a quarter to eleven o'clock, and found the shutters open and the sash pushed up - there was a mark on a table which stood under the window - it appeared like the mark of a heel, as if a man had got in backwards - we found several people in the house - a dark lantern was found, and next morning we picked up a crow-bar. The prisoner lived about two hundred yards off, and passed the house almost every day; I saw him pass next morning. About two months afterwards I saw him in company with a man named Eden, who had a coat on which looked like the one I had lost. I followed them to a house, and asked Eden if that was his coat - he said,</p>
               <p>"My worthy friend, do you think it is your's; what are you following me for;" - this was in Goddard's-rents. I said, it looked very much like mine, but the lining was altered - a mob gathered; and the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"Come along, Jack; it is of no use bothering with him;" and away they went.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This is a very populous neighbourhood. - A. It is; I saw him on the day of the robbery about as usual; when I got home the house was in an uproar.</p>

            . I am a silk weaver, and live in John-street, Brick-lane. I know the prisoner - he came to my house on the last Friday in January. In the evening I went with him to the Duke of York public-house, Turk-street, Bethnal-green - we met Phillips at the door. I knew him before. I did not go into the Duke of York. Phillips said to Taylor and me, that Taylor had only one shilling more of the property than the rest.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the first thing he said - A. Yes; he was rather in liquor. Taylor had told me that Phillips said I was suspected of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Well; but had you spoken to him about this before Phillips came up - A. Yes; I told him I was out of work and very much embarrassed, and that I had been suspected of the robbery. Taylor said, that on the night after robbery he came to my mother's to bring me one pound, but was told I was not there - the pound was to send me away - they had a reason for it - he said he would have given me a pound if he could have seen me - he knew that I was suspected.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what made you tell him of it - A. I thought it hard that I should be suspected, when, according to every appearance, he was concerned in it. I had seen him at my brother's, at No. 21, Wilmott-street, on the Sunday week after the robbery, and told him I was out of the way, as the officers were after me, and I knew nothing of the robbery. He told my brother to come to the corner of Air-street, about nine o'clock that night, and he would give me some money, and would speak to the other parties to send me some, as I was out of the way for it. I did not see him again, to my recollection, till the last Friday in January, when we went towards the Duke of York public-house. I met Phillips, who said Taylor had had one shilling more than the rest, and if there was a Bank note lost,

We came out, shook<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182406030063"></xptr>hands with Haydon, and bade him good bye. The prisoner and I went down Turk-street, and he stated to me the particulars of the robbery.

            , who came back with them. Blacket, who had been left to watch, came to the public-house about nine o'clock, and told them it was all right. There were then six of them, and they went down - Taylor got in at the window, and let in two of them, saying,</p>

               <p>"Come in, Bob - come in, Tom;" three of them went in, and Haydon, Walker, and Phillips, were outside; Taylor and Jones went upstairs, and Blacket was sky-larking below; Taylor and Jones took the box from over the stairs - then Blacket came up, Taylor caught hold of the money, and said,</p>
               <p>"Here it is, Bob," and gave him the money; and after they came out of the house, they threw the plum-pudding about the place, and brought the bread and beef out, and found a string of candles, which they brought away, and came along the road - that is all he said. We then went to the Ship public-house, at the corner of John-street, Brick-lane, and there saw Blacket - Taylor spoke to him about wronging him of the note - he said he had not had one - Taylor said, if any thing should happen to him, he should blame Blacket - we had a quartern of gin and parted. I saw him again last Monday three weeks at a fight - his arm was dislocated - he said, that when that was well, he would break the other over me. I had told my father of it before this, and he told Powis. I did not give information myself till after I met Taylor at the fight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You were out of the way for this robbery - A. Yes; I was accused wrongfully; I was not there. I was tried here for a highway robbery, which I was innocent of.</p>

               <p>Q. You said nothing about this till the prisoner threatened to break your head - A. No; he told me every thing about the robbery. I have been at work for the last three or four months. I was out of work for a month before Christmas, and for two or three weeks after. I might be out of the way for two or three months after the robbery. I recollect all that Taylor told me very well.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get your living while you were out of the way - A. I had plenty of goods, and sold them all off. I lived about a hundred and fifty yards from the prosecutor, and the prisoner lived nearer. I was concealed in Wilmot-street, which is not three hundred yards off. I went out frequently in the day-time, and went home two or three times.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you at nine o'clock on the 25th of De- December - A. At a public-house about thirty yards from the prosecutor's. I was not out of there after six o'clock on that evening - several people saw me there.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been to the prosecutor's house lately - A. Last Thursday, as we came from Hick's Hall, I went in as Taylor's mother was standing by. Powis did not wish to hurt her feelings, so we went into the house till she was gone. I was there last Monday, and staid about half an hour; I went to ask when they would go to Hick's Hall. I did not talk one word about this business - we did not mention the prisoner's name.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Bow-street. On the 12th of April I met the prisoner, and asked if his name was not Taylor; he said No, that he lived in Tyson-street, Bethnal-green, near or next door to the sign of the Duke of York; I said he did not live there - he said he did, and offered to take me there, but I did not go, not believing him. I took him towards King's, and in the road met an officer, and said to him,</p>
               <p>"What is this man's name?" he said,</p>
               <p>"Sam Taylor, is it not Sam?" he gave no answer. On the morning of the robbery Mrs. King gave me a crowbar, a dark-lantern, and the iron tip of a shoe. I took his shoes off at the first examination; one had an iron tip, and the other not, and the tip corresponded with the heel of that shoe; he wore the shoes in prison, and I afterwards found he had torn the other tip off; I could not compare the tip with the shoe, as it had been heeled, and has nails in it. I asked what he had taken the other tip off for; he said he had kicked it off in prison, but we could not find it there. When I examined the two tips they appeared to be fellows, but I cannot say that the loose tip had been on that shoe, as it had been mended; he appears to tread on the back of his heel, and both tips were worn alike.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He offered to go to Tyson-street with you - A. Yes. We had received information about Clayton on the day after the robbery. I was desired to to look after the prisoner a few days before the 12th of April.</p>

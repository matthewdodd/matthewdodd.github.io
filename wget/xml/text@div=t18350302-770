                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at East Ham, in Essex. On the 17th of February, at night, I was rather tipsy—I had been to the Borough, and fell down nearly opposite the Mile-end station-house—the prisoner, who was the policeman, came up to me—he put his hand into my pocket, took out my tobacco-box, and put it some where about his person—I said, "You have taken my tobacco-box, give it me"—two young men came up at the time, and he said, "Here is a villain charges me with robbing him of his box"—he then took me to the station-house, and said there, that I had charged him with robbing me of my box, and he had found me drunk in the street—I was then searched, but nothing was found on me—I then desired the inspector to have him searched, which he was, and my box was found on him—the inspector asked me if I knew it—I described it by two or three things, and said, my name was scratched on it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-inspector of the K division. I was on duty at Mile-end station dn the morning of the 18th of February—the prisoner, who was then a policeman, brought Sweeney into the station-house—he said he had found him drunk, in the Mile-end-road, and upon raising him up he had accused him of robbing him of his tobacco-box—I asked the prisoner if he had done so—he said, "No; most certainly not"—I then asked Sweeney how it was done—he said he put his hand into his jacket pocket, and took the box out as he was lying on the ground—the prisoner positively denied it, but there was something in his manner which excited my suspicion—I desired the reserve man, Mockett, to search him, and he handed me a box which he said he had found in his great-coat pocket—Sweeney caught a glance of it, and said, "That is my box," and swore to it—he prisoner said it was no such thing, for he had had it some considerable time—I found the name of "William Sweeney" on the bottom of it, as Sweeney said it was—I detained the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 241.) I was on duty as reserve man at Mile-end station-house, on the 18th of February. Sweeney was brought in by the prisoner—he appeared to be drunk—I searched the prisoner, and found this tobacco-box in his rattle pocket—he said he had had it some time, six months, in fact, and he had found it on his beat—he said that before he was searched—that he had it, but it was of very little use to him, as he neither smoked nor chewed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I solemnly declare that I picked up the box from the ground near the prosecutor—and my only motive for not giving it to him was his having charged me with robbing him—I felt indignant at it, and put the box into my pocket—I would not let him have it because be accused me of robbing him—I hope, for the sake of my wife and family, you will look over this, and enable me to maintain the good character I have borne, to my life's end.</p>

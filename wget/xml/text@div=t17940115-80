               <p>I lost some cotton waistcoats Christmas Eve, the clock went six as I missed them, I put them in a pan of water in the airy.</p>

               <p>Q. Were there three of them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they cotton? - Yes, I believe they are, I am sure they are? I sent a little child on an errand, and the comes back and says, mother has any body been down for any linen? I said no; she said then mother you are robbed; I then went down to see, and I missed these waistcoats, I went into the street and I followed them by the water that ran from them, I went up and got a candle and saw the water had ran from them as far as the rails in the area. I saw the things the same night in the constable's hands (Warren)</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner in your house? - I did not.</p>

               <p>I am a constable belonging to the public office, in Marlborough-street. On the 24th of December Mrs. Johnson's son came to our office, and said that his mother had been robbed of some linen, about seven o'clock; I found the prisoner in David's street, Grosvenor-square, but I did not take him there; I did not take him till I came to Chandler's-street; this was near about ten o'clock on Christmas Eve; I did not know whether it was the same lad or no, but I found him with this cundle of wet linen under his arm and I took him into custody and took him to Mary-le-bone watch house.</p>

            Did you lose any cotton handkerchiefs? - Yes, I believe these to be them, one is what I split in two for the children.</p>
               <p>Warren. I found three on him, two in the bundle, and one in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. As to these handkerchiefs and waistcoat, where they your own property or things that you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150217"></xptr>took in to wash? - One waistcoat is my own property, and the others is not; I can swear to that which is mine, as to the others they belong to the people that I wash for.</p>
               <p>-BEDFORD sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a hair dresser; I had sent four waistcoats to be washed to Mrs. Johnson's and these are three of them, I have pieces that are left and they exactly answer, they are all different patterns, I have pieces of patterns of two of them; of one I had observed that the first or second button was off, and likewise this striped waistcoat, there was a button off, on the right side; I have no doubt whatever of their being mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please you my lord, I was coming down Davis-street, and I met two young fellows, I had been in company with them before, and they asked me if I would go and have something to drink? and I went to the Rodney's Head, in Chandler's-street; and after that I went to market, afterwards I met them again and when they met me they asked me to hold the bundle for the value of five minutes, and I wanted to buy a piece of meat, and that man followed me to the butcher's shop and took me into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any of these witnesses here who gave you the bundle? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any other witnesses? - No.</p>

The prisoner was in my employ for seven months and twenty-one days - I had a good character with him from a respectable house in Bond-street. On the 6th of December I had discharged him, and was about to pay his salary - he said he would take his trunk, and call in half an hour for his salary; I had suspicion of him, and called him up into the drawing-room - I put rather forcible question to him; I certainly said he had better state all about it - I found I could get nothing from him, and called in a Policeman; the key of his box was found; after a short time, the Policeman opened it in his presence - a pair of ladies silk mittens were found, which I conceived to be mine, but cannot positively swear to them; they are worth 3s. - I thought it useless to search the box further at the house, and sent it to the Police-station; I was present there when it was searched; the two pair of silk stockings, and three odds ones were found in it - they are black, spotted with white; I have three stockings corresponding with the three odd ones; they are a peculiar stocking, and I can say decidedly they are mine - the pair are very fine, and not general in the trade, but I will not swear to them; the odd one I will swear to.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BALL. Q. Do not you know that the prisoner has been able to save a little money at his former place? A. I am not aware of it - I have heard of it since the prosecution; I have since heard from a relation that be has a little money in the stocks - I have seventeen persons in my shop; I know nothing about the prisoner giving any offence to the cook about any gruel; I know of no dispute between him and the young men in the shop about the cook - if he was ill, gruel would have been allowed; he may have been sent out on errands just before he left; I first saw his portmanteau when it was brought into my drawing-room by Mr. Rutherford, who has been twenty years in my house; it was locked - the key was not to be found, but the prisoner at last produced it; I know nothing of its being left down stairs open for four hours - I know nothing of the box having been searched before; when he was brought into the drawing-room it was sometime before the key could be found; I swear to the odd stocking - they are not a common manufacture, but very uncommon and peculiar; I think there is not another pair in England like one of these - I had only one pair of that pattern, and it was made to my own peculiar idea.</p>
               <p>Q. Could not other persons have put them into his box? A. How is it possible for me to say, when I do not know where his box was?</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I took the prisoner - the box was brought to the station-house by a porter; these two pairs and three odd stockings were found in it - they appear to be the fellows of these produced by the prosecutor; the prisoner produced the key of the box, and I opened it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing of the stockings being in my portmanteau - it was in the kitchen, exposed to all the house, from six o'clock in the evening till nine at night, as I was sent out by Mr. Rutherford; the box was opened three times before it was taken to the station-house - once it was opened by the porter, as he said Mr. Rutherford wished to open my things; I opened it - he examined it, said there was nothing belonging to him, and seemed satisfied; he went up stairs to fetch my money, as I supposed; he then came down, and said Mr. Rohertshaw wished to look it over - I took it up into the drawing-room to Mr. Robertshaw - he stepped up to me, and said I had been robbing him; he opened my box - he and the foreman examined it, and found nothing but the mittens; he then ordered the foreman to go for an officer - he gave me in charge, and I was taken to the station-house, the porter carrying the portmanteau - when brought to the station-house they examined it, and found the stockings; I knew nothing of their being in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090118"></xptr>portmanteau - it was exposed to every body in the house, and I and my fellow-servants were not living comfortbly together.</p>
               <p>MR. ROBERTSHAW re-examined. I only found the mittens - the officer has not stated where he found the stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the box opened before be produced the key to the Policeman? A. I consider not, for the things were particularly smooth, and he desired the Policeman to keep them smooth.</p>
               <p>JOHN HOWARD re-examined. I found the stockings at the station-house; they were in the sleeves of one of the prisoner's coats in the portmanteau; I was in the drawing-room all the while that the portmanteau was open - I unlocked it myself; there was no hesitation in bringing it forward while I was there: the portmanteau opens in the middle - his clothes were in the upper division, but the coat was not the first thing: the trousers were on the top of them - I know nothing of the portmanteau being opened before I searched it; the things were smooth, and did not appear to have been meddled with - I locked the box myself, after examining it in the drawing-room, and put the key into my own pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor's porter is here, and he knows my fellow-servants were not on good terms with me.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's porter. I believe the prisoner and his fellow-servants were not on good terms - I know nothing of the box being down in the kitchen before he left.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do not you know it was down in the kitchen all the time? A. I know it was in the passage just as you were leaving, and Mr. Rutherford said, "Whose is that?" the prisoner said, "It is my portmanteau;" that is all I know - this was about ten o'clock at night; I had been out all day, and had not seen it before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do not you know that Mr. Rutherford and I had it open in the counting-house, and all the things out, before it went into the drawing-room? A. This is the first I have heard of that - he did not always agree with his fellow-servants; I have lived there about three months - I never knew his box to be left open; I considered him very reserved and close, and not likely to leave his box open, and never knew him leave the key about.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. ROBERTSHAW. Q. Were the stockings kept in a place which the prisoner had access to? A. They were kept in the window, and must have been taken when he undid the nuts of the shutters in the morning; I should certainly have missed them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Hedges, a harness-maker and horse-dealer, in Burn-street, Paddington. About three weeks or a month ago my master brought the prisoner home to do a job—he was a stranger till then—master gave him supper that night, and be came and asked mistress for a light to go to bed, as he was to sleep there; but he went away, and I missed my coat—I never found him till I met him in Smithfield on the 27th of March—I knew him again—he had got my coat on his back—I said, "Halloo my fellow "—he said, "Stop, stop, I will give you the coat, don't make a row," and then he ran away—I ran after him, and called a policeman, and he was secured—this is my coat—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it had laid on my bed.</p>

I was in the market, and his master asked if I wanted a job—he set me to clean some horses, and to take them home I asked him if he could tell me a regular job—his master agreed for me to stop there a week for my victuals, and I was to lie on the straw in the room in which this boy slept—I could not find any straw, and I put on his coat to go and find him, but I could not find him—when I came back the stable was fastened, and I did not like to disturb them—I should hart returned the coat, but I was looking for a situation.</p>

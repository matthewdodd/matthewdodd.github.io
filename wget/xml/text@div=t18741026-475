                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the London Court of Bankruptcy—I produce the proceedings in the bankruptcy of Gustavus Marks, he describes himself as a commission merchant, of London Wall—there is a petition of Mr. John Parker, a public officer, on behalf of the National Bank, dated 4th February, 1873—the prisoner was adjudged bank<lb></lb>rupt on 26th March, 1873—a statement of his affairs was filed on 17th April, 1873.

               <p>the bankrupt's papers—they are monthly statements of accounts which were sent to him at different times between July and October, 1872—the total amount of his debt to me in October was 541<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the only cash payment that he made up to October was 77<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., that was for the first parcel of goods; that left 54<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for which he gave me these acceptances for 270<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 271<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., at two months, both falling due on 4th December, 1872—neither of them were honoured—about 18th November I saw the prisoner in respect of seventy-five pieces of merino—I handed him this memorandum—it is "Seventy five pieces merino at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 2 1/2 per cent, 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cash, the rest at two months from date of invoice, to Southgates &amp; Co."—those were the terms upon which I was willing to part with those goods—he saw the patterns, and I think the pieces as well—he came over, and I told him as there were already these two bills which were due in December, I would not give him further credit before they were paid, and he agreed to pay one half in cash, and the rest in a month, by bill or cheque—he then sent this note and cheque. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>): "Gentlemen, the bearer will hand you cheque for 194<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., being 3 per cent less than 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as agreed—please give bearer the order to Southgate to transfer the goods to my name; I will call and see you in the morning and make a settlement"—the cheque is dated 18th November, on the National Provincial Bank, in favour of Neil Brothers or order—he erased "bearer" and put "order," because he knew that we were obliged to send the cheque over to Paris to get it cashed—as I had not authority to endorse their name on it I had, on previous transactions asked him for an open cheque, so that I might cash it at once—at that time the goods were at Southgate's to our order—on the receipt of this cheque I gave an order to transfer them to his name—I expected there was money at the bank to meet the cheque, otherwise I should not have parted with the goods"—before the cheque was presented he called and selected five or six more pieces of merino, I think it was on the same day, the 18th—the amount of those was 49<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I gave him credit for those on the same terms, to be paid with the second half—I sent the cheque to Paris in due course, and on 26th November I received it back marked "Orders not to pay"—I saw the prisoner the same day and asked him how this happened—he said, he had some difficulty with the bank, and that matters would be settled in a few days; he said there was an attachment on his banking account—we presented it a second time in a few days, and the answer was "Not suffi<lb></lb>cient"—it has never been paid or the 49<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. either—he owes me altogether 1,010<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I did not know at that time that he was getting advances from Davis, Layland, or persons of that kind—had I known it I should not have parted with my property.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Caro and Davis is one of the large firms at Valparaiso—Charles Moore and Co. have carried on business at Sydney for twenty-five years—I and my father before me have carried on business in London forty years—it is our business to ship goods to Sydney and Valparaiso—it is a regular business to advance money on goods shipped for Australia—the Colonial markets fluctuate in a very astonishing way—merinoes are a par<lb></lb>ticularly fluctuating article—the soap that went to Valparaiso was rather a dead article in the market—I did not intend in consigning these things to Moore and Co. that they should be <hi rend="italic">slaughtered</hi> in any way; on the contrary, the best has been done for all parties concerned, according to the market at the time of the arrival of the goods—this is not the first instance by many in which losses have been sustained upon goods that have passed through me, the account sales of the merinoes will show that several pieces were deficient, they did not measure out the lengths marked on them William Jeffries Cox.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We do have sales where there is a considerable profit to the persons selling through us, or else the business would soon be stopped—there would be no difficulty in giving an instance of that (Mr: <hi rend="smallCaps">DAVIS</hi>. My Lord, I submit this is, not bearing on the case, it is not proper, and I object to it, I don't wish the business of any clients to be disclosed in open Court.) This is the ledger; I have not got the account sales book here—I decidedly pledge my oath that there are many transactions in which money has been returned over and above the advances to the persons shipping—I could not give you an estimate of how many in the course of a year, a very great number, deducting the 22 per cent, and all the charges—at times the profits in the Colonial markets are very large, and at times the other way—all the particulars in reference to Mr. Marks, his being the person taking the advance, the ship by which the goods have gone and the person to whom they are consigned would appear in our books, and could be found at any time by any person making inquiry.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I don't know that I am at liberty to name any person. to whom a balance has been handed; I could mention them if I must do so—I will give you the name of Bethamy, of Baltavia Works, Langton, Staf<lb></lb>fordshire to whom I have just recently paid a cheque of profit, I forget the amount, but I think somewhere about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the advance might have been on 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or something like that, I really could not: tell you the amount—that is not a solitary transaction, I could remember several, but I am not quite at liberty to mention names—it is not more usual to have a loss than a gain, I can scarcely say from memory which is the more usual, but I should think there would be quite as many gains as losses—we do not lose at all—there are not more losses than gains to the con<lb></lb>signor; I mean what I say, with the 22 per cent and all expenses, and although colonial affairs fluctuate very much—we try to ascertain the state of the markets before we send out; we send out anything suitable for the market—we take nothing that does not suit the market as far as we can judge.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">It wot read and was identical with the former</hi>). My usual commission is 5 per cent. and 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">del credere</hi> on the gross proceeds of the sale—I sent the goods out to Charles Moore and Co., they are auctioneers and merchants as well—I had an account sale from them on 30th October, 1873; I am sorry to say it shows a loss of 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. it does not produce the amount I advanced, I beg to explain that out of the 10 per cent, upon which so much stress is laid is to be taken frequently the amount of 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and sometimes 3 per cent premium on the return draft, and if the goods should he held for twelve months without being sold no interest is charged; the 10 per cent. covers all that; and so it is in the exchange from Valparaiso, frequently it comes to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a dollar, and we take the risk, of that—we also take the risk of the goods being sold on credit after the return sales; we get 2 1/2 more for that—I say that I am actually money out of pocket on the transaction, 2 or 3 per cant on bills and no interest on the money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> That was the only transaction I had—goods are often sent to me represented to he of a particular quality which when sent to the colonies turn out not to be of that quality—these were represented to be Kent hops by Marks, and I feel certain they were so described in the invoice, but I could not say positively; I don't know what county hops they were, I only know that they must have been inferior to have sold at so low a price, hops as a rule in the colonies almost always fetch a good price—it is very common for persons shipping to the colonial market to obtain advances on their shipments, hundreds of persons do it.</p>

I am one of the shorthand writers attached to the Court of Bankruptcy—I took notes of the bankrupt's examination on 8th and 29th May—the transcript of my notes is on the file—it is a correct transcript of my notes, which I took accurately from the mouth of the de<lb></lb>fendant, question and answer.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I also took Munday's examination; while he was being examined the bankrupt interpolated some observation which he was after<lb></lb>wards sworn to—it is on the notes; this is what he said "I applied to the manager and showed him the money I had; I wanted him to hold possession of the money for this cheque; he said you had better not pay the money into your account, you had better retain possession of it and give us an order not to pay the cheque—I produced the money to the manager and also to the clerk at the counter, a bald-headed gentleman."</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE LUSH</hi> was not aware of any authority which went to that extent; the giving a cheque upon a bank where he had no account would be a false pretence. because it was a representation that he had an account there, but he was not aware that it had been held that when a man really had an account, although it might not be sufficient to meet the cheque, that that would amount to a false pretence. The substantial question, however, for the Jury, was whether the prisoner was really carrying on a legitimate business or whether it was a mere pretence to raise money.</p>

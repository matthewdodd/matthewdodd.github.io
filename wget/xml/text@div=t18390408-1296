About five o'clock in the morning of the 26th of February, I was in the neighbourhood of the Minories—I met the pri<lb></lb>soner Sinclair at a coffee-stand in the street—she said, "Will yon have any coffee?"—I felt, and said I had no money—she said, "I will treat you with some coffee"—I said, "I don't want any young girl to treat me; I have money, but no change"—I then walked up Whitechapel with her, and came to the Elephant and Castle—she said, "They know me, I will Dot go in"—I went in, and said, "I will thank you to change me a £5 note"—the lady said, "No"—I came out, and Sinclair was waiting at the door—we then went on to the Coach and Horses—she said, "I will not go in here"—she stopped, and I went in—they would not give me change there—I came out, and then we went to look for another house—we came back to the Elephant and Castle—Sinclair said, "Yon can't get change there"—she met a policeman, and asked him to drink—he went with us to the door, but did not go in—I went into the Elephant and Castle, un<lb></lb>buttoned my coat, and took out of my breast-pocket two £10 and one £5 notes—Sinclair was there, and called for a glass of brandy and water—I presented the £5 <hi rend="italic">note to</hi> the landlady—she could not give me change—I then put the two £10 notes into my breast-pocket again, and the £5 note into my breeches pocket—Sinclair then said she would treat me, and she took from her glove a half-sovereign, two half-crowns, and three shillings, and paid for the brandy and water—after I had put my two £10 notes into my breast pocket, I thought she was a little funny—she catched at my breast two or three times, pretending to tickle me—I said, "You will get your hand into my pocket presently," but I did not think she meant to do it—she then said, "I have got plenty of money, God bless you, I don't want your money"—I then buttoned up <hi rend="italic">my</hi> coat—in a minute or two she said, "I want to go to the door; I will soon be in again"—she went out, and did not return—I felt in my pocket, and my two £10 notes were gone—I gave an alarm to the police—I had received the two £10 notes the night before from Mr. Burge, a contractor on the Eastern Counties Rail<lb></lb>way—I did not mark them myself, but I know they are the notes I had from him—I had no others.</p>

On the 26th of February I looked out for Field, and found him in the Back-road, St. George's, where I was on duty—I had seen him several times before with Sinclair, and knew he lived in the neighbourhood—I said he was charged with a robbery, but I had not then heard what the robbery was—I had him by the arm, and he went quietly with me for about twenty yards—he then gave a sadden spring, struck me on the left side of the head, and ran down a street—I pursued—he was taken to the station-house—I found this watch and guard on him.</p>

On the 26th of February, about six o'clock in the morning, the prosecutor complained of being robbed—he described a woman to me, and I looked after Sinclair—I had known her four or five years—I went to the prisoners' lodgings—I found a bed, fire-irons, a hearth-rug, a carpet, a set of brasses, a small key-hole saw, a centre-bit, three keys, and better than three pounds of pewter, a new bonnet in a box,</p>

               <p>and a hat-box with no hat in it—Sinclair was not at home—I saw her afterwards in custody—I told her she was charged with robbing a gentle-man in Whitechapel of two £10 notes—she said it was impossible it could be her, for she had plenty of money—she had met a friend the night be. fore, who gave her a sovereign, and she had treated the gentleman with coffee and brandy-and-water—I saw a wedding-ring on her finger, which appeared to be new—I was at the office when Field was there—he said it first that he bought the watch and guard in the London-road with money that he had saved out of his earnings—that he had deposited it in his sister's hands, and drew it out, and bought the watch and guard, and he had bought his sister a wedding-ring at the same time—Sinclair was present.</p>

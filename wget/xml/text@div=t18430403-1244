                  </hi>. I am in the employ of the Copper Company, at Castle-Baynard wharf. I know the prisoners—I have known Hastings well; he has been there many years taking the dirt away—I cannot say that I know Willis so well, but I know him—on the 11th of March I was shutting up the doors, at Castle-Baynard Wharf, and I saw the prisoners there—they had their baskets and shovels, to take the dirt away, and shoot it into their cart, which stood in the street—I was up three stories high, but I could see what was going on—I saw Hastings take this copper out of an old copper boiler that we put small pieces into, put it into the basket, and cover it over with dirt—Willis filled the dirt into the basket, and lifted it on his back—the prisoners were both together—I saw Hastings take the copper, and present it to Willis—it was dropped into the basket—Willis covered it with dirt, and Hastings shot it into the cart—I came down and told the foreman.</p>

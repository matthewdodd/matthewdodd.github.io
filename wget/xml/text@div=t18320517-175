               <p>ELIZABETH STEPHENS. I am single. I have been living with the prisoner nearly seven years; we lodge at Great Saffron-hill; he brought home the time-piece when we lived at Finsbury-court - it was there four or five months; he told me to pawn it, and I did; he brought home a case of instruments when we lived at Saffron-hill, and the neck-chain, which he gave me for my little girl to play with.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DONNE. Q. When did you first see the time-piece? A. Eight or nine months age - he had made use of his master's money, and he told me to pawn the time-piece - I pawned it in my own name; it had stood on a sideboard, and was not concealed; I was not quarrelling with the prisoner when the officer came - he knocked me down.</p>
               <p>JOHN BATEMAN. I am a pawnbroker. I have the time-piece, pawned by Stephens, on the 24th of March.</p>

            . This is my time-piece, and so are the other articles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.What character had the prisoner? A. I considered him trust worthy - I never trusted this time-piece to him; I had no transaction with him in a way of business - the time-piece was for the use of our office, and when it was missed he charged another person with stealing it; I was once in the Court of Exchequer for selling some goods for a man, who afterwards took the benefit of the Act, and I had to pay the fine; I have borrowed 5l. of the prisoner's brother, but I never had any money transaction with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The time-piece was not pawned by my order.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

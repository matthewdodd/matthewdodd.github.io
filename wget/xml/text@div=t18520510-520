On 21st April, I was at Mr. Stone's house, the Light Horseman, on Hounslow-heath—the prisoners were there in company—I had two games at quoits with the male prisoner—I then left, and went towards Cranford, where I live—the prisoner followed me, and Hancock asked me to have half of a pint of ale—I said no, I would stand a pot, and we went into Mr. Starbuck's where I stood a pot of ale—I gave Mr. Starbuck a shilling and he gave me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out—I put the sixpence in my purse, and put the purse in my coat left hand pocket—Hancock was on my right, and Taylor on my left—Hancock was <hi rend="italic">bothering</hi> me to buy a duplicate, and while so doing I felt something in my pocket—I put my hand to my pocket, and felt Taylor draw her hand out—the prisoners had seen where I had put my purse—I took the purse out, found it open, and four half crowns gone—it was a steel clasp purse—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I am positive it was closed when I put it in my</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Hussar beer shop, at Hounslow-heath—on 21st April, the prisoners and the prosecutor came together to my beer shop—the prosecutor ordered a pot of ale, and paid for it, while the prisoners were standing close by him—I saw Webb's purse—it contained 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I gave him, and four half crowns—when he gave me the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., he emptied the contents in his hand, and I saw what was in it—I left them in the tap room, went to the bar, and in a few minutes heard as if they were quarrelling—I tried to get into the tap room, but could not, there was somebody holding the door—I pushed the door, got in, and I saw Hancock knock Webb down, and when he got up, he said he bad been robbed, and showed me his purse—there were some half pence in it, but no half crowns—Hancock said, "Why should we want to rob you? I have got plenty of money"—he put his hand into his pocket pulled out some money, and I saw 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., four half crowns, and some halfpence—he put that into his pocket again, and Webb told me to go for a policeman—I sent my little boy, he could not find one, and the prisoners left, and Webb followed them.</p>

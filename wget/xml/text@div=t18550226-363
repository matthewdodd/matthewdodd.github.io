                  </hi>. I am manager to Mr. Perkins, a pawnbroker, at King's-cross.

"—he said, "I want some money, and I wish to pay the interest to-morrow on the linen"—he asked me if I would lend him 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the watch—I said, very likely I might—he then went out, and the policeman who was outside took him into custody—I have the agreement here that he entered into—he wrote the name and address in my presence—the other transaction was in two pledges of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—when he pledged the last lot he said he had got another lot, and would I take that in, and I refused—I never knew him by the name of Two ood.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>,). In consequence of information, I made a communication to Messrs.

Chaplin and Horne, to the value of upwards of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that a portion of that linen had been disposed of at Perkins's, at Battle-bridge, for 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in two lots; on 19th July for 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in two pledges of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, and one lot on 25th July for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I asked him how he accounted for the possession of those goods—he said he had bought those goods of a Mr. Brown, a linendraper, at Notting-hill, and he had given him a guinea a piece, that Mr. Brown brought them to him in his horse and cart—he said he had pledged them the same day that Mr. Brown, brought them to him—I asked him if Mr. Brown still lived at Notting-hill—he said he really did not know, he had only seen him two or three times—I then told him I should charge him with disposing of a quantity of linen which had been obtained from Messrs. Chaplin and Horne's on 18th July, a portion of which I had found pledged on 19th July for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and a further portion for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 20th July—he said, "I certainly did pledge the linen"—I searched him, and found on him a pack of cards and two brass chains, which we term <hi rend="italic">duffing</hi> chains—I asked him his name—he said his name was William Twogood, and he lived at No., Munden-street, Hammersmith—from inquiry I found that to be false—I did not take down the address, it was taken down in the charge book—I perfectly recollect the address—I took it down in my pocket book, now I recollect—it was taken down in in the charge book by an officer in my presence—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is "William Twogood, Munden-street, Hammersmith"—I afterwards went to No., Munden-street, and found it occupied by a Mr. Upton, a dentist—I could find nothing of William Twogood there—in consequence of further information, I went to No., Devonshire-street, Hammersmith, and found that a person of his description was living there, in the name of William Brown—I searched that house, and among other things of no importance I found this piece of rope.</p>

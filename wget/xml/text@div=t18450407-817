                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's foreman. I can swear to this blue cloth—I have seen it in master's warehouse, and missed it about three weeks before the prisoner was taken up—I have the charge of the cloth—I had been in the country, and when I returned, this cloth was missing—I cannot say when I had seen it, but, as near as I can tell here was a long length of it early in Jan.—it was in its usual place on the shelf.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's brother. I know this piece of blue cloth, so as to speak to it positively—the prisoner had it from my hands a year and a half ago, when he was In my service, to send to my father, in Ireland, for a coat—he asked my permission afterwards to ex<lb></lb>change it for an olive he had of his own, as he should prefer the blue coat himself—I consented, and he sent the olive to my father—the cloth was a remnant, and, being in business, I had placed it to my own account—I do not know the maker's name, we buy them in town.</p>

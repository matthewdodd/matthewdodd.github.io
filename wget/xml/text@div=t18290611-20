She had bought a piece of meat there once before, and I think left some money on it; I heard her say she lived servant in Burton-street - I suppose there were fifty persons in and about the shop; I think she was perfectly sober - there was 6s. 11d. found in her pocket; I thought she was not quite right when she once came to our shop - there was no sovereign found on her that I saw.</p>

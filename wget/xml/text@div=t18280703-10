I looked at it and knew it to be mine; it was in my pocket when I was knocked down; there were two half-crowns in it, some other silver, two 1s. 6d. stamps, and a pencil; I had had it about a month or five weeks, and knew it to be mine - it has my writing in it.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 17th of June, about half-past eleven o'clock at night, I was in the street, and heard a cry of Stop thief! three times; I looked out and saw the prisoner come running up; I crossed over, and when he saw me, he stopped running, and walked; when he came up I took him - I knew him well before and had spoken to him that night; I saw the prosecutor soon after, and when the prisoner got to the watch-house door, he had both his hands in his pocket and wanted to get them out very bad; I told him not to take them out; he said, "O, that is all stuff;" I took hold of his wrist; he directly dropped the pocket-book from his pocket - Webb picked it up in my presence; I examined it in Spencer's presence and found two 1s. 6d. stamps in it, with a card of where he worked; I found no half-crown, but Spencer said he had put two in there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When you took me, where was the prosecutor? A. At the corner of Osborne-street; there was one gentleman with him and a young woman; I only saw one gentleman - several gentlemen came to the watch-house; Spencer said he had lost two half-crowns; I did not pick the pocket-book up, as I thought you wished to drop something else, and I had enough to do to take care of you.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. If he saw me drop it, why not mention it to the night officer? A. He said he had got nothing; the pocket-book was produced and shown to him; he said he knew nothing about it - but I saw it drop from his pocket, and saw it picked up.</p>

I was going down Whitechapel; the prosecutor lay on the stones, and two gentlemen stood before him; a woman was standing with him - when I came up she had hold of his right arm - one of the gentlemen told me to help him up; I caught hold of his arm, helped him up, and was going away, when the woman cried Stop thief! the watchman came up and asked what the woman was crying after me for; the gentleman gave his address, and he could testify that he never moved, he was so drunk; I never saw the pocket-book till it was produced in the watch-house.</p>

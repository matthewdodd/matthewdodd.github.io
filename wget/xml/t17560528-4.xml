             was inform'd that the waistcoat' had been pawn'd there by the prisoner. She was sent for; her mother came, and sent for the waistcoat there. The girl at the bar own'd she saw me go out of my house, and she went in and took it out of a drawer. We took her before the justice, and she there confessed the same (the waistcoat and flat produced in court, and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the waistcoat ?</p>

            . I missed this waistcoat; and my husband and I went to enquired at the pawnbrokers; then Mrs. Roberts, said the prisoner had pawn'd the waistcoat there, and took it out in about five minutes after. The girl's mother was sent for; she came, and brought her key; saying she had got it under lock and key; so a woman took the key; and brought it. The flat iron was pawned at Mrs. Roberts's, by the prisoner, where I found it. We took up the girl, and before justice Welch she confessed she saw ply husband go out; and went to his lodgings and took the waistcoat and flat iron away.</p>

I am a pawnbroker, in Catherine-Street, by Leicester fields; the child at the bar brought the waistcoat to me to pawn, and wanted a shilling on it, and it was taken out again in less than a quarter of an hour; by which means we found out the things when the prosecutor came to enquire after them.</p>

I said I would give none: he said I was a very unkind father. He then sent for me to know what I designed to do; I said nothing at all, and hid him go about his business. Then he came and served a warrant on me; I had heard of it and had superseded it, and shew'd it to the constable.</p>

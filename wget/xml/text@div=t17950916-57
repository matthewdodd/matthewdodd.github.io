On Monday the 25th of July last, I went out about half after nine, and returned about half after eleven, I cannot say to a minutes; I left every thing safe and found, all the doors locked up; when I returned I found the party wall all cut down, and I went up stairs and the oats were gone; that door was not locked. They broke down the party wall joining their premises and mine, so that two people might get in; I went up stairs and missed my oats and sick and all, there was rather better than a bushel.</p>
               <p>Q. Your door remained as you left it? - The room door was just the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the oats afterwards? - No. When I missed it I went down stairs and see the oats scattered about the place, and from that I had a suspicion of this person, and the watchman took him up the next morning in the highway, with the sack upon him; he lives in the next place, he and another man rents it; I see the oats scattered out of my place, and on the wall and into their premises.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any other reason to suspect that he had them? - No, no other than tracking them into their place; the next morning he was going to market with the sack on him, and I gave charge of him to the watch man, as he was going to Covent-garden. They opened the sack at the watch-house, and there were several cats shaked out. The sack was one that I borrowed of this man, and when I put the oats in the sack, the oats burst out of the hole.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he keep oats in the sack? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any oats in it till you put the oats in it? - I don't know indeed. I am sure of the sack, because when I put my oats in it, the oats bursted out of two holes, and then I put same has in the holes, and put the oats in. I took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160160"></xptr>more notice of the sack not being mine than being mine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. The prisoner keeps a horse, does not he? - He did keep a horse.</p>
               <p>Q.Was not this place next to your place, a stable belonging to a friend of his, in which he kept his horse? - His is the same as mine, a coach house and rooms over it.</p>
               <p>Q. But he does not live there? - No, he does not.</p>


               <p>Q. Now be so kind as to tell us how this stable was connected with your's? - Mine is the corner place, and there is but one party wall, and that belongs to me; it is the only wall in the place.</p>
               <p>Q. Who desired you to say that this was your party wall? On your oath answer me, sir. - The party wall belongs to the place that rent. I don't know how to answer. I don't understand what I am to say.</p>

               <p>Q. You are to say the truth, because I will have it; and shall have it presently? - Nobody desired me to say nothing; nobody has told me to say any thing, but just to speak the truth, as I thought myself, to say what is right.</p>
               <p>Q. You must give me a positive answer? - No person has not indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you swear that positively. Then, sir, what are you? - I get my bread by selling things about the street, garden stuff.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you and he were old comrades? - No; he frequently used to go out a dusting. I kept his company no more than if we had a pint of beer, I always paid my share of it; I never went out with him to sell any things at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deal in oats as well as in greens? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you buy oats and sell them again? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Be kind enough to give me a desoription of this party wall; how it separates the other stables from your's; whether it is built up from the bottom to the top? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know that this stable of the prisoner's generally his the door left open in the day time? - I cannot say; I have seen it open, but not to say constantly.</p>
               <p>Q. When the horse is not there, the stable is left open? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, sir, was you ever told that there was a large sum of money in the case of a conviction for a burglary? - No, it is not that I have heard that, because they have offered me a horse and cart, and money besides, to make it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not, upon your oath, heard there is a reward of forty pounds? that would be a pretty fortune? - I have heard that. I cannot swear who told me that.</p>
               <p>Q. Who are the other witnesses on this trial? - John Wade, the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any patrol, or any constable besides? - There is the sergeant of the night.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of those was it told you about the forty pounds? - Never a one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it told you? - I don't know indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since you learnt this? - I don't know indeed. I did not do it for the sake of the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it been a week ago? - A long time ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, which of them was it? - Neither of them. If I was to say so I must tell a lie; they never advised me, good or bad.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, who pays the rent of this place in which you lodge? - I pay it myself, and have been there near on two years.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of connection has this stable with your house? - There are the rooms over the stable, the room that I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160161"></xptr>live in is over the stable, by the lost, and the coach house is joining the stable.</p>
               <p>Court. The wall that is broke you take as part of your premises? - Yes, I do; my landlord said that it belonged to me.</p>
               <p>Q. What may he the value of these oats you lost? - About five shillings, as near as I can guess.</p>

             came to me, and said he was robbed; he took me down to his place, together with the sergeant of the round, and shewed us the party wall broke, and there were oats scattered about the place. I took the prisoner into custody and the sack about half past four in the morning, and took him and the sack to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the sack on the prisoner? - Yes. It was taken from him in my presence, at the time that he was charged in the watch-house. I could not discover any thing in the sack.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I think you seem to be half and half now? - I don't know what you mean.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been in a public house? - I have been in a public house for a certainty.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since you and the last witness were talking all this over? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. It is very odd if he should recollect it and you not recollect it? - We have been talking about nothing further than wishing to be rid of it as fast as we could.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if the last witness has said that you and he were conversing about the evidence, he must have told a lie? - I cannot answer that.</p>
               <p>Q. I will tell you the story over again if you like it. - It is a thing I cannot answer; it is not in my power to answer it without telling a lie. If I was to say so it would be telling a lie. I know nothing in the world of what you are talking about.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what that man is indicted for? - He is indicted for stealing oats.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what the nature of the charge against him is? - I am no counsel.</p>
               <p>Q. You seem to keep your own counsel extremely strict. Do you know what this man is indicted for or not? - Yes, I know for what he is indicted, he is indicted, for oats.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, don't you know what the charged against him is? - He was charged for breaking the wall and stealing the oats.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the consequence of that charged - The consequence is just as the jury please to make it, I dare say.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, don't you know that you are to have a reward if this man is convicted? - Upon my oath, I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been a watchman? - As much as three years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean, sir, to repeat that you have been three years a watchman, and that you don't know of a reward of forty pounds on conviction for a burglary? - I don't know it; I have heard of such a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Who desired you to say, when you came into conrt to prosecute that man for his life, that you knew nothing of a forty pounds reward? - It is a thing I am quite ignorant of; I only give you a clear evidence, and that is all I can say to you. Upon my oath there was nobody desired me to say any thing more than I have said.</p>

               <p>Q. How long is it since you had this conversation with the last witness? - I don't know that ever we had any conversation.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if the last witness has said you had, has that man sworn true or false? - I think he must have sworn false, for I do not recollect I conversed with him in such a manner.</p>

               <p> I am lanthorn bearer to Mary le-bone watch-house. On the 16th of July the prisoner was brought in, about half past four in the morning, and the sack along with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing in it? - Some oats that shaked out on the table; the sack was spread on the watch-house floor, and Thomas Bishop said he could positively swear to that sack; in consequence of that I locked him up with the sack, and when I went to take him before the magistrate in Marlborough-street, about half after ten, the sack was gone; I asked the prisoner what he had done with the sack? he made no answer; I immediately told the magistrate that it must be certainly done by some of the parties that were with him in the morning. I never found it.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it ever been found by any body? - No further than one porter told me that this was the sack that he took away from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You locked the prisoner and sack up; where did you put the key? I generally hang them up; we have several different places, sometimes in the parlour, and sometimes in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you put the key that morning? - I cannot tell you.</p>
               <p>Q. You locked the sack up with the prisoner, and when you came back this wonderful sack, which contains all the magic in it, was gone? - I look upon it it was gone by his parties who came to see him; there is a hole where you can put a quart pot through.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you always as careless as you was that morning? - I have always taken care what I have to do.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you heard about this reward? - What reward?</p>
               <p>Q. Who desired that it should be made a burglary? - I know nothing about it, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if your two friends have said that you advised this prosecution as a burglary, they must have told what is false? - I don't know what they have said, I have said the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not an answer - If they have said that to be sure they have said what is false, but I suppose they have not said any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Who heard this conversation before the magistrate? - There were many people in the office, the same as there may be in this court.</p>

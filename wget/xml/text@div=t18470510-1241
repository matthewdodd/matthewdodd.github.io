                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRENDERGAST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> No account was given of this payment on the 19th of June? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—the next day the prisoner should have accounted was on the 3d of July—this sum of Mr. Ramsden's was not accounted for at all by him on that day—there was a resolution made but he reported nothing—I be<lb></lb>lieve he sent an account that he was ill—there is no report of his, and if he had attended I must have made it—the next meeting was on the 10th of July, he did not give any account of this sum from Mr. Ramsden then—he did not make any report of collecting that day—I conclude he did attend the Board—on the 17th of August he reported he had collected 54<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—no account was given at the Board of what amount was collected from each street, that was ascertained at a subsequent examination of the rate-book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At the time of giving in the account of 54<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. did he give any items? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; only the different streets in which it was colleted—I had almost invariably on a piece of paper the amounts of the different streets—those papers were never preserved after I entered the account on the minutes—the paper of that day is not produced—it was word for word and letter for letter the same as I have entered—here is my entry, 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., collected from the Road side—that is where Mr. Ramsden's is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you know that 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was not included in that? how did he make up that sum of 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.? can you point out of what it was composed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot—no account was given of it—he has not charged himself</p>

               <p>with that sum in the rate-book, and the subsequent collector found it was paid—I have gone through the prisoner's account, and find he had not charged himself with it—he has not put that sum in the paid column in the rate-book—he produced his own vouchers, and gave his own account of what he received at a Board held on the 19th of Feb., 1847—the minute is, "The collector re<lb></lb>ported that since the last Board 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. had been received from the Roadside, but not paid in; the collector not being prepared, the Board proceeded to examine the books by the various sums stated"—294<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. it appeared had been paid, and it appeared he had paid in a sum which left a deficiency of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRENDERGAST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You find that he had paid into the banker's 288<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and neither of these sums were included in it—I have been present at every meeting at which he professed to give an account—I have the account for the year 1845—the year 1846 has not been examined further than from his vouchers—it was taken from his vouchers in his presence, and that ought to have included sums—supposing he received these sums, it was his duty to tear off the receipt in this book of receipts, (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>,) and leave on the margin an account of it—his doing it in any other way would be considered irregular, and would excite suspicion—I can find no margins of the receipts of Mr. Archer and Mr. Ramsden—instead of leaving the margins, the whole of them must have been torn out—I have endeavoured to compare Mr. Archer's and Mr. Ramsden's receipts with the margins in the book—I find there are no margins corresponding with those receipts—the margins of various receipts were produced by the prisoner at our Board, and the account was taken from them—supposing the margins to be torn from the book, we had no other mode of finding what he had received except from accidental discovery—I have compared these receipts with all the margins he had produced.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COOPER</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you find Mr. Wentwoth's on one of these mar<lb></lb>gins? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I find it not to Christmas, but to Midsummer—I was present at the last meeting, when the prisoner was there—he said the time was very short, and he was not ready—the usual time for the audit meeting was some<lb></lb>time between Feb. and July—the time of the audit depends on the state of the collector's account—it is not at any particular time—the prisoner was in the room all the time his accounts were audited—I think about two hours—there was no other business going on during that time—he was on one side of the table, with his books—he said he wanted time, he was not ready—I have known him thirteen years—he has borne a high character—I have had respect for him, quite as much as any neighbouring tradesman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On his paying he did not go into the items of the dif<lb></lb>ferent accounts? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did not till lately, when suspicion was entertained that he was not doing right—the streets were stated, but not the individuals, so there was no account of the several items of which the account was com<lb></lb>posed till a very recent period—one of these sums is on the 25th of May, another on the 19th of June, and another on the 7th of August—on any of these occasions, or at the meetings closest to these, there were no item lists of the names of the persons—there was an account given of arrears at the ordinary meetings—he had the rate-book there every meeting—he could have been asked how he made up the sums for a street—if he paid over a larger sum than was in the book, he might have paid in these—I did not check the large book by the receipts—they were examined in my presence, by two or more of the commissioners, at each of the meetings which have taken place within the last six moths or so—in August last, and previous to that, no account was taken, except at the annual audit.</p>

               <p>sums we received from the prisoner are all accounted for by payments of which he gave an account—he gave an account of all the sums he pro<lb></lb>fessed to have received—they account for all the sums marked on the rate-✗ book, and no other—there is an account which can include these sums, and there is an account which does not include them—he has paid over no other sums than those entered in the rate-book—these checks and margins are in his possession from the time he gets the rate-book till he gives it up, having finished it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you tell me what sum was accounted for as received on the 5th of June, 1846? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> 192<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there were nine items included in that—so much for the Road side, and other places, but I have no account of the persons names—I only gather that from the rate-book—I find the rate-book has been made to tally with the sums he stated as received—he has made a minute of the sums he charged himself with.</p>

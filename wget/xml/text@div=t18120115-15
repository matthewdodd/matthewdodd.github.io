               <p>Q. Had you a pocket-book, with some bank-notes, about three months ago. - A. Yes. I had a ten-pound bank of England note, and three ones, that I am positive of. I believe the precise time was the 23d of July. I have recollected some circumstances since, and I am sure to the time. I had some money to pay away. I put it in my book before I went out. It happened so I did not pay it away.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had put these notes in your pocketbook, what did you do with your pocket-book. - A. I put it in my pocket. I did not pay it to the person I intended. I kept it in my pocket. I came home about a little after four. When I came home, I deposited the book in the parlour on the table. I left it there, I did not see it again for two days, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your parlour door open these two days. - A. I cannot answer that question. I do not know. I left it laying on the parlour table, and the notes in it.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150026"></xptr>When I had occasion to look into my pocket-book, I found the ten-pound note was missing, and the ones were left.</p>
               <p>Q. The ten-pound note was gone - how many ones remained. - A. Three ones.</p>
               <p>Q. What does your family consist of. - A. Myself and wife and three children.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the age of the eldest. - A. She is turned of 21 that is at home, the youngest is turned of 17. - When I examined the pocket-book, and missed the ten-pound note, I was very much confused, and did not know what to do; and knowing that the prisoner had robbed me many times before, suspicion fell on him.</p>
               <p>Q. You must not talk of what happened before, only this time. Did the prisoner live in your family then. - A. Yes, he is my apprentice.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any other apprentice who lives in your family. - A. No, I have mentioned the whole of my family living at home. I challenged the prisoner with it - he denied it. I have never seen the note since. I searched the prisoner. I found nothing of the note upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the note if you were to see it again. - A. Yes, I could swear to it, if I saw the note.</p>

On the 1st of August he brought me a ten-pound note, and said it was come from his aunt; he asked me to take care of it. I received it of him to take care of it; he made me to understand that his aunt sent it to him to buy clothes, a watch, and some other things he was in want of.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that given him the same day, or when. - A. On the 6th of December last, he gave me orders to put it down in a book; he laid out seven shillings and sixpence for a chain and seal - that was the day I bought the watch, the 3d of August.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pay any more money by direction of the prisoner - A. Another pound to another young man, on the 8th of November.</p>
               <p>Q. What has become of the rest of the money. - A. The prisoner had three shillings for his pocket; he asked me for it to spend; eighteen pence more he had for the repairing his watch.</p>

He said he took the ten pound note out of his master's pocket-book; he gave it to Mr. Carron - that he had some trifle out of it - that he had a watch, it stopped, and he gave it back to Mr. Carron.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord, I hope you will consider my unfortunate case; I was drawed into it by Mr. Carron, and one of the witnesses against me; that man took the ten-pound note. I had no more than two shillings of it, and he has got 9 l. 18 s. of it, which is the property of my unfortunate master. He bought me a watch, it stopped, I returned it to him. I have never seen it since. The witness Carron keeps a room to harbour boys and girls in, and encouraged me into my offence. I hope your lordship will let me go to sea, and serve his Majesty, that I might get rid of all my bad connections.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any communication between the two houses in Maidenhead-court and this house? - A. No communication in the upper part.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He has swore my hands were dirty, they were as clean as they are now.</p>

               <p>I went with the last witness, on Saturday the 16th of April, to the house of the prisoner; it enters by a passage, there is a compting house on the left hand side, where he appeared to carry on the business of a candlestick or sender-maker; when the children cried out, he came up; we said, we had a warrant to search; on going down into the cellar, there was a forge and a pair of bellows, a body of a tea-kettle, and pieces of copper that might be converted into senders, or many other things; we asked him, have you not another cellar? he said, he had not; I said, I know you have; I turned round, and going a little beyond the stair-case, I saw a wooden door, I pulled it open; Lawrence was gone up, upon hearing a noise; I said, bring me a light; I went into that cellar, and found a stamping-press, with the dies fixed by the side of them, a pair of plain dies which are here, these halfpence (producing them), which are struck, and this halfpenny I took from between the dies, Mr. Stribblehill being present the whole time; some farthings by the side of the press, they are struck; I believe some of the officers have the dies belonging to them; there was a binn, where there was a quantity of saw-dust, but I did not search that, that was in the shop where his manufactory was carried on; the prisoners were secured, and on the Monday, when they were examined before the Alderman, Striblehill said, he had let the place to Haynes; Haynes said, he did not; the halfpence bare the date of 1762, I believe the dies correspond; Stribblehill had his sleeves tucked up, and trowsers on; I did not observe his hands; he went with us without any words, and nothing further passed; the fly appeared recently to have been at work, by the oil running down the worm; there was a trap-door and a ladder that communicated with the court; (the press and fly were produced); it is fed by one person sitting on the stool, and two persons pull the fly, it being fixed in the earth, and the dies are so fixed, that it makes no jar, and the people in the house cannot hear any body at work.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe the hands of the women? - A. I did not.</p>

               <p>I produce some dies, and what I found in the garret; I went, in company with Armstrong and Lawrence, into the cellar; I came up and went into the garret, and found a cutting-press fixed, and a quantity of blanks of farthings and halfpence, a rounding-engine, some cecil, some brimstone, two trounsing-sacks, and some saw-dust, and a bell-metal put that they use with brimstone, and liquid to make them black; I then helped and got them all down; (the cutting-press produced); the cecil is what the blanks are cut from, (producing it); it was close to the press; these bits of cecil were lying round it; they were in the garret of Stribblehill's dwelling-house; after taking them all down, and getting them into the passage, I went down again into the first cellar, and found a bin of saw-dust; I put my hand into the saw-dust, and found five dies, one with the head of a farthing, the others for halfpence and silver; these two (producing them), are for the silver; there was a tub in the room, and some liquid in it, and some sieves; there was every thing complete; there was some very dirty sawdust in the garret; this is one of the trounsingsacks; it is very black; they are put in and worked backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>Armstrong. The cutting-out press cuts them out first, before they receive the impression; what remains when they are cut out is called cecil; the rounding instrument rounds the edges, and puts a bevel on them; I don't know whether they round them before they stamp them or after.</p>
               <p>(The halfpence that were struck, and the farthings that were blacked shewn to the Jury.)</p>
               <p>Armstrong. They are blacked for the purpose of circulation, that they should not appear fresh.</p>

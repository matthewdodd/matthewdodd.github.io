             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am a constable of the parish of St. Pancras: On the 23d of April, about six in the morning, I stopped the prisoners Kennedy and M'Cormack at Kentish-town; M'Cormack had a bag, and Kennedy had a bit of a blue apron on; the bag appeared to be full, and so did the apron; I had a brother officer with me, and we stopped them; I asked them what they had got, and they said, a man had hired them beyond Highgate to carry them on the road to London, and he was to overtake them at Camden-town; in the bag we found two sheep cut asunder, and two quarters in the apron, there were altogether three whole sheep; we took them back towards Highgate; we took them into the Angel at Highgate, and there Kennedy voluntarily told us to go to a new house upon Finchley Common, beyond the Baldfaced Stag, and he said we should find a man in the house with one carcass of a sheep left behind; he said, they were killed in the night at the back of the house, but he did not say in doors or out; M'Cormack heard Kennedy say this, but did not speak a word; we then got the constable of Highgate, and went with him to the house that Kennedy had described, it was Jones's house; we searched it, and found four heads, four skins, and a carcass of a sheep under the bolster of the bed; the skins were in a bureau bedshead, in the same room where the prisoner Jones was sitting in the corner by the fire, and we brought him away. (Produces the skins).</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I was with Whitsey when he stopped the prisoners at Kentish Town; Kennedy told us if we went to Finchley Common to a house that he described, we should find a whole carcass; he said they had killed four altogether; I went to Jones's house, according to the description of Kennedy, and we found it exactly as he had said; there were four skins, four heads, and a carcass; we found Jones in the same room with the skins, there were three of us; I searched and found these things after the prisoner Jones was taken.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Kennedy. Before I told him where the sheep were, he said he would procure me a pardon if I did.</p>
               <p>Brasier. I told him he had better tell where they were.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Did you tell him you thought he might be forgiven? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CLARKE sworn. - I am the owner of the house in which these things were found. between the Baldfaced Stag and Brown's Well; I had been building two houses; Jones was a labouring man, he slept in the house to protect the premises; there was no other person in charge of the house but him.</p>
               <p>JOHN CLARIDGE sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am a farmer at Finchley; I had sheep grazing upon Finchley Common: I missed four sheep on the morning of the 23d of April, I saw the skins again the same morning; I had seen the sheep the evening before.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at these skins? - A.They are all marked F C, and F C upon the horns also; I am certain these are the skins and horns of my sheep.</p>
               <p>Kennedy's defence. M'Cormack desired me to go with him to get some mutton; being hungry, I went with him to Jones's, and Jones gave us the mutton; I saw the skins upon the floor, and he told me it was his own property; as we were coming home, these constables took us, and I told them where I got it.</p>
               <p>Jones's defence. These men called me up, and M'Cormack told me he would give me two shillings if I would kill four sheep for them, which I did; Kennedy brought them in with his own hands.</p>
               <p>M'Cormack's defence. I am a plasterer by trade; Jones desired me to go down on Thursday morning to fetch some meat, and to bring another man with me, and I took this man; I told Jones that it was dangerous for us to carry them, if he was sure they were not his own, and he said they were his own.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Kennedy called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

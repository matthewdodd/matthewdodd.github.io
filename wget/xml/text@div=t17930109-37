Proceed. - Between the hours of three and five in the afternoon, the prisoner at the bar came and offered me some lace to pledge; from the number of yards I supposed it might not be her property. I asked her whose it was; she said it was the property of some person who was in distress, without saying whom; afterwards there was some words passed between us and she said I might send for an officer; I told her I thought it was not her property, and I would send for an officer; an officer came, and she was taken to the office and committed for re-examination. I have had the lace in my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179301090057"></xptr>possession ever since it was shewn to the prosecutor at the office.</p>

            . The lace was in the shop on the 13th of December, Thursday; we counted the laces on that day, both in the shop and in the warehouse, and they appeared to be perfectly right then; so that that lace was in our possession the 13th of December; they were right by comparing them with the books. I know the pattern exceeding well; I do not recollect the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that when you counted all the laces, you can tell that that piece was there with that quantity? - I can swear that the lace was right that day; we had such a pattern in the house that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say that you had a piece of lace of that identical size on that card? - The quantity was seventy-two yards and a half. We do not examine the quantity of the yards; we only count the number of the cards; we count them once a week; the card is marked 1850. We never look at the patterns; nor do we particularly look at the numbers; we had lace of that number on the card; on that day I examined them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you, as you look through the book, examine the lace and see that your laces correspond to the numbers in the book? - We do; and further I can say, this lace never was sold; we never sell a card-lace out of our shop. Whenever we sell a card-lace we always cut the number and ticket off, and we know it is not sold by our wholesale books.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I believe you told us a little while ago, that when you are running over the laces, you do not attend to the patterns? - We do not.</p>
               <p>Q It was the 13th of December when the laces were counted over; and it certainly must be there, or it would not be put down in the book. - I only know by this, that if it had not been there, then we should have found one card short. I counted them; and another young man in the shop, he counts the shop and I count the warehouse. I took the numbers that he counted on a piece of paper.</p>
               <p>Q. But whether he counted them right or not must depend on him? - I took the account as he gave it me.</p>
               <p>Q. You relied on him to be correct? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And he is not here? - He is not.</p>
               <p>Q. He counted the cards in the shop; and you counted the cards in the warehouse? - I took the account from him of the quantity that he had counted.</p>
               <p>Q. He took the shop laces; therefore he was the man that knew whether the shop laces were right or not? - There is no doubt but what he counted them right.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this a shop lace or a warehouse lace? - It had been in the shop a week; I recollect this very card in the shop; I recollect the pattern being there. I do not say that I recollect this pattern that day; but I recollect having seen both pattern and card in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you say the card again; you said before you did not look at the pattern or number, but only go by the tale? - We do.</p>
               <p>Court to Flint. How do you know this lace to be your's? - I know it by several things; first of all here is the mark 1850; and here is another number, 9525, both of which has a reference to my book; the one has a reference to the man's bills of parcels of whom I bought it of, No. 9525, and 1850 refers to my piece account; I have the bills of parcels and the book.</p>
               <p>Q. Who keeps that book? - This young man and another and my wife. We enter every card of lace by the number;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179301090058"></xptr>and we enter our own number likewise; we put down the quantity of yards we put the cost mark, and we put the selling mark. If they should happen to tally, if they answer to the quantity that this book warrants them to be, they are past over as right. If there should be any missing, it is wrote down missing such a day; that book contains the warehouse account and the shop account; there is no separate account.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether the account taken in the shop and the account taken in the warehouse are taken by different people? - They cannot but be taken by different people, because one person cannot take them alone.</p>
               <p>Q. May not the warehouse account be taken by one man, and the shop account by another? - No; because one calls the lace, and the other checks the book against it.</p>
               <p>Q. Why have you not brought the other persons? - I could not spare the time that I have lost already.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you another young man that took the account with this witness? - I have; but I can tell that the account was past on the 13th and found right. I can swear to that; and he can swear the same if he swears the truth; we never sell a card of lace with the marks on it; the number is always cut off and put into a drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you are not in the habit of selling; nor never do sell a card of lace in the shop with the numbers on; but might not this have been sold to a wholesale customer? - Had this been sold to a wholesale customer, the No. 1850, the quantity of yards and the private marks would have been in the wholesale book.</p>
               <p>Q. As to the number 9525, what do you know by that? - My Lord, there is the numbers, there is the quantity, and there is the prices, all in plain figures, as plain as an A,

               </p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. These cards, when you sell to an wholesale customer, are entered in an wholesale book; and that book is not here? - It is not here; we must be very hardy to come here and affront you.</p>
               <p>Court to Smith. With regard to the shop laces, how were the business carried on between you and the other young man, on the 13th of December? - We counted them on a piece of paper, the young man counted in the shop, and I in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Your master said it was done different? - It was taken by two, one counted and the other checked the book.</p>
               <p>Mr. Flint. Give me leave to explain.</p>
               <p>Court. You swore positively and decidedly how it was done; your servant has explained it to be done in a different manner, and now you want to make general observations upon it, the Court will not endure it. I do not mean to impute to you or the servant; but if the accounts do not exactly tally, it is our duty to see whether they exactly tally or not, servants do not at all times do as their master orders them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses who gave her an exceeding good character, particularly her master whom she lived with at the time, at Old Ford, when this affair happened.</p>

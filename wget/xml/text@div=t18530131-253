I went with wagon No. 174, containing ninety-eight bags of nuts, from Camden-town station to Messrs, Keeling and Hunt's—on arriving there, the prisoner came to the back of the wagon, and took a bag of nuts as I handed the bags out—I did not know him before, but thought he was a servant of Keeling and Hunt—I unloaded ninety-eight bags, including the one that he took; there were other men taking them—when I came to get my receipt ticket from Keeling and Hunt, they signed for ninety-seven bags only—my van was drawn up at the Pudding-lane entrance—I had never been there before—I could not see that there was a way through to Monument-yard—there are two steps at the Pudding-lane entrance.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the book-carriers to Messrs. Chaplin and Horne; I accompany the wagon when it goes to deliver things. On 18th Jan. I was with van No. 123, which went from Camden-town to Keeling and Hunt's with ninety bags of nuts—I arrived there about half past 5 o'clock; that was before Jones came—I delivered my cargo; there were different men to carry them up the steps—on presenting my way-bill to Keeling; and Hunt for signature, I got a receipt for eighty-nine bags only—I had counted ninety bags as they went from the wagon—about half past 6 o'clock the same evening my fellow Wagoner arrived with wagon No. 174—I waited about to see, if I could, how I had lost the bag—I saw part of his load delivered, and saw the prisoner there smoking a cigar alongside the wagon—I watched him, and saw him <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> away his cigar under the wagon; he turned his beck to the wagon tail, and Jones delivered a bag of nuts to him on his back—he turned towards the stairs with it, but instead of going up into the warehouse he went through, and <hi rend="italic">bolted</hi> right across Monument-yard into Fish-street-hill, and then into Thames-street—I followed close behind him, and as soon as he got into Thames-street he hallooed out, "<hi rend="italic">Bob!</hi>" twice, but no. <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi> appeared; he said, "I am wrong," and I collared him directly and held him—he flung me down on my back, but I never let loose of him till I gave him in charge—he had the nuts on his back, and after I collared him he dropped, them on the pavement and burst the bag—he begged of me not to tear his clothes—I had not noticed the prisoner while I was unloading my van.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How near were you to the man, who you say was the prisoner, when he was going off with the bag of nuts? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Close to his heels; I did not catch him, because I wanted to see where the other bag of nuts was gone—I am quite sure I never lost sight of him from the time he left the cart till ho dropped the nuts on the pavement—I am quite sure the prisoner did not come out of a public house with some other man—I did not hear him say he came out of the public house and stumbled over the nuts; I collared him with them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Keeling and Hunt, fruit brokers in a large way of business in Pudding-lane.

               <p>our warehouse to Monument-yard quite as well as the way up to our warehouse if he had been going there—you can go by the steps along the passage, and instead of going up to the warehouse you can shoot through into Monument-yard—there is a ladder leading to the warehouse, and a person so inclined might go through to Monument-yard instead of going up the step—the carman would see him going up the steps, but would not see him further.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi>, Did you examine the nuts? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, at the Mansion-house—there was about two bushels—they were worth about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at the least—they were Turkey filberts—since then we have sold some at 55<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which makes them worth more than that—there is a coffee house there, called Francis's, the Sun, and from what I have heard, I think the nuts must have been dropped at the door of that coffee house.</p>

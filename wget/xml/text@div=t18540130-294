On Thursday, 29th Dec., after 1 o'clock in the morning, I went to bed—I and my wife were the last persons up—we only had to go out of the drawing-room into the bed-room on the same floor—I am sure the shop window was shut down, and I believe it was fastened—I came down in the morning about 10 o'clock, and missed forty-eight agate stones, eight scent bottles, two sets of dentist's instruments, six surgical saws, twelve swivels, a bracelet, a necklace, and a cash, box, which I had seen safe during the day before—I saw marks of corduroy trowsers in the snow outside the shop window, and there were footmarks in the snow on the wall which leads from Little Russell-street—there were some repairs being done in Little Russell-street, and some planks were placed against the wall, which would enable persons to get up—my servant, who was the first person up, is not here, nor is my wife.</p>

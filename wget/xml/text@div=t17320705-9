               <p>John Willoughby. I pick'd up Walker in Fleet-street about 10 a Clock o' Sunday Night, and went with her to her Room in <placeName id="t17320705-9-crimeloc59">Hanging Sword-Alley</placeName>

The other brought up a Flask and a Glass; I stay'd 1/4 of an Hour, and then was for going; but Walker said, I should lie with her first. I said, I would not. Then said Bishop, If you won't lie with her. you shall with me; and so she flung her Arms round my Neck, and fell a buffing on me like any thing. Then Nill Walker unbutton'd my Breeches, and took hold of what I had, and held it hard with one Hand. While she pick'd my Pocket with t'other. I cried out, and then she let go her Hold below, and clapt that Hand to my Mouth, and the other Hand she reach'd out to Bishop who presently went away. Then says Nell, what does he make a Noise for, I have got but 2 Pence, and that's for the Maid. I went toward the Door, and presently the Landlady came to me, and swore at me, and bid me go about my Business. There were 2 men going by the Door, who help'd me to a Constable, and we found one of the Prisoners about 2 a Clock o' Sunday Morning, and the other about 3; and on Monday they were carried before the Justice, and then they said they had but 8 Pence from me, but I lost 3 Pounds.</p>

            . This Fellow came by my Door, and forced me in to drink a Dram; he said he had but 14 d. about him, but if I would trust to his Honour, and oblige him, he would call again, and give me half a Crown. I told him, I never did such things upon Trust, for it was my way to deal with none but Gentlemen that could make me a-handsome Present. Then he would have had Bishop to have Pawn'd his Waistcoat ; but she told him it was worth nothing. And as I'm a Christian, we got no more out of him than 2 Groats, tho' he swears he lost 3 l. But he's an Irishman, God bless him; I consider his Country, and know he will swear any thing. I was forc'd to go to the Ale-house to borrow 6 d. to give him, before he would trust me with his Shilling. He told us he liv'd in Play-House-Yard in Drury-Lane.

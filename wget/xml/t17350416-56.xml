             carried me there to drink. I took out my Pouch to pour the Money on the Table to pay the Reckoning when the Prisoner knocked it all off, except one Guinea that fell on the Table, which I catch'd, and took my Pouch off the Ground with one more Guinea in it; but Taylor knocked me backwards, and I saw the Prisoner pick up one Guinea and run out; and Taylor picked up some, and clapt his Back to the Door that I should not go out. The Prisoner came in again, I told him I hoped he would return me my Money. Te Rascalty Dog, says he, I'll skin ye alive if you say that I have got your Money. I got away; and next Day I took out a Warrant against the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The Prosecutor came to my House with Taylor, and offered to sell me some Run Brandy. They had two or three Bowls of Punch; But while they staid I was pretty much above Stairs attending other Company; and they went away without paying the Reckoning.  Next Morning the Prosecutor came with two Black-shoe Boys, and asked me if he had left any Money with me. I told him he was so far from leaving any that he did not pay his Reckoning. Some Words arising upon this, he said he'd swear a Robbery against me, and went away. On Friday I heard Mr. Hastings had got a Warrant against me, upon which I voluntarily surrendered my self.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner called several Witnesses to prove these Allegations, and others who gave him the Character of a very honest Man.</p>

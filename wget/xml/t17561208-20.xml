            . I was the officer. I was going to serve a warrant in Church-Street, and met the prosecutrix and Lynch together. She told me she had been rob'd of her hat, and a cuff of her gown, and told me where. We turned back, and saw this Davis, and another girl, with a basket of oysters. She said Davis was one that had robbed her. I took hold on her, and the other made off directly. I took her to the watch-house. She was very stubborn, and threaten'd she would stab the woman if she was sent to gaol. I said there were three or four more with her, and if she would tell who took the hat it might be the better for her. She told us of two more, and we took them up by her direction; but when they came the prosecutrix cleared them. Then Davis said she took the hat, and tossed it to Harding; so Harding was taken up.</p>

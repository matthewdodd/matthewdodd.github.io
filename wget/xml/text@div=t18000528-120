               <p>Q. Did these duplicates lead to the discovery of the property? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You are not a married man, I suppose? - A. Why do you ask that question?</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a married man? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you live with your wife now? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the prisoner live with you or your wife? - A. With me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that prisoner ever live with you, when you and your wife lived together? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you ceased to live with your wife? - A. Ever since the 28th of March.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave your wife, or your wife leave you? - A. She left me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not leave you in consequence of a complaint that she made, respecting you and the prisoner at the bar? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you continue to live in the same place? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner continued to live with you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the keys of your drawers after your wife left you? - A. The keys of the drawers, that contained the linen, the servant had, or at least knew where they were, they were placed in the drawer of the dressing-glass.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not give them to her, and desire her to take care of your household affairs? - A. I must desire those questions may be separated, because they are distinct.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, upon your oath, did you, or did you not desire the prisoner to take the management of your household affairs upon herself? - A. Yes, of course, as I had no other person in the house; I kept her for that purpose to take care of my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not tell her she should be mistress of all you had? - A. No, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the landlord of the house attending here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where your wife lives now? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Has your wife made any complaint to you, since she left you, with respect to your conduct towards the prisoner? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Neither directly, nor indirectly? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear, that you did not tell the prisoner, that if she would live with you, and be as a wife to you, that she should have the possession, and be mistress of all you had got? - A. If it were not for the respect I owe this Court, I would not answer so insolent and impertinent a question, but as I owe that respect to the Court, I say, no; it it is a fabricated circumstance worthy of such a pleader as yourself.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't be rude, sir, I stand here to do my duty, and I will do it - I ask you, did you not tell the prisoner, that if she would live with you as a wife, she should be mistress of all you had got? - A. No, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, have you not cohabited with her? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. For what did your wife leave you? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. And she never told you why? - A. She never did.</p>
               <p>Q. And that you mean to swear? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Where does your wife live now? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath? - A. I do not; I have heard where she has been seen, but never heard where she resided.</p>
               <p>Q. Does any other servant reside in the house? - A. No; there was one.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not give the prisoner the keys, and the entire dominion of your affairs? - A. No, she only had one key, and that was of the linen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not dine at table with you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who desired you to take her into custody? - A. Nobody, it was upon information.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not upon the advice of somebody against your own inclination? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to the Shadwell Office; I apprehended the prisoner, in company with the prosecutor; he gave me charge of her, and in her possession I found a number of duplicates, (produces them;) here are sixteen that match with Mr. Windsor's, they were examined and found to correspond, before the Magistrate; here are three that relate to the articles pledged at Mr. Mashiter's and Mr. Dickman's, which correspond exactly; I also found a teaspoon in her pocket, when I searched her in the presence of her master, which is not in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say at the time? - A. She said she had certainly made away with them, and gave up the duplicates in the presence of her master, and there was nothing more said.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What conversation had you with her before she made these observations? - A. I made use of no promises or threats, I know better; she said she had done so, she had made away with the property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say she had done it at the request of her master? - A. She did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing like it? - A. She did not.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did she say she was either the wife or the kept-mistress of Mr. Waterman? - A. Neither.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. He often desired me to buy articles for the house without giving me money, and I could not buy them without money; I was obliged to pledge some things to get money, and he owed me a quarter's wages, and denied paying me, because I wanted to go away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the landlord of the Duchess of Clarence public-house, Vauxhall-bridge-road—the prisoner was in my service—he left on 8th June, 1858—on the morning of the 12th I found my house broken into—that is the transaction which we are now inquiring into—I heard a noise, and my wife called my attention to it—I ran down stairs and saw the prisoner in the bar—it was about 3 o'clock in the morning; quite daylight—I endeavoured to seize him, but he ran away through opening the bolt of the door at the bottom, and I never saw him again till two or three days ago, when I saw him custody—I was the last up that night—my house was all safe—I went to bed about one o'clock—the place had been entered, by pulling the shutter and bar window down—the window had been opened; not forced—they were closed when I went to bed—I missed about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which had been left all safe—I am quite sure the prisoner is the person.</p>

               <p>some money from the till at such a time—he said, "I had enlisted for a soldier at that time"—he said nothing else—I did not, at that time, know when he had enlisted—I communicated to the adjutant—I told the adjutant that I was not sure, but I thought it was May, 1859—I was not exact as to the year—the adjutant told me he had joined the regiment in 1859—this was in the prisoner's presence—it was in consequence of some other inquiry, that I got information about the prisoner.</p>

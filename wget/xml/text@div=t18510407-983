                  </hi>. I am foreman to my mother, Rebeeca Kelsey, who has a trimming-factory at Nicholl's-row, Shoreditch. On 1st March, about a quarter-past one o'clock, I missed some silk from the workshop, and in consequence of information went with Hill to the pri<lb></lb>soner's house, 10, New Nicholl-street, about 100 yards from my mother's—it was nearly two o'clock then—I went in, and asked the prisoner if he had bought any bobbins of silk—he did not make any reply, and I asked him if he had bought any of two men—he said, "Of two men?" and then went to the door, and said they had just gone down the street—I opened the door—Hill came in, and the prisoner pointed out some silk on the counter—it is a very small shop, and he sells silk and cotton—he said he had paid at the rate of 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pound for it—it is worth from 36<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 42<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and we do not sell it in that state, but manufacture it into trimmings—there were these forty-eight bobbins (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) about a pound and a half—two sets of bobbins are marked with the letter "K" which is our private mark, and the other set "B. L." for Beal-lane, the silk-warehouse we have our goods from—it was no: till after the prisoner saw the constable that he said he had bought them—I gave him in charge.</p>

I went with Mr. Kelsey to the prisoner's shop, and found this silk in the scales on the counter—the pri<lb></lb>soner was inside the counter—the prosecutor said it was his silk—I asked the prisoner if he was aware it was stolen—he said he was not—I asked how he came by it, and he said, "I purchased it of two men who came in here"—I asked him if he knew them, and he said, "No; I do not, but I have often seen them, and I think I shall be able to find them in the course of half an hour, or an hour"—I said, "Have you their address; or know where they live?"—he said, "No"—I told the prosecutor to take out the silk belonging to him—he did so, and I counted forty-eight bobbins—to the best of my recollection the prisoner said he knew one of the men by the name of <hi rend="italic">Charley,</hi> but did not know where to find him, but might be</p>

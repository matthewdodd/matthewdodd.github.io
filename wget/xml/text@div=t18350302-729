                  </hi>. On Tuesday, the 17th of February, I went to Mr. Bryant's livery stables, in the Haymarket, in a carriage—I ordered a pair of fresh horses to Shooter's-hill—they were brought out—I asked what they would be—they said, "Eighteen shillings," which I paid to a person in the office, and stated that I should probably return, as I was going as far as Northfleet, and would he allow me to work back at half price—he said, "Certainly"—the prisoner drove me to Shooter's-hill—I told him I was going to work back, as I was going to Northfleet—he said, "You may as well let me take you on to Dartford, which is only six miles far<lb></lb>ther, and the road is good"—he drove me to Dartford, and I said, "What more have I to give you now?"—he said, "Nine shillings"—I had not much silver, and I gave him a half-sovereign—when I returned to Dart-ford, I found the chaise ready, and the prisoner brought me back to town—I then said, "I have paid you 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the half of that will be 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.

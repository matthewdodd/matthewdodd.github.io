                  </hi>. I live in Old Rochester-row. I have a daughter named Mary Ann—she will be eleven years old on the 6th of next April—I have known the prisoner twenty years—he kept a shop in the same row where we live, and he has been my landlord for the last seven years—on Monday, before the 6th of December, I owed him 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. rent—he called on me that day, and I paid him a week's rent—I think it was between ten and eleven o'clock—after I had paid him, he said, "Now, Mrs. Howell, you were speak<lb></lb>ing of a place for your little boy, I have not heard of a place for him, but I think I have heard of one for your daughter"—I said, "Oh dear me, I think she is too young"—he said, "Oh dear, no, she is quite old enough for what I want her for"—he said it was only to go with a lady to Southampton for a month or six weeks, that the lady was ill, and had got a little baby, and all my little girl would have to do, was to nurse the baby, and go on errands—I said I knew she was capable of doing that, and she would be good to the child, for she was fond of children—on Monday the 6th, the prisoner came for his rent—I paid him—he said, after I paid him, "Now, Mrs. Howell, concerning your little girl, the lady will come this afternoon about half-past three, and make arrangements with you about her"—I said, "Very well, I will make her ready"—I told my husband that the lady was coming, and he said he had no objection—the prisoner said he would be down with the lady about half-past three—the prisoner came about half-past three or a quarter to four—it rained very hard—he came in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he sat down, and did not speak for a minute or two—I said, "Is the lady coming?"—he said, "Oh dear, no, the lady is so ill, and the weather is so wet, she was afraid to come out, but I am going to take your little girl with me now"—I said, "Oh dear me, I was not aware you were going to take her away to-day, I have not any thing ready for the child"—he said he thought he spoke plain enough in the morning—I said, "Yes, you did, but I thought the lady was coming to see the child, and to make some arrangements with me"—my husband and I both told him we did not require any wages for her—my husband was at home the second time the prisoner called, in the afternoon—the prisoner told me not to mind about her clothes, she would have plenty of clothes where she was going—she went away in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with the prisoner—on the Tuesday following the prisoner's grandson called on me, in consequence of which, I went to Mrs. Hopkins's, the prisoner's wife, and then I gave information to the officer—on the Wednesday, the next day, I received this letter, in my daughter's handwriting—on the afternoon of the following Friday I saw the prisoner again—he brought my daughter home—there was a fe<lb></lb>male with him, who I did not know—they came in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—directly my daughter saw me she ran up to me, and begged me not to let her go back with Mr. Hopkins, he had used her shamefully—he was in the passage, within hearing—he said, "I have brought your daughter back safe"—I asked him where he had had ray child, and told him I would not let him go till I knew where the child had been—he said, I had nothing more to do with him, he had brought my child home safe, and he went and got into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I went after him, and got into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—the woman was in there too—the prisoner pushed me out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—the female that came</p>

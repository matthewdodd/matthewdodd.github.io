                  </hi>. I am errand boy to John Boulting, and live in Union-street, Middlesex-hospital. On the 1st of Aug. I was going up Broad-street, towards Oxford-street—I met two young men, one wore a flannel jacket, and the other a black coat—I knew the one with a flannel jacket—he came up to me, said, "How are you," and put his hand in my waistcoat pocket, where I had one shilling and a penny—I put my hand in my pocket, and told him to take his hand out—I went on, and met with the prisoner talking to a boy—the prisoner came to me and said, "You saw me talking to that boy"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "I had a fight with him, and he says his mother will take out a warrant for me"—I said, "Very well"—he said, "Look at my black eye and torn shirt, that was done with the fight"—he then laid hold of me, and showed me how he wrestled with the boy—he put his leg under me, and mauled me about—he said he should go down the back <hi rend="italic">slums</hi>, and look for his father—I felt, and missed my money—I ran through the posts after him—I met a policeman, and told him—he saw the prisoner going into a house with the other two that I had seen at first—there was a girl standing outside the door, they spoke to her, and all three rushed in—there was no money found—when we got in he had his jacket off and his silk handkerchief—he dropped the handkerchief as he was going to the station.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> You said, "You have been changing your clothes; that is the boy, he has a black eye." You said I took the shilling out of your pocket. It is quite false; it is no such a thing.</p>

I having no customer in the shop, went backwards into the parlour, and left nobody in the shop: soon after that, I heard the till make a noise; I went into the shop, and saw the prisoner coming from behind the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you shut the shop door when you went into the parlour?</p>
               <p>Theircher. It was shut: the prisoner was just turning round the counter as I came in, from towards the till, which is behind the counter, I went behind the counter, and found the till drawer pulled quite open. I looked, and saw I had lost two half guineas and a guinea; I went to the street door, and desired a neighbour to follow the boy, saying he had robbed my till.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the person you saw in your shop?</p>
               <p>Theircher. I am very sure he is: he had a blue coat on, and a handkerchief about his neck; he was taken immediately, and brought back to my shop. I charged him with robbing me: he said he had never robbed any body. I said he had robbed me: he had half a guinea in his mouth, another half guinea in one pocket, and a guinea in another pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you promise to let him go, if he would give up the money?</p>
               <p>Theircher. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen the money before?</p>
               <p>Theircher. I had seen it but a very few minutes before in the till.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your shop a part of your dwelling-house?</p>
               <p>Theircher. It is.</p>

            . As I was coming home, opposite to the prosecutor's house, I went over; there was the prisoner; they said he had robbed Mrs. Theircher of two guineas. He said, if she would forgive him, he would give her the money. One there, put his finger in his mouth, and took out half a guinea: she said, there is half a guinea more: he put his hand in his pocket, and took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176501160008"></xptr> that out: she said he had a guinea likewise; that also he took out of his pocket: we took the prisoner in a coach to the justice; there were two young fellows followed the coach all the way, which I suspected belonged to the prisoner: when before the justice, he said, if he would admit him an evidence, he would impeach his gang: he owned there he took the money out of the till; he said the men who followed the coach, one was named Dragon, and the other Downs, and they were of the gang; but they had taken care to get away.</p>

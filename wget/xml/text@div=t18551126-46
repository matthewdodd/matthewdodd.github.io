I heard a coping stone fall—I looked up. and saw Ward going along the gutter with a piece of lead in his hand—I am quite sure it was him—I saw him about ten minutes afterwards, coming out of the gateway of the warehouse, wiping the sweat off him—I had seen Reddington come out of the same gateway—Ward went across to the public house.</p>

               <p>father in Silver-street—the prisoners were in our service. On 6th Nov. I was on the premises, at the corner of Bread-street-hill, Upper Thames-street—I saw some labourers who did not appear to be doing their work—I went round to the foundation, and saw Reddington running up stairs at a much more rapid pace than I ever saw him before—I called him, he did not answer—he ran up to the roof—I did not see him on the roof—he must have heard me call him—I remember about a coping stone failing—I afterwards spoke to Reddington—I asked him what he went up to the roof of the house for—he said to look for Ward—I said, "What business had you to go up stairs? here was your business, down here"—my men had no right to take lead from the adjoining houses.</p>

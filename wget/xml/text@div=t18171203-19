On the 7th of November, about ten o'clock at night, nearly a dozen people were assembled to see a sham-fight between the prisoners-they were not stripped; Caton said, "I will fight to-morrow;" when Connolly said, "let us have it out now." I desired them to go home, and not collect a mob in the street. Connolly asked me what I wanted - I said I wanted them to go home. I left them, went round my beat, and returned in about a quarter of an hour, found them still quarrelling, and the crowd round them. Connolly said, "

            , what do you want here?" I said I wanted to disperse them. He said he would go home when he liked. A girl, who was with him, said she would go home when she liked. I said, if they did not go home I would take them in charge for being disorderly. He used vulgar expressions. I went to lay hold of him; the girl came before us to prevent me; he squared at me with his fist, and desired me not to strike the girl - I said I would not. I seized him with my left hand, and collared him by his neck handkerchief - I had my lanthorn on my right arm, and a rattle in my hand, which I sprang. Caton came, pushed himself before us, and shoved us, to make me let go. I sprang my rattle as hard as I could. In a short time he got a knife-both his hands were up to his neck, as I thought, to disengage my hand from him. I felt him cutting my fingers with a knife; I screamed out, Murder! and that he had cut me with a knife. Caton said,"He has no knife" - I said I saw it in his hand. I took my hand from his collar, being afraid; he struck me on the nose and ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a knife was it - A. A clasp knife. Caton ran after him. I got surgical assistance at the watchhouse. My fingers bled very much, and my nose bled for two days. I gave information, and they were taken about five nights after.</p>
               <p>MR. JOSEPH BURGESS. I am the workhouse apothecary. Two days after this took place, the prosecutor applied to me; a piece had evidently been cut from the fourth finger of his left hand - I saw him several times. It is in a fair way of doing well.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL ROBERTS. I am the constable of the night. The prisoners were brought to the watch-house on the 14th. I found a knife on Connolly.</p>

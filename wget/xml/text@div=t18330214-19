On the 5th of February, from ten to eleven o'clock in the morning, he came to my house, and was about the coffee-room for about twenty minutes, or half an hour; he did not call for any thing - this table-cloth was placed in a cupboard in front of the bar, out of the coffee-room - and I ordered it to be taken out of the cupboard and placed in the coffee-room while the prisoner was there, as I had suspicion of his having taken table-cloths before - when he first came in there were six or eight persons there, and before he left one or two might have come in; a great many people attending the market breakfast at my house - I saw the table-cloth placed on the first table in the coffee-room; I saw him remove it on to a seat near the table - I was observing him all the time he was there; he stopped there till every body had left the coffee-room, and I left him there by himself, near the table where this cloth had been laying; it was on the seat at the time, where I had seen him place it - when I left the coffee-room, I went into the bar, to tell my sister to watch, and to call me the moment he left the coffee-room, and the moment he left I ran out; I could not see him for ten minutes - I then met him in Darkhouse-lane; I laid hold of him, and accused him of taking the table cloth - he denied it - I have never seen the cloth since; I went and looked behind the door before I ran out, and the table-cloth was gone, and I think that gave him the opportunity of getting out of my view.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You say the instant he left the coffee-room you ran out? A. Yes, after my sister called me - I ran first to look into the coffee-room; I passed the coffee-room door to go out - Darkhouse-lane is not a quarter of a minutes walk, but I went to search for him in different public-houses; mine is the Newcastle coffee-house - I cannot recollect whether I took his hat off when I met him; I went to his lodgings and saw his wife - she gave the duplicate of a table-cloth, but I found it was not mine; my sister was in front of the counter at the bar - I was in a small room behind the bar; I have not inquired at the pawnbroker's for the table-cloth - Mr. Cook, a salesman, and Mr. Reid were in the coffee-room, and several persons came in to settle with them; my waiter was not in the room, for I had my eye on the bar the whole time - I saw him go up stairs; I could see the coffee-room door where I stood, but could not see inside - I will not swear nobody but the prisoner was there.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner in the coffee-room; I saw the table-cloth on the table - there were two other persons there, I believe, at the time he was there; I did not see who else was there, but I do not think there were any other persons - I only saw the prisoner sit down in the coffee-room, and then he removed the table-cloth from the table, and put it behind him on the seat behind the door; I saw him do that, and afterwards he moved the table-cloth back, and put it on the table again - I did not see him do any thing till he took it and put it under his apron, and then he left the room directly; I called to my brother immediately, and he went out directly after him - I have not seen the table-cloth since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were there only two persons in the coffee-room? A. Not that I am aware of; I was standing at the bar, which commands a view of the whole coffee-room, but not when the door was shut - not one person came in after the prisoner left till he returned; two or three came in when he was first there - there were two persons in the room when I saw him take the table-cloth, and as soon as he took it, he went out; the two persons were still there, sitting in the box - they were across the room; he sat with his back to them - I am not aware that any body else came in while he was there - my brother was in the back bar, I was in the front bar.</p>
               <p>Q. While the prisoner was there, were there six or eight persons in the room, and two more came in? A. Not that I know of; the waiter was gone up stairs - I cannot say who served the two persons in the tap-room; I cannot tell whether they called for any thing - the prisoner was in and out several times; the prisoner might have had two coats on for what I know - he had a blue apron and a pocket apron, two aprons and two coats; the coffee-room door was fastened back, and wide open - he put the cloth under his apron; he could see me, as well as I saw him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were the two persons sitting with their faces or their backs towards him? A. Their faces towards the door; his back was to them - they could not see him put any thing into his pocket, as the partition was too high.</p>

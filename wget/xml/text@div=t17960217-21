             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant to Mrs. Yeoman; I was called up by the last witness; I went into the parlour, I lighted a candle; I went towards the street door, and there was a gentleman, who is the prisoner at the bar; I said, my mistress is not at home; if you will please to walk in, she will be at home in a minute; he went into the parlour, and stood in the parlour near the door; I lighted the others candle, and desired him to sit down; I went and stirred the fire; there was a new sheet behind the parlour curtain.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the sheet made up? - A. It was begun, but not finished; my mistress had been to work in the afternoon about it; I gave it a twist and slung it into the back parlour; the prisoner was in the front parlour, sitting on the sofa; I shut the parlour-door, and went into the kitchen again; there was a double knock at the door, I came up stairs and opened it to a gentleman that belonged to the gentlewoman up stairs; and I saw the prisoner sitting sideways, with his face towards the parlourdoor, on the chair; I let the gentleman in, and he went up stairs; I then turned my face towards the prisoner; he said, I am frightened, I am frightened; I am all of a tremble; frightened, said I,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170036"></xptr>what are you frightened at? it is a gentleman belongs up stairs; upon that, he got up, and said he must go; no, says I, stop a few minutes, my mistress will be home in a minute; upon that, he said no, he would go, and call again; then, says he, I will stop; he sat himself down in the same posture as he was before, sideways in the chair; I happened to cast my eyes down between his knees, and through the chair I saw the new linen, it was deposited between the end of the sofa and the side of the chair; upon that, I was much flurried, seeing my mistresses property, that I knew was deposited in another room.</p>
               <p>Q. The same linen you had put in the back-parlour? - A: Yes; he rose, and said he must go; I said no, sir, you shall not; he went to the passage, and I pushed him back; he said he would go; says I, you are a thief, and a villain; and you have robbed my mistress of her property; he got round the corner to the door; he had a great coat on; we had a good deal of tustle, and he got the door open with one of his hands; I pushed it to keep it close; his coat gave way owing to my clasping of him, as he got out; I cried out, "stop thief, for God's sake, stop thief," he has robbed my mistress; I stept pretty close to him, as well as I could; and I never left him till he was taken and brought back.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was brought back, did you see him? - A. Yes; he was the same man that had been in the parlour; I saw the property again in the parlour after he was taken and brought back; I did not see the table-cloths till he was brought back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. How long have you lived with your mitress? - A. Twenty months; I was nurse to her.</p>
               <p>Q. You can tell whether she is a married lady or not? - A. A single lady; she has lost the use of her limbs almost a year and an half; I was nurse to her.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had this man been in the house from the time he first came in? - A. It is impossible for me to tell; for I was much alarmed with the sound of a foot walking in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you from the parlour when he first came in? - A. I was making one sheet belonging to the new cloth below stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. You were below stairs then all the time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And the prisoner had been about half an hour by himself; a pretty good time, if he had meant to have committed a robbery, to have gone away in you absence? - A. I don't know; I paid very good attention.</p>

               <p>On the 3d of February, near eight o'clock, I heard the cry of "stop thief;" I live in Charlotte-street, Mary-le-bonne; I was taking my window bar in, which I always do at eight o'clock; I ran immediately, and caught the prisoner at the bar; he swung me about three yards, as near as I can guess, and a man of the name of Gibson came up to my assistance, and we took him to Mrs. Yeoman's house; No. 82, Queen Ann-street East; when we got him into the house, he sat down in a chair near a sofa, and laid his elbow on the sofa; at this time he had his right hand in his pocket; he said he was very saint, and I saw something drop from him, which turned out to be two tablecloths, or napkins, or breakfast cloths; Gibson took them up; I should know them again if I was to see them; when I caught hold of him, he begged I would let him go; I told him I would when I brought him to the place where he came from.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took charge of the table-cloths? - A. The constable of the night, at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. But who took charge of him before that? - A. One Captain Devereux; he belongs to the military; I saw them afterwards at the watch-house, and am sure they were the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. Whether you mean to say, that the property dropped from him or the chair? - A. When he sat down there was nothing in the chair.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of observing that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>EDWARD GIBSON sworn.</p>
               <p>On the third of February, I pursued the prisoner, with the last witness; I did not come up with him till Gardener had him by the collar.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the prisoner at the bar? - A. It was; I took hold of him on the right side with my left hand, and as we were bringing him through High-street, Mary-le-bone, the people said, he was dropping things out of his pocket; I said he should drop no more, and I seized his hand, and kept hold of it till he came back to the house; he sat down in a chair near a sofa; he drew his hand out of his right hand pocket, and there were two small tablecloths in his hand; he dropped them; that is all I know about it; I took them up, and they were immediately given into the hands of a gentleman, who was in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know these table-cloths again if you were to see them? - A. I believe I should.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put any mark upon them? - A. Not that night, but the next day, at the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those you put your mark upon the same that dropped from the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>

My Lord, I was coming by and met with the woman at the door; I was very much in liquor; and I asked her if it was to her I spoke a few minutes before; that she said no; I used to come to the house to see ladies: Mrs. Yeoman lodges ladies of the town; and coming to see a lady there, I asked if the lady in the parlour was at home, who had usually lodged there; she insisted upon my walking in, and she would serch her mistress; I said no, I would come again; do, sir, pray walk in; I told her, no; now do, sir, pray walk in; she called to her fellow-servant for a pair of would candles for a gentleman; pray do walk in, sir; I am much obliged to you, I had rather not; I will call some other opportunity; by these persuadings both the women got me into the parlour, and I sat down upon the sofa; as to meddling with any of their property, I know nothing at all about it; that gentleman asked at the Justice's how he was to come by the 10l.(The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.)</p>

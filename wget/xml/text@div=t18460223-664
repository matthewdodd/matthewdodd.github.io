                  </hi>. I belong to the first regiment of Foot-guards, quartered at Birdcage-walk barracks. On Saturday night, the 14th of Feb., I met a female in Tothill-street, Westminster, and went with her to her lodging, in a court in Pye-street—I had 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper in one coat pocket, and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver in the other—I gave 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to the girl to fetch a pot of beer, and had 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. left in my pocket—the girl rushed out of the door, and the two prisoners immediately rushed in—Jenkins said, "What the devil do you do here? it is my lodging; you must turn out: I pay the rent"—I jumped up, and said I would go—I put on my helmet—Jenkins turned up my coat-skirt—I turned round and saw the halfpence in his hand—I ran out to fetch a policeman—Hale threw a brickbat at me—I fetched the constable, but they were gone then—I went down the street, and saw Jenkins go into a cook-shop—I waited till he came out, and then gave him in charge—Hale had the brick<lb></lb>bat in his hand when he came out of the room, and struck me on the breast<lb></lb>plate with it—he slipped the halfpence out of my pocket into his hand—he stopped in the room, and kicked me two or three times on my knee—I have no doubt of the prisoners—I saw Jenkins go up the court, followed him up the street, and took him coming out of the shop—Hale was afterwards found in the room.</p>

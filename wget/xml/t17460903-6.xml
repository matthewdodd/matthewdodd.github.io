               <p>Johnson. I have lost Money several Times; she own'd she took it.</p>

               <p>Court. You lost Money at several Times; what, do you mean that she took it?</p>
               <p>Johnson. She was there, and I tax'd her with it; I can't swear to my Money: She had none upon her; but she bought new Clothes, and changed a Guinea, that made me suspect her.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it that she own'd she took it?</p>
               <p>Johnson. Before the Justice.</p>

               <p>Q. You had not been with her? - A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of night was it? - A. Near three o'clock in the morning; it was late before I got away from the trade club at St. Martin's-le-grand.</p>
               <p>Court. You ought to have been at home, and in bed, instead of being at the trade club till that time.</p>
               <p>- DONNERY sworn. - I am a watchman: On the 21st of August I was going my round, calling three o'clock in the morning, and met the prosecutor and the prisoner; the prosecutor wanted the prisoner to come along with him; he said to her, come along with me; she said, no, that he had a girl in Tothill-street the night before, and that she would not go with him; I desired them directly to keep off, or I would leave off crying the hour on my beat; I was near my box, and as soon as I got into my box, he cried out, watch; I came out to him, he said he was robbed; I heard the money drop; I took up two shillings in money, and some halfpence; I gave it to the constable of the night at the watch-house, and he returned it to him in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he sober? - A. The prosecutor was drunk.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the prosecutor.) You were a little drunk? - A. Yes, a little.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not recollect the circumstance, that you wanted her to go with you? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was coming home; I met this man, and he asked me if he should go home with me; I told him, no; he asked me if I would have a glass; I told him he had a girl with him; he said she had run away from him; he took two shillings out of his pocket, he offered it to me; I told him he mistook the person; he tore my cloaths, and used me very ill; he dropped the money by some means or other; he was afraid I was going to pick it up, and so he called the watchman.</p>

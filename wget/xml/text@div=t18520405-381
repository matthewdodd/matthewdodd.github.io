                  </hi>. I am the wife of Felice Ludovico Solita, of Mansion-house-place, Camberwell. On 12th March I was in Bridge-street, Blackfriars, about 5 o'clock in the afternoon—I was walking along—two boys were wrestling together, and I could not pass, as one threw the other across the pavement—in turning round to go near the railings I was immediately surrounded and pinioned by five or six boys, and the prisoner put his hand in my pocket while I was so pinioned, and took oat my parse, which con<lb></lb>tained 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or rather more—I did not know him before—I am sure he is the boy—I did not lose sight of him—they held me for a moment to give him a chance of escape, but still I pursued him, and never lost sight of him—he was captured by two persons at the bottom of the next street—that was only a few minutes after my purse had been taken—I had not lost sight of him at all—I was not used with violence, except being kept against the railing.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 18, Little Trinity-lane. On the evening of 12th March I was in Bridge-street—I saw three young men surround the prosecutrix, and pinion her by her back against the railing, while the prisoner put his hand into her pocket, and delivered a small blue purse to a man who I think was pitted with the small-pox—I ran across the road to try and chase the man who had the purse, but a dray passing prevented my doing so—I saw the prisoner run, and the prosecutrix after him—I am quite sore he is the person.</p>

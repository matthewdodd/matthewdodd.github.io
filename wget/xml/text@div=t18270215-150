            . I am fourteen years old, and live with my father in Charlton-street. On the 15th of January, at seven o'clock in the evening, I was going home along<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150072"></xptr>Chichester-place; I saw Keosell and Jones, with another lad named Hobbs, opposite Liddell's shop - Keosell and Jones crossed over; Jones stood by the turnpike; Keosell went into the shop - Hobbs looked into the window; Keosell brought out a large jar in about two minutes, which he gave to Hobbs, who took it to the turnpike, and gaveit to Jones - I only saw one jar - I saw nothing more - I am certain of them - I followed them into Weir's-passage - Keosell and Hobbs went into a house on the left-hand there, where they sell pigeons - Jones stopped outside; I did not wait till they came out - Jones had given the pot to Hobbs; next evening I was playing in Charlton-street, and told some boys of it; we went and told Mr. Liddell.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. QUIN. Q. Did you not mention the name of Patterson before the Magistrate? A. No; I said I saw them take it to a shop next night(Tuesday) - I had none of the honey - one Mears keeps the pigeon shop in Weir's-passage - I said nothing about it that night - the name of Patterson was on the shop, in Charlton-street - I saw the prisoners there next night, and saw Higgs take it into that shop - I was never in Mears' shop.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What happened on Tuesday night? A. I saw Jones and Higgs come into Charlton-street - Higgs went into Patterson's shop and sold it for 3s. 6d. - some other boys were with them - I heard a whistle when he came out of Patterson's, and then they all ran off together.</p>

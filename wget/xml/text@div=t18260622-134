               <p>CATHERINE MACDONALD. I met the prisoner in the street on the 23d of March - she was turned out of her lodgings - I took her home, and she remained with me some time - I was ill and taken to the hospital - I left her with my children, and left a sovereign to support them for thirteen days - I returned on the 1st of May and missed the children's shoes off their feet, a frock and a flat iron - she was still living in the house; on the 13th of May I sent a gown and two shifts to the mangle, and she went and fetched them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When you went to the hospital did not you ask me to lend you my gown and shift? - A. No, we changed gowns; she had my gown in the room of this - this was hers at first; the shifts are mine and never were hers.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you send your shifts and gowns to be mangled? - A. Yes, by one of my children.</p>

            . I live in Queen's-place, Westminster. On Saturday, the 13th of May, Mrs. Macdonald's child brought me these things to mangle - the prisoner came afterwards and asked if they were done - she laid down three half-pence and asked if that was right - I said Yes - she took the things, and went down the court instead of going into the house.</p>

            . I am a constable. I saw Mrs. Macdonald in Peter-street on the 13th of May - there was a show, and I went in, and found the prisoner there with Mrs. Macdonald's child - I asked her for Mrs. Macdonald's things, and she gave them up to me directly - I found some duplicates on her which relate to the shoes - the prosecutrix said nothing about the shoes till the second examination.</p>

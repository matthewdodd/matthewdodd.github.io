On Friday night, the 30th of Jan., I hung a sheet and counterpane in the back kitchen about half-past four o'clock—about eleven I heard my daughter call me to bring a light, which I did instantly—I went to the back kitchen door, and missed the counterpane and sheet, and instantly after I and my daughter ran up the stairs—I heard somebody going before us—the street-door banged to—we opened it and ran into the street, and the first I put my eye on was the prisoner—she ran down the street, when I called "Stop thief," as hard as she could—I had called "Stop thief" before I got into the street.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 21st of May, I locked up my house about ten o'clock, and left no person in it - I left the key with Mr. Hart. I returned between four and five o'clock, and found the street-door had been opened with a picklock key - I had double-locked it; people were then in the house. I found my drawers and boxes all open - seventeen locks of drawers and boxes had been picked and broken, and the articles stated in the indictment stolen. The silver coin consisted of sixpences, half-crowns, and different pieces.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Your sister, who is dead, kept the house - A. Yes; when she died I administered. She rented the house for one year, and died in the middle of the year - I have continued to live in it, and occupied it as a tenant. I intended to leave, but had not given it up.</p>

            . I live opposite to Mrs. Morgan. On the 21st of May I saw her go out, and about half-past twelve o'clock, I saw the prisoner, Tilling, knock at the door, Marsh was then about four doors off. In about five minutes I saw Tilling open the door; he put his hand down by his side, and then appeared to put it to the keyhole; he went in and beckoned to Marsh. I went to Mr. Hart, told him, and he went to the door - they had bolted themselves in, and came out the back way. I saw Tilling run, he was secured by Hart in Fenton-street. I went into Branch-place, saw Marsh running, and saw him secured. They were in the house about a quarter of an hour.</p>

            . I am landlord of the house, and live near Bilby - the key had been left at my house. Bilby came to me about half-past two o'clock. I got Mr. Tilbery, who went with me and Burk. I asked Burk to watch the back of the house - we went to the front and tried the key, but found it was bolted inside. Shortly after, I heard a cry of Stop thief at the back of the house; we ran round, and Tilling ran into our arms; we took him back to the house, and sent for Abel, the officer, who found several things on him. The prisoners behaved very well.</p>

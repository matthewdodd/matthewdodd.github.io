                  </hi>. On 7th April I went, accom<lb></lb>panied by a gentleman named Greening, to the office of the <hi rend="italic">Day</hi> news<lb></lb>paper; I saw the defendant—I took this copy of the <hi rend="italic">Day</hi> from my pocket, and said to Mr. Nosworthy, "There is an article in this paper called, 'Well Served, or the Biter Bitten,' you are the printer of it?"—he said, "You will see at the bottom; I did print that copy"—I said, "The object of my calling upon you is to get you to give up the author;" he said, "I shall require time to consider whether I shall do that"—Mr. Greening asked whether Mr. Scott was in—Mr. Nosworthy said, "No," and that he was out of town, and would not be back either all that day or for some days, I am not sure which—at that moment Mr. Scott came out from the back room half dressed—Nosworthy appeared extremely confused, and said, "Why, what, are you up?" which Scott did not appear to understand—I showed Mr. Scott this paper, and referred him to the article; I said, "Will you give me up the author of that article?"—Mr. Scott replied, "Go to the <hi rend="italic">Times office</hi>, and ask the editor for the author of the leading article there"—I then turned to Mr. Nosworthy, and said, "Do you intend to give me the name of the author or not?"—he said, "No, I shall not"—I said, "Am I to consider that your answer?"—he said, "Yes, that is my answer"—I then said, "If you decline to give up the name of the author, you, as printer, must take the consequences"—he said, "Very well," and then turned and walked out before me.</p>

                  </hi>.

Q.</hi> Were you a servant of Mr. Scott's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was a workman of his—the type was set up on the day which is attached to the paper, March 7th, in the afternoon—a small number of copies were taken off to be circulated among the parties that were written about, that were concerned in it—that was the afternoon before it was published—I have no recollection of what day it was, but copies were printed of it before it was published—I remember Mr. Nosworthy being away ill at his place at Hoxton some time—I do not know when that was—he has been away ill several times; I cannot say whether or not before or after Saturday, 7th March—some one gave this article oat to be printed—I do not think it would have been printed if Mr. Scott had not been there—my reason for saying that is, that Mr. Nosworthy scarcely ever undertook anything of importance if Mr. Scott was not there, and he was then there—I earn, under 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—Nosworthy was paid as much as he could get, sometimes, much and sometimes little—Saturday was considered the pay day when he could get it—I cannot say that I have seen Mr. Scott pay him money, but I have heard Nosworthy say he had received a trifle—I am jobbing now for Taylor's—this place, No. 11, Red Lion Court, is supposed to be Mr. Scott's—Nosworthy managed Scott's business—he called him a foreman, but we called him an overseer—in Nosworthy's absence Scott mixed himself up in the business as much as he could—Scott lived upon the premises, and gave out the copies—I know a person named O'Donnell—it was supposed that he took the place of overseer in Nosworthy's absence—I do not know whether he might be considered as managing the business, but Mr. Scott gave him copies to give out—he did Nosworthy's duty when he was away—the way I remember this particular article is this, after I had received the subpœna (for I was not at all acquainted with the substance</p>

               <p>of the article)—I came to the office, and then I showed it to Mr. Scott and Mr. Nosworthy, and it was brought back to my recollection, and I recol<lb></lb>lected it when I turned things over, and Mr. Nosworthy brought me forward the slip, which was my bill, and then I remembered that I had put some of it up—a portion of my bill was paid on that Saturday, I think by Mr. Nosworthy, but I do not recollect—I believe the article was given out by Scott—I do not recollect by whom a part of my bill was paid—I will not swear that Nosworthy paid me, or whether I received any money at all that night—I do not know when the name of Nosworthy first appeared as printer to this paper, or when his name was removed after 7th March—I know there was a difference between Mr. Scott and Nosworthy about Nosworthy not coming to do his duty—it was a difficult thing to please Mr. Scott—Nosworthy did not please him—I do not recollect the date when this difference occurred—I know that about this time there was some difference between Nosworthy and Scott, and that then Mr. Scott removed Nosworthy's name from the paper—Scott said he would not put up with it any longer, but would have some one who would do better—I understood he sent for a man named Jones, of the <hi rend="italic">Dispatch</hi>, but he did not get him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 11, Red Lion Court.

                  </hi>. I have been for fifteen years a seaman in her Majesty's service—on Sunday night, the 12th of Oct., I engaged a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to have a <hi rend="italic">cruise</hi> for the night—it was to drive me about till six o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing—I stopped at the Plough public-house in Oxford-street—the prisoner met me outside, and asked me for a ride—I said, "Yes, jump in, I will give you a ride as far as I go"—I was going to Waterloo-road, and told the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>man to drive there—as we were going up Wellington-street I was dozing in the corner of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> stopped, and it awoke me imme<lb></lb>diately—I found the door was open and the prisoner gone—I put my head out and saw her going at a sharp trot towards the Strand—I sung out to the caiman, "Slew round, I am robbed"—I put my hand to my pocket as we were going on full speed, and my purse was gone—I jumped out right bang on the prisoner, and found my purse in her hand—I was going to strike her, but the policeman came up—I said to him, "You take her, and don't let go her hand till you get to the station-house"—I know I had my purse perfectly safe before I saw her—I was certainly the worse for liquor, but I was not regularly stupified—I was not dead gone—I was lather sleepy—I had my intellects—I have not seen my purse since—it was a blue purse, and had two bone slides—I had five 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bank notes in it, two sovereigns, and twenty-one shillings in silver.</p>

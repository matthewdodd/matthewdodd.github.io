The prisoner also asked for his trunks; I told him that they were in the house. He asked me which way he must go to get them; I told him round by Dyers-court, that was the way he could get them best.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, in what state did he appear to be in - A. He appeared to be as he always was.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he been out of your observation - A. Perhaps fifteen months; he appeared as well as ever I saw him in my life, quite composed. After I referred him to the back door to go for his trunks, he went out at the front door, and came back at the front door; he might be absent a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes: when he came into the warehouse he asked for Bottomley again; Bottomley was not returned. He said nothing more; he went out. It was past one o'clock before I saw him again; I then saw him at Mr. Haigh's desk.</p>

             was in the room; I was very much surprised to see him. I said, bless me, Thomas, are you here this morning: what! have you got out of St. Luke's; yes, he said, he got out that morning out of the window. I said, it was an unfortunate circumstance; I had understood he was to be out soon; it was unfortunate that he had broke out. He then said, he was going into the country; he wished me to let him have two or three pounds; I paused for a short time; I said I would go up stairs and see. I came down again directly, and told him he should have the money. I had a ten-pound note in my pocket-book; I sent out for change; he had the money before he went. He stopped and breakfasted with me.

             gave him the money, not in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you learn from him how much money he had - A. I did not ask him any questions; he breakfasted with me, my wife, Mrs. Haigh, and Mrs. Haigh's daughter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you where he was going - A. I said to him, you seem quite well; he said, yes. I asked him if he was well; he said, yes. I then said, as you are going into the country, when you get down there what do you intend to do. He answered, that he had laid all his plans before he came out. I enquired no further about it, being in haste to get away; the time was arrived which I usually appear at the warehouse. I went away, leaving the prisoner with my wife.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he with you in the whole - A. Altogether I was not more than five minutes with him. It was half past eight when I first saw him. I went out before nine o'clock; I was absent from him part of the time dressing myself. He appeared to me quite cool and in his senses. He might be insane and I not discover it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him before he was confined - A. I had not seen him since February last. I called twice at Hoxton to see him; when I went to enquire for him they shewed me into a room; he was confined at Hoxton, in a mad-house. The keeper came along with him. I talked with him. I did not stop more than five minutes. I asked him if he was well. He said he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been in the habit of seeing him for a long time before - A. No. He was sent to Hoxton in October. Before the 20th of October I had not seen him for eleven years. I do not recollect the time I saw him before that. I did not see him from the 20th of October to the early part of November, not above three or four times.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. Now, when you did see him before he was confined, what was his appearance to you - A. had heard before I saw him of his printing paper about his giving peace to all the world. I said, he certainly must be mad. I said that on seeing the papers. When I saw him and conversed with him he did not appear to me to be insane, but he might be, and I not able to discover it. Before the prisoner was sent to the madhouse at Hoxton, I had heard that he had printed and published papers. I went and saw him at Hoxton; I was there five minutes; I conversed with him upon these two occasions at Hoxton; he was then the same as when I conversed with him on the 30th of November; he then appeared to me to be as sane as on the morning of Tuesday last. I saw no difference.</p>

Never until Tuesday the 30th of November, then he came to my shop between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, he said, he wished to look at a pair of pistols that were in the window; he dealt with me for them; he gave me one pound fifteen shillings for them. Very little conversation passed between us, and what did, was about the mould for casting the bullets; that he was very particular about. He asked if the mould was the right mould that belonged to the pistols; he examined the barrals, and was very particular about them, he unscrewed the barrals; I told him, I had no doubt but it was the right that mould belonged to the pistols. I had some difficulty to persuade him that it was so, but upon my warranting them, he said, he would take them. He then said, I presume you can make some abatement; he then produced two one-pound notes; I gave him five shillings change. He seemed to have his circumspection as well as any other person might be in purchasing; he was attending to see if the screw fitted.</p>

Why, my little man, what sort of clerks do you keep; they have not given me credit for one single thing; what countrymen are they. Oh, the Lillies, the Lillies, are you Lillies; stop Daniel, I have got a bill to execute against you of several thousands, for defamation. NB. It seems entirely to depend upon your clerks; send them to Goggan before they ruin you. Mr. Haigh, for you I have a great regard. The demand I have upon you, and others, must be in force; I have sworn by earth, and shall I couple hell. The debt I must have, and will. Madness in your mind is a satisfaction; in mine it is is a disgrace. Duty demands satisfaction, and satisfaction I'll have, or I will perish.

               <p>Q. to Mr. Daniel Haigh. When you returned to town on the 1st of December, did Rhodes return - A. He left me after the date of the second letter, before the third. I believe the day after I received the second letter, I called him into the accompting-house, and settled with him; he gave me a receipt for the balance, as to his wages.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his conduct at that time - A. He was exact in business, the same as he used to be, and after we had settled, his conduct then was exactly as it used to be. When I asked him what he saw in my conduct to demand of me five thousand pounds to overthow the Government; he said, that would not do; he must have a larger sum now.</p>
               <p>Q. After the last letter, did you take any measure to put him in confinement - A. I went, and consulted with Mr. Stephens, in the Old Jewry; he was put in a private house at Hoxton, at Miles's, at Hoxton.</p>
               <p>Q. This is a house for insane persons - A. It is; he continued there I think two or three months; he was removed from there to St. Luke's, by my permission.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him on the 30th of November - A. I saw him pass my accomping-house window; I have no doubt he saw me; he looked in at the window.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came in you went backwards - A. I went with two gentlemen and my son; I don't think I should have gone, only I was called away. A friend met me behind the Bank; I told him what had happened. I did not see any thing of the transaction of the death of Prestow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive that printed paper of the prisoner - A. No; I received some one at the accompting-house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. The day that you invited Rhodes to dine with you at Battersea Rise, you had a long conversation with him - A. Yes, we talked together a good while; he talked of giving peace to the whole world.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought it very wild, and in consequence of what you observed you engaged Mr. Haslam to come and see him - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And after that, you finding he was insane, you had him confined - A. I did, and when we heard that he was away from St. Luke's, assistance was sent to get him back again if he could be found.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he shew you any printed papers - A. I heard there were such things; I conversed with him upon the subject of the printed papers while Mr. Haigh was at Ramsgate; he seemed determined of giving peace to the world; I talked to him about it. I suggested the great impropriety of publishing a paper of that sort; he went off immediately, and stopped the publication of it. In short he went out of the house to do that, when he returned he told me he had suppressed it. I told him not to circulate any more; I found his name at the bottom of the paper. I told him we should have a number of people come to the house, when the paper was circulated. He went about his business as usual. Except in that single subject there was no departure from reason.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his natural temper and disposition - A. I always thought him very sullen and obstinate; he was always very friendly with me; we were upon the best terms, in short, we could not be otherwise.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181312010013"></xptr>Q. On the 30th of November, did you see him at Mr. Haigh's warehouse - A. I did; when I first saw him it might be about noon; when he came in I was busy in the warehouse; I went up to him, and shook hands with him. I asked him how he was; he said, pretty well. I said, you look very well. He said; how is Mrs. Charles. I asked him, how they treated him; he said, pretty well; better than he expected. I said, you look pretty well Rhodes. He then went into the warehouse, where there were some furniture prints lay; we began talking about one thing or the other, that might have taken place in the business; there were one pile of prints he observed in particular; he said, this is some of the old stock, and I rather think it was some of the old stock. We went on about these prints; he took down one of these prints, put it on the counter, he observed the date, and seemed to think they were part of the old stock; his uncle did not join in the conversation. I conceived his conversation was rational. I was told that a gentleman wanted to speak with Mr.

             quitted the accompting-house before you went up stairs - A. He quitted the accompting-house when we sent for an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he quit the accompting-house without passing Rhodes - A. Yes, he could. I remained upon the top of the stairs a few minutes; while I remained on the stairs, I saw Rhodes quit the warehouse, and go into the accounting-house; I stood there until I saw Prestow come into the warehouse; it is an open stair-case. Prestow went into the accompting-house, he perceived that Rhodes had a pistol, he retreated, and stepped back; Prestow had a small stick in his hand, he might hold the stick up; I cannot say whether he did or no. Prestow advanced a second time; I saw him go into the accompting-house, and I heard the report of a pistol; after the report of the pistol, I saw Towe run in, and I ran in after Towe; to help to secure the prisoner. Towe was endeavouring to take the other pistol from him. I ran up to the prisoner, and put my arm round his neck, in order to secure him too; Towe was on the other side endeavouring to take the pistol from him; we secured him. I saw some man in the passage, I beckoned to the man to come and assist; when he came in I run off to get a surgeon; Prestow was laying with his head on one of the steps bleeding.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the stick that Prestow had in his hand - A. A man told me afterwards that was the stick.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know whether Prestow was known to the prisoner - A. I don't know. When I returned with Prestow, I stood at the right hand side of the accompting-house door outside, in the warehouse. The prisoner then was in the place where Mr. Haigh generally sits. Prestow went to the door; the prisoner held the pistol up; the prisoner said, he had another; that is all I heard him say. Prestow stood at the outside; I stood behind him. Prestow had a stick in his hand; Pristow said, he had a pistol. Prestow advanced the second time; I stood where I was. I don't think Prestow spoke, holding the stick down. It appeared to me that he struck with the stick, to strike Rhodes, I cannot say whether he did or no; the prisoner fired in the twinkling of an eye; I saw the discharge: I saw it flash in the pan; I ran backwards at first when I saw the flash I heard the report, Prestow fell dead, and never stired in the least as I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Prestow advanced near enough to reach the prisoner with his stick - A. He was within half a yard of him. There are two steps in the accompting-house where Rhodes was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say before the Coroner, that Prestow struck his legs - A. It appeared to me that he struck where his legs was; I think he meant to strike his legs in my own mind; I cannot exactly say whether he hit him or not.</p>

            , went to seek after him; I first saw him at Mr. Haigh's accompting-house, about one o'clock in the day, he was in the warehouse; soon after I saw him, I said, I was come for him; he drew a pistol from his pocket, told me to take care of myself; he presented the pistol at me; I withdraw to another part of the warehouse, towards the door; he walked backwards and forwards in the warehouse. I saw him go into the accompting-house; I saw Prestow come. The prisoner was alone in the accompting-house; when Prestow came, Prestow opened the accompting-house door. I could see the prisoner, I was on one side of Prestow. Prestow went a little way in the accompting-house, with the door in his hand; the door opens inward; the prisoner presented a pistol at Prestow; Prestow said, oh, dear man, you lay for shooting, do you; and withdrew. Prestow was a powerful man. Prestow advanced the second time quick up to the place where Rhodes was; I did not see Prestow aim a blow, or see him have a stick the second time; the first time I did. I saw Rhodes present the pistol at Prestow the second time, I heard the report, Prestow fell immediately, he shewed no signs of life afterwards, as I saw. Upon Prestow falling, I rushed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181312010014"></xptr>forwards to secure Rhodes; Mr. Charles and somebody came to my assistance; I took the pistols from him.</p>
               <p>Q. When you rushed forward at him did you see any pistol - A. He presented a pistol, and snapped the pistol at me; I rushed forward and laid hold of him. He was endeavouring to cock the pistol again; I took the pistol from him. The other pistol I believe was down on the ground; I am sure he had two pistols. After I had secured him I took him back to St. Luke's myself, and then the officers, Harrison, and Cartwright, took him in custody at St. Luke's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you convers with him as you were taking him back - A. I did; he told me if the other pistol had gone off he should have shot me as dead as Prestow.</p>

            . I am one of the marshalmen. I received these pistols at Mr. Haigh's house, one had been discharged, the other was loaded with powder and ball. I asked him where he got the pistols; he told me he bought them in Tottenham-court-road. I took the prisoner from St. Luke's; Harrison was with me. He said, he got the powder and hall in Oxford-street. I asked him where he got the horn that the powder was in; he said in the Haymarket. I then asked him if he knew Prestow, he said, he knew him very well to be an officer, and a resolute man, for he had seen him handle an Irishman bringing him up Aldermanbury; he knew him to be a resolute man. I then said, suppose Mr. Nalder had come, would you have shot him! yes, he said, or any other person that came to molest him. He gave very regular answers to every question I put to him; I took him to the Compter.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I feel myself an injured person; it appears the capital part of the charge is done away; I need not defend myself on that head. In October, 1812, I published that paper; I was taken up and placed in the Compter by Mr. Nalder, the City marshal, he said he would take me before the Lord Mayor; he began to search me; I made no resistance. He took from me a knife, and when I was in the coach I asked him whether I might have a private or public examination; he said, which I pleased. I said I prefered a public one; I was taken into a private room in the Mansion House; the letters were all taken before the Lord Mayor, read, and all sworn to, except the third; Mr. Haigh could not swear to that. A gentleman said, his lordship would not do any thing in it, he would wish to defer it until the Thursday week. I had an idea that they were going to take me to a private mad-house; said, I had no objection of going to Newgate. I was sent back to the Poultry Compter, and on the day that I was to be taken to the Mansion House, instead of taking me there, two keepers from the mad-house came for me; Mr. Nalder said, there was an order for me to go to the mad-house. I was shewn into the turnkey's room; the two keepers came in, they said, they had an order to take me; I pulled my coat off to have the straight jacket on; they said, I was quiet enough. When they got me a few hundred yards towards Miles's mad-house, they tied my hands, they searched me; I had some money they did not find; I gave that up. I did not know what a place a mad-house was, and on the 9th of April, I was taken from there to St. Luke's Hospital. When I had been there three or four months, I was informed the physician said I was quite well enough to go out; I then thought they had no right to keep me there after the physician said I was well; I was determined to break out. I got out, and got the money that has been stated. I bought the pistols to protect myself, as it may appear to the court and the jury. This man has stated that I knew Prestow; I did not know the man was an officer. I found he came to take me, but I never heard he was an officer until I was in confinement. They have stated that I presented the pistol at Mr. Prestow, I do not think they could see, except looking through a glass-door; I do not think that is legal to swear looking through glass.</p>

            . I am the apothecary of Bethlem Hospital. I have been conversant with the complaints of insane persons about twenty years; I have in that time had the opportunity of seeing many thousand cases. In November last, by desire of Mr. Haigh, the prisoner was introduced to me under a feiganed name, rather against my will; I had one interview with Rhodes for near two hours; my opinion is that he is absolutely insane; on my certificate he was put into Hoxton mad-house. I invited him a dozen times at Miles's; his mind was in a state of insanity; I delivered my opinion that he was an uncurable lunatic.</p>

            . I am the apothecary of St. Luke's. The prisoner was brought to our house on Friday, the 9th of last April. I saw him almost dailey; he was brought to the Hospital in a deranged state; he continued in a deranged state; he was always so. I saw him on Monday before he escaped; he was in the same deranged state. I considered him unsafe to go into society.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. From what do you form your opinion that I am insane - A. From your action, and ideas, and your general conduct told me that you were an improper person to be at liberty.</p>
               <p>Q. You judge from ideas; you have a good opinion of yourself. Do you remember ever my being confined with a strait jacket, or a hand-cuff - A. I do not. I could see from your general conduct that you wished to make away with your uncle, and I have the same idea of you now that I always had.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did I not shoot my uncle when I was there - A. I coneeive you had not a fair opportunity of doing it.</p>

The prisoner has been under my care during the time he has been confined there. I saw him every Monday, and in my judgment he was insane the whole of the time. I should consider it imprudent that he should be at large. He certainly was not capable of judging whether his actions were right or wrong.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 30, Wellington-street, Bethnal-green. I am a labourer—the prisoner Gayton was in my employ—in Dec. I wanted to buy an old omnibus, and on Sunday, 4th Dec. Gayton brought Chapman to say that he knew of a <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> to sell, which was in George-yard, Whitechapel—he did not mention the name of the person to whom it belonged till we got there; he then said it belonged to Mr. Emanuel, the proprietor of omnibuses—I went into the yard with them—I saw Mr. Emanuel there, but I did not speak to him myself—both the prisoners went and spoke to him—they returned to me, and then Gayton said the price was 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I saw the omnibus—Chapman was within hearing of what Gayton said—I told them to buy the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> as cheap as they could—Gayton told me there must be a deposit of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Chapman was then present—Gayton had at that time money of mine in his possession, to the amount of about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I authorised him to pay the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit—I could not get the omnibus to my premises till 12th Dec.—I and the two prisoners went on 12th Dec. to pay the remainder of the money—we all three went to the Spread Eagle—the prisoner left me there, and went to Mr. Emanuel's</p>

               <p>yard—before they went, Chapman wrote this receipt—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Dec. 11th, 1853. Bought, an omnibus of Mr. Emanuel, for the sum of 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. Thomas Warren")—when this was written, I said to Chapman, "Go over, and pay Mr. Emanuel the remainder of the money, and get the <hi rend="italic">bus"</hi>—I had paid it in three instalments—2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the deposit—after that 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was given by me to Chapman, to pay to Mr. Emanuel; and on this last occasion I gave Chapman 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the public house where he wrote the receipt, and authorised him to pay the balance—he took it away to get the receipt signed, and he afterwards gave it to Mr. Emanuel's ostler, to give it to me—Gayton did not go with Chapman—I called his attention to get the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> out, as there was a confusion—I got the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> to my own yard—Chapman did not come back to me to the public house—he came to lend a hand to get the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> out—the ostler gave me this receipt—Chapman was close to him—I saw Chapman give it to the ostler, and the ostler handed it to me.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But why did you give money to Chapman, when you say Gayton owed you 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could not get the money away from Gayton—he held the purse and shook it at me, and said, "Not a pound shall you have"—I did not tell Chapman to put "paid" at the bottom of the paper—he did put "paid" but I did not tell him—I do not recollect telling him to put it—I told him to go and pay Howe—I did not look at the receipt—I could not read well enough—I know this is the paper—I am not such a dunce but what I know that this is the paper he wrote.</p>

               <p>I thought he knew better than I did; they were curious ones—one had a horn, and the other was very diminutive—they were to be exhibited, and I told him I would give him a little more if I found I could get my living by them—I had confidence in him, I am very sorry I had.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an omnibus proprietor, and cigar manufac<lb></lb>turer, in Church-lane. In Dec. I had an old omnibus to dispose of in George-yard—on a Sunday in Dec., I remember Gayton going to my yard—I cannot say whether Chapman was with him—there were three or four outside; I did not look to see who they were—Gayton asked what the price of the omnibus was; I told him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I agreed to take 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he went away, it might be, for two minutes, and came back and gave a half sove<lb></lb>reign as a deposit—I saw him two or three times after that, as I was going to the stable—I saw Chapman and him together sometimes, and sometimes I saw them singly in the yard where the omnibus was—on the next Satur<lb></lb>day night I saw Chapman, he said he would come and fetch the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> on the Monday morning—on the next Monday Chapman came, and my ostler was with him—Chapman then paid me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not receive from either Gayton or Chapman any other amount for that omnibus—I gave him a receipt in my own writing; I did not see Gayton at that time—no part of this paper is my writing except the stamp—this part which is on the stamp is my writing—I never saw this paper.</p>

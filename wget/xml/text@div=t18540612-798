                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Jones, at Mitcham. On 14th March, about a quarter past 1 o'clock, I missed two coats and a scarf shawl, which I had seen hanging in the hall a quarter of an hour before—they were my master's property—there are gates which open into the enclosure—I went over to Mrs. Busbee, who lives opposite.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Busbee, a labourer; we live opposite Mr. Jones, at Mitcham. On 14th March I saw the prisoner Allen on Mr. Jones's hall steps—he went into the house—I went inside for a minute, and on returning I saw him coming out at the gate with a basket like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it seemed as if there was something inside—he had a lemon in the other hand—he went towards a horse and chaise which was standing about twenty-five yards from the gate, and which I have seen since—it is the same—there was a man a good deal like Rainbow in the chaise, but I cannot say that it was he—Allen was going towards the chaise, but he checked himself, turned back again, and went towards Mr. Coleman the butcher's; the chaise went after him, and I lost sight of both of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Coleman, of Mitcham. On Tuesday, 14th March, a little before 12 o'clock, I saw the prisoners on the opposite side of the way, going towards the confectioner's shop—Allen was walking with a basket similar to this, and Rainbow was riding in a chaise—I saw Rainbow taken, and am sure he is the man—they went towards the common, and I lost sight of them—I saw them again about half an hour, or more, afterwards—Allen was then walking on the other side of the way, towards Mr. Jones's house, and I lost sight of him—I re<lb></lb>marked him because I thought he was a friend of mine, and went out to speak to him, but found that I was mistaken—he had a basket with him, and a lemon—I saw Rainbow the second time, when he came to the corner with the horse and chaise—he stood still some time; Allen came back from the direction in which he had previously gone, put the basket in front of the chaise, took the reins from Rainbow's hands and drove off at a trot, and when he had gone about 100 yards he struck the horse into a gallop—it was</p>

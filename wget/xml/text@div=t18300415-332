            . I am a constable. Stevens came to my house soon after eight o'clock, and complained of having been robbed of 7s. and his handkerchief; I went in search of the prisoners - he told me who they were, but did not go with me; I found Williams against the cage, and apprehended him - I found this handkerchief in his breast pocket, under his smock-frock; he told me Mitchell was one that was with him - I went in search of him; a boy came and told me he was talking to Williams in the cage - I went and found him there, but found nothing on him; Mitchell said the handkerchief was his own - I never heard the prosecutor say it was not his; he was a little elevated, but not drunk.</p>

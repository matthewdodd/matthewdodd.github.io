I saw the prisoners at the King's Head, where the man fell asleep—I was in the room before they came into it—he put his head down and fell asleep—the women were on the left side of him—I saw Pead put her hand into his pocket, and take out his tobacco-box—the other was sitting by the side of her at the time—I saw her open the box and count the money on the table-four shillings and seven sixpences—they then took the box and went out together—I did not wake the man, because Pead said, when she counted the money, that she considered that he ought to have more, and I thought she was his wife.</p>

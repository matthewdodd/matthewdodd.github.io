On the 29th of August, the prisoner came to my shop, and said he wanted his watch cleaned and a bolt to his case; he asked what it would come to - I said 4 s.; he then said he should wish to part<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150038"></xptr>with that watch, in exchange for another; I shewed him two or three, and he chose one - the difference might be about 2 l. 15 s. - I laid it aside with the ticket; he then said, I wish to have a good gold key; I shewed him several; while I was giving him the last key, I saw him take up two from the counter; he then went towards the door, and I said, "Sir, do you mean to pay for those keys?" "Oh no," says he, "I'm going to see if there's another watch in your window I like better." As he passed the window, I saw him run - I pursued him to New Compton-street, and called Stop thief! he was there stopped and brought back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Had he purchased the watch of you which he wanted to exchange? A. Yes, he had some months before, and had paid me by different payments.</p>
               <p>Q. When he took the keys, did he not say, I will see which I like best, and I will pay you for it. A. Yes, he took the keys out of the shop - he did not say he would see which would do and return the other; he took them up in a very curious manner - I asked him if he was going to pay for them; he said, "Oh dear, no! I am going to look at the watches in the window."</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the old watch? A. He took it off the counter again.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long had he had the old watch of you? A. About six months - I knew his name, but not where he lived.</p>

            . My father keeps a shop in King-street, Soho. On the 29th of August, I heard a cry of Stop thief! I went out and saw the prisoner running with a mob after him; I saw him throw a watch key opposite the coffee-shop - I do not know what became of it; I followed him, and he was taken in New Compton-street; he was taken back to the prosecutor's shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far were you off the lad when he was running? A. I was in my father's shop, and he was four or five doors off when I first saw him - I followed him, and I was just by the corner of Crown-street, when I saw him throw away the key; I did not see it when it was on the ground - there were some persons walking before him, but none running.</p>

            . I was called to take this prisoner; I found a watch on him, but nothing else.</p>
               <p>THOMAS NORTH re-examined. Q. How often did you see the prisoner? A. I never saw him after he had paid for the watch, which was about five months before. He came about five or six times to pay the money; I never saw him any where else to my knowledge; I believe I charged him 30 s. or 35 s. for the old watch. I kept the property till the payments were made.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Does it stand to reason that I should go and purchase the watch for 2 l. 11 s., and then wish to exchange? I asked what he would charge for mending it, and he said 4 s. 6 d.; I said, it was a great deal; I then asked him if he would make an exchange; and he said he would - I looked at one at 3 l. 18 s.; I thought it too much - I then asked to look at some watch keys: he shewed me some which I did not like - I then looked at some more, but it was not likely, that I should take two keys out of a shop.</p>

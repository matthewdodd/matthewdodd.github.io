               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you owe any thing to his master? A. I believe there was 1s. 8d. left on the Saturday, that we could not agree about; he came to ask for that money, but he did not receive it - he said at the office that his master had desired him to take some goods if he could not get the money; he said, at the office too, that I owed his master 6d., but his master denied that; he had asked for 1s. 8d., and what work there was for him to do; I should have given him the 1s. 8d. if he had not robbed me; nothing passed upon the subject of transportation between me and the master at any time - the prisoner has a mother - his being taken was not made known to her till after the hearing; she came and gave me her address - that was how I knew where to find her.</p>

No; I do not think he saw me - it was near nine o'clock; there was a glass door between us - I was about a yard from him; I am a butcher - I was standing in my shop, and the prosecutor said to me, "Just look into my shop while I get a light; "the prisoner did not hear that - I live next door: I could go into the shop without his seeing me - it was all done in a minute.</p>

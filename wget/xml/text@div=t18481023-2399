I went to 1, North Audley-street, and asked for the room of Mary Cooper, the prisoner—she went up to the top of the house with me, opened a box, and strewed her things about, and said, "You see I have nothing here"—I was not satisfied—I searched, and found this piece of coloured silk velvet (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—she had said she had nothing of the kind in the house—I also found some pieces of ribbon, thirty dozen pearl buttons, trimmings, gloves, and other things (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—most of them have my name and address on them—I found the drawers open next day, with nothing in them—the ribbons cost me 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—these things are worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have never sold such an amount of goods to my servants.</p>

I was at the search—the prisoner was asked if she had received any things of her sister Sarah—she said, "No"—she afterwards said, "I received a small piece of velvet; it was so creased, I took it to the dyers to be pressed, and he not being able, sent it back again"—I asked if she had anything else—she said, "No, you are welcome to see if you like"—I called Mr. Swain in—we went up into her room—she went in before I did—I cannot tell whether she unlocked the box—she said, "There is nothing there"—Mr. Swain searched, and found the things.</p>

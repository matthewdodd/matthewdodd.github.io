                  </hi>. I reside at 145, Tottenham-court-road, and am manager to Mr. Maple, an upholsterer there—we have a person Darned Jackson in our employment, a polisher—the prisoner Harris has worked for us, but Jackson was his master—he employed the prisoner for us—he was in the habit of coming there—on Thursday, 24th August, I saw him go up stairs—he went to a part of our place where there was nothing kept but chair frames, in a roof—I saw him come down and go out of the shop, and I followed him out down the Hampstead-road, and saw him go into Turrill's—that was the day before he was taken—I gave instructions to an officer named Chapple—the next day Harris came again, and went up into the same roof—I watched till he came down, followed him out, and saw the officers follow him to Turrill's—he had no business up in the roof—he had occasionally to go up to fetch chair frames down from the floor below, but not from the next floor—after he was taken I found some table covers, table cloths, pieces of cloth, and several other things in that roof—it is not a place where we deposit property in the course of business—I saw these table cloths (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) at the station-house when Harris was taken—they arc Messrs. Maple's property—the things I discovered in the roof were of a similar description, and I saw these very cloths in the roof the night before Harris was taken—I went up to see what there was, and saw these table cloths, and nine or ten more huge ones—when the officers went to Turr<lb></lb>ill's I waited outside—Turrill has no connexion with our establishment in any shape or form—I did not know the man—he is a tailor, I believe.</p>

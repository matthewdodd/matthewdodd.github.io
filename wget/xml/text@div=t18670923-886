                  </hi>. I am potman at the Duke of Wellington public-house, Brunswick Street, Hackney Road—about 7.30. p.m. on the 30th August I went to the privy door in the back yard—the prisoner was in the privy standing up, and he appeared to be adjusting his dress—I watched him from the stable, and saw him come out—he threw half of our clothes prop on the ground, and went to the bar and had half a pint of beer—I saw the prop was covered with soil, and I accused him of break<lb></lb>ing our prop, and with putting it down the privy—he said he was not there, and that I must have made a mistake—I told him I had made no mistake, as I had seen him in there and had seen him come out—he went down the yard again and looked down the closet, and then went out at the back gate—after he had gone I got a candle and looked down the closet—I sew a number of letters, a good many of which were torn in two—I got up some of the letters, about thirty-nine, and put them in a pail—there were four torn in two and thirty-five whole ones—I gave infor<lb></lb>mation to the Post Office authorities—from the time I saw the prisoner in the closet to the time I found the letters no one else had been in it.</p>

Q.</hi> You could not see the letters without the aid of a candle? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; they were very wet, and I got them out with a pair of tongs—he appeared to be sober—he did not seem to be ill—he walked straight enough into our house and back again—I cannot say whether he was tipsy or not, but he did not appear like it to me—I would not under<lb></lb>take to say he was not in liquor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of letter-carriers at the Bethnsl Green Post-office—in consequence of what the last witness told me I went to the privy—I received some letters from him, and I saw some pieces of letters down the pan—the letters given to me by last witness were in the envelopes, and have that day's postmark—they ought to have been delivered that day—I afterwards saw the pieces brought up from the closet—they formed parts of one ter, and bore that day's postmark—the prisoner at that time was a letter-carrier in the serviletce of the Post Office—he went to that district from my office about a quarter-past four, and in the ordinary course of things he would finish his delivery about six or a quarter past—the Duke of Wellington is not in his district—it is about two or three minutes off his beat—there was a letter addressed to Mrs. Richards, Vincent Street, Boundary Square, Shoreditch—that was in the prisoner's district.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The prisoner has been in the service of the Post Office nine years, has he not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he has not given very great satisfaction for the last year or two—we have not heard anything particular about his delivery—we have thought sometimes he has been in liquor—we hardly knew what to make of him, he has been rather sleepy-headed—there was not much light in this closet.</p>

I am an officer attached to the Post Office—in con<lb></lb>sequence of information I received, on the evening of the 30th August I went in search of the prisoner, but could not find him—I saw him about seven o'clock the next morning at the Bethnal Green Post Office—I asked him if he was not on duty the day before at four o'clock, he said he was—I asked him if he delivered all his letters for that delivery, he said yes, he delivered them all—I said, "Are you quite sure you delivered all your letters?"—he said, "Yes, I delivered all"—I said, "What letters were those you threw down the water-closet?"—he said, "I was taken ill, and had to go there, and they fell out of my hand, and I got a stick to get them up"—I said, "A great many of them were torn in pieces"—he replied that he got a stick to get them up—I then took him to the General Office, and afterwards to Bow Street—in the afternoon I went to the Duke of Wellington public-house, and in the privy I found the pieces of about thirty different letters, many torn across—I could read the addresses of only two, they were torn about so much—amongst them I found the ports of which formed a letter addressed to "Mrs. Richards, No. 2, Vincent Street, Boundary Street, Shoreditch," and also one to "Mrs. Willings, at Mrs. Abbott's, 46, Columbia Square, Charles Street, Hackney Road, London"—it bears the Staines postmark of the 30th August—those two letters are torn across the middle—the enclosures are there—there is also a letter to Mrs. Newman, of 95, Hackney Road, London, N.E.</p>

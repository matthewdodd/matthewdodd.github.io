                  </hi>. I live at 13, Rich Street, Limehouse—last Thurs<lb></lb>day night week I was passing the Lord Hood public-house, and saw Mr. Hobson, the landlord, shoving Driscol out—he pushed him down—he got up again, and went up the steps for his cap, and as he went up, the prisoner, with his two open hands, pushed him down, and he went on his back—he fell on the back of his head—I screamed, and ran for Driscol's wife.</p>

I was called to the Lord Hood about 11.30, and found the deceased lying on his back on the pavement, just outside the house—there was a little blood running from his head—I assisted in taking him into his house—when I came back I saw the prisoner putting up the shutters—he said I ought to have been there a little before, that he had had a bother with a man who had caught hold of the hair of bis head, and punched him three times—I afterwards Cook him into custody—he was potman at the Lord Hood—Driscol was then dead—he was about thirty-five years of age—he was in liquor; he smelt very strongly of liquor.</p>

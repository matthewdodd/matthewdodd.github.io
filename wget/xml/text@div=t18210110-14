            . I live in Fore-street, Limehouse. On Wednesday, the 27th of December, I was walking down the <placeName id="t18210110-14-crimeloc85">Horseferry-road</placeName>

The prisoner thrust his hand into my breast-pocket, and took out my pocket-book, I seized him directly, he gave it to his companion in front - I took him to the watch-house, the others ran away - it was done in an instant.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. You were not sober - A. I had been drinking at the George - I was not tipsy, but a little drunk. I believe three people were round me, I saw no more. I am certain it was not in a crowd. There was a lamp just by. I went alone with him to the watch-house. Three of us had drank three pints of gin and beer.</p>

            . On the 27th of December I saw three men go up to Webb, and the one on the right took a pocket-book out of his coat-pocket, it was the prisoner. Webb immediately collared him and took him to the watch-house. I was close against him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not this a very dark night - A. Yes, I was going from town with Webb, he told me to recollect what I saw. I was with him at the public-house - he was not very drunk. I should not know the others again, but I know the prisoner by his coat - there were only three men. I never said I was not positive of the prisoner. I stood close by Webb, and was following him.</p>

            . I am a headborough. I received the prisoner at the watch-house. The prosecutor was not quite sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was there a crowd - A. There were ten or twelve people round the watch-house. I asked the boy to point out the man from three others, he said he could not say which was the man.</p>

               <p>"You have taken my pocket-book!" he let that man go and seized the prisoner - I am sure he seized another man first. He seemed much intoxicated.</p>

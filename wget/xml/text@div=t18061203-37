            . - A. Yes; I went to the bank, and changed the 100 l. note for a 50 l. a 40 l. and ten ones. I then went to Messrs. Robinson and Simpson's and paid the 40 l. and eight ones, with some other monies to them. I then went home; I went into the warehouse, and laid my pocket book down on the counter. I went from there into the house, and changed my coat; I returned, and missed the pocket book. I asked the prisoner if he had seen my pocket book. He said he had not. I then felt about upon the counter for my pocket book, and amongst some waste paper I found it. I took it up and put it into my pocket. I then went to give my father the change, I gave him the bill that I had taken up, the two ones, and the fifty, as I thought; my father opened them and said there was no fifty; I had put them all together, I saw the fifty was not there; I asked the prisoner if he had seen any thing of it, he said he did not know any thing about it. Then I went to Mr. Robinson to see if I could find it, I could not find it there; I went to the bank, to know whether I was certain of the number of the note; I stopped the payment and came home. I have seen the bill since at Mr. West's, a grocer, in Shoreditch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. You are the son of the prosecutor. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. He has no partner. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He had given you an hundred pound, that you were to change, you had not the precaution as others have, to take the number of the note. - A. No, I had a recollection of the number, but not perfectly sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You went afterwards to the bank, to ascertain what the number was. - A. I went to ascertain whether I was right or not.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found that you had lost the note, did not you accuse a respectable young man, did not you say you had dropped it in that office. - A. I did not; I went to Messrs. Robinson, to know if I had dropped it there; not being able to find it, I was willing to try every means.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore in truth you did not know where you had dropped it. - A. I was not certain, I told my father I did not believe that I had dropped it.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw it afterwards, I understand. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. You saw the note in your pocket book, at Robinson's - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought you might as well go there before you accused any body. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did very right; had you taken any thing out of your pocket book from the time you came home, till you gave the notes to your father. - A. I had not; the note was dated the 5th, and I received it on the 8th; it was a remarkable number, and I had a faint recollection of the number.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the boy there then. - A. He was in the tap room, she said there was one of his sons in her tap-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Smith's father. - A. Particularly well, I went into the tap-room, I looked at the boy, I knew him very well, and all the family; I came out, and went in and looked at him again; he then went up the yard where the horse was, and the hostler, I followed him, I asked whose horse that was, the ostler replied his master's, and that the boy's brother had hired it to go to Edmonton; I asked the boy (Smith), which of his brothers, he said George; I said you are wrong there, for your brother George is in the country; he said he made a mistake, it was for his brother William. He then requested the ostler to let him take the horse to Edmonton, to his grandmother, he said his brother would meet him at his grandmother's. I then took him by the collar, I said you and I had better go and see your father, I understand you have a good deal of property about you; then he came out of the back yard with me into the kitchen; there he began very much to kick about; I held him, and Mrs. Barlow took the notes out of his pocket, in a canvass bag, and delivered them into my hand, Mr. Barlow took the numbers down, there were forty nine pound in notes in the bag, and a half crown piece. There were six two's, and all the rest were ones, there was some silver in his pockets; as soon as he was in charge of the officer, I went and informed his father; he is a gardener.</p>

               <p>Q. One would think you was the most accurate man in the world.

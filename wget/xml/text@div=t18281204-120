On the 16th of October, a few minutes past nine o'clock in the morning, this cheque (looking at one) was presented to me - my opinion is that the prisoner is the person who presented it; the largeness of the amount, and it being drawn for stamps drew my attention to it, and it is my belief that the prisoner is the person - I saw him two or three days after at Marlborough-street, three were several persons present at that time, and my recollection of the person enabled me to point him out from the rest; (referring to a book) this entry is made by myself, and I find by it that I paid for this cheque a 100l. note, No. 18,276, dated the 20th of September, 1828; one of 40l., No. 2,016, dated the 23d of July, 1828; and another 40l., No. 19,802, dated 21st April, 1828; and 10s. in cash - we do not make any mark on notes, we only know them by their number, date, and amount; (looking at three notes) these correspond in number, date and amount, with my book - the cheque was perfect when presented to me, it has since been punched, and part of the number of the house, which was 62 is punched out, and part of the G is wanted in the name Grote - that is our mode of dealing with cheques.</p>

            . I am a teller in the money office at the Bank of England. I have an entry made by myself on the 16th of October (it was about half-past nine o'clock in the morning,) of a 100l. note, (looks at one) this is it - it was presented to me to be changed for a 50l. note, and fifty sovereigns; there is "Matthew Riely, No. 11, New Turnstile, Holborn, on the front of it - I wrote that myself; it is usual for the person bringing the note to write the address, but I wrote it on this occasion - the same address is on the back of it, but the word "Stile" is punched out, that was on it when it was presented, and I wrote the same on the front, being afraid the address would be punched out - I copied it from the back, the front being the proper place to put it; I gave a ticket on the pay-clerk for a 50l. note, and fifty sovereigns.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose it is usual to take the numbers of the notes for which you give change? A. No; we only take the name, and what notes we give for them -I do not think I wrote this address in the presence of the person who brought it.</p>

            . I am a tailor, and live at Nos. 41 and 42, in the Poultry. On the 16th of October, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to my shop; he asked me how I did - I said he had the advantage of me; he said, "Oh, you must recollect me very well at Mr.Lane's, Lincoln's Inn-fields" - I then recollected that I had seen him at Mr. Lane's; he said he had lost an uncle, and wanted a suit of clothes made that evening by eight o'clock - I said it was a short notice, but we could get them done; I booked the order for a blue suit of clothes; the whole dress was to be blue - I asked his name; he gave me the name of William Maxwell, No. 4, High-street, Bloomsbury - after writing his name and address down, I said he was almost a stranger to me, and I should like a little deposit: he immediately said, "Oh, deposit; they say pay before hand is very bad pay, but here is the money" - he had a large canvas bag with him, which appeared to contain fifty or sixty soverigns; the clothes came to 8l. - he then said he was going to America the next morning, and ordered some shirts, a travelling cloak, and all the articles together came to 17l. - I am a tailor, hosier, and glover; he paid me the 8l. first, and paid the rest to my brother in my presence - I wrote the address he gave me in the order-book - he was going away, and had nearly got to the door when he came back, and said, "I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040048"></xptr>wish Collier you would give me change for these notes;" he produced two of 40l. and one of 50l. - I said I kept a banker's, and never kept so much money in the house; he then said, "Oh, any of your neighbours will change it for you;" I said, "No, if it is any convenience to you I will send the notes to the Bank for change" - he said it would be a very great convenience, and gave them to me for that purpose: I asked him to have the kindness to write his name and address on the top of the three notes - he then said his name and address were the same as he had given me in the order-book, and desired me to write it on the top of each note; I did so, and put 16th of October, 1828, and my initials - (looking at three notes) these are the three I received from him; here is one of 50l., No. 13,121, dated the 13th of September, 1828: No. 2,016, 40l., dated the 23d of July, 1828; and No. 19,802, 40l., dated the 21st of April, 1828 - I was going to give them to my foreman, but he said, "Oh, never mind the 50l., the two 40l. changed will be quite sufficient;" I then returned him the 50l. and gave the two of 40l. to my foreman, to take to the Bank and get sovereigns for them - he bought a canvas bag to put the sovereigns into which the man brought from the Bank, and he (the prisoner) left a bag behind him; on the following day I received this letter (looking at it): before he left, my man brought the sovereigns which were delivered to the prisoner - he put them into the new canvas bag, and took them away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The prisoner was dressed much as he is now, was he not? A. I cannot say - he ordered a blue suit; that was not a colour for mourning - that aroused my attention, and induced me to ask for a deposit</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I was sent for on the 16th of October, and went to the Goat public-house, Pall Mall, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, and found the prisoner there - he was given in charge by the landlord; he was very much in liquor - I searched him and found a 50l. note, sixty-six sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, and five shillings in silver on him, also some bullets, powder, and flints, and the landlord gave me a brace of pistols; I asked the prisoner about the property, he said it was the savings out of his wages - that he was going to Ireland to see his mother; I asked him name and address - he would not give me any name or address then, but at the watch-house he told me he was a clerk to Lane and Croft, of Lincoln's Inn-fields, and gave me the name of Riely - this is the 50l. note I found on him (looking at it); I laid it on the table in the parlour, and while I was counting the sovereigns be snatched the note up and tore it in pieces - we could not get it form him he was so violent; we found it on the floor at last - I am certain this is it, the landlord put his name on it in my presence; it has been pasted together, and I put my initials on it; it is No. 13,121, dated the 13th of September, 1828 - I did not see him write any note myself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The landlord of the Goat sent for you? A. Yes; I found the prisoner sitting down there making a great noise - he appeared to be very tipsy; the landlord produced the pistols; I suppose I was twenty minutes in the public-house before we could secure him - he was so violent, kicking us, and knocking us down, and knocking the tables down - I, Smith and another man were in the room; the landlord did not interfere, he was so much alarmed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not think the prisoner out of his senses? A. He appeared like a man that was so, but I really think it was the effect of liquor - I had never seen him before; he did not cry out - he was so tipsy, that next morning he did not know me, nor the man who handcuffed him - he lay down on the floor, and kicked and fought; there were three of us endeavouring to secure him - he did not bite me - I believe he attempted to bite somebody; he kicked me very violently - his coat was not off; I found the bullets in his waistcoat-pocket, and the powder in a canister in his coat-pocket; there was a fire alight in the room - the flints were in his pocket; I did not see the pistols in his hand - they were loaded, and had flints in them; there were balls in the pistols - the powder is taken out - they were not cocked - I do not know whether they had been.</p>

A.Latterly, I had - his memory was particularly defective, and at times he conducted himself so strangely, I could not account for his conduct; he asked me, about a fortnight before this, to lend him 10l., and I gave it to him - I have had a letter from him since, in which he says he asked me for 50l., but I have no recollection of it; I may have refused him a loan, as he frequently asked to borrow money - about a fortnight before this transaction, I gave directions for his discharge from the office - he called on me early in the morning, and was nearly half an hour in my library, protesting that if I discharged him he would not exist - that it must be his death- that he could not live without a character, and if I would take him back he would serve me as a slave - he said this quite in a wild manner, sometimes laughing, and sometimes crying, and in a familiar tone, quite different to his ordinary manner of expressing himself - he alluded to some intimacy with my maid-servants, which I could not account for, and I suspected at first that he was in liquor- I at that time would not consent to take him back, having warned him a great many times, as well as my managing-clerk, that if he absented himself, as he had often done, he would not be retained in the office, and I had made up my mind not to take him back; I was then going out - he followed me into the hall, and appealed to my feelings in the strongest manner, asking me if I expected<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040049"></xptr>mercy in Heaven if I shewed none here; he asked me to go back again to my room, which I did - he then went to the window, and putting his hand into his bosom, drew out a pistol, and solemnly commenced a sort of oath, declaring he would destroy himself if I would not take him back; I remonstrated with him - he had the pistol towards me, at that time, I approached to take it form him; he said in the most vehement manner "Beware, sir, it is loaded and cocked;" I afterwards ascertained that it was loaded and cocked - I told him I would not be intimidated, and ordered him immediately to uncock it, and stop it, which he did - fearing what might be the consequence of giving him a positive denial, I told him to come to my chambers at eleven o'clock, (this interview was about half-past eight in the morning, at my house) - I told him he must give me up the pistol before I could speak further with him: I knew he had an umbrella with a sword in it - previous to eleven o'clock, I went to where he lodged to satisfy myself if I could, of the cause which led to his present state of mind.</p>
               <p>Q.Then I suppose you considered his mind disturbed? A. At that moment I did, because I told him I could give him a character, as a copying-clerk, as a most excellent writer, in point of his hand-writing; I satisfied myself from my inquiries, and was at that time induced to think his regret at leaving my officer had been the immediate cause of his then state of mind - I believe he always had a great respect for me - he always expressed himself so to others; he came at eleven o'clock, certainly, in a different state, and in a state which he could not have been had he been in liquor at half-past eight - that was the impression on my mind, and as such I agreed to take him back, and lent him the 10l., he asked for, to pay some debt; he brought me a pistol at eleven o'clock, and said it was the one he had shewn me, and it seemed the same - it was then uncocked and unstopped, but was primed and loaded with balls.</p>
               <p>Q. Then your intention to discharge him arose from his absenting himself, and other causes,than the mode in which he did his business? A. Yes, for absenting himself, but his manner of writing was as good as ever.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. How long before he finally left you did this transaction take place? A. About a fortnight; he continued with me till within two or three days of the transaction in question.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.What made him go away finally? A. He discontinued coming to the office of his own accord.</p>
               <p>Q. At any time, except the occasion you have referred to, did he give any indication of this sort of passion? A. I always thought him passionate and strange - I have endeavoured to persuade him to conduct himself in a proper manner, and he treated it with levity.</p>
               <p>Q. But previous to this interview in the library, was this strangeness, or his intemperance, of such a character as to induce you to suspect a derangement or aberration of intellect? A. No; I thought he had been among players- he would enter the room in a forced attitude, when I have rebuked him - I was never aware of his having been in the company of players - I have asked him, and he has denied it; his manner was theatrical.</p>

            . I am in the service of Mrs. Mitchell, of Lancaster-place, Waterloo-bridge - I have very frequently seen the prisoner near the house - he never called there to my knowledge; the last time I saw him was about two months ago, about four o'clock in the afternoon - he was on the opposite side of the way in the street, walking backward and forward, beating his breast.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you appear at the drawing-room window? A. Yes; I saw him take a pistol, or something from his bosom, and hold it in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it held towards where you were standing? A. Yes; I stood at the window some time and then went out to him - he said he had come to wish me good by and presented the pistol - I said I was not alarmed; I knew him before; he said he did not wish to alarm me, but probably he should be a corpse before the following morning; he appeared extremely agitated - nothing else passed.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, from the conduct he exhibited to you, did you consider him in his right mind? A. I considered it extremely strange, and wrote him a note to say I thought it was bordering on insanity, as I thought so.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. How long have you known him? A. About eight months; I frequently saw him - he was making love to me; I had not refused him.</p>

            . I live at No. 17. Seymour-crescent, Somer's-town, and am clerk to an attorney. I have known the prisoner several years - he lodged with me once; I have not been on very familiar terms with him lately - he used to sleep with me; he lodged with my mother for about six months, and has occasionally slept with me afterwards: it was about eighteen months since, that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040050"></xptr>he lodged at my mother's - while he was there, at intervals his conduct was the very best, and at others the most extraordinary, in fact the must ridiculous; he has occasionally told me that if he could raise a sufficient sum of money, he could establish a title to a very large estate in Ireland- from the knowledge I had of his father and mother, I knew it was impossible, as their circumstances were quite the contrary to affluence; he very often, when lodging with me, would get up at two and three o'clock in the morning, and go stamping and fuming about the room, take off his night-cap and stamp on the floor; I have remonstrated with him, and he has said I did not know his mind, and could not judge his feelings - he said he was an object that the world had crushed; he would get out of bed in the middle of the night, and recite pieces from Hamlet, and from Richard - he always told me I could not tell what his feelings were; he frequently raved in this manner: I have remonstrated with him for spending his money in the most ridiculous manner, and told him his mother and father were objects of charity rather than of contempt, for he always spoke contemptuously of their poverty, not of their conduct to him - he has made no reply to my remonstrance that I recollect; he has frequently called out Murder! in the middle of the night, and when I have shaken him to awake him, he has seemed to imagine he was within the grasp of some superior force; and occasionally when he was awake he appeared to think so; at other times he would smile, and appeared to wish that I should not speak of such matters; his conduct has been so inconsistent at times, representing me, at one time, not his friend, and at other times as his best friend, as I have been told by others: I discontinued to visit him on account of his inconsistences, and I left the lodging - about four weeks ago, I met him going from Searle-street towards Great Tunrnstile - he was coming down from Holborn, and had the stick of an umbrella in his hand; he spoke to me - I rather crossed to get out of his way, when he stopped me, stamped his foot and called out "Villain!" I smiled at him, and rather laughed; he 
               <persName id="t18281204-120-person1051">drew</persName>
             a small sword-cane from the stick of the umbrella, and presented it at me directly - he put it up against my breast, I retired towards the wall and he followed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that he presented it at your breast, or thrust at you? A. He thrust it at me, put it towards me- I went to the wall and he advanced; I thought he was mad at the time, and asked if he had been drinking.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought that he was not in his senses, either from liquor or some other cause? A.Exactly so - the point of the sword entered my waistcoat; he called me a villain, and said "When I have got you, I will have you on the hip;" what he meant I do not know - he said his hand had wreaked vengeance on villains before then.</p>
               <p>Q. From the conduct he evinced when you saw him then, and from his whole demeanor, do you believe that at times he was out of his senses? A. I do firmly.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. The last transaction happened in Searle-street? A. No, in Lincoln's Inn-fields, against the dead-wall, about eight o'clock in the evening - it was about four months ago to the best of my recollection; it did not make such an impression on me, as to enable me to speak to the time - it is about eighteen months ago that we lodged together; that was in Clement's Inn-passage, not at my mother's, but he occasionally came to my mother's to sleep - to the best of my recollection I ceased to lodge with him eighteen months ago - he represented that he was entitled to an estate, not that his father and mother bad got any money; I was not hurt in Lincoln's Inn-fields- I laid hold of the sword; and it ended with my laughing at him.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought him mad, and it ended in your laughing at him? A. Yes - I rather unconsciously retreated against the wall; I have been in the habit of taking meals with him - he was remarkably extravagant. but not at his meals; it was in other matters - I have seen him in liquor but not often; it produced rather a merry effect - (looking at a letter) this is his hand-writing.</p>

            . I am a law stationer, and live in Portugal-street; I have known the prisoner about four years, or rather more - I have been in the habit of seeing him very constantly, but not within the last eight or nine months; I saw him constantly up to that time.</p>
               <p>Q.During your acuquaintance, what has his conduct been? A.Extremely strange at times: what first excited my attention, was his manner of stamping about the room; he would often come up, and walk up and down the room for about five minutes, making use of different expressions, but take no notice of whoever might be there, and give no answers to questions which were put to him, and about two years ago he came into the room apparently intoxicated; I thought he was so when he came into the room - he laughed hysterically, and said he had some good news to tell me; he then burst into laughter, which lasted for some time, and then told me his father was dead; I spoke to him about it; he said, "You don't know my mind," it was impossible for any one to know his mind, and that he had secrets which would die with him; I met him about two months after that, at the bottom of Chancery-lane. passed close by him, and he did not notice me; I tapped him on the shoulder - he took no notice of that, but kept on; he must have known me if he had been in his senses; he proceeded through the Temple - I followed him; he stopped several times in the Temple, and put his hand up to his mouth, as if thinking of something; he stamped several times, and appeared in thought; I was not in sight, but watching him; he then went on, stopped in William-street, folded his arms, looked up toward the clouds, knit his brow, his eyes flashed, he bit his lips and grated his teeth, as if he was thinking of something desperate; I then went over to him, and said, "Riely, what is the matter?" he did not notice me at first, but afterward turned round, frowned at me, and asked why I disturbed him; he did not wait for a reply, but said he had just been spending a few of the happiest moments he ever had - I said I thought that he was drunk, and asked if he was drunk, or what was the matter with him; he made no reply, but stamped his foot, and said, "Say no more about it;" previous to my first speaking to him, he said, "I'll do it," throwing his arms down - I then accosted him. I remember meeting him in Portugal-street, fourteen or fifteen months ago, about our months after the time I have mentioned - he was walking very fast; I stopped him, and asked why he was in such haste, and where he was going - he replied, very abruptly, "Out of the world;" he spoke in a very agitated manner, and his countenance was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040051"></xptr>very gloomy; he continued to say, "I am sick at heart - if you are my friend, leave me to my fate;" he has repeatedly spoken about suicide - I pressed him to go to my lodgings at this time, and he said that he thought he was born to be his own destroyer; he used to make suicide a general conversation - he often said it preyed on his mind that be feared his wits were deranged; that was last November twelvemonth - I was in the habit of seeing him frequently, till within this last eight or nine months - and from my observation of his conduct, I believe him at times to be out of his mind.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. You have seen him only occasionally for the last eight or nine months? A. No - he did not lodge with me - only visited me; he would quote from different authors, when he has passed up and down the room - he has not been an actor.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness; I have known the prisoner three years - he came to me one evening, about the 20th of September last, between six and seven o'clock; my husband was not at home - he came staggering in, as if some one was pursuing him; he appeared quite exhausted, much frightened, and looked very wild- I spoke to him first, and asked what was the matter with him; he said he was going to kill himself, and that he came to die there - that he must die in the course of three hours; he produced a pistol, laid it down on the table, and said it was loaded - he took it up, and shewed me that it was loaded with powder; this very much frightened me - he perceived that; he stamped about the room; I asked him if he would go, and after walking about the room about ten minutes, he went, and cried as he went away, and said he should never see me any more, wished me good by, burst into tears, and left - I had opportunities of seeing him before this occurrence, but never saw him conduct himself in an extraordinary manner before; that was the only opportunity I had of observing his conduct.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Do you happen to know whether this was when he had the disagreement with Mr. Lane, who was about to discharge him? A. I rather think it was - he said the pistol was loaded; he appeared overcome and agitated.</p>

            . I am a tailor, and live in Clement's Inn-passage. I have known the prisoner nearly four years, he lodged with me formerly, and Redman lodged with him in another house in the same passage; the prisoner lodged twice with me about four months, and after that for about two years, and it is two years since he left me - my idea was always that he was not correct in his mind, certainly, from his odd behaviour; the first thing I observed was when he lodged with me he bought a sword stick, I thought not much of that, but at last he played with it like a child, he could hardly keep it out of his sight, and always had it out - I told him I thought it was not proper conduct, and then he said he would run me through with it; I did not conceive that he meant to do so, but I told him I would not have such a thing in my house; I took it from him, and broke it; and afterwards, some time before he left me, he bought an umbrella with a sword in it - I would not allow him to keep it in my house; he pledged it, and said he could have it out then at any time he wanted it; his conduct was never at all like a reasonable person - he would come in as gloomy as if he were going to drop into the grave the next moment, and a few minutes after would be laughing and cheerful - then change again to the very reverse; I do believe he was at times subject to fits of insanity.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Did you apply to any medical person about him? A. No, nor have him removed from my house.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q.Did you think his behaviour was affected or real? A. I did think it was real - he would sometimes affect it, and recite plays, and so on, but I believe it was real; I do believe it was the effect of a disordered mind.</p>
               <p>- WILLIAMS. I live at No. 50, Brunswick-street, Blackfriar's-road - I have been an eating-house keeper, but am not in business at present. I have known the prisoner eight or nine months last past - the latter part of that time his conduct has been extraordinary; on one occasion, he frequented my house to dine - that was about the 12th or 13th of September; I know the date, as I gave up my house on the 15th: on one occasion he came to my house, and took refreshment, after which, a baker who lived opposite came in - he then concealed a knife under his sleeve, and went out; I followed him - he then shewed me the knife, and said "Why dare that rascal enter the house;" I said "Riely, pray put the knife down - don't conceal it in that manner;" he then came into the house again, and in a short time the baker left the house; Morell, who had lodged with me six months, came in - he looked at him in a most varacious manner - he went, and caught hold of a large carving-knife, presented it to the lodger's breast, and asked him if his life was not in imminent danger I at first thought it was a joke, but I was obliged to interfere - I never saw a man look so wild in my life - I was obliged to get the lodger to bed: he was not drunk; in the early part of the time I knew him, he conducted himself well, and dined up stairs among respectable persons - he would come down to the shop to order his dinner - he would pat his head before he could recollect what to order- I told him what I had got, and he would at times order his meat, and say "Bring me all the vegetables you have," and at times he would say "Bring me all you have" - not saying vegetables; persons in the room have observed that, and made remarks about it within a week of the time I gave my business up; I believe his conduct to be the result of an unsettled mind: on the same evening (I think) he was going out, he followed me about a dozen yards, and said"Williams, I shall never like a woman again" - speaking in rather a troubled hurried, manner; I parted with him as soon as I could; his conduct at last very much alarmed me; I did not like to disturb the neighbourhood by calling the watch, as there was another man present when he presented the knife, and I thought no harm could come.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did he lodge in your house? A. No - it was not him I wanted to get to bed, but my lodger; I prevented the prisoner from getting at him - he tore his coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did his saying, he should never like woman again, make you think him mad? A. No - his presenting the knife, and his manner generally, and the manner in which he said he never should like woman again - he turned and spoke to me in the most abrupt manner; I was no acquaintance of his.</p>

            . I keep the King's Head public-house, Pall-mall - it was formerly the Goat. I was subpoenaed here about an hour ago - I remember the prisoner coming to my house on the day he was taken; I had never seen him before - he came a few minutes after one o'clock,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040052"></xptr>passed by the counter, and asked if he could dine; I said he could have a steak or chop - he said, "Let me have rump steak and a bottle of sherry, and I shall be proud and happy of your company;" I said I was obliged to him, but I did not drink sherry so soon - I went up stairs to dress, and when I came down, he again sent for me to drink a glass with him; I apologised and declined: he went away, and came again about seven o'clock, and said,"You would not do me the favour to drink a glass of wine with me before, but I shall be happy to drink with you now" - I said I was not found of sherry, but would drink a glass of weak brandy and water, which he ordered; on sitting down he pulled out a note, and asked for change of a 50l. note - I said the people had all shut up, and I could not get change; he said, "Well, drink your brandy and water, and I will be back directly - I am going to Egg's;" he went out, came back, ordered a bottle of port, threw a brace of pistols on the table, and again threw the note on the table: I said, "Really, from the manner you have behaved with this note, I should think it is not a good one"- he said, "You villain, I will blow your brains out," and raised the pistol to me; I caught hold of him, knocked his arm on one side, and caught him by the neck handkerchief - the servant came to my assistance, and the patrol was called in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you believe at the time he was going to shoot you? A. From my not knowing him before, I really cannot say; the officer examined the pistols afterwards - they were both loaded; he was sitting close to me on the same seat when he presented them - he brought them in openly in his hand; I have inquired at the gunsmith's, and found he had changed another pair of pistols for them - he is a very powerful man.</p>
               <p>Q. From what you saw on that occasion, do you think the man was in his senses? A. I should think not, for he could not escape if he had shot me - he must have been taken immediately; he had taken part of a bottle of sherry at one o'clock, and in the evening I do not think he tasted the brandy and water, but believe he drank a glass of port.</p>
               <p>Q. That was not enough to produce such conduct as the effect of liquor? A. I should think not.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q How many times was he in your house that day? A. Three - on the first occasion he had a bottle of sherry, of which two other persons partook, I understand so from my servant, but was not present; he was absent from two till seven o'clock - he did not apply to me to change the 50l. note on the first occasion, but he did to my wife, as she told me; he applied to me at seven o'clock, before he went out, and again when he came back with the pistols.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he earhest with you to procure change for the 50l. note? A. Yes - he said he was going to Ireland next morning, and that the note was of no value there; I told him it was as good there as in England, and on my intimating there was something wrong, he jumped up with the pistols; I do not suppose he would have presented them if I had not said that.</p>
               <p>The letters identified as the prisoner's writing, were as follows: - </p>
               <p>To Mr. Collier, Nos. 40 and 41, Poultry,</p>
               <p>Sir - Be so good as to send my bag, and the articles I bought of you to the Police-office, Marlborough-street, immediately, and ask for Mr. Riely; my name was not Maxwell, but Riely.</p>
               <p>Friday, 1 o'clock.</p>
               <p>To - Gates, Esq. Solicitor, Lombard-street Newgate, Nov. 1, 1828.</p>
               <p>Sir - I have to request that the clothes which I purchased of Mr. Collier may be delivered up to me, as I am here without even a change of linen; I cannot anticipate that my prosecutors will offer any objection, indeed I have every reason to think, that had I mentioned my wish before the Magistrate yesterday, it would have been complied with, and he (by the officer) sent me word, that had I mentioned it when they were there, he would have seconded my request, and he authorised me to say as much; of course the purchasing the clothes, and the forgery are two distinct things, and as I am committed for the capital offence, I trust that you will not think it necessary to detain the clothes from me; I would also mention, which I beg you will state to my prosecutors, that I have not even the means of employing a solicitor for me at my trial, begging an answer at your convenience. I remain, Sir, your most obedient servant, MW. RIELY.</p>
               <p>Be so good as direct, "M. Riely, No. 23 Ward, Master's side."</p>

            . Q.Is it your opinion, from what you have related, that he was subject to occasional aberrations of intellect, or that he was always so? A. Subject to attacks - I have seen him at times perfectly himself.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Were you acquainted with the reason of these attacks? A. No - he never would tell me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, it is your belief, in the ordinary transactions of life, that he was not capable of judging of the difference between right and wrong? A. At times, for the reasons I have given.</p>

            . Q. You were eighteen months in the employ of Messrs. Lane and Co. - during all that time the prisoner occupied the same office with you? A. Yes - I never have observed any thing singular in his behaviour.</p>
               <p>Q. His behaviour was not such as to lead you to suppose his intellect was deranged? A. No, certainly not; I have seen the cheque - I should not say that it was an imitation of Messrs. Lane and Co.'s signature.</p>
               <p>Q.Is it in the prisoner's natural manner of writing? A. No - I think it a little constrained.</p>
               <p>Q. to HOPPER BANKS. You observed nothing singular in the prisoner's behaviour? A. Not at all - I cannot state whether any words passed between us; I think it very probable that I asked him in what notes he would take it- I observed the cheque, and imagined it to be the handwriting of Messrs. Lane and Co., or I should not have paid it; the cheque is dated the 15th - it was presented on the 16th.</p>

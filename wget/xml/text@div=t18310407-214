               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe you offered to let the prisoner go if he gave you what you paid to redeem the coat? A. I did - I did not play at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070103"></xptr>skittles with him after I lost my coat, and do not think I played with him that night.</p>
               <p>GEORGE KETTERES. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Sun-street, Bishopsgate. This coat and handkerchief were delivered to the prosecutor on the 10th - it was pawned by the prisoner on the 8th of March, about nine o'clock in the morning; he said it was his own - that he worked at the docks; I talked to him for some time, and knew him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner delivered in a petition for mercy, and received a good character.</p>

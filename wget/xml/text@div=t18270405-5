I awoke about a quarter past three o'clock in the morning; he was then gone; I got up, and missed my watch on searching for it, as my aunt had alarmed me; I went down stairs, and found the street door shut; the lock had caught, but it had been unbolted within for I had locked and bolted it myself before I went to bed; the prisoner did not return. I found my watch in pawn three or four days afterwards, at Mr. Kimber's, at Knights-bridge.</p>

            . I am journeyman to Mr. Kimber, a pawnbroker, at Knightsbridge. On Tuesday morning, the 13th of March, this watch was pawned with me, for 25s., by the prisoner - I am certain he is the person; he came again on the Thursday, with another man, to show the watch to him; he produced the duplicate - I granted a fresh one, and took the other back; I believe he sold the duplicate to the other man, but I am not certain - he had it put in the name of John Tipping, Old Bailey, by order of the man who was with him - he had pawned it in the name of John Russell, No. 22, Kensington-gore; there is a ribbon, seal, and key to it; they are worth together 3l. 10s. - they would fetch that at a sale.</p>

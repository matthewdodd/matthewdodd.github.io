                  </hi>. I live in Noble-street, and am a porter. On the 5th of December I was at the end of High-street, near Oxford-street—I had a parcel on my shoulder—Strong called to me, and I missed my hand<lb></lb>kerchief out of my pocket—I turned and followed him to Lawrence-street—I saw Labern about twenty yards down that street—he had another lad With him, who I believe was King—I went up and asked how they could be guilty of such an action—they said they were not guilty, and one of them threw open his jacket for me to search—we then left them to follow another person—I afterwards took Labern to the station-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Upper Gardner-street, Vauxhall-road. On the evening of the 5th of December, I was near the end of Oxford-street—I saw the two prisoners, and another with them—I watched them into High-street, St. Giles's—I then saw King take a handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket, and give it to Labern, who gave it to the other boy—I told the prosecutor—we crossed and went after them—we left these two to follow the third boy, but could not catch him—we turned down a court to see for him, and the two prisoners came to peep after us—we took Labern—King came to the station afterwards, and was taken—I am certain of the person of both the prisoners—I had watched them for five minutes.</p>

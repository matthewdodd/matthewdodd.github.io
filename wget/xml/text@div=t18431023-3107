I am a builder, and live at pulse-bill—the prisoners were in my service, about February last, as plasterers—I believe they were working in Clapham New-park—I had a rule there—I was there almost every day—I saw that rule there afterwards, and it had been altered—it had been made narrower at each end, which was for some purposes more convenient than if it was a regular size all the way through, as I had had it made—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">look<lb></lb>ing at it</hi>)—it had been as wide at the ends as it is in the middle—I had it made about twelve months ago—I observed "E B "was cut on it, which had not been on it before—I saw Byfield when be came to the building—I asked how he dared to take and put his name on my rule—he said it was not my rule, that a person named Wren made it for him, for doing a job just above—I said, every man on the building knew it was my rule, by a singular place on it, that Wren never made it, and every person in the building knew it to be the truth—he then said if Wren did not make it for him, it belonged to Haines—I said, if he dared to take it away, or Haines either, I should lock them up wherever I found them, for stealing the rule, as it was mine—this was in the latter end of May—I was at the building, and observed the rule was missing in July, and I sent to the prisoners, by a boy who they employed to work for them—I sent three different messages—Haines at last came to me on the 7th of August, and brought this rule, it was on a Monday morn<lb></lb>ing, and he seemed as if he had been drinking—he said, "Do you call this rule yours?"—I said, "Yes, certainly I do call it mine"—he said, "You are a d—liar"—he said, "I will tell you how I came by that rule; it belonged to the Asphalte Company "—I said it certainly did not—he said, "Their name is on the rule now"—I said it certainly was not, "E. Byfield" was on it—he said it was not—I turned it up, and said, "There it is"—he said "He had a right to put it on, he and I are partners"—I said, "Where is the Asphalte Company's mark?"—he said if it was properly cleaned it would appear—I said it was not, he persisted in taking it away, and pretended as if he was going to knock me down—I said, "If that is it, I shall not leave you till I give you into custody"—I followed him about a mile, and then gave him into custody—I</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did they immediately afterwards bring an action against you for false imprisonment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, but that was only to bounce it over me, that I should not go to the Sessions—the Magistrate said, "You can take the rule, and do as you like"—I said, "No, I won't, they may contend that I altered the rule," and the rule has been in the hands of the policeman ever since—the pri<lb></lb>soners served me with a process—I dare say that was dose to get rid of me—the solicitor came and tried to laugh me out of it.</p>

               <p>standing about here till Tuesday, I said, "I won't stand about here in this way"—I went to Union-ball, and applied for the warrant—I believe that was about four o'clock—the policeman went with me, and the prisoners were locked up that night, I believe, and taken the next day before the Magistrate—he said he had no power—he certainly did not let the prisoners go, be<lb></lb>cause they came to Newgate, and laid here all nights—I appeared before Mr. Justice Erskine last Sessions—he ordered the prisoners to be admitted to bail—on that J asked for my expenses, and he said I should have every farthing—he said I should have them, if this did not turn out to be a vindic<lb></lb>tive prosecution—I certainly never said, that if they would abandon their action I would my prosecution, or any thing of the kind.</p>

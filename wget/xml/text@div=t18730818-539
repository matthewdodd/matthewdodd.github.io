                  </hi>. I am a seaman, belonging to the ship <hi rend="italic">Hudson</hi>—on 7th August she was lying in Shad well Basin—the prisoner was also a seaman—the deceased, Swan, came on deck that night between 12 and 1 o'clock—there was a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> going on on deck—he bad a knife in his hand—he said "I come to see fair play, because I heard some of you are going to double-bank <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi>, and two or more are going to get on one"—Williams is <hi rend="italic">Bob's</hi> right name—the fight was between Williams and Watson and the boatswain—the prisoner said that if anyone interfered he would put his knife into him—one of them said "What have you got to do with it?"—the prisoner said "I like to see fair play; I have struck a blow already for you once"—the prisoner struck Williams two or three blows with a belaying pin—the deceased went towards the prisoner with his knife, and raised his hand—the prisoner struck him three or four blows with the belaying pin and broke his knife, and then the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> was quiet between the deceased and the prisoner, but the other fight went on between Watson and Williams—Watson began to fight with the deceased, and after, that the deceased went to the prisoner, and the prisoner and him got fighting, not with their fists: the prisoner had a belaying pin, the deceased had nothing in his hand at that time—he struck him several times, and the deceased threw the prisoner down on the deck—they both went down—when they rose up the deceased said "Oh, Lord! I am stabbed," and fell to the deck—just before they both fell, I saw a knife in the prisoner's hand, as well as the belaying pin; the knife was in his right and the belaying pin in his left hand—I saw him stab the deceased in his left side, and the deceased fell after he was stabbed—he was bleeding—the prisoner then stood over him, and struck him twice across his head with the belaying pin while he was on the ground, and then threw the knife on to the quay—the vessel was lying close to the quay—the deceased was taken to the hospital—a policeman came on board, and the prisoner was taken to the station—I suppose he could have got away before that, there was nothing to stop him—neither the deceased nor the prisoner were tipsy—I don't know what they were fighting about—it was an American ship—the deceased was a man of colour, like myself, and so was Watson.</p>

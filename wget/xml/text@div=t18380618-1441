                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs. Fousse, of Alder<lb></lb>manbury. The prisoner was engaged at their house as a dresser of gloress—in consequence of something I heard on the Friday before the 10th of June, I sent for a policeman who came—(the prisoner resides within two doors of our factory at Battersea)—Mr. Fousse asked the prisoner for him key, and he gave up one key, which I believe was the key of the sitting room—the other key he rather objected to give up—I am not sufficiently acquainted with French to know what he said, but be appeared to object, till Mr. Fousse said he insisted upon it, and he then gave it up—he was taken into custody, and Mr. Fousse and the policeman went away with the two keys—this was about ten o'clock, and we had to appear before the Lord Mayor at twelve o'clock—they returned at that time, and brought with them forty-seven dozen of gloves which I have examined, and the I are the property of my employers—Mr. Fousse and the policeman went away again on the Saturday, but no more property was produced that day in my presence—it was on the Tuesday morning after—I have heard the prisoner speak of going to America.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you hear him say any thing about it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Many times—I cannot say any particular day—I will say last month—he said as soon as he had saved 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of his wages he would go—I thought well of him—he could not have taken all the pro<lb></lb>perty at one time—it must have been taken at a variety of times—we have been robbed every day since he has been there—it is not possible the property in the mattress could be taken at once—we did not miss any portions of property from the warehouse—the principal part of these gloves are in an unfinished state, they require, what we call, dressing—it was in that employment the prisoner was engaged in Aldermanbury—there is pro perty of this description at Aldermanbury—I am able to swear that the whole of these came from there—I have known the prisoner about twelve months—Mr. Fousse engaged him, I believe, out of pure charity—he has told me so—he is a Frenchman, and so is the prisoner—I did not apprise him before he was taken, that I suspected he had I got gloves at his house—he</p>

               <p>was never asked whether he had taken gloves from time to time to his house for the purpose of dressing them—I did not see any part of the property found at the prisoner's—the greater part of this property requires to undergo the process of dressing—they are cut at Battersea, sewn at Torrington, and then come to us in Aldermanbury, to be dressed for sale—there were two Englishmen employed as dressers, besides the prisoner—I am not able to identify any of this as property that has been missed—we could not miss any—we manufacture about four hundred dozen a week, and without we take stock, we could not miss any—we have taken stock si nee this, but have not missed these articles—it is impossible to tell what we lose—we cannot tell whether we have lost any.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Windsor, and am a carrier. I employed the prisoner to drive my van—on the 12th of April I employed him to come to London with the van and a mare—I overtook him, with the van, without the mare—he said the mare had set to kicking, and had kicked her entrails out, and he was forced to have her killed—if he sold the mare I have not received any money for it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had he ever received money for you before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, never—if he had delivered any goods on the road it would have been his duty to have given me the money, but he had no goods to deliver—I was behind with another wagon—he had delivered goods four or five years ago, but he never took any money—if the mare had been killed, or died, and he was obliged to sell her, it would have been his duty to pay me the money he took—he did not do so—he never had received any money for me before—I asked him what he had done with the mare—he said he had left it with some policemen and some gentlemen—I asked him whether he had received any</p>

The prisoner was employed by me for three months; he boarded in the house, but lodged out. This property was in my warehouse shortly before it was taken. The officer came to me on Monday morning, the 24th of March, and asked if I had a lad named Tunnicliff, and produced these articles, which I knew to be ours - I compared them with the pieces in the warehouse, from which they had been cut, without our knowledge. The prisoner was then in custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. Did you receive a good character with him - A. Yes. The silk matches the pieces they are cut from. There is an irregular mark in the warp, which tallies exactly.</p>

            . I am an officer of Farringdon ward. On the 22d of March, about half-past eleven o'clock at night, the prisoner was brought to the watch-house; he had this silk, one piece in each trowsers pocket, and the other in his coat pocket. He was too drunk to speak or open, his eyes. A young man who had been drinking with him said they both lived with Mr. Leaf, who claimed the property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. In what state was the other young man - A. Tipsy, but not so much so as him. The young man said he knew nothing of the silk.</p>

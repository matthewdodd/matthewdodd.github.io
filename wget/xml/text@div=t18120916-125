               <p>Q. When was your house broken open - A. On the 15th of May, between eleven and twelve at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at home - A. No, I was not; I went out to get a pint of beer. It is a double house. I live in the shop. The shop was broken open; it is part of the dwelling-house. They came in the passage; there is only one passage to both dwelling houses. The door of my parlour leads into my shop. That door had a padlock on.</p>
               <p>Q. If I understand you right, they came into your passage, and broke open the door that leads into your shop - A. Yes, that door was fastened with a padlock. I found the staple drawn.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you leave the shop - A. Between eight and nine. I did not find it out until the morning, at seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, from between eight and nine at night until seven in the morning, you cannot tell when it was done - A. No; when I came at seven in the morning, I found the staple drawn. I went to Bow-street, and got an officer. We searched the house I live in; we found none of the effects there. I lost eight pair of boots, seven pair of shoes, and some leather.</p>
               <p>Q. You know nothing of the robbery - A. I don't know either of the prisoners, only my boots being found in their room.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 4th of August, I apprehended the prisoner Bull. Limbrick and I searched him, and found a duplicate of one boot, pawned at Mr. Lamb's, Stanhope-street, Clare-market. Mumford was in company with Bull. He said, that Bull had sold him a duplicate of a pair of shoes. Bull was present when he said that. I took him in custody, and went to the office, that is all I know respecting Bull. On the 7th of August, I apprehended Mackdonald. He ran away from us; we got him afterwards. I took him to the office, and searched him. In his pocket I found this centre-bit, and the model for making it; and a gimlet in his pocket. At his lodging I found the stock for it. The centre-bit is so high tempered, it will cut through iron. He had a new pair of shoes on his feet; I took them off. I went to find out his lodging. A little girl came out of the door; she said, I know whose shoes they are. They are my uncle's. I said, I wanted to know where he lived, for we wanted an old pair of shoes for him. That little girl went and shewed me his lodging. I searched his lodging; I found one boot hanging up, and another in a basket; they were both new boots. The one that is in pawn is the fellow to this one. They sent a one legged man to pawn it.</p>

            . On the 4th of August, Mantz had Bull in custody when I went into the public-house. I asked him if he had searched him; he told me he had not. I searched him; in his pocket I found this duplicate of a boot, pawned for a shilling at Mr. Lamb's, Stanhope-street, Clare-market. On the 8th of June, he told me it was a duplicate of a waistcoat; I and Mantz and Mumford was there at the time. Mumford said, he had given him a pair of shoes to pledge on the 7th of June. I and Mantz went in pursuit of Mackdonald; we were sitting in a public-house waiting for him. When he came in I laid hold of him; he struck me a violent blow in my mouth. He escaped for that time, and ran from the house; we pursued him. He was stopped in Exeter-change; we brought him to the Brown-bear in Bow-street. Mantz searched him, and in his pocket he found the model, the centre-bit, and gimlet. The stock of the centre-bit was found at his lodgings; and Mantz found there also the two new boots.</p>

I asked him how much I was to give for it. He said, six shillings. I gave him one shilling, and part of a pint of porter towards it. The next time he met me, he asked me for the remainder of the money. I told him, I had not got it. He said, he must have the boot, he could make more money of it.

            . I am a porter. In June I was at a public-house with Bull; he told me that he had a ticket of a pair of shoes, pawned for four shillings. He told me, if they fitted me, and I gave four shillings more, I should have them. I went with him to the pawnbroker's. I tried the shoes on; they were too little for me. I paid the interest, and left the shoes behind.</p>
               <p>Mantz. I produce the boots and shoes.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. These are my shoes; I can swear to them. This single boot is part of the property I was robbed of, and so are the boots found in Mackdonald's room.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of all the things you found - A. Sixteen pounds. Bull told Mumford that he had taken a sack of boots, shoes, and leather.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mumford. What did Bull say to you - A. Bull said, if he had known that I wanted a pair of shoes, he could help me to a pair, he had plenty. He did not say where he got them.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Do you sleep in the house - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Bull's Defence. I will say no further than the truth The tickets of the shoes and boot I had on purpose for these men. The man whom I got them from, I did not know where he got them.</p>
               <p>Macdonald's Defence. To this hour I never had the misfortune to be brought to a bar of justice; for this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160071"></xptr> reason, I never deserved it. Where the boots were found was not my lodging, I only called there to have a little washing done. I am acquainted with a number of men in the coach making trade.

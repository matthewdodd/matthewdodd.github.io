                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, residing in Acre-lane, Brixton. I remember 10th Jan. last—on that morning I was applied to by the prisoner at half, past 4 o'clock—she came to our door, knocked at the door, and told me that Mr. Jones was dead—I immediately jumped out of bed, and asked her when; she said that morning, and would I come in—I did not go in with her—I dressed myself and followed her, I was not more than five minutes—I went to the deceased's house, it was only three doors off; I lived at No. I, Springfield-cottages, and Mr. Jones lived at No. 4—on going to the door I was let in by the prisoner—I saw the deceased lying on the sofa on his back, with his hands across his bosom, he was in an inclined position, not flat on his back—he appeared to have recently died—I pulled aside the blanket that he was wrapped in, and put the back of my hand upon his hand, and it was warm—the prisoner said nothing further to me at that time; I said I would go and call my son, and leave him with her while I went for Mr. Key.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> During the thirteen years that you witnessed her treatment of him, did you ever see anything that warranted you in supposing that she was ill using him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never saw anything of the sort, neither did I ever hear Mr. Jones make any complaint—he was reputed to have money, and to have some poor relations—I know a man of the name of Collins—he was a witness before the Coroner; the verdict of the Coroner's Jury was accidental death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long after the Coroner's inquest was it that there was any examination before a Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The inquest was held on 14th Jan., and the prisoner was apprehended on the 31st—I was examined as a witness before the Magistrate—I believe there was an attorney employed there—I, cannot say whether the depositions that were taken before the Coroner were also before the Magistrate—Collins was not examined before the Magistrate; he was ordered to be in attendance, and was there, but was not examined—he is a jobbing gardener—it was no doubt necessary, from the deceased's age and infirmities, that the prisoner should move and assist in moving him about—I have seen her assisting him, and I have seen her washing his feet and dressing the wounds on his heels from the chalk stone gout—the stones came out of his heels, and likewise out of his fingers—I was the first witness examined before the Coroner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, living at Brixton Oval. I am a member of the College of Surgeons—I have been in the habit of attending the late Mr. Jones medically for the last eighteen years—I have known the prisoner for that time—she lived in the house as his housekeeper for about thirteen or fourteen years—on 10th Jan. last I was called to Mr. Jones's house about half past 5 o'clock in the morning by Evans—I did not get there till a little after 8 o'clock—will you allow me to explain why I did not go before, as observations have been made about my being so long in going? I was sent for to another patient, who died that morning, and I could not get there before—I found Mr. Jones in the back parlour, lying on his back on the sofa; he was quite dead—he had his usual dress on, except his coat—I am not quite sure whether he had his coat on, I think not—I saw the prisoner there—she was in the room when I came in—I asked her some questions about his death—she said he died about half past 3 o'clock—I asked what time be had been down—she said he was lying there all the night—I said, "Why not get him to bed?"—she said he was so helpless the night before that she could not get him up to bed, and he requested her to sit up with him, which she did; that he lay on the sofa till about half past 3 o'clock; that she gave him a little water, and immediately upon giving him that he died—I asked her what time he came down on the Sunday, the day previous—she seemed to be unable to tell me, till at last I found that he came down about 4 o'clock on the Sunday afternoon, that he had his dinner in bed, and came down after dinner, and that he had not gone up stairs again—I asked her if he made any noise, any snoring, or any symptom of apoplexy—she said no—I asked if he had said anything—she said he asked her for some water—I said, "Did</p>

               <p>be say nothing more?"—it was a very confused account that she gave me—I did not make any further inquiry with regard to his state during the night—I do not remember asking as to his being insensible or not—by his asking for the water I considered he was sensible—I then proceeded to make an examination of the body—I examined the whole of it externally—I saw several bruises on the head, principally the right temple, and one at the back part of the head—they were contusions, not wounds; the skin was not broken—there were several marks on the top of the head and slight abrasions of the skin, but the two principal ones were the one on the right temple and the one at the back of the head (<hi rend="italic">pointing out their position</hi>)—there were also two on the forehead—they were old affairs—I mean they might have been done ten days or a fortnight before—among the bruises I saw, some appeared to have been inflicted a longer time than others—those on the forehead were the remains of former bruises—the contusion on the right temple might have been done within a week, or it might have been done within much less time—that at the back of the head might have been done within five or six days, or a week, or it might have been done very recently—it was rather more puffy than the one on the temple, rather more swollen—that would lead me to believe that it had been done a shorter time than the other—this was my opinion from viewing the wounds externally—there was also another wound on the lower part of the middle cartilage of the nose, that part which divides the nostrils—I cannot say it was broken, but it was in a state of ulceration—I cannot say whether that was from a fall or a blow-—it had been done a longer time, I should think—the septum of the nose was ulcerated—that might have been from violence, or be might have had a fall—the ulceration might have been caused by violence or by a fall—what I mean is, I do not think it was done by disease—that injury must have been done more than a fortnight, it was not of recent occurrence—there was a bruise on the right knee, and an appearance as I thought of a burn on the left knee—the injury on the right knee might have occurred from a fall on the knee or the side of the knee—it might have been produced by his falling on his knee—it was a very slight bruise, there was very little appearance of it—I think those were all the external injuries that I observed—I afterwards proceeded to make an internal examination of the head—on taking off the scalp I found a number of patches of extravasation on the right side of the head, corresponding with the external bruise on the right temple, and effusion of blood—the extravasation was on the scalp, under the bruise—the effusion was inside the head—the patches of extravasated blood were outside the head, beneath the scalp, between the scalp and the bone, and the effusion was inside the head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is effusion of blood different from extravasation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Extravasation is a small effusion, and when it is in a large quantity then it is called effusion—that was at the same side as the bruise on the left temple.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HODSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the blood that was effused there immediately in contact with the brain or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, because there was the membrane between—I found effusion of blood between the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi>, which is the external covering of the brain, I should think to the extent of an ounce and a half or two ounces—that amount of blood in that position would cause a pressure on the brain, and that pressure would be sufficient to cause death—the substance of the brain itself, independent of the pressure, was perfectly healthy—it is possible, notwithstanding that pressure, that he might continue to have his senses down to the act of death, or within a few minutes of death; because it does not follow that the effusion took place immediately upon the violence used; I mean it might have accumulated gradually.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you have any conversation with the prisoner about what you found in the internal examination, or about the bruises? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Upon being asked about the nose, she explained that he had fallen on the stairs, and that he was always falling about; that he had a fall in the garden—I think she said the fall on the stairs was a long time ago—I do not know that she said when it was that he fell in the garden—I had seen Mr. Jones about two months before; he was then perfectly well in health; I did not observe any bruises about him at that time; I had on previous occasions; about the beginning of Aug., last year—except being subject to the gout, I should say he was a perfectly healthy man—I saw him about the first weeek in Aug., about the 7th or 8th Aug.—I then observed that he had some bruises on his face—the prisoner was present when I saw him in Aug.—I asked him, in her presence, how he came by the bruises—she said, "Don't tell him," and he did not answer me—she was very abusive to me—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">stated, that it was upon the latter ground that the evidence was tendered</hi>)—she was very abusive to me for speaking to Mr. Jones—when I asked Mr. Jones how he came by those bruises, she said, "Don't tell him;" and she said, "I have got the money, and you told Mr. Jones not to do it"—I told her that I had given Mr. Jones conscientious advice—I had given Mr. Jones advice about money—I think I had had conversation with the prisoner before, on the subject of Mr. Jones's money, but not upon that individual point, the transfer of the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when I said I bad given him conscientious advice, she said that she had got the money, and that I had advised Mr. Jones not to do it—she went on for about an hour—it was mere personal abuse—if I was to give you the whole of the conversation, you would think I was casting ridicule on the Court—her conduct towards me was more from a personal quarrel, that I had advised Mr. Jones not to do this—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE ERLE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">thought this personal altercation could not be relevant; the evidence was not pursued</hi>)—I produce the probate of the will of the late Mr. Jones—I am the executor under it—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HODSON</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">stated that the will was dated</hi> 11<hi rend="italic">th May</hi>, 1850, <hi rend="italic">and that the prisoner was made residuary legatee</hi>)—I think I had seen Mr. Jones once or twice since Aug.; I have been to the house once or twice; I have not always seen him when I have been; sometimes I could not get in; that was previous to Aug., from May to Aug.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe he felt it due to you to leave you 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I duly inserted that in the will, assuredly—will you allow me to state what he first said about the will?—I did not draw it at my own house, and then take it to him</p>

               <p>to be executed; I drew it at my own house, and took it to him to look over it; and when he had read it, I told him to bring it down to my house, and he should execute it—he did bring it down to my house—nobody came with him, he came by himself—I had not told him to come by himself, nor suggested that he had better not bring Mrs. Vickers with him—he came alone, as he had always done previously—I have drawn many wills before; I have drawn the will of a person dying of cholera when an attorney was not to be found—no attorney was present at the drawing of this will, nor any one on Mr. Jones's behalf; I am no relation of his, only an old friend—it was in Aug. last that the prisoner's abuse of me took place; she did not refer to the legacy that I had left to myself; not at all—that was not a part or a principal part of the abuse; it was not referred to—I only wanted to know how he got those black eyes—she did not say a word to me about how I got the legacy—I think the prisoner had lived with Mr. Jones in his wife's lifetime; I think she came to him before his wife died, I am not quite sure—she died in 1838—the prisoner had been in attendance upon Mr. Jones from 1838—he had no domestic servant except her—she had to perform all the offices of the house, and to attend to him, and to all his wants—he suffered from chalk stones, that arises from gout—they ulcerated, especially about the heels and hands—that would render him extremely feeble—he might be liable to tumble if left alone; I cannot say that he would not tumble down; still it did not impede his walking very much.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Should you, as a medical man, leave a patient of yours, of eighty years of age, and upwards, with ulcerated chalk stones, to walk about by himself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, he could walk by himself, and walk very well—you ask me would I leave him alone; and I say I should not have had the least hesitation in leaving him alone—he could walk about alone—I certainly should not have the least hesitation in leaving a patient of mine in Mr. Jones's state to walk about alone—he could come down to my house—he has been to my house much within a year and a half ago—he might have come down alone once or twice within the last two years—I cannot tell you any time at which be came—I should say he has come to my house alone within the last two years—I have no doubt that he might; but I cannot say—I cannot say positively—if I could remember the date I could swear to it—he often used to come in when he was passing—when I saw him at his own house in October, he walked up and down stairs, and walked about very well—I would not undertake to swear that he walked down to my house within the last two years, not without being able to give you a date—I should say that within these two years he was fully competent to do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Nobody asked you that—you are asked for a fact—you say you should say he has come to your house within two years—the learned counsel has asked you to carry back your recollection, and collect your thoughts, and then asks if you are certain of that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot recollect from any particular circumstance that he was there within two years—he was at my house at the date of the will—that I can swear—and that is not much above two years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>at all to do with his death—there were bruises on the forehead—they had nothing to do with his death—there was an extravasation of blood between the bone and the scalp, a bruise on the right temple, and one at the back of the head—there was extravasation there, in the scalp, but not in the head—I cannot say that that had nothing to do with the death—there was extravasation under the scalp; but there was no effusion in the head—the contusion at the back of the head might have caused death, from concussion only—there might be concussion without any mark at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What I want to get at is, not a speculation about concussion, but whether there was any blood, connected with that bruise, which was in any way whatever connected with his death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was no effusion from that contusion at the back of the head that would cause death; but he might have had concussion—I do not mean to say that that bruise had nothing to do with his death—it possibly might, by concussion—if there had been no effusion at all in the head, I should have said he died from the effects of concussion—concussion does not cause blood at all—if vessels get full and burst, that it not concussion—concussion does cause that—I do not know that apoplexy is constantly caused by concussion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have spoken of two blows on the forehead which might have caused concussion; was there any difference between the blow at the back of the head and the two on the forehead? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Most assuredly; the one at the back of the head appeared more extensive, it is a more important part of the head—a blow there would be more likely to shake a person—there was no effusion of blood there, still he might have died from the effects of that blow—I suppose that bruise at the back of the head had existed, it might have been, three or four days—not so much as a week or ten days; four or five days was the utmost—concussion would cause insensibility at once.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">IS</hi> that your mind?" The blow at the back of the head was within four or five days; if death had been caused from this blood from concussion, immediate insensibility would have followed the blow;" is that so? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; but the effusion might have taken place in much less time than three or four days, it is impossible to say—I say the bruise could not have been caused longer than five or six days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Am I rightly reporting what you have said, that if that had caused concussion five or six days before, insensibility would have supervened immediately? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Supposing it bad been done that time—if it had been within a few hours of his death it would have had the same appearance as if it was four or five days before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, whenever it occurred, there would have been insensibility from the time of its occurrence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; the man might recover from the effects of concussion in a few hours—if he died of it, he would not recover—a man when he becomes insensible from a blow, may recover, or he may die in a few minutes—with respect to the blow on the right temple, I not only found extravasation beneath the skin, but effusion on the brain—that was quite sufficient to account for the death, if there had been no other blow; and supposing I had seen no other bruise than that on the back of the head, I should have said, "This man died from concussion," because it left nothing at all behind it—if I also found effusion of blood, I should say either one or the other caused death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you the least doubt in the world that death was caused by effusion of blood from the blow on the right temple? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that death was caused by violence; he might have died from the effect of concussion—I have not the least doubt that the quantity of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185304040134"></xptr>
               <p>blood I found effused on the brain would cause death; I say it was quite sufficient to cause it; or he might have died from the effects of concussion from the blow at the back of the head—there was sufficient evidence of the blood effused on the brain having caused death, I firmly believe that that was the cause of death; or it might be the effect of the blow at the back; it is impossible for me to say which of the two blows caused it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I must have an answer to my question in the form in which I put it. Do you, as a medical man, believe that death was caused by the effusion of blood on the brain; you must have some belief, surely? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was evidence enough of it, I can say no more—there was quite sufficient to account for death—I can only answer your question as I did just now; it was either from that, or the effect of concussion—I should say there was quite evidence enough that it did cause it—I believe that the effusion of blood was occasioned by the blow on the right temple.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, attached to University College Hospital. I have heard from Mr. Key a description of the injury said to have been received by the deceased on the right temple, and the appearance of the head, on <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, having an extravasation of about an ounce or an ounce and a half of blood pressing on the brain—I have also heard a description of the puffy wound at the back of the head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing a person to have received, either by accident or design, a blow or injury on the temple, and to have remained for some time after in a state of consciousness, and after death to have presented the appearances that Mr. Key has described in this case, in your judgment is it probable that the first injury on the temple might have congested the vessels of the brain, and that a subsequent blow or injury might have caused a lesion, and so a suffusion of blood on the brain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it probable that a blow on the right temple at a previous period would render a man more likely to suffer from a second blow, and to suffer more severely than if no such previous blow had taken place—I do not enter into a physiological explanation, but so far as the facts are concerned, I think a previous blow would render a man more likely to suffer severely from a second blow, and in a different part of the head—a blow on the temple, not followed by such a suffusion of blood as to cause insensibility, would be likely to be followed by a highly congested state of the vessels—I think the vessels of the head in that congested state would be more likely to be ruptured by a subsequent-blow, even of a slight character, than if they were in a state of health—I think a subsequent blow in any part of the head might have that effect—it would be more likely than under any other circumstances; anything that increased the circulation would have a tendency to produce extravasation in the part.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does it not repudiate the notion of concussion producing the death, the result of the blow behind, when you imagine it possible that the blow behind might have produced the effusion that was found under the scalp? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The two suppositions of course could not exist at the same time, though they are not incompatible—they are incompatible, but they are allowable as suppositions—I never saw the body—I think it would be highly dangerous for me to take on myself to say what caused the death, and I should not wish to undertake to do so—I think the circumstances detailed by Mr. Key render it impossible to say what was the cause of death.</p>

               <p>found no other cause; I should say, in all probability that did cause it—if the general appearance of the body was healthy, I should say the very strong probability would be that the cause of death was injury to the head; I would not say what injury, but seeing a number of bruises external and internal, unless I saw the patient during life, I could not say what was the cause of death.</p>

I have lived there more than fourteen years; before Mr. Jones came—I lived next door to Mr. Jones, and was in the habit of seeing him daily—I remember his coming to me on New Year's day—he came to the garden fence, which is a low fence, between my house and his—on his coming to the fence, I saw that he had a large bruise, a large lump on the right temple, about the size of a walnut—and just above that there was a large wound on the right side of his head, about the size of a moderate sized teacup, as though the flesh and hair were cut off it—it was bleeding—it appeared as though it had been inflicted about a day and a half—blood was issuing from it—I observed nothing on the left side of the temple—I observed nothing more on that occasion with respect to his appearance—he appeared in good health and cheerful, he was quite jocular with me—formerly I saw him daily—before New Year's day I saw him only about once in two or three weeks—I have seen him frequently at the fence, and sometimes at the side door—he would have to walk from his house to my fence not so far as from this rail to that corner (<hi rend="italic">pointing to the rail of the witness box and the corner opposite</hi>)—he walked without support—he was able to walk some distance about the garden, and run if occasion required—I last saw him before 1st Jan. at the door—I had not seen him in the garden with the prisoner for a long time before that—I should say the last time I saw him in the garden with her was about six months ago—after New Year's day the prisoner came to me—I recollect when she spoke to me about some money—it was last spring—she told me that Mr. Jones had promised to make over 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to her, but that Mr. Key had prevented his doing so, but that she had defeated Mr. Key, for she had got it done, and as soon as the breath was out of Mr. Jones's body she could go to the Bank and take the money—she said she was tired of waiting for an old man, and then she would get married to a young one—she said that she would make Mr. Jones remember going from his promise as long as he lived—nothing more passed on that occasion—she has repeatedly come again to me, and spoken upon that matter since then—on the Thursday before his death she did so—she said she was tired of her job, and should be glad to get rid of it, that was, waiting on Mr. Jones—she then said he would never go where he had been the Thursday before—that was to take an annuity—I said to her, "Why, Elizabeth, you alarm me by saying so"—I said, "Is Mr. Jones ill? because if he is, and you want assistance, call me, and I will come at any time; I will fetch Mr. Key or any other doctor you choose"—she said, "Oh, no, he is very well, but I shall know where to come to if I want assistance; but I tell you he will never go where he was last Thursday, though he eats and drinks very well; but I shall be glad to get rid of my job," and she then went in doors—this was all at one time, on the Thursday previous to his death—I heard of his death on Monday morning, 10th Jan.—on the Friday before his death I remember the prisoner coming to the house—it was a little after 11 o'clock at night—I was near the fence I have been speaking of, close to the house, very near the front door, Mr. Jones's side door—I was looking out, and saw her lying on the ground, near the door—she was very much intoxicated—she</p>

I will kick the life out of you;" and then she kicked him, and he fell down and groaned, and cried most bitterly—then she says, "Now come, get up, get up;" and she still kept hitting him and beating him—I could hear that it was with a heavy stick, as well as kicking him—I heard her say she would kick him, and kick the life out of him—then she says, "Come, get up, get up on the sofa. for I want to go out again"—I did not hear Mr. Jones speak after that, but she went out shortly after.</p>

               <p>not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was about showing himself out, because she had for many months kept him shut in, not allowing him to go out—she did not know of his seeing me; that, poor man, he did in her absence—she would not let him go out if she knew of it—this occurred the night after he was so jocular with me—I saw him about 3 o'clock, and this occurred at 5 o'clock—this was not the means by which he got the wound I have spoken of—he had that wound before—nobody was with me when I heard all this, I was outside—Mr. Jones had told me that he feared he should be a murdered man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you think it worth while to go and prevent his being murdered at 5 o'clock that night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Why, Sir, I had been told that unless I heard him cry "Murder!"I could not have the house entered—I have heard that from several persons—I had inquired, and learned that unless he called "Murder!" I must not go in, and the police had not power to enter the house till "Murder!" was called, and Mr. Key had told me to call "Murder!" and "Police!" and then I should have some one in—I know Mr. Key as a neighbour, nothing more—he said that in my presence—it was when Mr. Jones was showing his bruises to Mr. Key, and Mr. Key wished to take him away and place him in apartments, fearing what would be the end, from what Mr. Jones had told him—I mean to swear it was from what Mr. Jones had told him—it was from being told that I could not go into the house without hearing "Murder!" called that I did not interfere on that occasion—that was the reason, or I should have done it—that was the reason why I did not call the police, or interfere—I was at the fence when I heard Mr. Jones beaten, the garden fence, close by his parlour window, between the two houses—he was being beaten in the back parlour—I was very near the parlour window.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why not knock at the window, or break it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was broken, and that was the reason I heard it all so plainly—I state facts to you—persons have been to the house when he was being beaten, and could not get in—I did not look in at the window because the blind was drawn—I noticed that—I did not try to get in—I could not look through the blind—I tried to look through the window—I did not touch the blind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why not move aside the blind, and see what was doing; if there is one word of truth in what you have sworn, why not have screamed out to your neighbours and called attention to it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I knew they were about taking him away; means were being used to take him away, and I was to tell Mr. Key of all that occurred—whenever I heard the beating I was to tell Mr. Key, but I did not tell of that till after his death—it was not in my power to extricate him—I was watching for the purpose of telling Mr. Key—the reason I did not interfere at that moment was because I intended letting Mr. Key know, in case they had the power to do something—if I could have seen him out of the house, I should have dragged him down to Mr. Key's house—I had seen him that afternoon, but this dreadful beating was afterwards—he had a bruise when I saw him in the afternoon—it was a wound—I had then made up my mind when I saw him again to take him to Mr. Key's—if he had called "Murder!" I should have gone to the police—the only reason why I did not go the police was because he did not cry "Murder!"—this beating continued for about half an hour from the beginning to the end—I was standing at the paling—his groaning was at the last—I was at the fence then—I did not attempt to look through the hole in the window, because the blind was drawn—I never called anybody's attention to it—I intended to—I have frequently heard him beaten, and he has come to me afterwards—I am sure it was a stick that I heard him beaten with—he must</p>

               <p>have had a good many blows—the first blow I heard appeared as though it was on the face; that appeared with the hand, after that she used the stick—I think it was a broomstick; there was scarcely a broom in the house but the handles were broken off—I have since understood that they were broken off in this way—when the door has been open I have seen long brooms without handles, and one I know was purchased, she told me so herself, not a long time back—I thought at the time it was a broomstick—all the brooms are broken—I have seen them standing there when the door has been left open—I have very little doubt they were broken about Mr. Jones's head, from hearing him beaten—months back I heard him beaten with a small stick like a cane, but since Christmas it has been with a broomstick—not a day since Christmas but he has been beaten with a very heavy weapon—I heard her beating him on this occasion I should say pretty nearly half an hour—I heard blows of different kinds—I should say nearly half that time she was beating him with the broomstick—I have not a doubt it was a quarter of an hour—it was not gently, but very heavy—she seemed to be doing it as hard as she could, it sounded like it—I could hear it was blows falling on a person, and I heard him say "Don't, don't 1 oh, don't! oh, don't!" several times—I had no doubt what was going on—I did not interfere because I knew it was Mr. Key's intention to take him away, and I knew his nephews would take him away as soon as they could get him outside of the house—they have been repeatedly to take him away, and the door has been shut in their face, and she would not let them enter, and I was looking for them to come to put an end to this—I did not expect them to come at that moment. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But <hi rend="italic">do</hi> not you see, here is an old man, eighty-three years of age, being beaten in a way that must have soon killed him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> And I have heard him beaten quite as much as that, and seen him the next day with black eyes; I have seen him with three bruises on his head at the same time, therefore I hoped I should see him again, and I was in hopes of seeing a policeman to take him away to Mr. Key, the executor—I could not do it—my father was in my house at the time, nobody else, I am sure of that—this is a retired neighbourhood, there are not many persons passing; where we live it is very retired—a gardener lives in the next house, his name is Conolly—I did not knock at his door—they are people that have not interfered in the business—I should have let Mr. Key know—the Conollys bad not the power to take him away; that is what I mean; they had not the power to interfere in the business any more than I had; it was the executor and the nephews that could interfere, I could not—I had a very good reason for not speaking to Conolly—he is no more than a private individual—it had been the opinion of the neighbourhood for a long time that Mr. Jones would be found murdered; but they said Mr. Key and the relations were about to interfere, and they would not do anything in it—I knew, that without bearing, "Police!" or "Murder!" cried, Conolly could not have had the house entered any more than me; and then he is very deaf, that he could not have heard it if I had called him—I feel persuaded he could not have heard Mr. Jones, he is too deaf; he might have heard me, but I dare say he would not have gone upon what I said; he must hear himself, to go before a Magistrate or to the police—I do not think he could have heard Mr. Jones—I did not think of that at the time, it is your speaking of it makes me say it—Miss Hammond lives at No, 3—she is not deaf—she has no servant—I did not think of knocking them up; I did not know them at that time—during the whole of this half hour I did not see a person pass by—I think I should have seen them if they bad; it was dusk; I cannot tell you anything</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, P</hi> 111). I was on duty in Acre-lane, on 1st Jan. I know the house that was occupied by Mr. Jones—I saw the prisoner at 12 o'clock that night coming home, I believe from the Duke of Wellington, but I did not see her come out of there—a man named Collins was in company with her—they went as far as the front gate of Mr. Jones' house—the prisoner was drunk—I saw the deceased Mr. Jones in the garden, lying down—I had seen him fall—he was in the act of shutting the shutters—he had no hat on, or any coat—I did not see him come out of the house—the shutters are in front of the house, towards the road—he shut them as close as he could, and turned with the intention of walking in doors, and in doing so he fell in a forward direction—he did not fall against the wall, I am quite sure of that—he fell on the gravel pathway upon his hands—that was before the prisoner and Collins had got up to the gate—after they came up to the gate I told her that her master had fallen down in the garden—she asked me who her master was—I said, "Mr. Jones"—she said, Dr. Key was her master—she then went into the garden and took him up by the arm, and took him in doors backwards—Collins and I remained outside the gate for about five minutes, and then he went in one direction, and I in another.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the P division of police. In cones quence of information I received, I went to the house No. 4, Springfield cottages, about half-past 8 o'clock in the evening of 31st Jan.; and before I reached the house, I saw the prisoner come out, with a man in her company—they stood at the garden gate—I saw her give the man a bottle, and what I thought was some money—I think that was a man of the name of Evans, the witness who has been examined here to-day—I went up to her, and asked if her name was Vickers—she said, "No"—I felt convinced that it was her, from the description I had, and I entered the gate—I told her who I was, I did not tell her the charge until she entered the room—I then told her that I took her into custody upon the charge of being concerned in the death of her late master, Mr. Jones—she was very violent indeed before she got into the room—there is a fore-court in front of the house, and it is some little distance to get to the door—she resisted him in getting to the door—we were just between the gate and the house—she certainly was very strong—it is very difficult to take a woman into custody to what it is a man—you cannot use the same violence—in fact, she overpowered me—when I told her the charge, she said she had nothing to say; she should say nothing; I think it was, "I have nothing to say," or, "shall say nothing;" it was words to that effect—I went to a drawer in the house which the prisoner pointed out to me, and in it found this pocket-book, which contains a transfer for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I produce it—when she saw me take that pocket-book, she snatched it out of my hand—(<hi rend="italic">this was a transfer for</hi> 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">into the joint names of William Jones and Elizabeth Pickers, dated 20th Nov.</hi>, 1851.)</p>

I accompanied superintendent Lund to the house in question, on 31st Jan.—after searching the house the prisoner was taken away in a cab—I accompanied her—she asked me who were the persons that were going to be brought forward—I told her Mr. Jones, Miss Hammond, and several others—she said, "I know Miss Hammond never saw me ill treat Mr. Jones"—she then asked me what Mr. Jones had to do with it—I said, "He charges you with causing the death of his uncle, your late master"—she said, "I expected that; I wonder that you did not come before"—I searched the house—I believe 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was all the money that was found In the house.</p>

I am the owner of the house in which Mr. Jones resided—I was in the habit of seeing him continually from time to time—my attention was called to the fact of his death on the 28th or 29th Jan,—that was after the inquest—I believe the inquest was held on the 14th—I made a communication on the subject of the death of Mr. Jones to Mr. Norton, the Magistrate, and thence followed this prosecution.</p>

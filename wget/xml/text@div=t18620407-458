I am a plumber and painter, carrying on business at 123, Pennington-street, St Georges-street—the prisoner was formerly in my employ—to the best of my knowledge he left at the latter part of March, or the beginning of April, in last year—I deal with Mr. Burrell—I have occasionally sent the prisoner there for goods—I never sent him with any book containing orders for goods—I used to send the orders on bits of paper (<hi rend="italic">looking at five receipts produced</hi>)—I never authorised the prisoner, or any other person, to obtain those goods for me—he was not at work for me during this time, and I never saw him till I saw him at the police-court, after he had been discharged by me—I believe this is the prisoner's handwriting.</p>

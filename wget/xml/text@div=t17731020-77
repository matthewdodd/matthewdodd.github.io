            . Bradley, Crofts, and I, were at the Sun in Green Arbour-court one afternoon drinking; Carter came in, and called Bradley out; he staid with him about ten minutes and then came in again; then Bradley called me out and said now is the time to go and rob Keep's house, they are both out at market. Accordingly I, Crofts, Bradley and Carter went out together; Carter went first; at last Bradley stopped and said this is the place; accordingly I got over the wall and Crofts followed me over; Bradley and Carter staid on the outside of the wall; I went and opened the latch of the back door; it being dark I went back to the wall after I had opened the door; there I found Bradley and Carter; I told them I wanted a light; Carter wanted to go away; presently he fetched me a tinder box and candle, which I gave him; he took the tinder box and candle and went back into the house with Crofts; there he struck a light; presently after this Bradley came over the wall and came to me; we all three went into the house together; we went up stairs and plundered the drawers; then we went to the corner cupboard; we took away the plate; I do not know the particulars; there were table spoons and salts among them. After that we went to the closet in the same room; Crofts broke it open; I saw money lying in two boxes when they broke them open; there was gold in one box and silver in the other; Bradley and Crofts took the money while I was searching and packing up the linen I found there; Bradley ran down stairs, I and Crofts went after him; Carter had the handkerchief that had the linen; we went over the wall; Carter was gone; he was there when I came back for the light, but was gone after we had robbed the house; Bradley then went, as I believe, to Carter, to the Sun ale-house, and Crofts helped me up with the linen, and then Crofts and I went to one Muling's, in Blue-court, Saffron-hill; I left the linen there all night; Crofts and I then went to the Sun, and found Bradley and Carter together; we paid the reckoning there; then we all four came out of the Sun together; as we went along Carter wanted some money, and Crofts gave him a guinea. Carter had refused at first to go and be concerned in breaking open the house; he said he would be satisfied with a guinea, and would desire nothing more of us; then Carter left us. Then Crofts, Bradley, and I, went to Saffron Hill; there we shared the money; my share of the money came to twelve pounds. Though Carter at first said he would be contented with a guinea, and would not accept of any other share in the money, yet a day or two after I met him, and he insisted he should have a share of the money, and if we did not give him a share of it, he would give information against Bradley. On Monday afternoon we sold the plate for six guineas and a half; that was shared with myself, Crofts, and Bradley. I had no share of the linen, Crofts and Bradley made a hand of that.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner</hi>). I have teen about three years in the employment of Messrs. Taylor &amp; Son, plumbers and contractors, of 45, Fish Street Hill—I was employed as a labourer—Johnson was foreman—he was there when I went there—Messrs. Taylor are plumbers to the Corporation—a man named Blewitt was in the service—he was my mate—it was Johnson's duty, as foreman, to send me to the work in the morning—on Friday morning, the 17th December, Blewitt was with me—Johnson called out the men's names, and sent them to their different jobs—he said to Blewitt "You can go on to your work at Guildhall, I want your mate to go round to Rood Lane to a job, to get some things away"—the men had then gone to their different jobs—I went to Rood Lane, and took a set of window cloths to Nimmo, the painter, and brought back a pair of steps to the shop—that was about 7.20 in the morning—Johnson then asked me if I could get rid of a bit of white lead—I said, "I don't know, I will try"—he said, "Go up and put a bit in a pail"—the white lead and pails was kept in the first floor—I wont up stairs, put the white lead in a pail, put another pail on the top, and brought it down stairs, as I had been directed—when I came down Johnson said, "Put it down behind the truck"—I put it down and stood a little while—he said he would go round to Rood Lane with me—he then said, "You go round there, and then go where you like and get rid of the white lead"—I left the premises about 7.40 or 7.45—Johnson helped me with the pails on my shoulder—I went down Eastcheap and up Rood Lane—I then turned back again, down St. Mary-at-Hill, up Thames Street, up the steps of London Bridge, over the bridge, down Tooley Street, down several streets which I don't know the names of—I went down several streets round Bermondsey—I walked about and got tired of carrying the load about—I went into Mr. Jackson's house—I did not know anything of Mr. Jackson before—he is a plumber, in White Street, Southwark—he was not in the shop—directly I got in at the door Mr. Davis, the officer, rushed in, and I went a step into the parlour, and there was Mr. Jackson, I suppose, and some children—I had not seen anyone to speak to in Jackson's shop—I did not know the officer—I did not know who he was—I thought it was some lion coming, or something, into the place, he came in so fast—I had not sold, or attempted to sell, the white lead—the officer pulled the things off my shoulder and said, "I am a police officer, I shall take you into custody for robbing your masters."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You were charged, before the Magistrate, at the same time as Johnson? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I was not examined as a witness there—I have never made any statement before to-day—I have not told it to any<lb></lb>one, only to Mr. Wontner, who appeared for me at the Police Court—he told me to tell the truth, and I made a correct statement to him as to how the thing happened—he did not say it would be better for me—I don't know whether my sentence will be lightened in consequence—it has not been conveyed to me that the prosecutors will recommend me to mercy if I made this statement—this was the first time Johnson spoke to me about taking white lead—my regular work was the Corporation work—I had been working, the day before, with Blewitt, at Guildhall and the Sheriffs' Court</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187001100009"></xptr>
               <p>—we were both to go to the Sheriffs' Court on the 17th—I and Coleman were in the habit of being kept back for the purpose of cleaning out the office at Mr. Taylor's, when we went at 6 o'clock in the morning; we were often kept till 9 o'clock—we should not go into the City to work till after we had done cleaning the office—florae of us used to go at 6 o'clock; the plumbers don't come till 7—we do not do the office in the winter, the boy Alfred Gunnell does—I had not been doing the office that morning—I used to stop and sweep up the place sometimes, when my mate did not come to his time; that was under Johnson's direction—he kept the time of the men, and distributed the work to which they went—there are a great many men employed sometimes, but only about six or eight at that time—Mr. Ascott, the junior clerk, was examined before the Lord Mayor, and also the boy Alfred—Mr. Ascotts' right time for coming was 7 o'clock, but some<lb></lb>times he was not there to his time—I think it was a little after 8 o'clock when I got to Mr. Jackson's—Mr. Taylor, senior, does not come to business every day; either he or his son is there every day—nobody in particular, that I know of, has charge of the material up stairs—if we want material, we do not go and take it, we have to ask for it; we do not go up and help ourselves, unless we are told by Mr. Johnson or Mr. Taylor.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). I received instructions with reference to Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am a mineral water manufacturer, Norfolk House, Globe Road, Mile End—I have been in the habit of supplying Mr. Perrett at the London Bridge Refreshment Rooms, and the Broad Street Refreshment Rooms, with mineral waters—Westley senior has been in my service some time—his son was also a paid servant of mine—the boy Humphries was not in my service—he was paid by the Westleys—Gabriel was in my service—</p>

               <p>he was employed to deliver express orders—the Westleys had commission as well as a salary—Gabriel had no commission at all—the Westleys have been six or seven years in my service, and Gabriel four to five—Gabriel had a book supplied to him for the delivery of mineral waters—there was a par<lb></lb>ticular book for Mr. Perrett supplied to him—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Gabriel used to drive a one horse van and the Westleys a pair horse van—my brother, who was the manager, would superintend the loading of Gabriel's van—he would take an account of the goods put in the van—on the 20th August, 23rd August, and 2nd September, Gabriel took out goods to deliver to Mr. Perrett—he had no goods to deliver to any other place—when he goes out in the morning the counterfoil which is left in the book is unsigned—the other part is left with the customer as an invoice—I find some of the counterfoils in this book signed by Denham, who was Mr. Perrett's cellarman at London Bridge Station, and Trodd, who was the cellarman at Broad Street Station—the book is brought back after the delivery with the counterfoil signed—I don't know Denham's writing—Gabriel had no right to transfer any portion of the mineral waters on either of those days to the Westleys' van.</p>

               <p>gave it to the elder Westley—I then saw Gabriel count out three dozen, and put them in a basket, and carry it to the two-horse van, and give it to Westley—the younger Westley was then in a public-house—after the con<lb></lb>versation with Gabriel he left, and went into a public-house; he came out of the public-house, got up in the van, and drove it away in one direction, and Gabriel went in another direction—on 2nd September I was in com<lb></lb>pany with Lawley—I saw Gabriel deliver goods at London Bridge on that day, at Mr. Perrett's stores, in Joiner Street, Tooley Street—before he went there I saw him deliver two dozen at a coffee-shop in Duke Street, Tooley Street, to a Mr. White—he then went to Mr. Perrett's, where he delivered four dozen of lemonade, in two boxes—I then saw Gabriel go through Snow Fields, Union Street, and through all the back streets, to Southwark Bridge, where he met the two-horse van and the Westleys and Humphries—they went to Upper Thames Street, where they had a conversation for four or six minutes, and then the younger Westley drove to Southwark Bridge again—Gabriel followed behind with his van—they stopped in Sumner Street, Southwark, and young Westley left the ran and stood about twenty yards off—I saw Gabriel and the elder Westley pass four boxes containing lemonade and soda from the one-horse van to the two-horse van—Gabriel also put two dozen of soda water in a basket, and put them in the two-horse van—the younger Westley could see what was being done—when he saw the first box come from Gabriel's van he started away and stopped about twenty yards off—I went up to him where he was standing—I told him I was a police officer, and I should take him for being concerned in receiving a quantity of lemonade and seltzer water from Gabriel—he said "I have had nothing to do with this transaction, and I have told them both of it many a time"—I then went up to where Lawley had stopped the two-horse van—I told the prisoners I should take them down to the station, and we did so on the van—on the way to the station young Westley said to his father "I have told you not to do this, and it is through you I have got into trouble"—about 2 o'clock the same afternoon I went with Lawley to Mr. Perrett's, where I saw Denham—I had seen him before open the door to Gabriel at the stores—I saw him when Gabriel delivered the four dozen lemonade—I told him we were police officers, and asked him what he received in Joiner Street on that day from Gabriel—he said "I don't know him by that name; I know <hi rend="italic">Tom.</hi> I received a gross of lemonade"—I said "How did you receive it?"—he said "In three boxes of four dozen each"—I said "Did you receive any seltzer water?"—he said "Yes, two dozen"—I said "Did you count them?"—he said "Yes"—I said "I have only seen you receive from Gabriel four dozen of lemonade, and no seltzer water, and I have been watching you all the time"—he made no reply—something then passed with Mr. Perrett, and he was given into custody.</p>

I have been employed by the elder Westley about two years—I used to go out with the van—on 22nd August I was outside Mr. Edmonds' yard, Globe Road, and I heard Gabriel say to the Westley's "I will meet you where I met you on Saturday"—young Westley said "I will have nothing to do with it"—I had been out with them on the Satur<lb></lb>day,</p>

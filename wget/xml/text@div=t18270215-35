I was hustled about, till they got my watch out of my pocket, and then one said, "Let him go;" as soon as I got out I left the field, turned round the outside of the field, and came in again at the small gate; I spoke to a friend, named Ralph Ruddick, who was standing there; he is not here; and, in consequence of what passed, I went to find an officer, but could not. I had some gold taken out of my left-hand trousers pocket; it was from I sovereign to 3; four men walked out of the field, and I followed them into another field; they went out of the footway across the field, when they saw me following them; I believe the prisoners to be those four men.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you first seen them? A. When they left the crowd, and went out of the field; that was after I had gone out of the field, and come in again; I thought they were the same party who were round me when I was robbed; I had not observed their faces, but I thought they were the same; they looked like the same men; I did not observe the faces of any body to recognize them.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after you were robbed, did these people go out of the field? A. It might be from two to five or ten minutes; it did not exceed ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure these are the four men who left the crowd, and went into another field? A. I think they are the men; they were taken in about an hour; I went from that field up the road, till I met some Bow-street officers, and gave them information of them.</p>
               <p>Q. After you were robbed, did you see the spot, where the mob was, sufficiently to say whether any body joined them after the robbery? A. Certainly; numbers might have joined them.</p>
               <p>Q. You felt somebody's hand on your watch pocket: did he take hold of your pocket? A. The hand was laid on my pocket, nothing more - they crowded close round me - I received no blow; one put his hand on my pocket, another caught hold of me by the side and pulled my arm and hand from the top of my pocket, and at the time they did this, somebody shoved my hat right over my face and over my eyes, which prevented my seeing - Ruddick had not seen me robbed, but referred me to the witness Kain.</p>

            . I am a clerk, and live in Paradise-row, Bethual-green. On the afternoon in question, I was com<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150026"></xptr>ing over the fields, and saw the four prisoners hustle Mr. Hunter - I saw Avery put Mr. Hunter's hat over his face; Hunter came out of the mob; I heard an outcry while they were hustling him - I stopped there for five or ten minutes after it was done; I saw Mr. Hunter - he and I went round the field to look for an officer, but found none- we saw the men go out of the field - they went into another field; and across the footpath, into the middle of the field, three of them laid down; Avery stood up, and was watching us out of the field - Hunter and I were together; we went down Mile-end-road, and at the turnpike saw four Bow-street officers, whom we informed of it - I described the prisoners to them; I knew Avery before; Hunter and I then went into the White Hart public-house, Mile-end - Hunter went out to inquire the names of the officers - I was standing at the window, and saw the four prisoners go by - I immediately ran out, and told the officers, who took them directly - there might have been a thousand people in the field where the prosecutor was hustled, as there was a fight going on; but about the spot, I suppose there were twenty or thirty - the field is at the back of the Eel-pie house, and in the county of Middlesex - I had also seen Fowler once before - they were secured about an hour, or an hour and a quarter, after the robbery; and about three quarters of a mile from where it was committed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How far from where the men were fighting was Hunter hustled? A. About thirty yards or more; I knew none of the men who were fighting; the prisoners laid down about two hundred yards from where the fight was - I did not see the mob disperse from the fight; Hunter was hustled about a mile from the road, and near the water side - the White Hart is close to the turnpike, and about three quarters of a mile from where it happened - the prisoners are the four men who hustled Mr. Hunter; it lasted three or four minutes; I was about two yards from them at the time; when they passed the White Hart, they were going towards town all four together, and quite in a public place- I was crossing the field, and stopped to look at the fight - I noticed some persons there, who were looking at the fight - I saw Avery there, and knew him - I told the officers I knew some of them, and spoke of Avery as one; I swear that the prisoners are the men who hustled Mr. Hunter - I took a good view of them - they were searched as soon as they were taken, but none of the property has been found.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long had you been looking at the fight, before you saw Hunter hustled? A. Five or ten minutes - I saw Avery three or four minutes before, close against Mr. Hunter, before he was hustled.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. How soon after it happened, did you speak to Hunter? A. Five or ten minutes - I did not like to say any thing to him in the field, for fear of being ill-treated; the men might have ill-used me - after Hunter got out of the field, I asked him if he knew the parties - he said, No; I said I knew them; he then said if he could get the watch again, he would give the men three guineas for it - he did not say he would give me three guineas to get it back - he left the field three or four minutes after it happened - he was out of the field about four minutes, and I told him what I had seen in about two minutes afterwards; I might have been five minutes near him in all, before I told him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How far was he from you, when he got out of the field? A. About twenty yards; I did not know what had happened till he came back; while he was going round the field a friend had made a communication to me, and that was the first time I knew he had been robbed.</p>

            . I am a constable of Bow-street. On the 5th of February, in the afternoon, I was with Vann, Keys, and Newsome, at the Mile-end turnpike-gate - about four o'clock, Hunter and Kain came up to us - Hunter said he had been robbed; Kain described the parties, and said he knew one of them, Avery - they left us shortly - we stood by the Black Dog public-house a short time; they came back again, and Kain said, "The four men have all gone by" - we immediately rushed out - I took Avery, my brother officers took the others - they were all in company; Fowler said they had been to the fight; I searched Avery, but found nothing on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. When Kain spoke to you, were you walking along? A. We were standing at the Mile-end gate - he told us where the robbery happened - he mentioned Avery's name, but no other at that time - he wanted us to go round with them to look for them, but we said there was a house these men frequented, and he had better leave it to us; I did not know Kain before - Hunter complained then of losing nothing but his watch; Kain said he knew the men, and described them - I should have apprehended the prisoners from his description - I stopped them going towards Wentworth-street, in their way home; Fowler said, "We have been to the fight."</p>

            . I am an officer. I searched Fowler; I found some silver and a watch-chain on him, which I returned to him as it was not identified; Hall's account is quite correct - we apprehended all the prisoners.</p>
               <p>W. HUNTER re-examined. I first missed my money, about seven o'clock; I cannot say how much I had about me; I had two or three pieces of gold; but whether they were sovereigns or half-sovereigns I cannot say; nothing was left in the pocket I had my money in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. When you called out, Robbery! did you observe any body near you, besides the four men? A. Yes, there were several; I did not observe Kain; I said I would give three sovereigns if I could get my watch back, and would ask no questions.</p>
               <p>FOWLER'S Defence. When I was first taken into the public-house, Kain said he could not swear we robbed the man, nor that we were the only four persons near him: now he says quite the contrary - at the first examination he said he could not swear either of us robbed the gentleman; but he believed we were the persons.</p>

               <p>JONES' Defence. I was looking at the fight - I saw these persons, and came home in company with them; the witness said he would not swear either of us took the watch, but he saw us near him; Hunter said he did not think he saw either of us before, but he believed he saw Avery near him in the field.</p>

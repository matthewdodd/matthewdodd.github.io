                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Waterhouse and Winterbotham, of 1, Cook's Court, and am secretary to the Cook's Court Improvement Company, including the entrance to Portugal Street—Fowler was tenant of 17, Portugal Street, up to Midsummer this year, under this agreement. (<hi rend="italic">This provided that when rent was in arrear for fourteen days after the dates specified, or in case of the breach of the agreement, the landlord should re<lb></lb>enter the premises, and the tenancy should determine</hi>.) At Midsummer there were two quarters in arrear—after giving notice, I was compelled to distrain—we re<lb></lb>entered on 13th August through our tenant's premises—Fowler was not there—Mr. Hope, senior, was occupying the rooms on the first floor, I believe as Fowler's sub<lb></lb>tenant—Mr. Hope, senior, wrote us this letter, after which my managing clerk Mr. Baker saw him, and at his request we entered into this agreement with him, and he paid us 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account—Hope is his father's clerk—on 11th October I was sent for by Mr. Baker, to 75, Portugal Street—I went there about 5.30. p.m. and saw a crowd of about 100 people and two policemen round the door, which was broken, one of the panels being out—I went upstairs—there were twenty people in the house—I asked a policeman to follow me—another door was open of one of the rooms let to Hope—it had been padlocked, but the padlock was broken off—I saw the prisoners Hope and Stone, Stone had a sledge<lb></lb>hammer—I gave them in custody and took them to Bow Street—Hope said he would not go near the house that evening—the next day, in consequence <hi rend="italic">of</hi> communications I received, I applied for a warrant, which was granted, and the prisoners were apprehended.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to the last witness—on 13th August I served a notice of our re<lb></lb>entry, on Fowler in Portugal Street, and told him the company had terminated his tenancy—I remained there that day-Fowler and Hope came and attempted to get in—Mr. Horn was standing at the front door by me—subsequently a summons was taken out by Horn—an agreement was come to in the presence of Hope the prisoner, to withdraw the summons on their taking no further steps—on 14th August, having seen this letter, I went to Mr. Hope, senior, and conversed with him about it (<hi rend="italic">The letter expressed mortification of the writer, Mr.; Hope, senior, in finding himself at</hi> 70 <hi rend="italic">years of age brought into a predicament by Mr. Fowler having misled his son, who had never seen Fowler's special agreement with the company, and undertaking to withdraw the summons</hi>)—the next morn<lb></lb>ing I took him Fowler's agreement, and produced to him duplicate notice in his son's presence—he expressed regret, said, he would withdraw the summons, and the next day he agreed to make terms, and we sent round immediately the terms on which he could take the place, and they were embodied in an agreement, which is put in—on 11th October I received instructions from my principal, as Hope's rent was in arrear, to re<lb></lb>take possession, and I walked in about 5.30.—I caused the street door to he bolted—I looked out of the window in Portugal Street, and saw Hope coming up with Fowler—Hope called to me to open the front door—I said, "Certainly not"—he said, "I will take the law into my own hands"—I said, "Do not be so foolish"—I next saw a man with a sledge<lb></lb>hammer—he knocked at the front door about ten blows on the upper part, and then about thirty blows on the lower part, and forced in the panel—more than fifty persons flocked there—they unbolted the door and the three prisoners ran upstairs and broke the padlock off the door of the back office, and broke it open and got in—I sent for Mr. Winterbotham when I heard the panel go in—I had instructions to go in—I found that Fowler had been coming there—I acted upon my instructions.</p>

                  </hi>. On 11th October I was standing in Portugal Street, when I saw Hope and Fowler come up outside with Stone, who had a sledge hammer—Hope said, "Will you open that door?"—I said, "No, I cannot; it is bolted up; I have possession of the house, and I cannot open it"—he said, "I shall break it in; here is a man with a sledge<lb></lb>hammer to do it"—I said, "Don't you do so; let me beg of you not to break it in; another thing, I have got four men, and some serious mischief might arise"—he said, "I do not care; I will break the door in"—Stone then went and struck the door with a hammer and made a large impression, and he broke off the top hinges; a mob came round; some man caught hold of the hammer, and between them they broke open the door and broke off the locks, and there was dreadful confusion.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Witnesses for the Defence</hi>. <hi rend="smallCaps">BENJAMIN HOPE</hi>. I am a solicitor, and have hitherto carried on business at 17, Portugal Street—my son was tenant of two rooms, and I agreed to take three rooms if I was not disturbed—I paid 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; another 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was retained for repairs—Baker did not ask for the rent—he asked for the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I said, "You were to do something to the <hi rend="italic">door</hi> and whitewash the place"—they wrote to repudiate my agreement—I said. "I am tenant of Mr. Fowler, and I am not liable to you for rent"—that was before Mr. Vaughan's decision on the summons—on 11th October I went to attend to my business—when I came back I found the door shut; they had taken possession of my rooms; my private desk was open; my daughter was left in the house when I went away—a crowd collected when they commenced to hammer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I went to Mr. Winterbotham about this matter—I did not admit I was wrong—I asked to see the agreement between the company and Fowler—I saw the provision for re<lb></lb>entry—I did not express my regret and say they were right—these two letters are my writing—I then signed an agreement—I do not know that it was in consideration of my age that the rooms were to be let to me—the rent was in arrear—I was in the crowd when they had possession, but not when Baker went in—they forced my door—I was at the back <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the crowd and heard Baker speak to my son.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. This occurred about 5 o'clock—Baker was there all day—I saw him—I locked myself in because I felt that I was in possession of papers as the clerk was gone, and I did not like to be with Baker's men—Mr. Winterbotham suggested that I should go up to the fire—I did not give the key to Mr. Winterbotham—I have it now in my workbox—one key does not unlock all the doors—I am sure I did not give any key to Mr. Winterbotham—I never gave the keys up I am certain.</p>

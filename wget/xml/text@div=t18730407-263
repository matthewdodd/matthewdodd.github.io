I am a fancy boxmaker, and occupy Nos.1, 2, and 3, Glover's Hall Court, in the Parish of St. Giles, Cripplegate Without—on the night of 11th March, at 8 o'clock, I locked up the premises—at 9 o'clock on the morning of the 12th I went to the premises—I found the area grating had been broken open, and the two counting-house doors—my cash-box and travellers' desk were broken open, and a box of cigars taken away—they had been safe in my cupboard over night—the cellar grating was safe the previous night—the cigars are here—I saw them at the Bow Lane Station at 9 o'clock.</p>

On the morning of 12th March, about 2 o'clock, I was on duty in Glover's Hall Court, by the prosecutor's house—I noticed a light over the fanlight—I listened at the door, and heard someone whispering in the house—I called the attention of Allison, Police Constable 619, who lives on the premises at No.1—he let me in at No.3—I went to the first floor—I found Edwards in the first floor front room—I told him he would have to come to the station with me for being on the premises—he fumbled about, and he threw this piece of wedge behind him—I searched him, and found a bunch of eight keys; they are ordinary keys—Allison had Mann in custody—I searched Mann at the station-house, and found on him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a cigar-holder, and some matches—he said nothing—I asked where he lived; he refused to give any address—after the prisoners were taken to the station I went back to the premises and there found these crowbars, one on the table in the inner office, and one in the outer office by the desk, a piece of composite candle on the inner table, and this broken piece of wood; it is part of the beading of the inner counting-house door, which had been forced—I found this cash-box in the counting-house, it had been broken open, and this box of cigars was on the top of the cash-box, on the table of the counting-house.</p>

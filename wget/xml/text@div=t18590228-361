                  </hi>. I keep a tobacconist's and general shop, in East-street, Kennington-road—on Friday evening, 4th February, near 6 o'clock, I saw the prisoner served with half-an-ounce of tobacco by my sister—the price was 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a half-crown—I did not notice that it was bad.</p>

               <p>but gave him change one shilling, two sixpences, and four-pence halfpenny in copper—he left, joined another soldier outside, who was looking in at the window, and went down East-street—I then took up the half-crown and found it was bad—I had not parted with it out of my hand—I searched several public-houses in Lambeth-walk, but could not find the prisoner—I then came up Regent-street, and saw him with another soldier, about 100 yards from my house—I followed them to Lambeth-walk, met an officer, and accused the prisoner of passing a bad half-crown at my shop in East-street—he said that he had not been in East-street—the constable took him—the other soldier followed a short way and then left—I gave the half-crown to the policeman—I am sure the prisoner is the man—I know him by his hair and his moustache being a different colour.</p>

I am a sister of the last witness—on 4th February, I served the prisoner with half an ounce of tobacco—I am quite certain of him—he laid a half-crown on the counter, and my brother gave him change—I saw another soldier outside, but did not take notice of him particu<lb></lb>larly—my brother kept the half-crown in his hand, and went after the prisoner.</p>

On 4th February I was on duty in Lambeth-walk, and Mr. Robinson gave the prisoner into my custody, and charged him with passing a bad half-crown—he denied having been in East-street—after I took him he said that he was in Rose's beer-shop in East-street, having half a pint of beer, but still denied being at the prosecu<lb></lb>tor's—there was another soldier with him—Mr. Robinson gave me this half-crown (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I searched the prisoner at the station, and found 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, good money—I found no tobacco on him, but they were smoking when I met them.</p>

I am bar-maid to my uncle, Mr. Jackson, who keeps a public-house in Regent-street, Lambeth, about a minute's walk from Mr. Robinson's, in East-street—about 6 o'clock, or a little after, on that day two soldiers came, but I cannot swear to either of them—they had some porter, and asked for pipes—they bought no tobacco of me—one of them had been in service—he had short red hair, and a red moustache, But I cannot swear to the prisoner—I should recognise him better with his cap on—the other was fair and much younger.</p>

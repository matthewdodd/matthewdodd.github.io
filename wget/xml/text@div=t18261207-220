The prisoner came into my shop, and asked for half a pound of beef, which he eat there - before he sat down I thought I heard something rattle - I turned my head, and saw my daughter's locket in his hand - he brought it and laid it on the mantel-shelf - he was quite a stranger - after he was gone, I went into the kitchen; my daughter went into the shop, then came and asked if I had seen her brooch - I said, "No, I did not know it was there" - I had locked the shop-door before I left - nobody could have come in.</p>

I was at this shop on the 22d of October, and saw the prisoner there; and on Monday I heard of this loss: and on Tuesday I went there again - the prisoner came in and asked for a plate of soup - I said he was the person who had the brooch. The prosecutrix desired me to follow him, which I did - he went to another shop, and then to East-street, where he borrowed a barrow; I went and brought him back - he acknowledged being there, and having the beef; and afterwards said he had stolen or taken the brooch.</p>

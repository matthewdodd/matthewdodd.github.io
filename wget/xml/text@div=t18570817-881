                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman in the employment of Messrs. Leaf, of No. 39, Old Change. On 4th Aug., the prisoner came to the entering room, and said he had ordered two pieces of silk—I sent for the silk, and asked him for the order; he gave me this paper—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Please to let the bearer have a piece of crimson Persian at 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.

Leaf—I asked the prisoner whose writing it was—he said, "Mr. Woolmer"—I said, "Which one!"—he said, "The young one"—I said, "I think not"—he said, "Oh, yes! if you do not believe it, you had better send on and see"—I said I should send one of my young men with him, which I did.</p>

Mr. North sent me with the prisoner to Mr. Woolmer's; just before we got out of the Change, he said he wanted, to go to Brooks—I said I was to go with him to Woolmer's, to see whether he did come from there—in going along I asked how long he had been at Mr. Woolmer's—he said about twelve months—just as we came to Jewin Street, he ran away—I gave a hue and cry, and he was stopped.</p>

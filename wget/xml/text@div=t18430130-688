                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Thomas Hutton, a fringe and worsted manufacturer, in Newgate-street. The prisoner was in his employ, occupied in the work-shed in Phœnix-court—on Saturday, the 21st of Jan., I did not see him leave the shed—he was brought back to the house by Sickle—I saw eight bobbins taken from his pocket—they are worth 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he had no right to take articles of this description.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, formerly in the employ of Poole and Bryan—on 18th August between 6 and 7 in the evening, I should say, I went to the factory at Northampton, and packed a quantity of boots and shoes of different descriptions—Beard went with me—Poole and Chapman came in while we were packing them—Chapman gave us some orders, after receiving which, we took the trunks we had packed to Kingsthorpe and put them in Chapman's coach-house there—there were either six or seven, I cannot exactly state the number—we afterwards returned to Northampton, and went to Poole's house—we saw Poole, who gave us some orders—I am not aware that we saw anybody else—I went to the factory between 9 and 10 next morning—I saw Poole, Chapman, and Ventris there, and Beard came in afterwards—we had orders from Poole and Chapman, in Ventris's presence, to go into the shoe room and assist in packing some trunks with boots and shoes—we did so—I should say we packed twenty trunks—we were engaged all day in packing them—Ventris was present all the time: he brought a quantity of shoes to pack a trunk, which he said were for himself—that was all he assisted in—after those goods were packed we received orders from Poole and Chapman, in Ventris's presence, to load them in the van and the light spring cart, and take them to Chapman's house, where we had taken the others the evening before—we took them to Chapman's house at Kingsthorpe, at midnight, and left them in the coach-house—after that we returned to Northampton—we saw both Poole and Ventris that night—Ventris gave me orders to be there early next morning, and take the cart and horse to Kingsthorpe, and take the trunk which we had left the evening before, and which was covered with canvas to Bramp<lb></lb>ton Station, and send it to London, which I did—it was directed to Islington—I gave it to the station-master—I was at the factory all day on Saturday, 18th—we had orders to take some bales of leather to the warehouse—I can<lb></lb>not exactly say who gave us those orders, but Poole, Ventris, and Mr. Pearce were present—we weighed the butts, and took them to Pearce's warehouse, in Dychurch-lane, between 12 and 1 o'clock in the day—there were two loads of them—after we had taken them to Pearce's, the work people were paid, and after they were paid, we packed five or six more trunks with the goods which were brought in—that was between 6 and 7 in the evening—by we, I mean me and Beard; we were engaged the whole week—after the goods were packed, we had orders to take them to Pearce's warehouse, in Dy-church-lane—we loaded them in the van, and left the premises with the van at half-past 9 or 10 o'clock, I cannot state the time exactly, and as we were going across the market square, Ventris came to us and told us we were watched, and to give the parties a chase—Beard drove on with the van, and I remained behind and went back to Poole's house—I saw the goods there, and assisted in unloading them—we put them into the stable, at Poole's private residence—Poole and Ventris were there besides myself and Beard,</p>

               <p>side boots, half a dozen waxed calf skins, and the ready closed uppers—there were other things which I rejected—the value of the whole was about 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the goods were stamped "P. and Co."—I made an offer which Ventris refused—on Saturday, 20th October, he called on me in the morning stating that he had a party who had offered 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the goods I had looked out, and if I liked to give him 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I should have them—I said I should not advance my price, and I did not care whether I had them or not—I offered him 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he could not let me have them—he went away and returned in about a quarter of an hour and said I should have them—I said "Very well, bring them in, and I will pay you for them"—I never saw him afterwards till I saw him at the police court.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where you saw these goods was in the back room of a coffee-shop, was it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I don't know whether it is usual to buy goods of such a class in such a place, without inquiry—I went to the address given in the advertisement, and saw Ventris, and he told me he had taken the goods for a debt—I have frequently bought goods in a coffee-shop, not exactly through an advertisement—I don't suppose it is a usual thing to buy goods in that way, not in a back room—I have bought goods in a coffee house—I don't suppose that is usual—I have never stated that the boots were thrown in a heap on the floor—they were spread about the floor—they were in the trunk previous to his unlocking it—when I went into the room he went up to the trunk, drew it into the middle of the room, unlocked it, and emptied the contents on the floor—the mark on the boot, was, a large P. on the sole—there was no mark on the leather—it is such as is usually known in the trade—there is nothing particular about it—I did not count all the goods that were there; only those that I looked out—I will not swear there was not other leather besides that which came from the trunk—there were boots besides those I looked out—I keep a boot and shoe shop now—I did live at Northampton once—I knew Mr. Collier, at Northampton, well—nothing unpleasant ever took place between I and he—there were no clothes in the trunk—I saw no wearing apparel at all—I should say the value of the whole lot of goods was about 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I was engaged by Messrs. Quilter, Ball, and Jay, in the affairs of Poole and Bryan, to take the stock—Ventris lived in Paul-street, New North-road, Islington—I don't exactly remember the number, but I think it was No. 4—I had the keys of the warehouse at Northampton—I gave them to Ventris on Wednesday morning, 22d August.</p>

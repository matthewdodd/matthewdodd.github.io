                  </hi>. I am a widow, and am a shopkeeper in the Walworth Road—on Saturday week I shut up my shop about 12 O'clock and went to bed a little after—about 1 O'clock I heard a police rattle—I threw open my bedroom window, and came down and found the shop window broken, and these candles and a tobacco jar lying on the floor—I well secured my door—I had seen the prisoner twice that evening, once with a cart.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman 220 P</hi>). On 5th January, about 1.20, I was passing the prosecutor's shop in the Rodney Road, Walworth—I saw a flickering light—I went as usual to try the doors—this door was secured by a large chain from one post to another, but not locked—I pushed it,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187801140101"></xptr>
               <p>then called out to someone inside whom I could not see—I said ''Your door is not properly secured; you had better lock and bolt it"—a man's voice from inside said "It is all right, policeman, my wife has put the chain on"—I said "You had better take the chain off and bolt and lock it, and then put the chain on"—he said "It is all secure"—I still per<lb></lb>sisted—he came to the door, undid the chain, and put the candle out at the same time, and said "You can See it is all right"—I said "I have no doubt it is, but I should like to see that it is all right"—he said "Come this way"—he led the way to the parlour at the foot of the stairs, and shouted up stairs "Mother, policeman thinks it is not all right; just ahout out and tell him it is"—I said "You told me it was your wife"—he said "I meant my mother"—receiving no answer, he said "I suppose she is asleep" and "Go upstairs, she'll soon answer"—I said "I do not like going to the bedroom door; you lead the way, I will follow"—he said "I will get some stones and throw up at the window, that will soon wake the old lady"—I said "Oh, very well"—he made for the door—I seized him by his left hand and said he could perform the throwing with his right hand, but I should hold him fast till his mother answered from the window—he came outside and said "I suppose you think there is some<lb></lb>thing wrong"—I said "I have no reason to doubt you just yet"—he picked up some slush from the gutter and appeared as if he was going to throw it up to the window, but made a plunge to get away—I held him and drew my truncheon—I sprang my rattle and assistance came—I went into the house again—it was half an hour before we could get the prosecu<lb></lb>trix to speak, because she was frightened and deaf as well—I took the prisoner to the station and found on him a key and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers—on examining the house I found an entry had been effected by taking down the outside shutter, breaking a pane of glass, and by putting the arm through, unfastening the chain—the shutter was then replaced, not leav<lb></lb>ing the slightest trace—the door was burst open from the lock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Lady Woolmer, at No. 15, Bruton-street. On Monday evening, the 7th of December, I was going through Lincoln's Inn-fields—I happened to turn my head, and saw the prisoner close behind me, with something white in his hand—I pot my hand into my pocket, and missed my handkerchief—I laid hold of him, and said I thought he had my handkerchief—he said he had none but his own, which he took out and showed me—I said I thought he had got mine—I searched him, and found it in his left-hand trowsers pocket—he then said he had picked it up—I had used it about three minutes before, and put it safely back—I gave him in charge—this is ray handkerchief—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>.)</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I was not in Lincoln's Inn-fields at all; I came down Kingsgate-street, and picked the handkerchief up under the archway in Great Queen-street; he came and asked if I had got his handkerchief; I said no; I did not know it was his; he said he saw me put it in my pocket; he searched rue all over, then went on one side, and afterwards came and took it out of my pocket; there were three ladies close by, who said they had not seen me touch his pocket. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I asked three ladies if they had seen him do it; they said no; it was under the archway I missed it.</p>

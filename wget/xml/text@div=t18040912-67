He was put in a caravan, and ordered to be sent down to Portsmouth; I went with him some part of the way, he made his escape on the 16th; there were two caravans, I went with one, and Mr. Kirby with the other; he did not make his escape from me, it was from the other caravan he made his escape, on the road to Portsmouth, in the Liberty of Hants; I did not miss him till I came out of the caravan, I did not see him till last Friday week; I heard of him on the Monday; I did not see him again till I saw him at Bow-street.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he say any thing when you took him? - A. He was fast asleep in bed, laying on his back; I stood right across him, and stood upon him; I received information that he had a brace of pistols, I broke open the door and went in, he was fast asleep with a young woman; in the room I found an iron crow, a phosphorus bottle, a bunch of matches, and a piece of wax-candle.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body else in the room besides this young woman? - A. No; he got the poker, and struck me over the arm, the blow was aimed at my head, he tried to kill me, he cut my arm; while I was packing up these things, I saw him whisper to the girl, and I suspected him, I saw him get the poker; his hands being small, he got the handcuffs off.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Clapton with my brother George—he is a calenderer—the prisoner was in his employ—we did not miss these pieces of calico, but the officer brought them back,—three or four pieces—I can't tell on what day; about a month ago—I recognise these as having been sent to glaze by my brother—they had been delivered to the prisoner to take home to a customer—these are Mr. Walter's, he is the only customer that will allow us to cut patterns off the pieces, and if these patterns are not delivered at the warehouse they would be missed—I made the mark of Mr. Walter on these pieces—here are four patterns, and here is the mark I put on them—they had been sent to my brother to be glazed—I delivered them into the cart, and the prisoner had charge of the cart—I have no doubt of these having been in our possession, and the prisoner had no right to have them in his possession at home—I never gave them to him as a present—I gave them to him to take back to the warehouse.</p>

               <p>on 8th May; I found these pieces of calico there and some more—I said to him, "How came you by these?"—he said, "My master's brother gave them to me to make patch-work"—these have been in my possession ever since—I showed them to Mr. Baker on the 9th, and he identified them.</p>

I saw him at dinner time at the Plough, public-house, where I live; he still insisted that master said he was to have it; it was then three o'clock - I refused, but he said he should return in an hour and a half with her, and I let him have her; he had been working for master ten or eleven weeks; he rode off on the mare.</p>

            . I keep the Swan, public-house. on Finchley-common. The prisoner came to my house, between three and four o'clock on Saturday, riding this mare - he put her into the stable, came into the house, and came out in a few minutes. I met him at the door; he offered to sell me the mare for three sovereigns, and to clear a score of 5 s.; I said if he would satisfy me that it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182402180012"></xptr>was his own, I would give him three sovereigns, and asked where he bought it; he said he bought it at Mr. Grange's sale, and then that he bought her of Mr. Bainbridge. I suspected that it was not his; he staid there three hours, begging of me to give him the money, and I sent for a constable; he was in liquor; he was fresh when he came, and had part of a pot of beer at my house. He rode the mare up to my door; there was nothing remarkable in his appearance. There is a nursery-ground at Finchley.</p>

Bainbridge and Eaton, and asked when would there be a coach to town; I said in about an hour.

I gave him a sovereign to buy three dozen, but did not tell him to take the horse. I went to the ground on Saturday, and the carnations were planted there, and suppose he had bought them.

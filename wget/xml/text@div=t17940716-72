               <p>Q. Where were these nails kept? - In the workshop, in paper; I see them the 10th of July last, in the evening about eight o'clock, we leave off usually about night o'clock, and he was gone to the public house; I went after him, and told him I had some trunks to send out, desired him to come back to take out a truck and he would not come back; he said he must go into the cellar first; I told him he should not go into the cellar, and told him I would charge a constable with him; I insisled on his coming immediately with me; at last by violence, I brought him out of the public house, and brought him home; when he came home, I told him he had got two thousand of nails in his breeches; he said, he had not; I put him on the bench and unbuttoned his breeches; he then put his hand up and pulled them out; I see him, there was the paper. Then I immediately charged the constable with him, and sent him to the Poultry Compter. The constable has the nails.</p>

            Whose writing is that? - The ironmonger's.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe that hand writing sufficient to say, that what was taken from the prisoner, was the same that you saw before? - Yes, I took very particular notice. These nails are kept in the work shop, but they were put in a secret place, by a person or persons unknown to me; I had seen them behind the desk of the work shop, this particular parcel seven or eight times; the work shop is in the garret, the top room of the house; I had seen them there four days before this, three times a day, till the day they were missed, and I had seen them that day at two o'clock; my apprentice was the first that missed them; he is here.</p>
               <p>Q. Now in this place where they were left, is it a place that this man had access to? - He constantly worked there.</p>

               <p>Q. And all these men work in the garret? - No, they work in the lower part of the house, which is three stories difference.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you think you can swear to the marks, or do you absolutely swear to them? - I don't attempt to swear to the marks in general, but I only say that these nails were in the garret.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe this place when he put the paper over it? - Yes, and I went and looked after he was there, and I acquainted my master of it directly.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not observe how that paper was marked? - Yes, there was writing on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the writing again? - I cannot be positive; it was a brown paper, and a string tied about it; I missed it from this place on the Thursday evening following for the first time; I went down and told my master directly, the man had got it with him, as I supposed; my master went directly after him. I did not see them taken from him; I came directly down stairs, and my master had got them in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you keep your nails? - I get them of my master out of the counting house, and when they are wanted, the men ask me for them.</p>

               <p>Hayward. To the best of my knowledge that is the paper.</p>

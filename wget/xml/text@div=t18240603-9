            . I live in Red Lion-passage, Hoxton. On the 25th of April, between nine and ten o'clock at night, I had just come from my house, and turning round at the back of Hoxton chapel, I heard some persons running after me, and on getting into <placeName id="t18240603-9-crimeloc53">Ask-street</placeName>

I called Stop thief! and went in pursuit, and was stopped by the other three, who wanted to push me into a muddy place, and as I turned round to look at them I was struck in the mouth by the prisoner, who sent me staggering backwards - there was a gas-light where I was stopped. I never saw the prisoner before, but am certain he is the man who struck me, for I followed him so close, and kept him in sight till he got to Pimlico, where he ran down; I was a very short way behind him, and in a moment I caught sight of him again; a woman had directed me which way they had ran; I saw Stevens, who got a light, and I found the prisoner standing up behind a dung hill, in a bye place, which is not a thoroughfare - he had his hand to his breeches, and seemed as if he had unbuttoned them; I collared him, took him to a public-house, and gave him in charge. I am sure he is the man who struck me, and is one of the three who were with the two who robbed me. He was dressed in a white coat and black handkerchief, and all the rest were dressed different.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you alarmed - A. I was frightened a little. I can swear to none of them by their features. I can swear to the dress of four of them; the prisoner's hand was across his face; I could not see his features. He pretended to be buttoning his clothes up when he saw me.</p>

            . I live in Drinkwater-buildings, Pimlico, Hoxton. I was going to bed, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I went down Pimlico, got a light and went behind a dung hill with the prosecutor, and saw the prisoner standing up; Hubbard went up, and collared him, and said he was the man who struck him. There was another man on the tiles of a shed close by - he jumped off on the other side, and got away.</p>

I went out to take a walk, was taken ill, and went down this place for a necessary occasion, and as I was buttoning up my clothes Hubbard came, and said he could swear to me by my white coat and black handkerchief, and while I was there a man came up in a smock frock, and got on the tiles.</p>

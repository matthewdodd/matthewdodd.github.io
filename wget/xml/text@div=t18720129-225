                  </hi>. I am a canal-boatman—about 11 o'clock on Monday night I was going down Whitecross Street—I was not sober, but I was not drunk—I met the prisoner going towards London Bridge—he asked me where I was going, and I told him to Bromley Look—I stood a minute or two, and as I turned away two other men came up—I was knocked down and the prisoner put his hand in my pocket and took out my purse, I snatched hold of his left arm and held him—he said "Let me go"—I said "No, you have robbed me"—he said "You have got your purse all right," and I said "Yes, but it is empty"—I had 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it when I was knocked down, and only a farthing was left in it—I saw a policeman coming, and I got up—I told the policeman the prisoner had robbed me—he was going to walk away, only the policeman called him back—he was not above two steps away I gave him into custody—I was struck on the left temple when I was knocked down, and kicked on the right hip—when I left home in the morning, I had 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I put 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in this purse; I had only paid for two pints of old ale, someone else gave me another glass, and I had one at the Crown.</p>

I saw the prosecutor on the ground, and the prisoner bending over him—when the prisoner saw me he got up and walked away—I went up and Green said "He has robbed me"—I called after the prisoner, and he came up, and Green charged him with robbing him of 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I took him to the station, and found 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. On him—Green was in liquor and was bleeding from the face—I had seen Green and the prisoner about 25 minutes before, talking outside the Crown—the pri<lb></lb>soner was dressed as he is now—I did not see anyone else with him—the pri<lb></lb>soner said "I have not robbed him, he has got his purse"—he said he was fastening up his trousers for him—the prosecutor's flap was unbuttoned—he was much the worse for liquor—he seemed to know what he was about.</p>

Finnan have been in the habit of purchasing of us through the prisoner—these flannels (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the sort of goods sold by Mr. Breasey—this ticket on this piece shows that it has been in our house—I have not brought the book here in which the entry of this piece of goods would be—this invoice (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in my writing—I do not recollect giving it to any person; it relates to this piece of eleven yards; I can swear that to be part of this invoice—I have often sold goods to the prisoner—I have no recollection of selling these to him—it is a long time ago; it was in July, 1853.</p>

                  </hi>. This is the prisoner's signature to this invoice; it indicates that the things were taken into our stock—the prisoner had no authority to take things out of our stock—this is the book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in which the entry would be made, if the prisoner had bought such things—here is no entry of them.</p>

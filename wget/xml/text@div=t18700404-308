                  </hi>. I am the wife of Albert Marshall, and live at 8, High Street, Whitechapel—on the night of 12th March, about 10.45, I was in the High Street—the prisoner came in front of me and caught hold of my throat—he then pulled my watch out of my pocket—he broke it away from the chain, and ran down Half Moon Passage with it—as he was going down Half Moon Passage another man followed him, about the same size—the prisoner was the man who assaulted me—he pressed my throat very much—my watch was worth about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I followed the prisoner till he was stopped by a constable—I did not lose sight of him; I was close behind him.</p>

I was on duty in Great, Alie Street on this night—I saw the prisoner and the last witness together in Half Moon Passage—she had hold of him, and called out "Stop him, he has got my watch"—he ran away; I ran after him into Duncan Street, and then into High Street, when he was stopped by another constable—I never lost sight of him—there was another man running with the prisoner, about the same size; he turned to the right, and got away.</p>

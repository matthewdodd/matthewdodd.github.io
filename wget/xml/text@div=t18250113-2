I was called up by my servant, and found the window of a room on the ground floor, looking into the garden, open; the fastening was wrenched out of the wood work, to which it had been screwed. There was a dirty footmark on the bed, which is immediately under that window. About two hours after, upon looking, I found two small matches in the room; the window was propped up by an iron instrument. The plate closet was broken open, and the plate which was in use all gone; most of my plate had been previously sent to my father's. I missed the articles stated in the indictment; some of the stockings were ribbed, and some plain - they were marked with my name at full length. I went into the garden about nine o'clock that morning, and saw footmarks immediately under the window, but the ground being hard they were not distinct. I saw some very distinct impressions about one hundred and fifty yards from the window; they were measured in my presence, with a stick - they were measured again a fortnight after, and a notch cut in the stick to mark the size of the smaller one; the other was the length of the stick.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. The only footsteps you measured were at some distance from the window? A. Yes, but I could trace them up to the window. The garden is about three hundred feet long. I traced two distinct footsteps, from the bottom one hundred and fifty yards up, till they came to the lawn, on which of course there were no marks. I traced them from the lawn to a soft bed, under the window. The impressions were nearly two inches deep.</p>

            . I am in Mr. Wilberforce's service, and fastened the catch of the window between five and six o'clock the evening before the robbery, and locked the room door when I went to bed; I have the care of my master's linen - he had some plain and ribbed silk stockings; the ribbed ones were marked, in silk, with his name in full. I missed three pairs of ribbed, and two pairs of plain. The garden door was forced open - I had fastened it the night before, and the bed-room door was forced open, to enable them to get to the plate closet; nobody slept in the bed-room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At what time did you shut up the bed-room? A. Between five and six o'clock; I do not think that the shutter was screwed quite tight, as it is difficult to fasten. The hasp of the window was wrenched off; I had fastened it, and barred the shutter. I did not lock the room door till about eleven o'clock - the stockings were in a chest of drawers in that bed-room.</p>

            . I am cook to Mr. Wilberforce. On the 16th of November I fastened up part of the house, and tried the bed-room door after Pearce. I was the first person up in the morning, and found the door open, and the garden door also. The plate cupboard was broken open.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 29th of November I and Shelswell searched a house at Chiswick; we found Pearce in a back room, on the first floor; Shelswell went up first; I was down in Scarce's room, on the ground floor. I found a variety of house-breaking implements in his room - I then went up to Pearce's room, and saw a hat box, with three pairs of silk stockings in it; I took out one pair, and Shelswell two; we did not examine them then, but at the second examination I could distinctly make out the name of Wilberforce, which had been picked out. Mr. Wilberforce gave me a stick at Queen-square: I went to Tothill-fields prison, where the prisoners were in custody, and measured Pearce's shoes or boots - I think he wore boots; they were exactly the same length as the stick; Scarce's differed about 1-8th of an inch from the notch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Will you swear that the name is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182501130005"></xptr>not Wilkinson? A. I read it Wilberforce. Their feet are about the usual length. When Pearce saw that the length corresponded, he said they were too tight for him, as he had had them mended.</p>

            . I was with Burridge, and went first to Pearce's room; his wife was in bed. I found two pairs of silk stockings in the box. I believe Scarce is landlord of the house.</p>
               <p>(Stockings produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>PEARCE'S Defence. On the Thursday or Friday before my apprehension, Scarce and his wife were out, a man came and asked me to recommend him to some apartments - I said my landlord talked about letting a room; he said he was going to Brentford, and would call about six o'clock - he left these stockings, tied in a handkerchief, with two oranges, till he called, but never came.</p>
               <p>SCARCE'S Defence. I found the house-breaking tools buried in my garden.</p>

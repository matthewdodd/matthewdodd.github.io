I asked him for some money; he said, he had no money; he should go home to Germany for forty pounds. On the 11th of April, I was gone out a washing; I was at home at seven o'clock in the morning, to breakfast; she came to me, and asked me to lend her a seal; I did not lend it her. They both went on the 11th of April, and never returned; they left the door locked.

I saw the counterpane at Queen-square office; the two prisoner were in custody then. The sheets and tea-caddy have never been found. The woman prisoner took the lodgings herself.</p>

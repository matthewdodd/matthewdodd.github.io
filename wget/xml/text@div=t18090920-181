On the 17th of September, about half past eight in the morning, the prisoner came into the shop under pretence to dispose of a bit of silver, I was called down to her, the girl left her in the shop when she came up to call me; I bought the silver of the prisoner. About twenty minutes after I found that there were three silver watch chains missing out of the window, I suspected that the prisoner had taken them; I applied to an officer and went with him to the Highway, we found the prisoner; I took her with one of the chains in her hand, she was shewing it to another woman. I never found the other two.</p>
               <p>Q. How could she get at the chains - A. By sliding the glass case any person might get at it. The chain is worth three shillings.</p>
               <p>- TODD. Q. Were you with Mr. Marshall when the prisoner was laid hold of - A. I was. When I laid hold of her she had this watch chain in her hand. I have had it ever since.</p>

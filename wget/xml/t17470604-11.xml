             . Do you know the Prisoner at the Bar?</p>
               <p>Hutchins . Yes, Sir, I have known him for about twelve Months.</p>
               <p>Q. What Business did the Boy follow?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. He lives with his Mother. He is of no Business.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you to say against him?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. I had my Door broke open the 17th Day of May, on a Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. What Time?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. I went out about ten o'Clock in the Morning to go to Church; and I went to Bishopsgate Church. I went afterwards to an Alehouse, and I did not go Home again till ten o'Clock at Night, then found my Door broke open.</p>
               <p>Court. First to Church, and then to the Alehouse; what! Did you spend the whole of your Time there?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. I went to several Places with some Country-folks.</p>
               <p>Q. At whose House do you lodge?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. At Hezekiah Stradling's House.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you lose there?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. I lost a Horse-hair Velure Waistcoat, a Pair of Silver Buttons for Shirt Sleeves, and a Sword; but that is not my own.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see these Things in your House?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. I saw them on Saturday Night.</p>
               <p>Q. What Business are you?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. I am a Taylor.</p>
               <p>Q. As you are a Taylor, what Business had you with a Sword?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. The Sword I had of my Brother, I walk with the Train Bands.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your Brother?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. A Taylor.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you find these Things.</p>
               <p>Hutchins. I seiz'd him the 18th.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to seize him?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. I had a Mistrust of him; he liv'd in the same House; he went out about five o'Clock in the Morning. I went out and catch'd him in a Court by Chiswell Street, and took it under his Coat. I told them I would have a Search-Warrant, and search for the other Things; the Sword at last was delivered to me by one Stradling ; and the Buttons were brought me by the Prisoner's Sister.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to you when you took it from under his Coat?</p>
               <p>Hutchins . He told me, if I would carry it home I might make it up.</p>

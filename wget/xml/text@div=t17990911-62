               <p>GEORGE JAMES sworn. - I am an umbrella-maker, opposite the prosecutor. On Tuesday morning, the 10th of September, I was standing at my shop door, I saw a strange person go in at my passage door; when I had hung up an umbrella, which I had in my hand, I followed him, and, as I got to the door, I met him coming out; I asked him who he was; he said he wanted Mrs. Brooke; I said no such person lived in the house; says he, I know that she lives in the next street; says I, how come you to call here then; he said he was in a great hurry, and wished I would let him go; I said no, I shall not let you go till I have seen what you have put in your pocket; I put my hand down his coat, and felt something like a pot in his pocket; I told him, I dare say that belonged to my neigh<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110097"></xptr>bour opposite, he must settle that with him; he said, he was in very great distress, and begged I would let him go; I told him. I must take him over the way; when I had taken him over the way, I found this pot in his pocket (produces it); Mr. Elliott went for a constable, and we took him to Marlborough-street. (The pot was deposed to by Mr. Elliott.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have two motherless children; I have made many applications to the parish, and they would never relieve me, nor take my children; I confess what I have done, but it was from extreme distress.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a coffee house, and reside at No. 252, Blackfriars-road. I know the prisoner, Longuille—he lodged at my house for a fortnight—that was about a month before 15th Dec.—since that time he has visited at my house—on Friday night, 15th Dec., I fastened up my house at 10 o'clock—I remember fastening, the back door quite well—that door fastens by a lock—it opens into a passage which leads into Holland-street—there is a door to that passage opening into Holland-street—that door was not fastened by any lock—it was shut—about half past 3 o'clock on Saturday morning, 16th Dec., I was awoke by the police—I went down stairs, and found that the back door which I had locked the night previously had been forced open—I observed some marks upon it close by the lock—a crowbar was afterwards shown to me—I saw that crowbar fitted to those marks—it fitted them exactly—there is a door opening from my parlour into that passage—the back door and the parlour door both open into the passage which leads to Holland-street—you would go into the parlour immediately from that passage—there were marks upon the door leading to the parlour—the same kind of marks as were on the other door, and they fitted the crowbar—that door had been bolted and locked, and it was still shut—the lock had been tried, but had not been forced open—I did not miss any property.</p>

From information which I received, I went on the morning of 16th Dec. to No. 4, Horse-shoe-court, St. Clement's-lane, Strand, about 8 o'clock—I found the prisoner Buclerk in bed, in the upstairs back room—I said, "Get up"—he did not under<lb></lb>stand me—I spoke in French, and he got up—I told him in French, to dress himself, and he did so—I said, in French, "I arrest you for being with another in breaking into a house, No. 252, Blackfriars-road"—he said, "<hi rend="italic">Pas moi;"</hi> "Not me"—he said again, "You are deceived; I know nothing about it"—I searched the room, and on a table I found this dark lantern, a box of lucifers, and these goloshes, which were quite wet—it had been wet the night before—I likewise found this pocket book, which contained a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note and some papers—I took him to the station—as we were going over Blackfriars-bridge, I said in French, "Do you know this bridge?"—he said, "I passed it at 4 o'clock this morning"—in going past Mr. Rayson's house, he pointed to it, and said, "I was at the back of that house last night with my friend, with whom I quitted at 4 o'clock this morning"—he said, "That is my friend's lodging"—I went afterwards to Mr. Rayson's house; I took this crowbar with me; I compared it with the marks on the door and doorpost; it fitted exactly—I saw the marks on both the doors, and it fitted the marks on each—the marks were near the lock—the door leading directly into the house, and the parlour door also—the house is in the parish of Christ Church, Surrey.</p>

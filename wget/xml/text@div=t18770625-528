                  </hi>. I am a servant at Alford House, Prince's Gate—on 14th or 10th November last I was in the Brompton Road between 4 and 5 o'clock, and saw the prisoners with another man—Williams was dressed as a baker, with flour about his clothes, Cameron was dressed about the same as he is now—Williams had a bird in a bag and Cameron had one in a cage, which he wanted to give, with 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., to Williams for his bird—Williams would not take it; he walked on—I heard Cameron and the other man say that it was a good bird, and the other man told Cameron to go and <hi rend="italic">bounce</hi> Williams out of it—Cameron went after Williams and said that the bird was no good, and he bad better take the money—Williams would not hear anything he had to say about it, and ran on—I went after him, and he turned and said to me "Would you let them have the bird"—I said "No, I heard them say it was a good bird and worth 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said "You can have it, if you like, for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,"—I said I did not want it—he said he wanted it to have a good home, that he had caught it in the bake house, that it whistled beautifully, but he was obliged to part with it, as his mistress overhead was very ill and could not bear the whistling of it, and as he was obliged to sell it, he would take 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—at that time Cameron came up and said he very much wanted the bird and he would give 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, that he had not the money with him, but if Williams would come to his house in the Edgware Road he would give him the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Williams declined to do</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187706250009"></xptr>
               <p>so, as his time was up to be in to his work—Cameron was jumping about I pretending he should lose all chance of buying the bird, and I was induced I to buy it on the condition that Cameron should come in the course of an hour with the money and fetch the bird, and if not Williams was to have it back—Williams said that he lived at Mr. Flack's, the baker's, just over the way, and had lived there five years—he went home with me, and I gave him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and took the bird—the prisoners never came to the house after<lb></lb>wards—I put the bird in a cage with some water, and it got into the water and washed all the paint off, and in three or four days I found it dead in the water—it was a sparrow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am sure it was a common street sparrow—I thought that Cameron would come back with the money for the bird—I parted with my money on that belief.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I believed what Williams said as to where he lived and what he said about the bird—that influenced me in buying the bird.</p>

I took the prisoners into custody on 28th May—I had heard of this case—Williams was dressed as a baker and Cameron as a working man—Williams had this paper bag in his hand, and a bird they called a bullfinch—I have seen the prisoners together on several occasions.</p>

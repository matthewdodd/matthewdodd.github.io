                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Dyas; I am now in the hospital; I live at No. 2, Three Herrings-court. This happened on a Monday night, about 1 o'clock in the morning—it is fire weeks ago last Monday—had gone to bed, and was asleep—I was awoke by a noise, and a kicking and knocking at the door—I got up and opened the door—I saw a mob of people outside, and I saw the prisoner—I spoke to her, and told her that as soon as the policeman came into the court, if she did not get away, I would give her in charge; it was she that made all this noise at the door, and she was making a noise at that time—she pot her-hand behind her like that—(<hi rend="italic">putting her right hand behind her</hi>)—then I saw the blow coming, but I could not stop it—she gave me a blow with a chopper, and cut my nose quite across—the blow knocked me down, and I did not know what more happened.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> She came to me that morning, and said, if I did not go and take some things for her to pawn, she would have her revenge. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No, I did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> On that evening I was coming up the court with my daughter, and this woman came and struck at my daughter, who had an infant in her arms; I put my hand up to save my daughter, and this woman struck me; I have got the wounds on my head now; my face was all blood. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> That is not true—I did not strike her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> She did, and it was her own daughter that struck at me, and the blow missed me, and struck her mother. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> My daughter was by my side, in the doorway—she had no chopper, or anything, she was stripped, in her night-clothes, the same as I was myself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of the last witness—I am thirteen years old. I and my mother and father were in bed that night—I got up when I heard a knocking at the door, and calling my mother most awful names—it was before the door was opened that the prisoner called my mother names—I knew her voice—I went to the door with my mother, and when the door was opened my mother said to her, "If you don't go away from my door I will give you in charge"—the prisoner then <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with the chopper that she had behind her, and struck my mother on the nose—my mother fell, and my father went after the prisoner, and found her in Redcross-street—I had no shovel or chopper in my hand—I did not strike at her at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at St. Bartholomew's Hos<lb></lb>pital. I remember Mrs. Dyas being brought there—she had received a very severe wound, completely dividing the nose; the tip of the nose fell down over the upper lip—it was quite such a wound as might have been inflicted with a chopper—I saved the nose; it is united and healed—she is still in the hospital, but she has been recovered some time—she is quite well enough to be discharged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi> (<hi rend="italic">written</hi>). Mrs. Dyas came to me with something to pawn, and because I denied her she said she would have her revenge; on 8th Nov., I travelled fourteen miles, hawking, and on my return about 12 o'clock at night I went for bread and butter for my children's supper, who had never broke their fast from the day before; they had no one to look to but me, their father being dead. My daughter and this woman's son lived together; they were coming home from a raffle; there was a <hi rend="italic">mob</hi> of people, and they had a few words; I went to get my daughter away, and we were coming towards our own home when Mrs. Dyas came out of her own passage with a piece of stick; she made a blow which she intended for my daughter; I went to prevent her, my daughter having a young baby in her arms; she struck me two blows on the head, which set me in a gore of blood, and her youngest daughter does no more but goes in her mother's room and comes out with a shovel or chopper, I can't say which; she struck a blow at me; I drew myself back, and her mother caught the blow; they got a policeman, and gave me in charge.</p>

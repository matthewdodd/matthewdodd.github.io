                  </hi>. My husband is a publican, at No. 14, Old Bailey. The prisoner was our barman—on 2nd Feb., about 8 o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner go to the till—in consequence of something that occurred, I watched him—I saw him take something out of the till, in his hand—I went up to him, and asked him what he had got; he said, "Nothing"—I then asked him to show me his hand—he said he had got nothing—I said I insisted on seeing what he had got in his hand—he went backwards a little, and then dropped a shilling from his hand—I called my husband, and told him—I went with the prisoner and my husband into the bar parlour—my husband asked him how much he had taken.</p>

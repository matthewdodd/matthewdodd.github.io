                  </hi>. I am a confectioner, living in Piccadilly. I have a cottage at Heston—I had some pigs there safe on the 26th of August—I missed one at seven o'clock on the 27th—Salmon was my carter—I asked him the reason he was not at home last evening—he made no answer—I said, "You did not sleep in your bed last night"—be said, "When I did come home I found the sty open, and all the pigs in the orchard"—I said, "That accounts for our missing a pig, are you sure you know nothing about this pig?"—he said, "Nothing whatever"—I then went to the station, and told the inspector, and had Salmon taken—I went to the Nag's Head, Hammersmith, and saw Maynard shutting the great gates—went in, and looked about as if I was in want of the water-closet—I perceived some pig-styles, and there saw my pig—Maynard followed me—I said, "You have a pretty pig there, how long have you had it"—he said, "Three or four days"—I then asked if I could see the landlord of the house—he said he was in-doors—I went in-doors and saw the landlady—I came out into the yard, and asked Maynard how much he gave for we pig—he made no answer, but said it was his property—he then said, "If you think it is your pig, pray take it"—I said, "No, I shall not take n at present"—he then said, "I will be d—d if any pig shall stop here, I will turn it into the street"—he then asked if my name was not Nicholls—I said, "It is, and you have got a pig that has been stolen from my place"—he was then in the act of opening the sty to turn the pig into the</p>

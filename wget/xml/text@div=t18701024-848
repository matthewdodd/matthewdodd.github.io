                  </hi>. I am a box-maker, of 6, Camomile Street—on the 29th November I had a workshop in Green Dragon Yard, Half Moon Street, Bishopsgate—the prisoner had a workshop opposite my place at that time—I had in my care the hind part of a waggonette, the springs and axletree, worth about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. one wheel the party it belonged to had taken away—I missed these portions of the waggonette about the 29th September, I don't know the date exactly—the fore part of the waggonette was left behind—I spoke to the prisoner about the loss, being an intimate friend and in the line, and I employed him to take the fore part of the waggonette to prevent any further robbery, which he did—that was three days after I missed it—he said "It is a great shame; who has done it?" and he seemed to take an interest in trying to find it—two days after I went with him and the officer to the Cattle Market, to see if the things had been offered fer sale there—in consequence of information from the police, on the night of the 21st July, I went next morning to the prisoner's place in Talbot Court, Grace-church Street, where he had removed to, with the officer, Mr. Lye, and Mr. Sheppard, the owner of the waggonette; we there saw the things produced, they are the same I lost the previous November—the prisoner was not there.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi> 921). On 21st July I went to 6, Talbot Court, Gracechurch Street, and searched a workshop there, occupied by the prisoner—I found these springs and axles, and the brass cape were given to me by Mr. Lye—I told the prisoner that I had found the springs at his place which had been taken from Mr. Honniball's premises, and asked if he wished to account for them—he said "Yes, I bought them of Charley Lye, of Half Moon Street"—he afterwards said "Well, sir, to tell you the truth, I bought them in Willow Walk"—I asked from whom—he said he did not know—he then said to me "For God's sake, sir, don't be too hard upon me"—on 20th September, two months afterwards, I apprehended the prisoner at Hollo way, coming out of the prison—ho then said he had bought them at the cattle market.</p>

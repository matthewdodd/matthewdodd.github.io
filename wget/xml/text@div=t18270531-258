            . I was under White in Mr. St. John's service. About three months ago White proposed to me to rob master - I told him I would do nothing of the sort; he then went and got three bushels of oats from the granary, in a sack, and put into Grant's car, which stood in the yard; John Grant had brought it there, but was gone to town - William was not there - Grant is a hay-jobber; I had heard no conversation between White and him - John had brought a load of hay in the cart; he went to London to fetch another cart; he returned about half-past eleven o'clock, with a horse only, and took away the cart - I was afterwards coming back from Edmonton and met John Grant drawing the cart, with the corn in it, and a little loose hay; shortly after this White asked if I would have any thing to drink out of what Grant gave him; I said No; he said he had got some money from Mr. Grant, and if I liked to drink, or have part of it, I might; I had only seen John Grant there that morning; Mr. St. John turned me away on the 17th of May, about some corn found under the manger; I could not get a place, and came to him and gave information; nobody requested me to do so; White had left him that day; I believe it was after I gave the information; I have not spoken to White since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Your master accused you of stealing oats? A. Yes, those under the manger; I ought to have mentioned this, but did not wish to make a disturbance; I went to tell him of it this day week, because he was blaming me to every body, and I could not get a place; I should have told him if I had got one - the Grants live at Enfield-highway; I was driving a coach when I met him in the cart, about twenty minutes past twelve o'clock; I did not speak to him; he had returned about half-past eleven; the oats were in a sack; I was going out on a coach when he came to the yard; White handed the corn from the granary; I saw him do it; I did not mean to have a shilling of the money it fetched; White told me he was going to send some hay-seeds away - I cannot swear that the sack contained corn.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was there any hay-seed at the granary? A. No: the sack I saw in the cart was the same as I saw put into it; I had passengers on my coach when I saw him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could you tell what was in the sack? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. ST. JOHN. I have missed no hay-seeds; I had not got so much as a sack; there was nothing in the granary but oats; the oats were worth 12s.</p>

            . I am constable of Edmonton. I apprehended the Grants, and told them the charge; the father said he knew nothing about it - the son said nothing; I neither threatened nor promised them any thing; as we went to the cage John said, his father, he was certain, knew nothing at all about it - but he had received them himself, and paid 5s. for them; he said so twice.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he say how he received it? A.

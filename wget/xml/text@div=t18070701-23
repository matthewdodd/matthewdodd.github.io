               <p>Q. On Friday the 22nd of May were you in possession of a cow. - A. I was, I saw her about nine o'clock in the evening in the meadow.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your gate secured. - A. It was locked. On the next morning about five o'clock I missed her; the gate was lifted off the hinges, and the cow was gone. It was a little black cow.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of information on the Monday morning following, did you come to Smithfield. - A. I did, with a person of the name of Fleming, and Garment joined us soon after; I came to Smithfield on Monday morning a little after three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find your cow in Smithfield. - A. About four, or a little after four, I found my cow tied to a rail in Smithfield market.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180707010028"></xptr> did, a tall man in a blue coat; it was the prisoner at the bar, he had on a red handkerchief, and there were white spots in it; the prisoner was so dressed at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. How near to the cow was he standing. - A. About three yards, I suppose.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you do upon seeing that man and seeing the cow. - A. About an hour and a half after that I saw a friend of mine, Mr. Garment; I kept watching the cow and the man during that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the man keep near the cow or leave her. - A. I believe during that time the man put the cow in some other person's hand and left the cow.</p>
               <p>Q. When Garment joined you, did you desire him to do any thing. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what you desired him to do, did you see him go towards the cow. - A. I did, I observed him to be conversing with Curtis a salesman; I saw the prisoner again in about ten minutes, I pointed him out to Garment; he went up to the prisoner, I believe he conversed with him about half an hour, I stood near him watching him; at last I went up to him, and at that time Garment was buying the cow of the prisoner; I charged the constable with the prisoner for selling the cow to Garment.</p>
               <p>Court. You charged him with stealing it. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that your cow. - A. Yes, I am very certain it was; the prisoner said what do you charge me for, I replied for the cow; I asked Garment if he had not sold him that cow, he said yes, that black cow for seven guineas; I said that is my cow; then I charged the constable with him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. What is the value of the cow. - A. Ten guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you since shewn that cow to Hunt. - A. Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you point out that cow to Hunt, or did he select it himself. - A. He selected it himself, it was with two others in the field.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you shewn that cow to Mrs. Ryning. - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any marks about the cow. - A. Yes, some grey hairs over the right eye.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Then the only mark that I understand you to know her by, the cow has some grey hairs over her right eye - is that the only mark. - A. She has a full staring eye.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you never see a cow with a full staring eye. - A. Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, with respect to a few grey gairs, I suppose you have seen a cow with that before. - A. I cannot say that I have exactly like that.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you had the cow. - A. About four or five months.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a married man. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any partner with you in your business. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You are quite sure it is your cow. - A. I am quite certain of it.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of what the prosecutor said to you, did you accost the prisoner. - A. I went to the prisoner, about pigs; after that we got into conversation about the price of beasts; I told him I had been cheapening a little cow in the market for a friend of mine; he told me that he had got one in the market; I asked him what part of the market it was, he told me it was at the further part of the market; I made answer that I had been cheapening one at the further part of the market, a small cow; I asked him if he would like to take a walk with me to the further part of 
the market, as I had been cheapening this cow; he took a walk with me to the cow; then I asked him if it was his property, he said it was his cow. I asked the price of the cow, the salesman said the price of the cow was eight guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that Mr. Curtis. - A. I do not know his name; I told the prisoner that price was too much, it was more than I could afford to give, I would give him seven guineas; the prisoner soon after made answer you shall have it; he was taken up immediately; I looked round immediately to Mr. Bliss.</p>
               <p>Q. On your looking round to Mr. Bliss he came up, and the constable took him into custody. - A. Yes, and the cow was taken away.</p>


               <p>Q. Was that the cow which Mr. Bliss claimed. - A. Yes, the same cow which Mr. Bliss claimed to be his property.</p>

               <p>Q. On Saturday May the 23d did the prisoner come to your house. - A. He did, about half past nine.</p>
               <p>Q. On that morning did he bring any thing with him. - A. He brought a black cow with him; her horn was tied by a cord to her foot, she was put into my yard; he asked me to let my servant milk the cow; in consequence of his request she did.</p>
               <p>Q. After she had milked the cow, did she say any thing. - A. I have a little black cow, very much like that cow; she said though that cow was like mine, it did not give so much milk; he replied, she had been brought nineteen miles that accounted for her not giving so much milk. I asked him if he had bought the cow at the fair; he told me he had.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he say what fair. - A. He did not; he told me to take care of the cow, and he would call in the evening; the cow remained there till the evening; he called again, and requested the servant to milk her again in the evening, and the morning. He told me he should take her away on Monday morning to Smithfield; accordingly she was taken on the Monday morning to Smithfield, I was in bed, I heard the cow go out. I saw the cow at Mr. Bliss's. That is the cow that was at my house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. I understand you to say that this cow the prisoner had was like your cow. - A. Yes, if I saw them together I should know my own cow, there is a difference in the heads of the two cows.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I propose to read this examination.</p>
               <p>Court. I do not know how that can be evidence to you.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I have no objection to it.</p>
               <p>(The examination read). The prisoner being asked what he had to say, saith, that on the 23d of September, about half past nine in the morning, he was at the World's-end, public house, King's-road, Chelsea, in company with two or three other persons; that on leaving that house, they went into the road, and met a man with the cow, that he returned with the man and the cow to the World's-end; and that the man offered him the cow for seven guineas, and he took six guineas and a half for the cow.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, called no witnesses to character.</p>

               <p>—my husband has the charge of Mowing-wharf, East Greenwich, the property of Sir John Scott Lilley—there is a factory on the wharf, in which is a steam engine, which has not been used for some time—the factory is locked up, quite closed—on Wednesday, 19th February, about ten minutes to 3, my child gave me some information—I went to the factory door and found it fastened—I looked through a large key-hole and saw the prisoner working very fast at the engine, trying to take some of the things off I think—I sent a person for a policeman—the policeman came and looked in at the key-hole and saw him—I told him to go round to the back—the padlock of the back-door was open, hanging to the staple of the door—I tried to get in at that door and could not—I told the policeman to break it open, and he did so—we found the prisoner inside hanging over the rafters of the house—another man that I gave information to brought a ladder to get him down, I think—he got down by the wall, he did not wait for the ladder—when he was taken into custody the engine was examined, and one of the brass bearings was down by the side of the engine, away from its place—the policeman took it up, and said, "I will examine you"—he said, "I have nothing"—the policeman said, "I will not take your bare word for that, I am used to your kind of customers"—the prisoner said nothing to that—the policeman said that he must have had a wrench to get the things of—he said that it was a wrench that was on the premises that he had made use of—he was taken to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the husband of the last witness, and have the charge of this factory for Sir John Scott Lilley—about 4 o'clock on Wednes<lb></lb>day, 19th February, after the prisoner had been locked up, I went to the factory—the constable gave me the padlock which was on the back door (I had seen that safe at 3 o'clock on the afternoon of the 18th)—I found it as if it had been unlocked—it had been picked, for I had the key of the house in my possession—I examined the engine and found different parts of it disconnected, brass taken off the pump—I found two guage cocks, they were broken off the boiler; some of the brass work of the engine—the con<lb></lb>stable showed me a brass bearing—the engine and those things were safe in their proper position the day before.</p>

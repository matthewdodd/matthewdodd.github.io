On the 7th of March last I met the prisoner at the King's Arms coffee house, over Blackfriars-bridge, where I usually at that time dined, we dined together, and in conversation at dinner, or after dinner, he said he had served his clerkship to a gentleman at Ludlow, in Shropshire, and that the name was Kinnersley and that he had been sent by his father to London to get into an attorney's office for improvement,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110125"></xptr>and that he had been recommended to Messrs Kinnersley and Long, at Symonds-inn, Chancery-lane, that he had been there but they had no vacancy; he said his father meant to give fifty pounds with him to be at an attorney's office a year or two; he then asked if I wanted such a person, or if I knew any gentleman that did? I asked him who he knew in town to give him a character? he said he knew Alderman Harley, and Alderman Harley knew him, and his family very well, and Mr. Knight, the member of parliament, knew him, and he said the lady of that house knew him, who, when I enquired, she said that he had been there about a twelve month before with his father, and she gave me a very favourable account of the young man and his family. On this I asked him to drink tea with me; he did; and he asked if he might come the next day? I said by all means; he came on the 8th and continued till the Thursday following, the 14th. On the 14th I had the balance of account, in a case that I had, to send into the country, the sum of one hundred and fifty-five pounds, six shillings and two-pence. On the 14th, in the morning, I went and looked into my drawer, and I had two hundred pounds, I went to my drawer I looked at my money, because I had to make the former payment either that day or the next.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the money there in bank notes or in cash? - In bank notes; there were two fiftys, two twenty fives, one twenty, and three tens.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the prisoner was in the chamber at the time you looked into this drawer? - That same morning he was not in the chambers, but the day before I had been putting a bank note in the drawer, and the prisoner was warming himself by the office fire, and he was looking at me at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. When you was about what? - At these bank notes. On the 14th I left the chambers in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether you left the prisoner in the chambers? - I am sure I left him in the chambers that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time did you leave him in the chambers? - In the morning about ten or a little after.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other clerk at that time? - My other clerk was with me; there was nobody left in the chambers but the prisoner; I took the other clerk with me, and just before I went I saw the bank notes in the drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner again, after you left your chamber in the morning? - He asked what time I should be at home? and my clerk said between six and seven in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him again that day? - Yes, I did. I went to the same coffee house where I used to dine between two and three.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you returned to your chamber in this interval? - I had not. The prisoner was at the coffee room at dinner? says I, dinner so soon? he usually used to go with me to dinner at three o'clock; so I sat down and dined with him; after dinner he asked me if I had been at the the chambers? I said, no; why has any body been there? he said nobody but Mr. Knight, the member of parliament, whom he said stayed with him above half an hour; I said directly, I wished to have been at home, because I wanted to see Mr. Knight, because he referred me to Mr. Knight for his character, and it would have saved me the trouble of going to Whitehall; he said that Mr. Knight had asked him to drink tea with him that afternoon, and could he go? I said by all means; I asked him what time he intended to go? he said Mr. Knight told him to be at his house at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110126"></xptr>five o'clock; I said, five o'clock, that is too early for a gentleman. He called for a glass of brandy and water, in the mean time a gentleman came into the coffee house to speak to me, and just as the brandy and water was brought he disappeared; I did not see him after; he never returned to the chambers that I could learn; I never see him again till the 12th of July, and that merely accidental.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after this conversation was it you returned to your chambers? - I drank tea at my chambers; I returned about six; I found my chambers locked.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any appearance of violence about your chambers? - No, not that night; I perceived nothing that night that led me to any suspicion; I had this one hundred and twenty-five pounds to send into the country in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the drawer where these notes were, the evening you returned from the coffee house? - No, I did not; it was the next morning, the Friday between ten and eleven o'clock. I slept in the chambers that night.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state did you find the drawer? - I went to the drawer, drew it out, and went to a memorandum book which I replaced these bank notes in, within its leaves; this book was there, and the notes out of the book.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that lead you to make any observation on the drawer itself? - I pulled out the drawer, I found it had been wrenched open by some instrument or other, as if they had got under the table and wrenched it under.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this drawer separate by itself, and no drawer under it? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. So any person might have applied an instrument to the bottom of that drawer, and it appeared to have been wrenched? - It did.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you have not been able to trace any of the notes? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. After he had applied for you to take him he told you it was necessary for him to write to his father, to have his consent, and that before he compleated this agreement with you he was to receive his father's answer's? - It was so.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time you were together you lived together? - We did; we dined together.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the landlady of the King's Arms coffee house was a near relation of your's? - Yes, she is.</p>
               <p>Q. It was to her you applied for his character, and she satisfied you? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 14th, after the time, he went back to your sister's house where you always dined, and there he dined? - It was so.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore it might appear that he wanted to meet you? - To be sure one might think so, that he went to meet me.</p>
               <p>Q. When he told you that Mr. Knight had asked him to visit him that night, did not you say then, you had better make haste, for it is time to set off? - It may have been so, but I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he finished his dinner, and called for a glass of brandy and water, and when he went away you was otherwise engaged with some body else? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't know whether you are aware of it; do you know that on the morning of the 15th, he really did receive a letter from his father forbidding him to enter into the engagement with you? - I do not know it, it may be so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he the only person that had access to your chambers? - The laundress always has a key.</p>
               <p>Q. And how is that key disposed of when the laundress does not want to come to the house? - Left at the porter's lodge; but the porter would be very particular whom he gave the key to.</p>

               <p>I am a woollen draper and man's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110127"></xptr>mercer, Charing-cross. I saw the prisoner at the bar; I cannot exactly say the day of the month; I have an entry in my book of an article he had the 23d of March, it was between the 12th and the 23d, I cannot speak nearer than that; it was between the hours of nine and ten o'clock at night; the shop was shut up; I was up stairs, and he came with another person, whom he called his servant; he immediately called me by my name, and he says, you recollect me, I had something of you when I was at the Golden Cross sometime ago; I did then recollect him; I took him into the back shop, and he told me that he wanted half a dozen waistcoats if I had them ready made, and a coat or two he wanted; I told him I had not got the articles ready made, but I could make them for him at a very short notice; he seemed to be very urging if I had any thing of the kind, as he meant to go abroad immediately; he informed me that he had seen an advertisement for one that wanted a companion who was going abroad; he said that he had seen that advertisement in some news paper that he could not recollect, and asked me if I could tell him? I told him I did not recollect any reference; there happened to be a waistcoat ready made for a gentleman that I thought would about fit him, and he had that waistcoat and a pair of drawers; he took his pocket book out of his pocket, and out of that pocket book he took a quantity of bank notes, and offered to pay me if I would give him change.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinguish the notes? - I could not distinguish any of the bank notes. On his offering to pay me for them, I told him it was no consequence, as he had things before I was not afraid to trust him, or words to that effect; he agreed to call the next morning to look out the goods that he wanted, and he gave me his address, that he lodged at the King's Arms, Blackfriars-road; I expected him the next day, but I did not see him afterwards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Are you sure that he is the man? - I have no doubt at all about it.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not seen him since March? - Not till I saw him at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Court. How often had you seen him at your house? - To the best of my recollection he called once or twice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. If I understand you right, you had some difficulty in recollecting him, if he had not told you he was the person that came before? - I had a deal of conversation with him that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it not appear to you extraordinary that that man should resort to you to know about a person for travelling? - It did not.</p>
               <p>Q. At this night, you knew from him, that he lodged at the King's Arms coffee house? - Or else I should not have known were to have applied.</p>
               <p>Q. You have stated it to have been on the 12th or 23d, will you take on you to say upon your oath that it was before the 14th? Will you venture on your recollection to say that this time when he called and produced the bank notes was not before the 14th? - When I called to enquire for him at the King's Arms coffee house, they told me that he had robbed his master.</p>

               <p>Q. On your oath was it not before the 14th? - It might be, I will not be sure.</p>
               <p>Court to Marshall. Was this King's Arms the same coffee house that you dined at? - The same coffee house.</p>

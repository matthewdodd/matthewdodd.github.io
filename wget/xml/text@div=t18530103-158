                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Frederick Barnes; he is an ironmonger. On 21st Dec.; about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner at the counter, purchasing some percussion caps—I was not serving him, I was about sixteen feet from him—while I was away from the counter, I saw him put some parcels of knives into his pocket—they were in parcels, on an iron chest, behind him—I went to the invoice to see how many were missing—I went to the prisoner, and told him he had some of our knives—he took one parcel out of his pocket, put it on the counter, and said, "Here are your knives"—he then ran off—I followed him, and as he ran he dropped one parcel in the road—the policeman took him—I took the parcel which he dropped in the road to the station—I did not lose sight of him.</p>

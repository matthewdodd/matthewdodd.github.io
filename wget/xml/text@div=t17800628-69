The high constable and I had been all night at the Rotation-office, to defend it. We were in Bloomsbury-square about eight o'clock, I saw the prisoner at Lord Mansfield's; I knew his person well before; he had a large bar of iron, and was sitting upon the cell of the window, and breaking down a wall of a building which was separate from Lord Mansfield's house; there was a vast concourse of people there. I suppose near two thousand; I durst not apprehend the prisoner on account of the concourse of people. I saw him three days after at the Rotation-office, on another charge.</p>

               <p>I am under-butler to Lord Mansfield. I was at my lord's house on the 6th of June, when the mob first came. I saw the prisoner about four in the morning. I passed him several times in the house with my Lord's liquor in his hand coming out of the house; I saw him in the street afterwards near the place that was pulled down; but I did not observe him doing any thing. He had nothing in his hand but his crutch then. I saw him carrying out the bottles before.</p>

               <p>I got up about a quarter before four o'clock, I was dry; the people said there was a shocking murder done in Bloomsbury-square. I went there and saw a soldier wallowing in his blood. On the 11th of June I was taken up by a constable on suspicion of picking a gentleman's pocket. After I was fully committed, the constable came and said as I was committed he would charge me with pulling down my Lord Mansfield's house.</p>

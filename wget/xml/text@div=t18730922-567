I live at 116, Horseferry Road, Westminster, and am in the employment of a confectioner—on Wednesday, 20th August, I served the prisoner with two pieces of sandwich—he gave me a florin—I tried it in the detector and bent it, and said "This is a bad 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece"—he said "I will take it back where it came from"—he snatched it from my hands and ran away, leaving the sandwich.</p>

I keep the Barley Mow, Horseferry Road, West<lb></lb>minster—on Friday morning, 22nd August, the prisoner came in about 5.30 in the morning—I open at 5 o'clock—he asked for a pennyworth of old ale and a penny worth of gin—he put down a half-crown—I gave him a florin and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—he said that he was very ill—he left—I put the half-crown by the side of the till—I never put half-crowns in the till—a few minutes afterwards he came in again and asked for a half-pint of ale and a pennyworth of gin and gave me 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said he was very ill, he had had some money, left him, and had been on the drink for three weeks with some friends who stuck to him, and he could not shake them off—he said would I give him 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of gin and bitters as that had sometimes a good effect upon him—I served him and he gave me a half-crown—I put it by the side of the other and gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—I then went down into the cellar—when I came back I found the two half-crowns were bad—I then went out to look for him and found him in Peter Street, followed him, and gave him in custody—I gave the half-crowns up at the station.</p>

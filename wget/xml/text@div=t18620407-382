I am curate at the parish church of St. Mary's, Lambeth—on Sunday morning, 5th January, I performed a service of marriage, between Robert Francis Fairlie and Eliza Ann England, in pursuance of this licence, which was produced to me, not by banns—the license had then the seal of the Court on it—after I had solemnized the marriage the signatures were made in the register by the persons—the two persons whom I married signed the register—I have got the register here it is between Robert Francis Fairlie, of full age, widower, engineer address, Vassal-road; father's name, Archibald Fairlie, deceased, engineer and Eliza Ann England, minor, spinster; residence, St Paul, Deptford; father's name, and surname, George England; profession, engineer—and these are the signatures of the two persons whom I married—the seal of the license is generally taken off by the clerk, he keeps the license.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the father of Eliza Ann England who has been married to the defendant—I never gave my consent to the marriage of my daughter—the signature to this register is my daughter's handwriting—she was eighteen years of age on 6th July last—I remember a conversation which took place between the defendant and myself with reference to some atten<lb></lb>tions which he proposed to pay to my daughter—I have had notice to pro<lb></lb>duce my diary in which that conversation was entered, and have it here—I showed it to the defendant after I had written, it—it is under the date of Friday, 25th January, 1861; it is headed, "Mr. Fairlie—had long conversa<lb></lb>tion respecting Lizzie," that is my daughter; "I told him, if he takes no steps in that direction for two years, from this day, I will then give him the same permission I have given Dickson; that is to the exercise of his powers to win the affections of my daughter, but on no account to make any attempts to pave the way before that time;" that is underlined—when I showed it to the defendant, about a week afterwards, he wanted to make it appear that I had said the promise was, that he should have her at the end of two years; and I said, "No; I will show you the entry that I made at the time," and when I read it I underlined those words, "pave the way "—that was done in his presence—he and I being both freemason's, belonging to the same lodge, he pledged me his word and honour, as a man and a mason, that he would strictly observe those conditions—that was the substance of what passed, and on those conditions he continued to visit at my house—about Septem<lb></lb>ber, 1861, I had occasion to observe that he was paying attention to my daughter; I spoke to him about it, and I said that he was not observing the conditions that I had previously imposed upon him, and which he had promised to maintain, and I then requested him that he would entirely cease his attention to my daughter, and if he could not keep his promise that he had so sacredly given, he was not again to visit my house—I think that was in September—he never visited my house after that—I remember my daughter going with Mr. Dickson and another daughter, on 4th January, to the Crystal Palace—I was not at all aware that she would meet Mr. Fairlie there, I thought he was then in Spain, for I had received a letter from him a few days previously—I expected my daughter's return to my house that day; she did not come back—I heard of her that evening from Mr. Dickson; he came to me and fetched me from Mr. Alderman Rose's, where I was</p>

Q.</hi> Is this your prosecution? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am the mover, most certainly; I appeal to the law for the protection it will afford me against such an outrage—I know that the defendant went to Spain subsequently to the marriage; but before that he caused a communication to be sent to me, as if coming from him in Spain, although he was then in London—I preferred this bill against him while he was in Spain with my daughter—he is not my son-in-law, and never will be—I applied to a Magistrate, the Hon. Mr. Nor<lb></lb>ton, and acted under his advice—I came here and preferred the bill—I received a letter from the defendant the very day my daughter left, when I got home at night—I received another from him during the period he was at Cadiz—my danghter sent letters one after another to her mother—I never stopped them—she gave them to me unopened—I have read then—I am not sure whether I have got them here, I think I have—my daughter has property so far as all children have in the success of their parents—she has none in her own right—of course she can never get a farthing's worth of my property except by my own will, unless I choose to will it to her, and you may depend upon it she never will; but this man thought she was to have 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was his expectation—he knew it was entirely dependent upon me—he knew exactly how my family were situated—I say that the under<lb></lb>standing with him was that he was to make no attempt to pave the way—I adhere to that most positively—I swear most positively that I have not assisted him in paving the way since that time—my daughter's birthday was on 6th July—I did not, on that occasion, receive from the hands of the defendant a very handsome bracelet, nor about that time—it was a law, time previous, in the previous year—I will swear it was not last year—it was previous to her birthday last year—I gave that bracelet to my daughter with my own hands—I did not tell her who it came from—allow me to explain—I insist upon explaining it—I handed her the bracelet myself, and I represented that it was a present of my own—Mr. Fairlie had produced the bracelet, and asked my permission to give it to my daughter, Eliza Ann—I said, "No, Mr. Fairlie; after the pretensions you are making to that girl, I cannot allow you to do anything of the sort"—he said, "Well; I have been to the photographer's where a photograph exists of you; I have had a miniature photograph taken of it put into this bracelet; it is not of any earthly use to me as it is, will you accept it from me, and give it to your daughter, instead of any present you are about to make to her?" which he knew I was about to do, there being some festival, and I am in the habit of making my daughter's presents—he asked if I would accept it, aud give it to her, as if I had purchased it myself and get my portrait put into it—I did so; and, for anything I know, to the present moment, the girl never know to the contrary, nor any of my family; even my wife does not know now that that took place—I allowed my daughter to wear it, falsely representing to her that I had purchased it for her, because it waa given to me by a friend as I then considered.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But why should you take the credit of giving your daughter a forty guinea bracelet, when it waa given you by the defendant? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have explained the circumstances—forty guineas! four guineas you mean, I sup<lb></lb>pose—I have got it now, and she never sees it again you may depend—she left it at home when she eloped—I mean to keep it—she won't get it—I know it to be his property, and I wish it had always remained his—I mean to</p>

There is another objection, viz.—the absence of any confirmatory evidence that the defendant had not Mr. England's consent on the day in question, 4th January; the only evidence on that point would be the defendants letter, which has not been put in.</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">That letter disposes of the last point; with reference to the first, my friend has ingeniously mixed up the affidavit which might have been made with that which was in fact made; the licence was undoubtedly issued in pursuance of the defendant's statement, falsely made, that he had the father's consent; true, he adds to it a statement which it is now contended in point of law was incorrect, and that Mr. George England it not the father, but that I apprehend it immaterial; he himself, by his statement at the Vicar-generals Office, made it essential to his getting the licence, that he had George England's consent, and then he falsely swears that he has that consent; how can that be said to be immaterial to the issue of the licence, when but for that statement of his, on oath, the licence would not have been issued. I further say that the Act of Parliament probably refers to the consent of the natural as well as the</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">legal father and mother; it is said that the consent of the mother should have been obtained, but the law takes no more notice of the illegitimate child of a mother than of a father. For certain purposes the law recognises in the character of father or mother, the natural father or mother of an illegitimate child; but I am not aware that the law draws anp distinction between the father end mother's status in that respect; for certain purposes of affiliation &amp;c. after the age of sixteen, the mother's settlement, must decide that of the illegitimate child but that it a matter technically arising out of the law; the law really takes no further notice of the illegitimate child of the mother than of the father. It is said that the defendant might have made an affidavit according to the facts, that so have procured the licence, but he does not do so—he distinctly points out George England as the person that has given his consent, and falsely swears that he hat done so. Then it it not the same at Reg. v. Phlipott, 2 Denison, p. 302, where it was held, that as the defendant had thought proper to make a matter material, it raised the question, and the materiality of perjury arose. I am unable to distinguish the principle of that case from the present; then it is impossible to contend that but for that false allegation the licence would have been issued. I find no trace in the Act of Parliament of making the law applicaple to a false oath control the materiality of the perjury; there is no necessity for any averment of materiality—there was no such averment in Reg. V. Chapman, 1st Denison, which was discussed at great length in the Court of Criminal Appeal.</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RECORDER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">I wish you would direct your attention to the form of your indictment; you distinctly aver as the offence here, that he stated so and so, and is your declaration you aver "he being the person whose consent was by law requried, before the said Vicar-general was entailed to grant the said licence."</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">I apprehend that raises the same point, because if it be immaterial for this purpose it may be rejected; it is not necessary to him that ment proved, the mere fact that, it is averred carries it no further; the Jury may reject that portion of the indictment, and then it would stand that he had untruly sworn that George England had consented.</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi> (<hi rend="italic">in reply). With regard to the averment of immaterial, there never wat any necessity for an averment of materiality in perjury at all; it was only put in by the pleaders when the alleged false state<lb></lb>ment did not show it to be material to the question; you must either show materiality on the face of the indictment, or aver it; in the present instance they have undertaken to show materiality on the face of it; they do not allege materiality, but they allege the absence of consent of the natural and lawful father, the person whom it is shown on the face of the indictment, according to the Act of Parliament, would be the person who alone could give consent; I should have contended, if that had been omitted, that the indictment would have been open to objection; that there was neither an averment of materiality, nor materiality thown. A distinction has been attempted to be drawn between this indictment and an ordinary indictment for perjury. I belive the only reason why a person cannot be indicted for taking a false oath before the Surrogate is, that it it not in a judicial proceeding, which it one of the elements of perjury, therefore is called "a false oath," but all the other mattert connected with Perjury are just as applicable at if within the strict form; therefore the state<lb></lb>ment, that a matter need not be material in order to support a charge of taking a false oath, cannot be supported upon principle. Again, it hat been urged that this is material, and on the ground that, however immaterial a thing may really be, yet if a person imagines it to be material, or uses it so as to produce any effect, in that case there is as much materiality at if the matter wat really</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">material; but the words are "material to the issue;" that is, it is something that if true, will go towards proving the issue and Reg. v. Philpott, it a strong authority in my favour, and from Lord Campbell's Judgment the distinctions between that case and the present it perfectly clear.</hi> (<hi rend="smallCaps">THE RECORDER</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">called attention to Reg. v. Gibbons</hi>). <hi rend="italic">I am not familiar with the details of that case, but at my friend has not quoted it, I may infer it it not in his favour. Supposing here that there was no father or mother, and he had sworn that he had the constent of the father, I apprehend that would be a matter wholly imma<lb></lb>terial, there being no such person in existence—here, he says, "I have the content of so and so, the father," then we must look to what legal power the father has; I contend that if the father had been present, and had given his consent, it would not have been a content within the meaning of the Act of Parliament, if the case I have quoted it correct: a guardian it bound to the appointed by the Court of Chancery, and he alone could give the consent required by the Act. It is clear that a legal connexion, and a legal position, must be referred to in the Act of Parliment, and it it for the purpose of maintaining those rights, and that position, that this number of restriction on put upon it; it does not anticipate the question of a father in relation to a bastard child, who hat no rights whatever in society, and has no claim upon the father, even to make him support it with its daily bread: if deserted by him, the could not by application to a Magistrate, or elsewhere, obtain any assistant from him within the Poor Law Act; the child, until the marriagt of the mother, follows the settlement of me mother, after that the has no rights, no position, no claim; if I am right in that, the father of such a child has neither right or claim upon her duty or obedience, and has no right whatever to expect that the should obtain his permittion to do any particular act.</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COMMON SERJEANT</hi>). <hi rend="italic">I am generally exceeding unwilling to stop a case upon a point of law without taking the opinion of the Jury upon the facts, especially when there is an opportunity, as there now is of reserving it for the consideration of the Court of Appeal, but if I entertain a clear opinion, I think I am bound to take that course; I do so here; and I am confirmed in that opinion by the Common Serjeant; I think that in this case the charge that is made is not established; there might be some question raised upon the point, of whether the particular averment was or was not material, but here the particular form of the charge is, that the defendant intended to obtain the licence without the consent of the lawful and natural father of the said Eliza Ann England; now that is not this case, because it appears upon the evidence that there is no lawful and natural father, and the distinct averment here made is, that the said George England is the lawful and natural father, that seems to be the form of charge made throughout, and that charge does not, upon this evidence, appear to be established, it is, therefore my duty to say, that in point of law, there is no evidence to support the charge.</hi>

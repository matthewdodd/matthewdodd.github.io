I am barmaid at the "Duke of York," Somers Town—on 22nd December the prisoner and another man came in—I knew the prisoner from having served him three or four weeks before, but I forget what took place then—the prisoner asked for a half-quartern of gin hot, which come to 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a florin, and I gave him the change—I put it into the till—there was no other florin there—the barman, Hether<lb></lb>ington, then came from his tea, and told me to go to tea—I went away, leaving the prisoner there—Hetherington came into the kitchen to me, and</p>

               <p>Q. Could you at all form a judgement how the people had got in? - A. Yes; they had taken out two bars from the cellar-window.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner, Wingrove? - A. Yes; he lived about two hundred yards from me in the town of Staines. After they had got into the cellar, they broke the cellar-door, and had the range of the house; they had bored a gimblet over the latch of the door, to prevent any body coming down in case of an alarm; they afterwards opened the yard-door that went into the stable-yard from the passage of the dwelling-house, to get<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120049"></xptr>the tubs out, for they were too large to get out at the cellar window, where they had broke in: the next morning I applied for a search-warrant, but it was near six in the evening before I served the warrant upon the witness, Clarke; I was present when his house was searched; we found there one dozen of wine; we found nothing else there; I found a tub of gin and a tub of ox-moor buried in the aits, a little island in the Thames; I never saw Wingrove after that, we searched after him several times, but he never appeared in Staines afterwards to my knowledge.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a labourer: In October, 1795, I lived in Staines, about 300 yards from Mr. Lawrence's house; I have known the prisoner these thirteen years; I saw him and another come out of Mr. Lawrence's passage with bottles in his hands between one and two o'clock in the morning, I cannot tell who the other man was; they both crossed the road, and went up the back side of Middle-row, towards Clark's house, with the liquor.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean that Clark who was admitted King's evidence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was Wingrove? - A. I took particular notice of him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you hear that Mr. Lawrence had been robbed? - A. About ten o'clock the next day, and then I went and told Mr. Lawrence of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen Wingrove since? - A. Yes, I saw him one night at Staines, I suppose a twelvemonth ago, or not quite so much, he was leaning over some rails in Staines, but I did not know it was him at the time I saw him, I have heard that he has been there several times.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. This robbery was near three years ago? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the night was it you saw him? - A. Between one and two in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you up at that time? - A. I went to bed very soon, and I was very thirsty, I could not find any water in the house, and I took a pitcher to go out to get some water, but I could not get any, and then I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. You lived in Staines, and not know where to get water? - A. I went to the Angel and Crown, but the yard was shut up.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever gone out for water in the night before? - A. Yes, several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been spending your evening? - A. I was in bed by nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Then of course you went to bed sober? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him a twelvemonth ago, and did not know him? - A. He was leaning over the rail, I did not see his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say your memory improves in the course of a year - Do you mean to say now that you know the prisoner? - A. I did not see his face then.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not a witness upon the former trial? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Though you saw a part of the transaction, you were not called as a witness upon that trial? - A. The prisoner was not then taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear of a reward for a burglary? - A. I have never had any reward.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard there was a reward of 40l. in that case? - A. Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Knotts was the man who was convicted of this offence before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw nothing of Knotts, and therefore they did not make you a witness upon that trial? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen the prisoner about his ordinary business from that time to this, in Staines? - A. No.</p>

            , the accomplice, sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. I lived in Middle-row, Staines, when Mr. Lawrence's house was broke open; the prisoner, Wingrove, and Knotts, were concerned with me in breaking the house open, about one o'clock in the night; we broke the cellar door open by pulling the bars down; we took out some wine in bottles, and two tubs of liquor; we carried them all down to Knott's house, and there we parted the liquor, the tubs we carried over the water into the aits; Knott's house was close to the water side, about two hundred yards from my house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had parted the liquor, what did you do with it? - A. They carried theirs to their house, and I carried mine to my house; Wingrove's house was about one hundred yards from my house.</p>
               <p>Q. How many bottles had you? - A.Ten or eleven, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you were taken up for this? - A. The Friday afternoon, the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of Wingrove? - A. He ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he live? - A. In the George-yard, Staines.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he ever been living publickly in Staines since the robbery was found out, till this time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you quit the house? - A. About two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You were one of the gentlemen that broke into the prosecutor's house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were taken up the next day? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120050"></xptr>Q. And then you thought it was the best way to charge the prisoner and another man with robbing the house, in order to escape yourself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That is no new trick, you know? - A. I did not know that.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us the things were taken to Knott's house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure they were carried to Knott's house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if any body says they were carried to Clark's house, they have not told the truth? - A. I carried my share home, but they were taken to Knott's house first and shared.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if any body else has said the things were carried to your house in Middle-row, it is not true? - A. I cannot tell that.</p>
               <p>Q. What time were you kind enough to break into this honest man's house? - A. About one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you be in the house? - A. About an hour, not much more.</p>
               <p>Q. You went in about one o'clock? - A. Yes, and left the house between two and three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you could not possibly have come out of the house till after two o'clock? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if any body else has said you came out at half past one o'clock, that cannot be true? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You were taken up the evening of the next day? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You prosecuted another man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get any share of the 
reward? - A. No.</p>


               <p>Q. But you got your liberty? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you have been a reformed man and lived a good life ever since? - A. Yes, as far as I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Where have you lived since that time? - A. At Staines.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever known any body of the names of Drake and Aldridge? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is become of Aldridge? - A. He is dead; Drake lives at staines.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you give evidence here against them too? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you had reformed since that? - A. I was in confinement.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Were you examined in that case as in this, as King's evidence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys.(To Lawrence.)Q. What is the value of these things? - A. The gin I valued at 3l. the wine at three guineas, and the oxmoor at two guineas.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. That man would swear any man's life away as he did the other man's; I have been at Staines for a week and a fortnight together, and nobody ever said any thing to me, or took any notice of me.</p>

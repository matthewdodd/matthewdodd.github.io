               <p>Prisoner. You did not see me throw it into a shop.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You are sure the prisoner was the person that picked your pocket? - A. I am very sure.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me pick your pocket? - A. I saw you pick my pocket, and I saw you put it into your breast.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see my hand in your pocket? - A. I could not see behind me; I felt your hand in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That is a falsehood, sir.</p>

             sworn. - Q. What do you know of this transaction? - A. I was coming up Tooley-street, about a quarter past three o'clock, and heard the cry of stop thief; the first man I met was the prisoner at the bar, at the corner of the White Horse, in Tothill-street; I pursued him, and when I got about twenty or thirty yards in the court, I saw him put his hand into his bosom and throw away a handkerchief into a green-grocer's shop; the woman of the shop picked it up immediately, and gave it to me over the hatchway; he was stopped, and the gentleman came up and claimed the handkerchief, and he asked me to get an officer; I went to Union-hall and brought an officer, and that gentleman gave charge of him.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure that it was the prisoner that chucked the handkerchief into that shop? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer: I was sent for, between the hours of three and four, to take the prisoner into custody. (Produces the handkerchief, which is identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Please your honour, I was coming over the bridge, on Thursday evening, about a quarter after three; I was going to meet a waggon with some flour, and saw the handkerchief lying on one of the seats on the bridge; I did not know who it belonged to any more than any gentleman who sits here; so soon as this gentleman saw me put it into my bosom, he sung out, stop thief; I am as innocent as either of the gentlemen of the Jury that sits round there; I am not guilty of any thing of the kind, I never did see who it belonged to, nor I never saw the gentleman's pocket.</p>

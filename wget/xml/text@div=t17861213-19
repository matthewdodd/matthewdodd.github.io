               <p>I know the prisoner.</p>
               <p>When did you see him first? - Yesterday was a fortnight; about the evening, at Norwich; he sent for me in a public house, and shewed me the goods to sell; I live at Norwich; I deal in clothes and silver; there was a gold watch, and the things mentioned<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130039"></xptr> in the indictment; he sent for me, and asked me to buy them; I told him yes; he asked me first fourteen guineas, and then ten; and then I thought he did not come honestly by them, as I thought they were worth above three times the value; so I stopped them, and took him before the Mayor: the prisoner said he bought the goods in Ireland; I carried the things up to the Mayor, with the prisoner; I delivered them to the Mayor in the hall.</p>
               <p>Did you see the goods at any time? - Yes, when Mr. Hebb came down, I saw the goods brought along and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Who brought them along? - That man.</p>
               <p>Did you know them to be the same? - Yes, I do know them to be the same goods; they are particular goods; any person can swear to them at any time.</p>
               <p>Did you ask him how he came by them? - Yes; and he said he came from Ireland.</p>
               <p>Had you known the prisoner before? - No, I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Were these goods that you have in your pocket, produced before the Mayor of Norwich? - Yes, they are the same goods.</p>
               <p>And can you take upon you to say that they are yours? - They are some old shop-keepers, and old acquaintance of mine; I am sorry to say we have had them in the house so long; as to this box, we have had it twenty years; it was sold in our sale, and the Jews returned it again; I could have sworn to it any where.</p>
               <p>What might be the value of these things? - I look upon it to be thirty or forty pounds all together; there is no putting a real value upon these things; this box is eighteen guineas in my father's time; it weighs seven pounds; I suppose it may be worth ten pounds; it is such a fancy trade, we lose such a deal by fashion.</p>
               <p>Court to Isaac. Look at these things, and tell us whether they are the same you carried to the Mayor of Norwich? - Yes, they are the same goods.</p>

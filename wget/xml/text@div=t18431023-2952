I live in Hare-street, Bethnal-green, and an foreman to Mr. Frank Jaques, a dyer—the prisoner was in his service, and in the employ of my uncle, who was his predecessor, for seventeen years—I was induced to watch the prisoner on the 12th Oct., and concealed myself in an oak chest, in the skeining room, for about two hours; and saw the prisoner come up with a lamp to look at the clock—he went down again, and in ten minutes he returned and opened the bin where this silk was concealed, and took it out—he threw it on his arms, then took two of the handfuli off, and was tucking them inside his bosom—I immediately opened the chest that was in, walked up to him, and said, "William, I have caught you at last; I have been looking for you for two months past"—he closed his hands, and begged I would forgive him—this silk belongs to Mr. Ballance, but while on the premises it is the property of Mr. Frank Jaques.</p>

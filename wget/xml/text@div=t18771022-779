I live at 2, Great Windmill Street, New Cut, Lambeth—on the 22nd September, at about 8 o'clock p.m., I was at the Sea Lion public-house, Cornwall Road—I was quite sober—my brother was with me, and some one insulted him, and the man and my brother went out to fight—my brother beat him, and the man ran away—another man then came up to fight my brother—I said, "One dog, one bone"—my brother was then on the top of another man outside the public-house—I was going to pick my brother up, and when I was stooping down I felt a dig come at my forehead just above the temple—I dropped my brother and said, "Joe, this man (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner</hi>) has stabbed me"—I put my hand to my forehead and my shirt was all saturated with blood in an instant—I caught Mm by the wrist in an instant—a knife was in his hand—I said, "What did you do that for?" and I up with my fist and knocked him down in self-defence and wrenched the knife from his hand—I held it up and said, "Here is the knife the man stabbed me with," and gave it to a young man named Roberts—there was a dozen going to catch hold of the knife, and I said, "Mr. Roberts, take this knife, mind it for me"—my brother Held him too, and I said, "We won't leave you till a police constable comes," and then I became unconscious till I found myself in bed in the hospital—this is the knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

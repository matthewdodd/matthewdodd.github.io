             desired that the prisoner might drink with us; the prisoner was unknown to me or any of the company; we drank porter from four till eight o'clock, we had had four pots; Hartley's brother-in-law then went away, then the prisoner said, I will drink along with you, he did not join our company till then; I objected to it; he said he would be his pot, I said no, you had better keep<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180002190011"></xptr>your own company; George Scott said, let him drink with us, his pot of beer is as good as ours, upon which he laid hold of the pot to drink; we then sat till between nine and ten, and drank four pots of beer more; then Rudkin had to go to his barracks, each man paid for a pot; George Scott said, we will have a parting pot, which I went and drew immediately; Rudkin slung down his penny to pay towards it; I said, let us be pennys-a-piece, for short reckonings make long friends; James Hartley said he would see me d-d first; I said, there is no occasion to see me d-d first, upon that I said, we will pay his penny amongst us; George Scott jumped up, and said, I was the cause of his coming into your company, I will pay the money for him, only let me go out and make water, and as he was going towards the door, he thrust the sword into him.</p>

               <p>Q. To the best of your recollection was nothing more said? - A. Nothing more on either side; he passed the prisoner, as he went to the door; the deceased turned to me, and said, oh Lord, Kendrick, I am killed, I am dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Nothing had been said by the prisoner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a sword was it? - A. A Dutch sword, that he had brought from Holland.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the sword in his belt? - A. I did not see it in his belt, he had it in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he it in his hand all the evening? - A. No, he gave it to me, and I returned it to him in about ten minutes after.</p>
               <p>Q. What occasioned you to return it to him? - A. He asked me to bring his sword back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him draw it? - A. No, nor I did not see the blow given, but I saw him draw the sword from his body; the deceased made a stop, and fell towards the fire; he died in the course of a quarter of an hour, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the wound? - A. Yes; the prisoner turned about and offered to make his escape, and an old man, William Davis, knocked him down, he had the sword drawn, and I forced myself into the box to him, and hit him over the arm that he held up, which made him drop his arm; I then laid hold of the point of it with my left hand, and with my right hand to the hilt of the sword, wrested it out of his hand and broke it; the landlord came running out of the bar, and the landlady; he went for a surgeon, it was near an hour and a half before he got a surgeon, but the surgeon said he was dead; I carried him up stairs upon my back; we sent for a constable; as we were conveying him to St. Mary-le-bonne watch-house, I had a lauthorn in my hand, and his arms were tied, he came up to me, and said, you have no occasion to say all you know, do not hurt me.</p>
               <p>Q. Before this happened, how were you as to sobriety? - A. We were all a little in liquor, but not to be in any way intoxicated.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner intoxicated? - A. No; he was about in the same form that we were.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. About seven o'clock the prisoner and his brother-in-law entered the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was upon a furlough going to Bandbury? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He told the landlord so, and requested a bed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the brother-in-law drink with you? - A. No; the prisoner did not drink with us till he was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What had the prisoner to drink with his brother-in-law? - A. A pot of ale, and a pint of porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Besides the eight pots? - A. Yes; but he took no part of the first four pots.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of gin was drank in the course of the evening? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. What other liquor? - A. No other, but a pot of porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it been agreed that the prisoner should have a bed there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he gave you his knapsack and his sword, and desired you to put them by, soon after he got there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not in consequence of some dispute between you and the prisoner, respecting the last pot of beer, that he asked for his sword and knapsack? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell him that he should not have a bed there that night, and was not that the cause of your getting him his knapsack and sword? - A. It was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not your own spontaneous act, fetching his sword and knapsack? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not tell him he should not sleep there that night? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a publican of the name of Davis? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear you never told any person that it was in consequence of your endeavouring to turn some person out of the house, that this accident took place? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ask for his sword himself, or did you fetch it him without? - A. No, he asked for it.</p>
               <p>Q. What other arms were produced? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there such a thing as a pistol produced? - A. Yes, by me; he asked me to let him look at it.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he know you had a pistol? - A. Because he saw it in the place where I put his sword.</p>

               <p>Q. In no other way? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not domino played? - A. Not while the prisoner was there; we were at play before the prisoner came in, but not after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner lay down upon the table to sleep? - A. Not till after the deed was done.</p>
               <p>Q. That you mean to swear? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never told any body that he was napping at the table, and that you awoke him to pay the reckoning, and that a quarrel ensued in consequence of his refusal? - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. How many blows passed that night? - A. None, till after he had given the wound.</p>
               <p>Q. Who struck the prisoner? - A. Davis.</p>
               <p>Q. It was in consequence of his refusing to pay his money towards the last pot of porter, that the quarrel ensued? - A. He refused to pay it, but there was no quarrel; Scott got up and said he would pay it for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not Scott go out and return, before the wound was given? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, after the wound was given did he not say, by G-d I am afraid I have hurt him; send for a surgeon? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor you have never told any body so? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in the army? - A. Between six and seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever belong to any other regiment except the guards? - A. Never.</p>

               <p>Q. How much had you drank before? - A. I suppose three or four pots in the course of the afternoon; I said I must be going home to the barracks; the deceased said, let us have a parting pot; upon that Kendrick fetched a fifth pot in, and we drank part of the beer; Kendrick said, we may as well pay for the beer, short reckonings make long friends; Kendrick, the deceased, and I paid our pennys a-piece; Kendrick asked the prisoner for his, and he said, he would see Kendrick d-d first; the deceased said, there need not be any words about the money, it was my fault he came into company, and sooner than there shall be any words about a penny, let me go out and make water, and when I come in I will pay the money; upon that the deceased was going out to make water, and going by the prisoner, there was a sword lying upon the settle, he took it up and put it into him, about two inches from his navel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him draw his sword? - A. No; but I saw him draw the sword from him; upon that the deceased said, oh Lord God, Kendrick, I cannot live; he died in about ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour.</p>

             sworn. - I am a licensed hawker; what I saw was after the man was stabbed: I saw nothing going forward, but I sat peaceable on my chair; after he was stabbed, Kendrick and Rudkin were pitying of him; Kendrick took the sword from the prisoner, and broke it; then he got the deceased upon his thigh; I thought it possible the prisoner might make his escape; I stood between him and the door, and struck him; then the landlord was called, and he went for a surgeon, and Kendrick and I kept walking backwards and forwards that he should not make his escape, till he was secured.</p>

               <p>Q. How long had you been in the house? - A. I had been there I suppose from about dark; but I was not in the room where they were I suppose not a quarter of an hour before it happened; I had been sitting in the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any quarrel, or any blows struck between them? - A. I did not see any blows at all; there was something like a dispute about a penny. but I did not know then what it was about, it was so trifling it did not take any attention.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Did the prisoner at the bar walk about the room, or continue sitting in the box, after the blow was given? - A. He sat in the box, and he drew towards the end of the box.</p>
               <p>Q. It would have been in vain for him to have tried to make his escape, you would not have let him? - A. No; but he shifted to the end of the seat, and how soon could he have got up and ran away, if I had not prevented him.</p>
               <p>Q. There were no blows given to the prisoner at the bar? - A. I struck him after the murder was done.</p>
               <p>Q. For what did you strike him? - A. Because he was shifting, I thought, to get away.</p>

Kendrick, was then present in the tap-room; the landlord tapped Rudkin on the shoulder, and took him out to speak to him, and I did not see him after; I had no conversation with Kendrick.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Baker's-rents, Bethnal-green. On the 23rd of May, between twelve and one o'clock in the daytime I was over at the ale-house, taking a glass of ale with my husband—somebody came over and said, somebody was doing something to my child—I went out and found the prisoner at the top of the court—I said to him, "You old villain, You rascal, what are You going to do to my child"—I laid hold of him on each side of his collar—he used a bad expression, and said, "I'll let you know," and put something across my face, which cut it where it is now cut—I did not see what he did it with—he was given into custody—I do not know who by—I was taken over to a surgeon.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Shoreditch. On the 23rd of May, I was in the public-house, having half-a-pint of ale with Mrs. Harris—somebody came and told her that her children were going to be killed—she went out—I did not go out at that time—a few minutes elapsed—I saw a great many per<lb></lb>sons, and went out—the prosecutrix then had hold of the prisoner by the collar of his coat, and said, "You old villain, what are You going to do with my children?"—he used a very bad expression—she screamed out, and fell back in my arms—the blood gushed out all over me—what it was done with I do not know—I dragged her over to the doctor's facing.</p>

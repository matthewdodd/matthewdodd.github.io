               <p>Mr. Akerman. My Lord, here is a letter and a receipt on a stamp, for the horse; the prisoner begged I would give it into Court.</p>
               <p>(Handed up to the Court.)</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Is this your letter? - I have not seen it since I came here.</p>
               <p>Did not you write this letter to this man, telling him, if he could raise the money to save your recognizance, you would not appear against him? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>You wrote something very much like it.</p>
               <p>(Reads the letter.)</p>
               <p>"I received a line from your hands,</p>
               <p>"signifying your wish that I should not</p>
               <p>"appear against you, but as I am bound</p>
               <p>"in a bond of forty pounds, I must, without</p>
               <p>"you have friends that will discharge</p>
               <p>"my recognizance, and make up my loss;</p>


               <p>"I have not the least objection to hold</p>
               <p>"the hand of mercy out to save the life</p>
               <p>"of any man; though I cannot think</p>
               <p>"you innocent; and it is very hard that</p>
               <p>"men should be rifled of their property."</p>
               <p>Court. It was not a very wise thing in you to write such a letter, nor an honest thing, it was selling mercy for forty or fifty pounds, not recommending it; does it become a man do you think that means to protect his property, and that of other people's by prosecuting, to behave in such a manner? you have acted very ill, and very foolish indeed; let this letter be put into the Recorder's hands.</p>

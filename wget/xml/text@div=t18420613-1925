                  </hi>. I am coachman to William Ralph Cartwright; his stable is at No. 17, North-road, near Hereford-street, Park-lane—the prisoner Samuel Price has been helping me for three seasons in the stable, and I have seen the other prisoner who called to see him—I saw the police<lb></lb>man have some oats and beans at Marlborough-street, and they are now here—I had some oats and beans at my master's stable on the 6th of June, but I cannot say I should know them again—I cannot say whether they were of the sort of those now produced, nor whether these came out of my stable—I had oats in the bin in the stable, but I should not like to say they were of this sort, because there are two or three more who have the same provision—I cannot say whether these are anything like them or not, nor whether these are the same sort of oats or not—there were some oats in the bin in the stable, that we used to feed the horses, but I cannot say that I missed any—we had a few beans up in the loft over the stable—they were split beans—I cannot say whether they were the same sort as those that are here—mine were bruised, and these are braised, but I cannot say whether they are the same sort—I have been with Mr. Cartwright turned of sixteen years, and have been in the habit of feeding my horses with oats and beans all that time—I can tell one sort from another, but there are two or three about me that use the same—I look at the oats and beans that come in, and feed the horses when I am at home—I have no opinion at all as to whose property this is—I never said I had—I was examined at Marlborough-street—I did not say that I believed this to be my master's property—what I said was taken down in writing, and read over to me—this is my signature to this depo<lb></lb>sition.</p>

            . I am shopman to my mother, who lives at Holborn-bars, her name is Sarah Cooke, her house is in the county of Middlesex. I have known the prisoner fourteen years, and was a pupil of his at Mr. Kirkman's, at Islington - he was a <rs id="t18280911-182-deflabel929" type="occupation">tutor</rs>

God! I am dead man - if I had a hundred necks, I must lose them all;" he afterwards added "Let me go to Newgate quietly - don't put me into irons;" he then held up his hands, and said "Melton, Melton has ruined me! he has robbed me of upwards of 7,000l. in two years;" he might have said more, but I do not recollect it; we did not allow him to go on board, but we secured him; I had this £159 bill with me, and produced it to him; I said "Mr. Fenn, how is that you have been so inhuman as to use me so - I hope this acceptance is a good acceptance;" he looked at it, and observed "James Lucett I have known for years, you may rely on it as a very good acceptance - it is as good as a Bank note;" Mr. Vincent was by at the time, and he asked him the residence of the acceptor - he said "he lives at No. 1, South-parade, Queen's Elms, Old Brompton," which Mr. Vincent wrote on the back of the bill - (here it is;) nothing more was said about it, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Is not the Citybar twenty yards beyond your mother's house? A. No, it is opposite - the house is in the county; I have lived there fifteen years, and my mother has been carrying on business for thirty-five years; I have no interest in the business - I merely receive a salary; I am her representative in the business; I have known the prisoner a great length of time - I have not had many transactions with him; I have discounted many bills for him, which he took up, but they were forgeries; he never brought people to me to discount on my solicitation - this letter is my hand-writing; (read.)</p>
               <p>"Dear Sir - After no little persuasion, I have got the bill, and send it inclosed; likewise the silk handkerchiefs; if you will have a 200l. at Mr. Melton's for it to night, you will oblige me, and if you will look me out a nice little bill for 50l. at two months, this will save me half a crown; if you will also get another 100l. of Melton, for the one I sent back, it will rub all off."</p>
               <p>Witness. The fact was, I had some bills in my hands which Fenn gave me, and represented them as very good bills, but which I was dissatisfied with, and I wanted to have an acceptance of Melton for them; upon my oath, I did not discount these bills for myself, but for my mother - I had the use of her money, which he knew; they were never discounted on my own account; I had not the means when I discounted the bill in question I gave him the difference, deducting the discount; to the best of my knowledge I gave him the money for it at five per cent., but then he gave me another bill in payment for articles purchased - I sometimes gave him money, and sometimes a cheque; we had an account at a banker, in my name, by the advice of all parties; I solemnly state I have no share in the business - I never discounted at more than 5 per cent.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When was it you found the prisoner at Calais? A. The latter end of March; we brought him to England, and he was taken to a lock-up house in Chancery-lane; he has been in custody ever since.</p>

            . I am an attorney. I was employed by Mrs. Cook, and went to France with the last witness; we went to Paris for Peter Fenn, but did not find him there - we re-traced our steps to Calais, and found him in company with a man whose name I have learned is Hanbury, at Lawson's, the Crown hotel - we had been up six nights, and declined to go any further, or to let him go; Hanbury remained but a short time with us - they had got their trunks outside the house, and were going to the packet, which was to sail in about five minutes - they had had their breakfast; I told Mr. Lawson that Fenn's trunks must go in again, and we went up stairs, where the prisoner gave Hanbury a 5l. note: Hanbury left the hotel in about three minutes; when I first saw the prisoner, he appeared frantic - paralyzed, and I made a memorandum of what he said at the time; Mr. Cook was there the whole day, but I went to take a walk, as I had got Fenns passport, and I knew he could not leave; what the prisoner said was (reads) "Melton is my ruin - he has obtained 7,000l. of me in the last two years; I will go quietly to Newgate, only don't put me in irons - I will plead guilty, I shall then have about six weeks after I am condemned; I will be seen by no one - I will do as Fauntleroy did, and it will be over in a moment; I was coming to England to deliver myself up to justice;" I produced this bill to him, and asked him what it was - he said it was good, and I marked it "good" in pencil; I told him I doubted its being good, as it appeared to be all in one hand-writing; he said No, it was drawn upon his friend James Lucett, whom he said he had known for twenty years, (I think.) or a great many years, and it was as good as gold - I told him that Old Brompton was a very large place, and to give me the address of James Lucett - he gave it me, and I wrote it on the back of the bill, in his presence, No. 1, South-parade, Queen's Elms, Old Brompton - I came to England with him and Mr. Cook; I have since seen Mr. Lucett.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Are you the person who was examined yesterday. A. Yes: when he came to London he had not an opportunity of escaping. I gave him leave to go to the Hummums, but my brother watched him there - I did not tell him my brother was watching him; he could have attempted to escape, but he did not to my knowledge.</p>

            . I am not acquainted with the prisoner - this acceptance is not my hand-writing; I did reside at the place stated at the back of the bill. but I do not reside there now, nor did I on the 14th of December, 1827.(Bill read, see Indictment.)</p>
               <p>COURT to JOHN COOK. Q. Did your mother know of your discounting this bill? A. Yes; there was an account opened at the bankers' in my name, at the request of my mother, on account of her age, and at the request of our friends also - Fenn knew I acted for her.</p>
               <p>The prisoner here read the same Defence as on his former trial,(see page 710) and with reference to the case in question, stated that he had himself frequently discounted bills for Mr. Lucett, which were payable in Parliament-street; he added the agent from whom I received them brought me a blank acceptance of Lucett's, wishing me to draw it rather than him - having known Lucett for several years, I yielded, and became the drawer, thinking it was Mr. Lucett's acceptance. Vincent has said to day he sent his brother to watch me closely while I was at the Hummums; he can only have said that from hearing my defence yesterday - I still repeat that I was at liberty; the coachman who drove me from where they left me, to the Hummums, asked me if he had not better drive me at once to my private dwelling, or to any other place in the neighbourhood, as I told him I did not like to sleep at such a place as the Hummums; when I once asked Cook why the business was conducted in his mother's name, why her name did not appear in the bills as well as his own, he replied, "The business is my mother's, and should any of these bills prove bad, or he unpaid, if I cannot take them up, I can soon get white-washed in the Bench, and the business be my mother's still."</p>

               <p>Q. What day was the 6th. - A. Last Thursday, he was to go and live with Lord Burleigh, as groom, I gave him a character last Sunday week.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a good character with him. - A. Yes, very good. He took his box away early on Wednesday morning last, before I was up, when he returned I asked him where he had been, he said, he had been taking his box away. I had given him orders the night before to go to the carpenter, I told him, it was very improper going upon his own business: it past off till the next morning. On the Thursday morning, one of my shopmen informed me, that, he had lost shirts and neckcloths out of his bed-room, dirty linnen. I called up the prisoner some time after, and asked him about it, I told him I must have it cleared up before he went. I had given him a good character, and I wished to know the rights of it. I desired him to go with the shopman, to shew him the box that he had taken away. They went out, and in a short time, they both returned. The box was to be in the coachman's apartment, he was to live in the coachman's apartment, over the stables, when he returned he said, the coachman and his wife were out of town. I requested one of the shopmen to go to his Lordship's taylor, where the prisoner's clothes were making, to enquire if the family were out of town, the prisoner said he would go with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181012050047"></xptr>him I had some suspicion that he would get away from him. I immediately desired another shopman to follow him, and in a short time after they both brought him back again. He attempted to make his escape from them. I sent for a constable; he took him to Marybone watch-house. From there he was taken to Marlborough-street Office. I went there, and swore to the property, a piece of Irish of twenty-six yards, and about five yards of plain British muslin.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you missed out of your shop any thing of that sort. - A. No, it is impossible from our large concern to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he been your porter. - A. About five months.</p>

            . Q. You are shopman to Mr. Evans and Savage, are not you. - A. I am. On Tuesday evening last I missed part of my linen. I suspected the prisoner from his being the only man that had access to my room, except the other young men. I mentioned it to Mr. Evans. I went to Lord Burleigh's stables, where he took me to a wrong door. He knocked at the wrong door, and could receive no answer. He said, the coachman had left town on Tuesday morning. This was on the Thursday morning the prisoner and me returned to Mr. Evans. I went to enquire at the taylor's. Before I got there, the prisoner and another young man was out, and I met them at the taylor's in Maddox street. The prisoner went from there into Bond-street, on business for himself. The prisoner then said he would give us a chance: he ran down Grosvenor-street. We ran after him, caught him, and took him into a public-house. After some time he promised to walk quietly home, if we would let him go. The moment he got out of the door he ran from home. We could not catch him. In Berkley-square he was catched by a man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call out after him. - A. I did, and he was taken by a man in Berkley-square; the man let him go on our coming up. We told the man we suspected him of having stolen goods. The same man followed him again, and found him concealed in a stable. I was present at the time. I followed the man in, and found the prisoner secreted under the manger in the stable. The man took him out of where he was, and gave him into our custody. We took him to Mr. Evans's house. We went for a constable, who took him to the watch-house. We took the constable up to Lord Burleigh's stable. Me, Bevan, and Pearson, the constable, went to the apartment occupied by the coachman, and found the box of the prisoner, which he had taken away. I knew the box, I had seen it on the morning before on the counter in the shop. I asked him if it was his box? he answered,</p>
               <p>"Yes." We brought the box to the watch-house where the prisoner was. It was opened in the prisoner's presence. He gave the constable the key. We found a piece of Irish linen and a quantity of British muslin, and two half handkerchiefs belonging to

            . Q. You were in company with the last witness, when you went after the prisoner. - A. I was; I went with the prisoner the second time, when he was pursued up Grosvenor-street; he was pursued and taken. The stranger ran after him again.</p>
               <p>Q. And you followed after the stranger. - A. I did. The prisoner took to a stable. The prisoner was taken and brought to our house. What Winter has stated is correct and true I went with Winter for the box. I knew it was the prisoner's box. I had seen it a few days before. I saw the box opened. The prisoner gave

               <p>Q. You was sent for to take up the prisoner, was not you. - A. Yes; I apprehended him on Thursday last, the 6th. I found the box in the apartment near the stable. I brought the box to the watch-house where the prisoner was. I asked the prisoner for the key, he gave it me. I opened the box with the key. I found in it this Irish linen, and the British muslin. opened it before the prisoner's face.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Evans by. - A. No, only me, the two shopmen, and the prisoner. I have had the things ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. to Winter. Have you seen the Irish linen, and the British muslin, in Mr. Evans's shop. - A. I certainly have - they have his private mark. I cannot state what particular time.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This Irish linen, it is my property, and marked in my own hand writing. It is the joint property of me and Mr. Savage. The British muslin has my own mark, likewise the Irish linen. I have valued at 4 l. it is a fine one. I think it is a low value, indeed - the value of the British muslin is fifteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. You say you know these are your goods because they are marked with your writing. - A. They are the goods of myself and partner.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you rub that mark out when you sell them. - A No.</p>
               <p>Q. It is possible that you may have sold it. - A. It is possible. This was taken out of the prisoner's box. We cannot take out that mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does Mr. Savage live. - A. He resides in Holley-street. Me and my family sleep at where my business is carried on, in Oxford-street.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

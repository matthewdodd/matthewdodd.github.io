Long came and gave me infor<lb></lb>mation on the 17th of June, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning—I went to his house—the prisoner afterwards came to the door, and I took him into custody, and took a basket out of the shop with tools in it—I had the basket in my hand when I took the prisoner—he said he would carry the basket, it being his own property, and said he had bought them at a sale.</p>

"About six o'clock, the morning I was taken, I left my lodgings, and went to a public-house to have a dram; while there, I saw a person whom I had been in company with the evening be<lb></lb>fore —another person came in who had been with us the previous evening—this third person asked if I had any money, adding, that he had none. I said I had not much. I knew he was the same trade as myself, a car<lb></lb>penter—he said he must have some money; and if he could not get it in any other way, he must sell some of his tools—he went away, and re<lb></lb>turned almost immediately with the basket of tools, and asked if I knew where he could sell them. I said I knew Long, who had bought some<lb></lb>thing of the sort before, and would show him where Long lived, or, if he wished, I would take them myself—he said, "If you will give me a crown for them, you can make the best bargain you can with Long." I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., being all I had. I went to Long, and was given into custody for the offence I was charged with yesterday. The prosecutor lost a pic<lb></lb>ture, and my wife has received an anonymous letter, stating that I am not the person who committed the robbery, that he himself committed it, and sold me the tools—it states where he sold the picture, which I think ought to be traced."</p>

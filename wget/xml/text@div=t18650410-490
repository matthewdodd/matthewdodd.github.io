                  </hi>. I am a widow, living at No. 20, Vine-terrace, Lam<lb></lb>beth—on Saturday night, 1st April, about half-past 9, I was in the Waterloo-road with a basket full of potatoes, and some grocery, on my arm—the prisoner came to my side, and made an attempt to snatch a purse out of my left hand which was underneath the basket—he gave a second pull, and I saw his face distinctly—there was no lamp-post there; there was light enough to enable me to see his features—he then ran up Granville-street—there was a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my purse—he took the purse and the money—I took my things home, and then went down Tower-street, and gave information to the police—I described the man—I saw him again on Monday morning, at Tower-street station, amongst several more, and I picked him out—I said, "I feel quite sure he is the man, if there were 100 people there"—I feel quite sure of him now.</p>

I was present when the prose<lb></lb>cutrix came to the station—I saw her pick out the prisoner from amongst nine or ten others—she pointed him out herself—the prisoner was the last—they were all in a row—when she came to him she said, "I believe he is the man"—I said, "You must not think; do you feel sure, "and she said, "I do, and if you were to place a thousand more before me, I could not see one like him"—I have known the prisoner a long time in the neighbourhood—he lives about a quarter of a mile from the station—I have been on the boat some time.</p>

Q.</hi> He was not apprehended on this charge at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—there is a man very similar to him; a companion of his, Mears, who was in the dock just now—from the description we received we thought it was Mears—Donovan, Mears, and Stanton were apprehended on another charge—the Grand Jury have thrown out the bill against Stanton in the other case—all three men were at the station when the prosecutrix came, and some others; some older and one or two younger—there were three children, about twelve years of age, but not near them—the prosecutrix picked out Stanton from about ten others—I believe there were one or two younger than the prisoner there; they were twelve or fourteen years old.</p>

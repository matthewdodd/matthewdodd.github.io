                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Gray, a clerk in an attorney's office. On Friday night, the 31st of May, about eleven o'clock, I was at a place in Mile-end, between Jubilee-place and Henry-street—I was alone—I had been into Jubilee-place—I had not seen any person there then, but on my return I distinctly heard the cries of an infant; and on turning round the corner into Henry-street I saw something lying on the pavement—I went and looked at it, and an infant stretched its foot from under the rags in which it was enveloped—I told a young man who was passing to call the police, and three policemen came—I took the child home to my place, with two policemen, and warmed it by the fire—it was a male child—the policemen said I must go to the station with them, which I did—it was then near one o'clock—we took it to Mile-end workhouse, but could not make any one hear, and I took it home to sleep with me that night—I took the same rags that I found—they were, an old calico shirt, a body-flannel or baby's blanket, a roller, about a yard of calico, a flannel belly-band, an old calico bed-gown, and it was covered over with an old black merino rag—it was very meanly dressed indeed—sergeant Harrison called between seven and eight in the morning, and took it to the station just as I found it—it was a particularly fine healthy child—I saw nothing particu<lb></lb>lar about it, no injury or any deformity or mark—I should expect it had not been placed on the spot five minutes—it was no doubt put there for the ex<lb></lb>press press purpose of being found by some one—I afterwards went before the Jus<lb></lb>tice, and gave my deposition.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Sebright-street, Bethnal-green-road; my hus<lb></lb>band band is a weaver. I first became acquainted with the prisoners by their com<lb></lb>ing to lodge with me—Lewis came last Feb. twelve months, and took a lodging—I asked whether he had got a wife—at first he did not tell me exactly, but afterwards he told me he had, but said she was going to a situation—he afterwards brought Hayman to the house, and they lived there together—while they were there, on the 7th of April last (Easter Sunday) she was deli<lb></lb>vered of a male child—it had a prominent navel—Mrs. Ridley, of Brick-lane, attended as midwife—I saw that child often—I washed it and took care of it for several days, and got so acquainted with it as to be sure to know it again when I saw it—I saw the clothing it had at our house—I afterwards saw that clothing in the hands of the police, with the same child, at Worship-street—the child was about nine weeks old when the prisoners left me on the 31st of May—they gave me about two days' warning—Lewis left in the morning, and took away the things—Hayman remained till about dusk, then she left, and took the child with her—Lewis returned about ten that evening, and told my husband, in my hearing, that he had got her in the mind to go to Bristol—about</p>

               <p>a fortnight afterwards he called at our house again—I asked how the baby was—he said it had been very bad in the bowels—about a fortnight after that I saw him at the shop where he works, in Hare-street, Bethnal-green—I asked him how the baby was—he said it had been very bad in the bowels, but was better—I saw no more of him till he was in custody—the child and things produced at Worship-street were the child and things I had known before—when Lewis took the lodging he told me he came from Bristol, and his wife also—he told me nothing of their previous life—I saw Hayman about three weeks before she was taken into custody, and asked her how the baby was—she told me it was quite well, that his sister had got it—I saw her about a week after that, and asked her again after the baby—she said his sister had got it.</p>

While her husband was gone for the doctor, she repeated these words to me several times, that she was murdered; I asked her who by, and how it happened; she told me she had lodged with Mrs. Fox; that she went to fetch away the remains of her goods on Thursday; that she owed her 4 s. or 5 s. for rent, and when she went for her goods the door was broke open and she went into the room to fetch her things; that

               <p>Q. Did you examine to see if there was any bruises on her back while she was alive?</p>
               <p>Hookham. Yes, they were black on the small of her back, and some bruises on her ribs on one side; I am not positive which side. She desired I would see justice done, to see her body cut open, which I did on Wednesday; I assisted in doing it; there was a boy, a fine one if it had been alive; it was dead; it appeared to be in the last month; she might have gone a fortnight or three weeks if she had gone her time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might it have been dead?</p>
               <p>Hookham. The child was black round the belly and navel, and as it lay on the right side, the left shoulder was cracked as it lay uppermost.</p>
               <p>Q. By the appearance of the child how long might it have been dead?</p>
               <p>Hookham. It might have been dead ten or twelve days before, being putrified; I cannot be positive to a few days how long it might have been dead.</p>
               <p>Q. This dead child would have killed the woman then if there had not been bruises?</p>
               <p>Hookham. No, no, a great many women live after a dead child.</p>

               <p>Hookham. She said she was sure she should die; I felt her pulse and it beat very high; I thought she had a fever coming.</p>
               <p>Q. She did not disclose on Sunday the scuffle between her and Fox?</p>

               <p>Dr. Cooper. I am a man-midwife: I was sent for on the Monday to Mrs. Brown; I went there about eleven in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. In what condition did you find her?</p>
               <p>Cooper. She was dying.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine her then to see if there was any bruises?</p>

               <p>Q. Is he here?</p>
               <p>Cooper. I believe he is in the country.</p>
               <p>Q. What observations did you make upon the body?</p>
               <p>Cooper. Outwardly there was blackness upon different parts of the body about the loins and hips.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it very black?</p>
               <p>Cooper. Very black.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the skin broke at all?</p>
               <p>Cooper. Not at all that I perceived: I examined carefully all the internal parts of the abdomen, and especially those that corresponded with the external injuries, but they seemed to be quite in a found state excepting the child.</p>
               <p>Q. Then according to appearance the contusions did not penetrate farther than the external superficies?</p>
               <p>Cooper. No, they were not farther than the external supersicies muscular substance; the child was quite in a putrid state.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you apprehend the putrid state of the child was occasioned by these blows?</p>
               <p>Cooper. I apprehend the child had been dead for at least three weeks, consequently before the fray.</p>
               <p>Q. By your observations do you think these external bruises could be the occasion of the woman's death?</p>
               <p>Cooper. By no means.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not think those marks could be the occasion of her death?</p>
               <p>Cooper. No.</p>

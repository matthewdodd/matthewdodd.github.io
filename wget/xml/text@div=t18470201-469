                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable P</hi> 7.) On the 9th of Jan. I received the prisoner into custody at the Walworth station—he had a hat on which was too large for him—I told him so—I took it off, and saw the name of "Blun<lb></lb>dell, maker," in it—I asked him where he got the hat from—said he bought it at a Jew's second-hand place—I asked him where—he did not tell me—I asked him where the Jew lived—he said, "I don't know; I met him on London-bridge: he had three or four hats with him, and asked me to buy one, and I bought that one"—I asked him how long since—he said, "Four months"—I found half a handkerchief, or shawl, in his pocket—I asked him where he got it—he said, "Do you think me a thief? "—I said, "If I must answer the question, I do "—he at last told me his mother bought it for him. and that he had had it twelve months or more—I took the hat and half hand<lb></lb>kerchief to No. 18, Champion-row, Gove-lane, Camberwell, the same night—I saw Hannah Burnett there, who at once identified the hat, and brought me down another half shawl, which tallied with the one I found on him, in every particular—I found an old hat there, which fits the prisoner—I, tried it on his head.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Elizabeth Watson, of Champion-row, Grove-end-road, Camberwell; it is her dwelling-house. On the 20th of Nov., about nine o'clock in the evening, I went out to get some beer for supper; it may have been five minutes after nine when I left the house—I am quite sure I closed the door after me, I locked it, and took the key with me—there is a grass plot before the house, and a gate—I fastened the gate also—I was gone about a quarter of an hour—when I came back I saw the prisoner come down the steps of house—he passed me, going out at the gate—I saw some coats on his arm—I asked him if he had seen anybody—he made no answer, but went away—I looked through the door, which has a glass to it, and saw that the coats were gone—I am certain they were there when I went away—they are the property of of Captain James Watkins—I afterwards missed a hat which had hung up in the hall, and the gloves were in the coat pocket—the half handkerchief, or shawl, was missing—that is the property of Captain Watkins—I pursued the man—he had not gone many yards—I called, "Stop thief!"—he ran—I followed him as far as the public-house, about twenty yards—I spoke to a policeman, and while doing so the prisoner turned round a corner, and got away—I believe the prisoner to be the man, but should not like to swear to him—I am certain this is captain Watkins's hat—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—this shawl was in the coat pocket—I have the other half here, which was in a drawer in the captain's bed-room.</p>

Q.</hi> Are there many lamps in the row? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There are two not far from each other—I had a good view of the prisoner's walk when he passed me—I inclined to think he is the person from his walk—I have always said the public-house was twenty yards from the house—I never de<lb></lb>scribed it as two hundred yards—I was not asked the question at all—I was told the distance—I may be wrong—I am in the habit of locking the door</p>

               <p>when I go out—there is no other servant—I found the door closed when I returned, but not locked—it not broken at all—I found the garden gate locked when I returned—there was one coat in the hall which was not taken, but that was of no value—I am positive this is the hat, and the other hat was left behind—Captain Watkins is not here; he is an invalid—I had seen the shawl in his coat pocket in the morning—I did not go to the pocket, but the handkerchief was always put there—the captain used to go out for an hour in the morning—I believe he had been out that day—I am positive the handkerchief was there, as it was never put anywhere else—I did not see it in the pocket in the morning, but I felt it outside.</p>

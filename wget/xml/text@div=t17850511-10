               <p>I am clerk to Mr. Partis, solicitor to the Post-office; this is a copy of the record of the prisoner's conviction, in the year 1782, which I examined with the original record, and it is a true copy; this is Mr. Shelton's hand-writing.</p>

               <p>- LEE sworn.</p>
               <p>I remember the prisoner; I lived ten years with Mr. Akerman; he was tried for robbing the mail upon Finchley Common; he was respited for the humanity he shewed the boy; he received sentence in September, 1782, of transportation for seven years.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was you present when I was convicted for this? - No, I was not, but I know he was convicted, because I frequently locked him in the cells; he was delivered on board the Censor bulk on the 11th of January, 1783; I went down with him.</p>
               <p>Court. It must be proved that the prisoner at the bar was the man that was convicted of this: how many more received the same sentence? - A great many more.</p>
               <p>How came you to recollect that? - It was long vacation, and it is the usual time they receive them.</p>

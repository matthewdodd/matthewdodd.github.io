I missed nine rabbit skins I lost twenty-four dozen in all. On the 17th I called at Mr. Routh's, and found the prisoner offering skins for sale, nine of which I can swear to; he said he had bought them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182404070062"></xptr>of a man, but did not mention his name; he afterward said they were mine, and offered me a handkerchief to take them back in, and afterward said again, that he had bought them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did not he summons you for his wages - A. Never, nor did he threaten to summons me. I thought that I owed him something for overwork, and told him to call on Monday for it; he said that he never got his money, which is false; he said if I did not pay him on Monday he should take means to get it.</p>

               <p>"Here Mr. Platford, I will leave them, and call by-and-by," and wanted to go, but was detained.</p>

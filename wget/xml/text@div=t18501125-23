On 2nd Nov., I saw both the prisoners there, about twenty-five minutes past five in the afternoon—they came together—I am sure they are the persons—I turned on the gas and viewed their features—they went out together—I had beard about this shilling, and I followed them—they went on together to the White Horse, in Fann-street—Brown waited outside, and Burton went in—I spoke to a policeman—I then saw the policeman in the White Hart—the policeman laid hold of Brown—I said, "I want you for passing a bad shilling in Carthusian-street"—they both said they had not been there—I got a shilling from Mrs. Brodie and gave it to the policeman.</p>

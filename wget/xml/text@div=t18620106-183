               <p>about half-past 12, the prisoner came up to me in King-street, Hammer<lb></lb>smith, and inquired the way to Brook-green station—I asked her what she wanted at the station—she replied, "I want to give myself up"—I said, "What for?"—she said, "For murdering one of my children"—I said, "Where and when did you do it?"—she said, "At 9, Rebecca-court, Wells-street, Oxford-street, about 6 o'clock this evening"—I asked her how she did it—she said, "By tying a piece of braid round its neck tight"—I said, "What made you do it?"—she said, "For want; I could not see it want for bread any longer"—I then said, "You have told a dreadful story against yourself, is there any truth in it?"—she said, "Yes; it is too true"—I asked whether it was a boy or a girl—she said it was a little boy aged ten months—I asked the name, and she said, "Henry Hamilton"—I then took her to Brook-green station—I asked her whether she had left anyone with it, or not; and she said she had left a little girl about four years old—she told me if I went there I should find it as she stated—as she went on stating this I cautioned her, but she still persisted in saying it was true, re<lb></lb>peatedly—I afterwards went to No. 9, Rebecca-court, Wells-street, to a front kitchen there—it was a poor, miserable place; the worst place I was ever in, I think, for a dwelling; I mean in appearance altogether—I found an old flock bed there—there were two children, a boy and a girl—they appeared to me to be about the respective ages the prisoner had mentioned—the elder child was alive; seeing a light it rose up in the bed—it was paralysed on one side—the other little child was lying on the farther side of the bed, and the little girl at its back—it was a wretched flock-bed; this piece of braid (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was tied twice round the child's neck tight, and tied in a fast knot under the ear—it is wide black braid—I examined it only so far as to look at that—I sent for a surgeon immediately, and took both the children to the workhouse—I looked about the room; there was not a bit of any<lb></lb>thing in the shape of food, except it was a dust of salt—it exhibited every sign of great want, in every way—the whole of the bed-clothing there was to the bed was an old, dirty, calico sheet, which I rolled the corpse up in—as we were going from Hammersmith station to Clark's-buildings, the prisoner said to me, "Is the little girl alive?"—she was not with me when I went to the place—I saw her again when I went back to Hammersmith, to take her to the place where the offence had been committed—I took the children to the workhouse, before I went back to Hammersmith—I had no trouble at all in finding her again—when she asked if the girl was alive, I said, "It is"—she said, "I could not hurt it," or, "I did not hurt it," I am not sure which, "as it was paralysed"—she asked me whether her husband knew it, and what time he came home—I told her, "At quarter to 4 o'clock on Sunday morning"—at Clark's-buildings both me and the ser<lb></lb>geant who took the charge, cautioned her again—the still persisted in saying it was true—I found it all true, literally as she had stated—she stated at the station she was sorry it was too true.</p>

               <p>—the prisoner is my daughter-in-law, my son's wife—she had two children, one a little girl who was paralysed, and the little boy who is dead—he was about eleven months old—his name was Henry Hamilton—the prisoner's husband is a tailor by trade—he has been very badly off as regards work; for a long time he could get no work—they have been badly off for this last two years, I may say, and it was brought on principally through the eldest daughter's affliction and illness; it was in and out of fits, sometimes a whole week together, lying in the bed, and that brought on the paralysis, and that brought them both into a bad state of health and into poverty—his earnings were nothing some weeks—the prisoner's manner was at all times very silent, reserved, quiet, and inoffensive—latterly she seemed more melan<lb></lb>choly and more dejected a great deal—there was a strangeness in her manner, a very great change—she would come into the place and just speak and run out again, and seemed always nervous; you could never get any<lb></lb>thing but "Yes," or "No" from her—she went out one afternoon and absented herself all night—she went out with my daughter, her husband's sister, and she came home after having what she required there, put the child to bed that was paralysed, which she would never leave at another time for a moment, and there she left it, and travelled from Stacey-street all the way to Sydenham; she arrived at her uncle's at 7 in the morning, having travelled all night, and her husband never saw her till 12 the next night; and through no words, or quarrelling, with the husband—she arrived, with the youngest child, at her uncle's at 7 in the morning, and came back the next night at 12—she had never done that before, but she has done it since—she never left her husband for an hour, without he knew where she was gone—she gave as a reason for going that she wanted to see her uncle—she has got a deal worse since she has been in this distress and terrible—her husband is a decent, quiet man, always ready to work when he can get it—I know, of my own knowledge, that they have been in a troubled state, as regards their lodgings and want of food, for some time past.</p>

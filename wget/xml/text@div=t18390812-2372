                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of Messrs. Guy, Champion, and others, vinegar merchants, in the City-road. Caveley had been in our employ for five or six months—we keep a number of horses, and made a verbal contract with the prisoner Larman to supply us with ten bundles of tares every day, weighing 60lbs. per bundle—he was to be paid 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per bundle—I fancied that the quantity of tares delivered was less than it ought to be, and on the 31st of July I secreted myself in the loft with Gay, one of my foremen—I saw Larman come and deliver the tares—he only delivered eight bundles—Caveley was there, and took them in of him—he put some of them on the weighing machine, but it did not go down—(it was his duty to weigh them all)—when they were delivered the two prisoners went away together—after they were gone I and my foreman weighed the tares, and, instead of 600lbs. which they ought to have weighed, they only weighed 302lbs.—next morning I and my foreman secreted ourselves again—Larman came, and delivered eight bundles instead of ten, as he had done on the former morn<lb></lb>ing—when the prisoners were gone I had the tares weighed, and they weighed 3321bs.—next morning I was not there; but on the morning after, which was Saturday, the 3rd of August, I was again concealed there—I had then spoken to two police-officers—there ought to have been twenty bundles delivered that day, weighing 1200lbs.—when the prisoners were gone I saw them weighed again, and there were only 624lbs.—Caveley had been present each morning, and had put some of the bundles on the ma<lb></lb>chine—he knew what they should weigh—he did not make any remark that they were not right—on that Saturday morning I had directed Tennant to mark some money—I was present when the officer brought the prisoners back to the yard.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Champion and Co. On the 31st of July I and Mr. Wright concealed ourselves in the loft—I knew the quantity of tares that were to be delivered—I cannot say that Caveley was aware of the quantity—I heard Larman bring the cart, and saw eight bundles of tares come in—Caveley put on the weighing machine about four bundles, they were not weighed, but merely put on, and then taken off, opened, and thrown about the floor—he could see whether they were weight—it was a machine used for weighing grain or flour—the weights are always on the machine—I had orders for supplying the</p>

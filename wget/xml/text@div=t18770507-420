                  </hi>. I am a private in the 1st Batallion of Scots Guards—on Sunday morning, 22nd April, I met the prisoner and asked her to go for a drive with me in a cab—I then had a sovereign, a half—sovereign, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver in a purse in my tunic—we drove for a quarter of an hour, and I then stopped the cab at a coffee—stall near the Marble Arch—the prisoner sat in the cab while I went to the coffee—stall, and when I took out my purse there was no money in it—I turned back to the cab and the prisoner was gone—I saw her going down Oxford Street—the cabman drove me after her, and I came upon her sitting in a jeweller's shop—door—I asked her why she did not stay and have the coffee I was going to give her, and she used a filty expression—I gave her in charge, and—heard the chink of money—I told the policeman to take care that she did not make away with it, and he found 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in her hand—she said "Take this 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and let me clear."</p>

The prosecutor gave the prisoner into my custody for taking 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from his pocket in a cab—she attempted to throw away 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but I caught her hand and took it from her—she was searched by the female searcher and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. found on her.</p>

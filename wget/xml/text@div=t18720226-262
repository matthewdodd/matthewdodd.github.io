                  </hi>. I am an oilman, and live at 39, Princes Street, Portland Market, Marylebone—on Tuesday evening, 30th Januarys I went into a public-house—I don't know the sign, being a stranger there—Mr. Shirley was with me—seven men came into the public-house—the prisoners are five, of those men—the one that tried to trip me up is not there-wit was between 4 and 5 o'clock when we went into the house, and we stayed there about a couple of hours, having glasses of ale and smoking—I had been down to the Fireaway Read about some property—Rock came in first, and said he was starving, and Shirley gave him some bread and cheese, and asked me to pay for it—I pulled out some gold and silver—I had 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. when I went from home—I handed Mr. Shirley a shilling to pay for the bread and cheese—I afterwards treated all the seven men to bread and cheese and ale—we left the public-about 6 o'clock, or a little after, and went to the next one, and the men followed us—all seven of them came in—we stayed there about three-quarter of an hour—they had some ale, and I paid for it we came out of the second public-house about 7 o'clock—we got a good distance down the Portobello Road, and Sullivan, Cockran, and Rook <hi rend="italic">pinned</hi> me, and Brittain took nay money out of my pocket—Whalin was with them, but I can't say that he had hold of me—one or two of them had hold of Mr. Shirley—I can't swear who they were, because he was a little distance from me—I caught hold of one of the men, but he is not here to-day—they tried to trip me up, but I did not go down—they all ran away after that—I am posi<lb></lb>tive that the prisoners are five of the men—I identified them at different times, from among a number of others identified Sullivan first, then Whalin, and then Cockran, Rook, and Brittain—I had not the slightest doubt about them—they are five of the seven, and were there from the time of going to the first public-house till they ran away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The public-house was where I first saw the seven men—they came in one after the other—they all had bread and cheese and ale—they were all strangers to me—I often have a large sum like that my Pocket; sometimes more and sometimes less—I don't generally take it out and show it in public-houses, and I am sorry I did then—I had three glasses at the two public-houses—two at the first and one at the second, and my friend had the same—we had a smoke—we were in the second public-house about three-quarters of an hour—I only had one glass of ale there; I don't swallow mine down like some of them—we had not been into any public-houses before that—I had my dinner before I started—I have never given a different description of Brittain—I did not describe him as a dark young man with a dark moustache—I said that the man who tried to trip me up had a dark moustache—Brittain is the one who took my money—they fol<lb></lb>lowed me behind and pinned my arms—four of them held me, three of the prisoners and one other—it took a very short time, not much over a minute, I should think—it was between 7 and eight o'clock—I gave a description of the dark one, but I could not swear to the other—we had got about 100</p>

               <p>yards from the second public-house before it happened—they walked behind us all the time—I saw they were the same men—I did not know they were going to rob me—they were talking all the time amongst themselves—we were coming home as far as we knew—we were strangers there—we could not find a police-station for some considerable time afterwards—I went to look at a house—I was going to buy it—we went there first and then went into the public-houses—the landlords of the public-houses are not here, and they were not called before the Magistrate—it is not true that I was sick—I did jump in the public-house, and Brittain jumped in the bar—it was a standing jump along the floor.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 44A, Princes Street, and I live on a little property of my own—I was with the last witness on Tuesday, 30th January, and went into a public-house with him—Rock came in and said he was starring, and I gave him two pennyworth of bread and cheese, and a pint of beer—the other men came in, and my friend said they all seemed to be hungry and wanting; and we gave them all some—we left that public-house and went to another—I don't know the sign of it—the same men came in there—the prisoners are five of them—we treated them to some ale there—I afterwards left that public-house with my friend—not knowing the road I said to one of the men "Will one of you fetch me a cab, and I will give you a shilling?"—they wanted the shilling beforehand—I said "No; when you have fetched the cab I will give you the shilling"—we went out to try and get a cab—I heard some persons following—I turned, and saw they were the same men—I was pinned from behind—when I came to my senses again I looked across the road, and I saw these young men there round my friend—they had hold of him—they were the same men who had been in the two public-houses—my friend was in the road, and I was on the footpath, a little ahead of him—I am sure the prisoners are the men I saw there—I identified them afterwards—I have had to go and pick them out—I have no doubt about them, but I thought there was another one, but when I got closer to him I found he was not one of them—I have not the least doubt as to these five.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There were fifteen or sixteen round the room when I picked them out—there were either six or seven we treated in the public-house—I could not swear whether we treated six, or seven, or eight—that observation applies to both public-houses—I don't know how long we were in the first—it might have been two hours, or two hours and a half—I did not jump—I am no jumper—my friend jumped to see how far he could jump along the floor—some of the young men were jumping for amusement, and he did it too—I can't say how many men pinned me—my arms were pinned behind, and very nearly wrung out of the sockets—I expect it was more than one—it was so sudden, I really did not know where I was for a minute—the whole of the prisoners were round my friend—there were about seven of them.</p>

               <p>his friend was sitting on a barrel. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He was sitting on a barrel, and I Was standing by his side, leaning on the counter—I did not hear him say "I will jump the lot of you"—he did jump, and slid down—he was not drunk—we only had a smoke and a glass or two of ale—I did go outside with him, but I did not say afterwards that he had spewed like a fountain—he merely spit, he did not actually vomit; but he spit out a mouthful of porter—he did not come inside and say he had been drinking all the even<lb></lb>ing, and was not fit to jump—I was not drunk—you wanted to take, the change out of the beer, and I would not allow you.</p>

I live at 4, South Road, Westbourne Park, and am a porter—on Tuesday 30th January, I was outside the Britannia public-house, about 4 30 or 4.45—I saw Mr. Mayho and his friend come out and go away from the public-house—I saw Sullivan come out soon afterwards—he spoke to the others who were round, and he said "One of those men promised me a <hi rend="italic">bob</hi>, I mean to have it by fair or foul means;" he said he saw about ten quid in his hand, and he might have the <hi rend="italic">poke</hi> before the night was out"—Sullivan, nick named "Tommy Dodd," said that—Mr. Mayho and his friend returned and asked if he could get a '<hi rend="italic">bus</hi>, and Sullivan said "I thought you wanted a cab," and he said a cab would do—they then went into a public-house at the corner of the bridge, and seven other men came up and asked me where they had gone—I said "Round that way some—where," and I nodded my head—five of those men are here, that is includ<lb></lb>ing Sullivan—they went into the Warwick, and I followed soon after, and saw them, all in the private bar—I stood opposite and watched; I intended to watch right through, but I had occasion about 7 o'clock to leave and go and look to a fire which I was keeping up for my <hi rend="italic">missus</hi>, and when I returned about 7.15 I saw Sullivan making his way towards the Prince Arthur, and the others were gone—I thought no more about it and went round the house—when I came back, in about ten minutes, I saw a mob outside the Prince Arthur—Sullivan was in the public-house at that time—I went down towards Netting Hill, and found Mr. Mayho and his friend down a turning—they had had some drink, but I don't think they were drunk—I think they were in a condition to know what they were about—I went with them to the police-station, and they made a statement.</p>

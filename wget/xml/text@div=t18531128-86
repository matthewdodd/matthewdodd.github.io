                  </hi>. I am single, and reside at No. 11, Finch-lane; I keep a house there, called the Louisa Chop-house—I know nothing of the prisoner. On Monday, 14th Nov., I received a letter from the hands of a boy; this is it—(<hi rend="italic">read:</hi>" Madam,—I am truly sorry to trouble you, but I am very much in want of a little money. The fact is, I know your secret, Miss; and unless you wish to be the laughing-stock of a parcel of waiters, and a thing to be despised by those who do not sell their virtue, you will send me the sum of 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. Madam, it may be some satisfaction to you to know that I have spent more than 100 times the sum I demand of you in your house, and I promise that it shall be faithfully repaid in three weeks from this time; but remember, madam, if I do not receive the money this morning, I promise you that you shall rue it before to-morrow's sun sets. You need not fear being again troubled by me, as I shall in a few months set sail to America. You must make a bundle of it, as though it was clothes; and if the bearer waits, give it to him: if it comes per post, direct it to Richard Jackson, Criterion coffee-house, Stone's-end, Borough, London. 'If you are so foolish as to try and brave me out, you will very soon see the effect of my tongue upon your business. Yours to command, if you choose, Jackson.") I never saw the prisoner, that I am aware of—there was nothing owing by me to him in any way—I do not know any person of the name of Jackson—upon receiving this letter, I communicated with the police—a bundle was made up, and sent to the Criterion coffee-house by a boy—I addressed it to" Geo. Jackson, Criterion coffee-house, Stone's end, Borough."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>). This letter was communicated to me by Miss Weston. In consequence of that, on Monday, 14th Nov., a parcel was taken by Edmunds to the Criterion coffee-house, and I followed</p>

               <p>him—I made some communication to the landlord—we got there with the parcel about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, and waited until the prisoner came; that was about a quarter to 6 o'clock—he came in, went up to the landlord, and said, "I have called for the parcel that was left here in the name of Jackson"—the landlord handed the parcel to him, saying," You must speak to that gentleman before you go," pointing to me—the prisoner turned towards the door, as if he wished to make his escape—I said, "Are you the person that this parcel was sent here for?"—he said, "I am"—he went outside with the parcel; I allowed him to do so, to see if there was any one else there, and I found Simms standing outside—I said to the prisoner, "Is this young man your companion?"—he said, "He is"—I said, "How am I to know that the parcel is for you? perhaps you had better step inside, and write me out a receipt for it" he then wrote this receipt, "Received, of Mr. Bassett, a parcel left at the Criterion coffee-house; Robert William Smith, Nov. 16, 1853 George Banks."—that "George Banks" was put afterwards—after the prisoner had signed it, I said to Simms, "Perhaps you had better sign it also"—the prisoner whispered to Simms, "Sign George Banks"—I heard him say that, and he signed, "George Banks"—I took the letter from my pocket, and saw that the prisoner's writing to the receipt corresponded with it—I then said, "We are two police officers; and you are charged with sending this letter to Miss Weston, of Finch-lane, and endeavouring to extort 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from her"—the prisoner said, "This young man knows nothing at all about it"—after Simms heard me say we were police officers, he immediately said, "Stop! I have signed my wrong name; I will write my right one"—he then gave me his right name and address, which I found to be correct—in fact, I had a knowledge of the lad; I did not think he was guilty—the prisoner went on, and said, "He merely came, to see me; I asked him to take a walk with me"—he also said, "I wrote the letter; I wrote it at home; nobody was with me at the time; I sent it by a boy"—I said, "Where are you going to take the parcel to?—he hesitated a moment, and then said, "Over to Kennington"—I said, "You must go with us to the station house;" Edmunds, the other officer, took charge of the prisoner, and Simms walked with me—when we got to the station house, I searched the prisoner—I found on him three or four envelopes, one addressed to the housekeeper, at No. 14, Walbrook—that is the place where his mother is housekeeper—in consequence of a communication that Edmunds made to me, I took the prisoner in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> over to Kennington Church—it was about two or three minutes past 7 o'clock when we left the station; I told the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man to drive as fast as he possibly could, as it was a case-of importance, and he did so—I do not know the time we got there—the station house was in Seething-lane—I should think it was not more than twenty minutes past 7 o'clock when we got over there—I left the prisoner and Edmunds in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I should say that the prisoner described a man to me, and I said, "You had better remain in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and I will go and see if I can see the man, or a person answering the description; as, if he saw you, he would most likely make his escape"—I looked for him, and also made inquiries of the police, but could find no such person—I then said to the prisoner, "You had better take a walk round with me, and see if you can see him"—I took him round with me, and down all the by-streets round the church, and backwards and forwards in front of it—we waited there, I suppose, about half an hour, and could find nobody at all answering the description—in going back, I took the prisoner into the Criterion coffeehouse, and saw the landlady; she said, in the prisoner's presence, "I</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to a merchant, at No. 14, Walbrook; the prisoner's mother is the housekeeper of the chambers there. On Monday evening, 14th Nov., I was leaving Walbrook with him, at a quarter past 5 o'clock—he said he was going as far as Newington-causeway to look at a pianoforte that he was going to buy—I went with him—when we had got a few steps past the Criterion coffee-house, he said, "Stop a minute, I am going in here to see if there is a parcel left for me"—I said, "You must make haste, because I am in a hurry"—he went in, and in about three minutes came out with this parcel—the officer came out with him—he asked him for a receipt, and said, "I suppose this is your friend"—I went in, and saw him sign a receipt—I was also asked to sign it—the prisoner said to me, "Sign George Banks; don't sign your own name"—I did sign "George Banks"—I asked him why I was to sign that, and he said, "Hush, hush"—I afterwards said it was not my right name, and gave my name and address—I was discharged when I got to the station.</p>

I have met this man several times, and he said he had lost hundreds in this house, and it had been the means of his ruin, and that if he could get a few pounds he could go over to America, and redeem his fortune, and begged of me to write it His excuse was that he had St. Vitus's dance in his hand, so that he could not for any length of time hold a pen. It was not only twice or thrice that he tempted me to do this, but he pleaded poverty, and dogged my footsteps wherever I went; and at last, without intending to gain one farthing by it, I consented to do it.")</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">was clearly of opinion that the objection could not be maintained; it would entirely defeat the object of the first clause of the Act of Parliament, if the word "menace" were to be construed as implying only some personal attack; threats might be made importing far more serious mischief, and more likely to result in obtaining the money demanded; but the use of the words, "without any reasonable or probable cause, cast back a reflective light upon the word" menace "and gave to it its full effect; those words showed that the thing was something which might be excused by there being a reasonable or probable cause for it; now if</hi>"<hi rend="italic">menace</hi>" <hi rend="italic">was construed to mean some specific act of personal violence or injury, it was difficult to see how there could be any reasonable or probable cause for any such thing; therefore if the Jury were of opinion that the prisoner sent the letter, and that the demand contained in it was without reasonable or probable cause, he was satisfied that it came within the statute.</hi>)</p>

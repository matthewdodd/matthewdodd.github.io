                  </hi>. I am a gunner in the Royal Artillery stationed at Woolwich. On the 25th of last month I was on guard near the prac<lb></lb>tice ground, which is about 1200 yards by 700 broad—it is fenced in, and no one is allowed to come in but those who have business there—between one and two o'clock I went my rounds, and met the prisoner near the centre of the grounds—I asked him what he wanted—he said he was looking after some old iron—I told him to go out of the premises, he had</p>

               <p>no business there—he then went back a few paces, and took up a sack, which I observed lying in some reeds, and said it was his—he lifted the sack, and from it came a truck and a shell as he lifted it—he shot it out of his own accord—I then took him into custody, and gave him in charge to Serjeant Anson—the prisoner said he thought there was no harm in taking them away—this is the truck and shell—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—there were some gun-carriages near where the sack was—I afterwards examined them with the serjeant, and found that one of the trucks had been taken off—I fitted this truck to it, and it corresponded—the truck had not been wheeled along—there were marks of its having been taken off of late, but no track of a wheel—it must have been carried away—these things are the property of the King, and have the broad arrow on them.</p>

They were both in the sack—he refused to carry the shell, only the sack, first of all—there was only myself there then, but when be went back and put the shell in again, there was three or four of us—I am sure I saw the truck come out of the bag.</p>

               <p>Court. Were these the same things that lay on the step when your mistress came up? - I cannot be sure of that, because I left them, and a gentlewoman picked them up.</p>

               <p>Court to Mrs. Blackshall. How far was the woman and the little boy got when you found the things on the step? - About thirty yards, I saw the little boy running after her, and immediately on my coming out, I saw the things laying on the steps.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you know them to be yours, have they any particular mark? - By handling them so often, and having them in my shop.</p>
               <p>Court. But several of the things I see are common goods, the handkerchiefs for instance, have they any mark? - Several of them have.</p>

               <p>What may the value of that gown be? - Ten shillings, this gown I am sure of.</p>
               <p>What may that be worth? - This is valued at seven shillings, it is marked to sell at ten shillings; the stays are all marked.</p>

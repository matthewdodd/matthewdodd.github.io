            . I am a watchman in Shoreditch. On the 25th of November, about five minutes before two, I saw the two prisoners in Kingsland-road, one of them had a bulk upon his shoulder. I got out of my box, followed them, and passed them. I turned back and stopped both of them. Jones had a cask upon his shoulder. I asked them what they had got? they said,</p>
               <p>"nothing." I told them I should take them to the watch-house. Cooper said,</p>
               <p>"do not, here is two shillings for you." I said,</p>
               <p>"that would not do, I would not take a farthing." Then Jones said, I should carry the cask. He threw it down, and the bung flew out, and the beer ran about the street. I tasted it, it was ale. I called for assistance; my partner came and took Jones, and I took Cooper. We took them to the watch-house, and they said they did not know each other.</p>

            . Q. You were called to by the last witness. - A. Yes, I saw both Cooper and Jones, and the cask, the bung was out and the liquor running about the street. I took Jones, and my partner took Cooper, and as Jones was going to the watch-house, he said he did not know any thing about stealing the cask. This is the cask.</p>

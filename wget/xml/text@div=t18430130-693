I was on duty near the river Lea, on the 16th of Jan.—at a quarter past six o'clock in the evening, I saw Ragan coming along by the river Lea—just before I met him I saw him stoop by a wall, and put something down—I heard it rattle—I went to the spot, felt, and found it was lead—I ran, pursued him into Bow, my brother officer came up, and he was taken—Ragan asked me what I wanted him for—I told him I would tell him when I got him to the station—I went back for the lead; and just before I got to it, I met Turton, with some more lead on his shoulder—I said, "You are just the <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> I wanted"—I took the lead from him—I went part of the way to the station with him, then went back and got the lead—after I had taken the lead from Turton down to the station, he ran away from me down a court—I went on the station, and then got the other lead which Ragan had left—there were 56lbs. weight in all—about 40lbs. were found on Turton, and 15lbs. or 16lbs. by the wall—it was quite the same description of lead—I found Turton at the Blue Anchor, Bromley, about a quarter to nine o'clock, I took the lead to the glass factory—the next morning I found some lead missing from the roof of the buildings—I compared it with Johnson, the plumber—he took the end pieces which were left on the roof, and matched</p>

On the evening of the 16th of Jan., I heard the cry of "Stop thief," and saw Ragan running—I stopped him—my brother officer came up, and told him he wanted him for stealing some lead—I was present when Turton was apprehended—at the station I said it was a bad job—he said, "What could a fellow do when he was asked by an old friend to help take the lead?"</p>

I know their premises very well—I am a plumber—I went on the roof, and saw a piece of lead taken off—it was compared with some lead produced by the officer, and made the most correct match I ever saw—I have no doubt that it came from that roof.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Young, a cabinet-maker, and live at No. 5, Ray-street. On the 9th of August the prisoner came to my house, and took a lodging for herself and her sister—I had two sheets and a blanket there, and the knives and forks she borrowed on the Saturday evening, the 12th—she left me without notice, after she had been there four days—she appeared in distress—she went out the first evening, and brought another female with her, whom she said was her sister, and brought a bundle, which she said was crockery, but it must have been bricks-on the Saturday evening I let them in again, and then she borrowed the knives and forks—when I went to fasten the street-door the key was gone, and I went into her room, and found that these things were gone, and in the cup board were about a dozen ends of bricks.</p>

I am not the person—I have no sister—I have no person be longing to me—I have been with no one—I have been lodging with a man and his wife. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I can swear to her—I am positive of it—she came three times before she took the room, and the other girl I could swear to if I saw her.</p>

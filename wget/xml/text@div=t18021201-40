            ? - A. That is the person. (Pointing to the prisoner.)</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure it was the prisoner? - A. Yes; I am convinced that is the person that took my muff from me.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the women all seem to be of the same party? - A. Yes, they did.</p>
               <p>Q.Were there any passengers going by? - A. Not a creature; I staid, I suppose, five minutes, and no person came to assist me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she snatch your muff? - A. Yes; when I found it going, I turned round to see who was taking it, and saw the prisoner, and I knew her by fight, I held it as long as I could.</p>
               <p>Q.Were there sufficient light for you to see her distinctly? - A. Yes; there was a lamp at the corner; some of the other women took my hat and tore it to pieces, and bit me; I was very violently bit in my arm.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon did she go away? - A. She was gone in an instant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she run or walk? - A. Upon my honour I cannot say, she was gone in an instant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner and the other woman abuse you very much? - A. Yes, and swore at me a good deal.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect any expression? - A. Yes, they d - d my eyes and limbs.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they call you? - A. They did not call me any thing in particular, they began without speaking at first.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not see what was done with your muff? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your muff worth? - A. A guinea, or twenty shillings, I suppose; there was another person taken up, who said, she had found the muff, and fold it for 3s. 6d.; the Grand Jury did not find a bill against her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Last Friday night was a week I was coming through Cranbourn-alley, and it rained very hard, and I stood under a court for shelter, and this young woman and some others began fighting, and the little girl that was taken up first picked it up in the court; a person of the name of Bird saw her pick it up.</p>

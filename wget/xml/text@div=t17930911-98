               <p>Q. What do you know of the prisoner taking them? - I saw him coming down Ironmonger-lane with the two loaves under his arm.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know they are the same you lost? - By many things.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you had lost them did you see them? - Not above five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner going towards your basket or from your basket? - Coming to me.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was he from you? - He was close by me, coming to me when I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is your master's shop from the place? - About thirty yards, not more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner appear to be coming from your master's shop? - No, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you stop the prisoner? - I did not see him take the bread.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner before or after you found the bread was missing? - After I had found the bread was missing.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you seize the prisoner? - He was seized before I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the bread? - No otherwise than in the man's hand. He was taken up for stealing the other man's bread.</p>

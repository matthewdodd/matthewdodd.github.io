                  </hi>. I am a boot manufacturer, carrying on business at 46, City Road—in November last, I had about 120 persons in my employ—the greater portion of my work is done on my premises—those who work at their homes fetch their own materials, and they bring back the goods when made—about the middle of the month, about forty persons left my service—a short time previously they had made a demand in respect to the price of their labour, but they gave me no decided reason why they left—they simply returned their work; some of it being in a finished, and the rest in an unfinished condition—I know what a "strike" means, the leaving of the men was generally understood as such by the trade—Shepherd was the only one of the defendants in my employ at the time—previously to the men striking, Emmett, sen., came to me, and said there was some disagreement amongst the men outside, about the question of wages, and I at once pro<lb></lb>posed that we should refer the matter to arbitration, if such was the case—he said he was afraid he could not bring that about—he is the secretary of the East End Shoemakers' Society—after the men had struck, I saw all the defendants, at different times—they were walking up and down in front of my premises, stopping persons who were applying for work, as well as those who were taking their work away—I saw some of them there early in the</p>

I am an ex-policeman, and live at No. 8, Henry Street, Tottenham Court Road—I was employed by Mr. Glew to watch the defend<lb></lb>ants and I commenced doing so on the 20th November—I saw Shepherd and Cook together on that day, in front of Mr. Glew's shop, and they stopped workpeople as they came out—I saw children bring in work, and they stopped them, too—I heard Shepherd ask a child where she lived, and he said, "Do you know this shop is on strike, and you have no business to carry the work away"—I heard him say this to grown-up persons as well—on the 21st I watched again, and I saw Shepherd, Cook, and the elder Emmett in front of Mr. Glew's shop, walking up and down—Emmett did not stay there all day, but went away occasionally—they stopped every person who went in and came out of the shop—I heard Emmett say to one man, "Do you know this shop is on strike, and you have no business to carry the work away; you are injuring our society"—I did not hear the answer—I think I saw Brain and the younger Emmett also that day, but I believe they did not stop for any length of time—on the 23rd I resumed my watch<lb></lb>ing and I think I saw all the defendants there that day, but at different intervals—two of them were always there, but scarcely ever more than that number—they stopped and spoke to the workpeople as before, but not so as to prevent their going away with their bundles—on the 28th I saw the two Emmetts, and I believe the defendant Cook, and the same sort of thing was done then—no one was allowed to go in or come out without being spoken to.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 25, Pleasant Place, and am a bootmaker—In November last I worked for Mr. Glew—on the 19th of that month I saw Shepherd outside—as I came out he said, "I suppose you are a shopmate?"—I said, "Yes"—he then asked me if I knew the shop was on strike—I told him I did not, and then inquired what it was on strike for—he said for a general reduction of wages—ninepenny work would be 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; eightpenny work would be; 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. work would be 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—"In fact," he said, "Glew means to make the shop like the one in the Hackney Road"—he asked me if I had been to apply for work—I told him I did not want any—he then asked me who I had been to see, and I said Mr. King—he asked my name and address, and I gave him the wrong ones—I then left—I wanted work that day—I afterwards had work, but the prices were not as Shepherd had represented them to be.</p>

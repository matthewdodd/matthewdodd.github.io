At 12.40 a.m. on May 7th I was in Cambridge Road, and saw there the four prisoners with another man—I was not in uniform—I watched them and saw them walk up Green Street, three on one side and two on the other side of the way—I saw Hayday and Ewing or Roberts and the fifth man go through Victoria Park Square, through Sugarloaf Walk into Globe Road, where Finnis and Roberts, or Ewing, joined them—they then all turned down Sugarloaf Walk again.—I had three sergeants with me then, Rolfe, Smith, and Murrell, all in plain clothes—the fifth man came towards us, and on seeing us he ran away up Globe Road—Rolfe and myself followed the other four men through Sugar-loaf Walk after I had given instructions to the other two sergeants—Sugar-loaf Walk is a narrow passage with a wall on one side and palisading on the other—we went through this passage into Victoria Park Square, where we saw Smith and Murrell on the ground struggling with Hayday and Finnis, and Rolfe assisted Smith and Murrell to take them in custody, and from</p>

The yards are not paved—the crowbar fell on the ashes and would make no noise—the walls of the shed slant inwards, coming to a point—I got on the top—it was between 1.30 and 2 o'clock, a moonlight night, and light enough to see the men in the yard—the shed was about 15 yards from No. 285, where I saw the two prisoners with their backs towards me—I said,. "What are you two doing there?" and they turned round and came towards me—they could not get out of the yard any other way—285 is the third house from the corner at the junction of Globe Road and Sugarloaf Walk—the corner house is a little chandler's shop—it was about three-quarters of an hour before we found them.</p>

I live at the chandler's shop, No. 279, at the corner of Globe Road and Sugarloaf Walk—I found this jemmy on May 7th, about 12.45 p.m., at the end of my yard near the dust-bin—there is a high wall at the back of the yard, and another separating it from the backs of the houses in Victoria Park Road.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a merchant. About eight o'clock in the evening of Thursday I was in Church-street, Shoreditch—Mr. Mordaunt called after me that my pocket had been picked—he had captured the prisoner—I put my hand into my pocket, and missed my handkerchief—I went into Shoreditch, found an officer, and gave him in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I was standing at ray door, in Church street, and on the opposite side of the way I saw the prosecutor, likewise the prisoner and another, who was a head taller—the other one lifted the prosecutor's coat tail, and took the handkerchief out of the pocket—he handed it to the prisoner, who put it under the flaps of his coat—the one</p>

               <p>that committed the robbery ran away, but the prisoner walked on to go down Shoreditch—I crossed from my own door, and as he saw I was in the act of seizing him, he took the handkerchief and threw it towards me—it fell on the ground—I took it up, and took the prisoner—I then hallooed after the party who had lost it, and he went to get an officer—this is the handkerchief, as to colour, that I saw taken out of the prosecutor's pocket as he passed.</p>

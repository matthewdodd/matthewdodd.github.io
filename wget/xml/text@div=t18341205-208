We lost a wine-cask from the front garden, on the 2nd of December—I received information, and went to Harcourt-street—I saw the prisoner there, with the cask on his shoulder—I called out, "Stop thief, "—he dropped it, and ran in the direction of Seymour-place—he was stop<lb></lb>ped there by the policeman, in my sight—he said at the station-house that he got the cask from a waggon at Paddington, and then he said it was at the</p>

I heard a cry of "Stop thief"—I turned, and saw the prisoner running towards me as hard as he could run—I stopped him—he said, "What have I done? If I have done any thing amiss, I will tell you where my mother lives"—he said he had the cask from Paddington, and then at the top of Homer-street—he did not appear intoxicated.</p>

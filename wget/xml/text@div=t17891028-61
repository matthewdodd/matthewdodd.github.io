               <p>I let lodgings, a ready furnished room, at two shillings and six-pence a week, to the prisoner and her husband, as they said; when I charged them with the watchmen, they gave their names in different; then I found he was not her husband; she was but one night in the lodging; I missed one pair of linen sheets the next night; the prisoner was out of the room when I found the sheets were gone, and the man too; they came back the second day, and she begged the watchman not to take her to the watch-house and she would produce them the next day; I told her if she would tell me where they were it would be better for her, but I never saw the sheets since; I let the lodging to her as a married woman; and she said her husband was to live with her.</p>

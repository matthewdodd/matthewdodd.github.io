I live at No. 5, Northampton-street, Lower-road, Islington—I have been residing with a person named Jones—on Satur<lb></lb>day, the 9th of April, the prisoner came to me; she remained till about half-past 7 o'clock—about 7 o'clock Jones came in—he remained about half an hour and then left—after that a young man came in, and directly he left, the prisoner made a rush across the room at me, and stabbed me in the throat with a knife—no words had passed between us—I put up my hand to save myself, and she cut me across the back of the hand—she drew the knife from her pocket—Jones had spoken to her a few words—they were angry words rather—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the knife—as I fell back on the ground I caught the blade of the knife in my hand—the knife does not belong to me—she must have brought it with her—the landlord and landlady came to my assistance—she had been with me ever since 3 o'clock—she lived at Hackney Wick—that is about two miles from me—we had taken tea to<lb></lb>gether before Jones came in—it was merely a slight wound, about a quarter of an inch deep and two inches long—I had it sewn up.</p>

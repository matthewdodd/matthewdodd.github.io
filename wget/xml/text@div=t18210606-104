I know Flowers' house is in St. Marylebone parish; I received information, and on the 28th of May, I took the prisoner at a public-house, in Charles-street, Manchester-square, on another charge; I took him to the watch-house, and charged him with the robbery, and asked if<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182106060058"></xptr>he had any duplicates about him; he said, he had not; I found one at the bottom of his pocket; went to the pawnbroker's, and found the watch which Welch claimed.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I declare before God and you, I am innocent of stealing this watch; in the beginning of May, I met a young man whom I knew some time ago, and who used to call on me to procure him a situation when I was in business; by accident I met him on the second or third of May; I had not seen him for two or three years, he said, he had been abroad most of that time, and expected to go again; we talked on different subjects, and he being a trifle in my debt before he left the country, I asked him to lend me two or three pounds; he said, he could not, but would call on me in the evening; I said, I had got a bed for a few nights at the Compasses; he said, he knew the house, and had slept in every room there, a few years ago; I described my room as having two steps to go into it; he said, he knew it; when I returned in the evening, I asked the landlord if a young man had been, he said No; I went to bed, and next morning he came up into my bed room, and sat down on the prosecutor's bed; we conversed together; he said, he was sorry he could not lend me the money, but if I met him in Percy-street, Bedford-square, he would oblige me; he got up, and said he had to go to Pentonville; I said, I would walk with him if he waited while I dressed; he said, he was in a hurry, and wished me good morning; I afterwards went and met him; he said, he was sorry he could not oblige me, but would pawn his watch; I said, I wished for no such thing; he gave it me, and said, he wished me to pawn it, as he wanted money himself, and told me to ask for 4 l., which I did; they would only give me 2 l.; I returned, and gave him the ticket; he gave me 1 l., and the ticket, and said, as he was going to leave England, it would be useless to him; I have lived in great credit; have been in business; and had the honour of serving four Sheriffs of this city,</p>

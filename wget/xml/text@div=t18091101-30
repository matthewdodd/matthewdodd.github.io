On the 18th of September in consequence of suspicion, I sent for a constable to search her box, which was in the attic story, the box was locked, she gave the key; we found in her box a yard and a quarter of lace, and several articles besides, which I knew to be mine.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the lace. A. About 10 shillings a yard. I have a card of lace here that it was cut off, nothing but the scissars parted it. She had been out, I asked her when she came in where she had been, she said she would not tell me.</p>

               <p>Q. I believe the prisoner while out of place, had lodged at your house - A. She had, and she left a box in my care.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 18th of September did she come to your house. A. She did; between ten and eleven o'clock in the forenoon, she brought some things, put them on my bed, and desired me to put them in her box, which I did; she desired me to break the box open, as it was locked and she had not got the key.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send your husband with that box the next day to Mr. Blundell - A. Yes, and it contained those things that she brought.</p>

               <p>MR. BLUNDELL. I was present when the box was opened; upon examining the box, I found a napkin which belonged to the family, there is a letter B with a figure of four upon it, a block of bobbin-wire with my hand-writing upon it, and a remnant of lace I think they are worth 30 or 40 shillings; and different articles, I had never sold any of them to the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. William James Stevens—he has different shops—I manage one at Ratcliffe-highway. It was the duty of the prisoner to take and receive money for my master, and to account to me in the evening—it was his duty to put it into the desk, and enter it in the book—on the 5th of October I was in the shop, and one of the young men brought me a book, and desired me to see whether there was an entry of a pair of shoes—there was no such entry—Paul was at tea—I then said I wanted him to go to Mr. Stevens with me—he said he had not sold a pair of shoes that day, and knew nothing of the witness Sullivan.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> These shoes are your master's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, if they had I been bought of the prisoner, it would have been his duty to put it down, and put the money into the desk—I know the money was not in the desk, because all the money he takes is entered in this book—I added the money together, and it agreed with the book.</p>

                  </hi>. I am married, and live at Wapping. I remember on the 5th of October Mary Sullivan asked me to go to buy a pair of shoes—we went, between ten and eleven o'clock, to the prosecutor's shop—my sister-in-law was in the habit of buying shoes there, and I took her in there—the young man brought her a pair—I should know him again among a thousand men—she did not like the first pair—the second pair I agreed for—he asked 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said she should not give any more than 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she paid for them—he went inside, and got a small piece of paper.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You went home to Wapping? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I went off immediately after she bought the shoes—she was out of a situation then, and was living as a stranger with me—we live in the same house, but do not sleep in the same house—she has been at work a week or two—she has no place now—she is in a place of all-work—she gets 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for help<lb></lb>ing to clean the house—we had walked all the way from Wapping, wich is more than a quarter of a mile—I did not go directly from my house to the shop, because I went to the doctor with the child, and she asked me to go to buy the shoes—we were surprised that she did not come home—she told me she went to a friend of hers in Bethnal-green, to get refreshment—no one but the prisoner was in the shop when I paid for these shoes, there was no other customer—Sullivan said she had never been in that shop be<lb></lb>fore—she slept in the same house as me, down in the kitchen, with my mother-in-law.</p>

            . The prisoner's counsel, Mr. Sheridan, discovered on that occasion, a variance of one letter, between the will and the manner in which it was set forth in the indictment; the consequence of which was, that after an argument on the subject, the Recorder admitted the varience to be fatal to the indictment, and directed the jury to acquit the prisoner on that ground. - The present indictment was drawn up conformably to the will, and therefore differed of course, (though only in one letter) from the first indictment; and Mr. Sheridan endeavoured to obviate the difficulty that would arise from that variance, in the out-set, by his argument in support of the prisoner's plea of autrefoits acquit, as follows:</p>
               <p>
            MY LORD,</p>
               <p>The plea of autrefoits acquit is an old, established and legal plea; but should it be once admitted, that a variance between the indictment to which this plea is urged as a bar, and the other indictment or record on which it is founded, will oblige the court to over-rule the plea; it is absolutely impossible, that such can ever be urged with effect, because no prosecutor who fails in one indictment on the ground of informality, will ever prefer another indictment for the same offence, in the same words: he must necessarily guard against the error that proved fatal to the former indictment. The consequence must be, that there must be a variance; and if the plea is over-ruled on that ground, I may, with deference contend, that autrefoits acquit, instead of being an established legal plea, is merely nominal, unsubstantial and frivolous.</p>
               <p>I find this plea urged, my Lord, in Hale's History of the Pleas of the Crown, vol. 2. page 246; and the argument of that learned judge appears to support the position I have laid down, and to warrant the use I intend this day to make of the plea of autrefoits acquit, as applied to the case of the prisoner, who has put it in by my advice. - My Lord, it is there stated, - that A was indicted for the murder of B by poisoning; and the indictment runs thus: - Quod B fidem adhibens persuasioni dicti A nesciens predictum potum cum veneno fore intoxicatum recepit et hibit, per<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178707110132"></xptr>quod predictus B immediate post receptionem vene predicti obiit. - But as it was not alledged quod venenum predictum recepit et bibit, the Court directed the jury to acquit the prisoner, who was indicted again for the same crime; and the second indictment was made formal and complete, by the addition of the words which were wanting in the former. When he was arraigned on the second, he pleaded autrefoits acquit. The court did not found the opinion given on his plea, upon any variance between the two indictments, though a very essential variance did exist; they did not compare the records, because, as we are left to conclude, the variance would not have proved fatal; but they over-ruled the plea upon grounds which applied to the case then under consideration. It will be my duty to shew, that the plea, as used now by the prisoner at the bar, does not come within either the letter or spirit of the objections stated in the case reported in Hale. - The first objection was, that the former indictment of A was insufficient, because it did not, in fact, state a felony to have been committed; the indictment, upon the very face of it was defective; and therefore A being acquitted on such a indictment, could not be said to be legitimo mode acquietatus of the murder of 
               <persName id="t17870711-89-person762">
                  B.

                  </persName>
            - But the case is very different with the prisoner at the bar: a felony was fully stated in his former indictment; and no one who did not compare the indictment with the original will (which was no part of the record of the court) could possibly discover any defect in it. Here is a very great and very material difference between the two cases; and what might be objected to the plea of autrefoits acquit in the one, would be totally inapplicable to the other. - The next objection taken by Hale, to the plea of autrefoits acquit, as urged in the case reported by him, is, that the indictment being insufficient and defective, the Court could not tell, whether the verdict of the jury was given upon the merits of the whole cause, or merely upon he defects in the indictment; but this objection could not hold in the present case: for as the former indictment was in itself perfect and complete, and no defect whatever appeared upon the fate of it, your lordship has no alternative but must intend that the verdict of acquittal, which appeared upon record, was given upon the general merits on the case; and therefore my Lord, I pray, that upon this plea, judgement may be given against the crown.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Wilson. Your plea is, that he has been acquitted of the felony for which he was indicted; then you must aver that it was the same felony; it this is another will, that allegation that it is the same felony will not be sustained. There is no imperfection in the indictment in the case you have been citing; it was the same man, and for the same offence, but the offence had been insufficiently alledged; there is nothing to be presumed, if the facts be different, if the will that is set out in the former indictment was a different one, there is nothing to be presumed, but that in point of fact, one of the felonies differs from the other: it is necessary for you to aver that the two felonies are the same; if they do differ, there is an end in point of fact to the plea: a man is indicted for forging the will of A. there is a mistake; he is afterwards indicted for forging the will of B. the second time you aver, that that acquittal was for the same felony for which he now stands indicted: produce the will, and you will see it corresponds with one record, and not with the other.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sheridan. So far it is the will of the same individual, only the difference of the letter I.</p>
               <p>Court. If they do not differ, then his plea is good.</p>
               <p>(The indictment read, and compared with the record by Mr. Sheridan, and it appeared not to be the same.)</p>
               <p>Court. You must take his plea.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shelton. The Court having given judgement against you on that plea, you must now plead over to these offences at large: are you guilty, or not guilty?</p>

               <p>Look at that will, what do you know of the prisoner and that will? - That will was produced by the prisoner at Mr. Christian's office, in order to obtain probate; at the time he brought the will, I asked him for the proof of the man's death, which is necessary, in order to write the jurata; he then produced a letter, I believe this is the letter.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure it is the letter? - I have read it over several times, and from the writing, and from the instructions I think it is the same; I found sufficient in the letter to instruct me to write the jurata; I wrote the jurata upon this will; it is my own hand-writing, and my own jurata; when he first produced the will, I believe he was not then sworn; on account of his not having the money to pay for the office fees; I kept the will in my desk, as he told me he had a friend that would advance him the money to pay for the will; I wanted to know what effects the man died worth, in order that we might know what stamp to use on the business; he told me where the money was payable, and I directed him to Mr. Waddington; he said it was money due for a prize from the Vigilant, he said a merchant ship; on his return he told me there was the sum of twenty pounds; the jurata is dated the 13th of July, 1786, which was some few days previous to its being sworn that it was first presented, I cannot charge my memory with how many times he did call, but the last time he called, it was of a Saturday; he informed me he had been to Mr. Waddington, and I told him to bring the probate by three o'clock, as he was then going out of town at that time, and he before told me that Mr. Waddington would be glad if Mr. Christian's clerk would go down with him; in consequence of which I expedited the business, the same morning, I think it was the same morning, it was on the Saturday morning I expedited the business; he told me if I would go with him; he would then pay me for the business, and make me a present for my trouble; I accordingly got the business under seal, and went with him to Mr. Waddington; when I was there Mr. Waddington asked some few questions respecting the will, to know whether it was regular; I told him it was done according to the usual course; then Mr. Waddington gave the prisoner a checque on his banker, and we went to the banker, then the money was paid, and a receipt given by the prisoner, which is witnessed; after Mr. Waddington had asked him the necessary questions, he paid the sum of fifty pounds one shilling, which I think was the sum; I wrote a receipt, and at the request of Mr. Waddington, I signed it as a witness to the payment of this money, with his clerk; I went with the prisoner, he received the money at the banker's, he paid me my bill, and gave me a little present.</p>

               <p>I was clerk to Mess. Waddington and Co. at the time; I remember the prisoner coming to their house, perfectly well; he came different times to Mr. Waddington's, and made a demand of the prize money due to him from Gibson; Mr. Waddington asked him his authority; he told him that he had had information that he was dead, and he had his will and power, to receive his prize money, due to him, in consequence of which he produced a will; and Mr. Waddington told him he could not pay him; but he must take out a probate; and unless he could produce a person that knew him, he objected to pay him the money; in consequence of which he said he could produce a person; and he came in company with Mr. Lander, and produced the probate, and Mr. Waddington paid him the money; and he signed a receipt, which I witnessed with Mr. Lander.</p>

             on board? - No, he only asked what prize money was due.</p>
               <p>N. B. Before the verdict was given, Mr. Sheridan suggested to the Judge a doubt, upon which he wished for his opinion. The law makes the forgery of a will a capital offence; but then the question arises - what is a will? In point of law, it is only the death of the testator, which can give efficacy to a writing, vulgarly called a will; so that in fact, it is the death that completes the deed, and gives it the name of a will. In that point of view, he said the prisoner could not be said to have have forged a will; as the supposed testator was alive, and had actually appeared in Court. The Judge said, the case was new, and as it had never been determined, he would take the opinion of the twelve Judges upon it, and of course would arrest the judgment.</p>

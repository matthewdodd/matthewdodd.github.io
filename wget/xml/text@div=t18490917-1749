                  </hi>. I live in Horse-ferry-road, Westminster. In July, 1846, I was indebted to Messrs. Johnson and Graves—on 25th April, 1847, I received a summons from the County Court, in the morning—the prisoner came in the afternoon—I did not know him—he said he came from Messrs, Johnson and Graves—he referred to the summons, and said Mr. Graves was a very nice man, and he did not wish to hurt any one, and instead of paying the money into Court I could pay it to him by instalments, which I was very glad to do—I gave him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he did not say who he was, but I thought he was one of Mr. Graves' men—I afterwards gave him half-a-crown and two shillings—I paid him these sums, because I thought he was authorized to receive them to stop the execution—he received the money as Johnson and Graves' servant.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business with Mr. Johnson, in Blackman-street. In 1846, Mrs. Argent was indebted to me—the prisoner was not authorized, in 1847, to receive money from any one—I cannot find any entry in the book of the payment of these 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., half-a-crown, or 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., from Mrs. Argent—he has never paid them to me.</p>

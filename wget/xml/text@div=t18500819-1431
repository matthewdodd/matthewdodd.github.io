                  </hi>. I am a furrier, and live in Friday-street. I had a person named Turner in my employment—it was my custom to give skins to workmen out of doors, to be manufactured for me—Turner was so employed in June—on 28th June I gave him 200 mink skins, and 150 musquash skins—the mink skins were for boas—they were worth about 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in consequence of communication, I went to Turner's workshop, in West-street, Smithfield—I sent Dibley toTurner's; he brought part of the skins, but I missed sixty<lb></lb>two mink skins—that was about 8th July—I went the same day to the</p>

I never have had any; I never saw any mink skins in Turner's possession"—the prisoner keeps a fur shop—there were a few common fur-skins in the window—I then went back to Mrs. Turner, and told her Harris denied having them—I took her to Harris's directly—there was Harris, Mrs. Turner, Dibley, and myself—I asked Harris for my property—he said, "I never had it"—I said, "That is my author; Mrs. Turner says that you had some"—upon that he said, "I did have the skins; I lent Turner some money upon them"—on asking why he did not say so at first, he said, "That is my business"—I said, "Is that your usual way, to advance money to persons on property?"—he said, "I will advance money to anybody on anything, without asking any questions, and what can you make of that?"—I think he said he had sixty skins—Mrs. Turner said, "You told me forty"—I am not aware that he made any direct answer to that—he said he lent 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on them—Mrs. Turner again said, "You said 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said, "Turner had the skins back, but I have not had my money"—he asked me to look and see if there were any skins there—I said, "Furriers know too well what to do with skins."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fur-skin dresser, in business with my mother. I went on 9th July with Mr. Hatch to the prisoner's premises—Mrs. Turner was there—we asked the prisoner what he had done with the mink skins belonging to Mr. Hatch—he said, "I have not seen any mink skins"—Mr. Hatch said that he had, and I also said that he had—Mrs. Turner said, "You know you received mink skins from my husband; you know you came two or three times to our house, and I met you in Skinner-street, bargaining for skins in the street"—the prisoner said, "Well, Turner did come here and left a parcel of skins here: I did not know how many there were; I lent him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on them; he came again and took them away"—I said, "Why did you not tell Mr. Hatch this morning?"—he said, "That is my business; I do business in my own way; I lent the man 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on them, and he came and took them away, and what can you make of that?"—he said he did not know the number of skins—I said, "That is a very strange way of doing business, that you should take in skins, and lend money on them, without knowing how many there were"—he then made the remark to Mr. Hatch, that he took in goods of anybody without asking questions, and be did business in his own way—I got 168 mink skins from Turner's place.</p>

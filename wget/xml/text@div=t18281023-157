I was directed to wait at the premises of Mr. Lyon, and saw the prisoner come out between four and five o'clock in the afternoon; I took him, and said I believed he had some property of Mr. Lyon's about him - he said he had not; I took him back, searched him, and found these gold brooches in an inner-pocket of his trousers - I heard him say he took them from Mr. Lyons, and ask forgiveness.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

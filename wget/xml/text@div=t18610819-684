                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, C</hi> 197). I was occupying a house of which I was in charge, 4, St. Martin's-court—on the night of the 18th, I had a uniform coat and macintosh hanging up in the kitchen, which was on the first floor, on a row of pegs behind the door, and my hat was also there—there were also a silk handkerchief, a pair of Wellington boots, and a coat of my son's—his coat was on a bench in the passage, the boots were in the kitchen, and the silk handkerchief in my uniform coat pocket—I went to bed at about half-past 9 o'clock that night—I was called up about half-past 1 by a police-constable—I did not observe any marks of violence upon coming down—I found the kitchen window open, and my uniform hat in the middle of the kitchen—my uniform coat and macintosh, and my son's boots and some other things, were gone—the window was shut when I went to bed—the constable Gordon had got my uniform coat on his arm when be called me, but I have never seen the other things since—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my uniform coat.</p>

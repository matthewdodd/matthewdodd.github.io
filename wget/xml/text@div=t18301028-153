On the 21st of October I lost a pair of trousers from my shop; the prisoner came in about dusk, and bought a hat - he returned about half-past nine o'clock, seeming to say he did not like the hat; I said I had nothing to do with that, I was paid and I was satisfied - he said he had two young men who would buy some articles of me, if I would give him the money back; I said I would not - he sat down, and the young men looked at a pair of trousers and some other things; they did not buy any thing - but while they were looking at other things the prisoner went away with the trousers which they had looked at; I gave the two young men in charge - they said they knew nothing of the prisoner; I found him about half an hour afterwards - the trousers were found in his chest; he took the key, opened it, and gave me them out.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. J. ALLEY. Q. Did he ask the price of the trousers? A. No; that I will swear - I did not show him any trousers, but I did the others; the prisoner did not offer me any money - I showed the others two or three pairs of trousers; I sold them a waistcoat and a pair of trousers, but not of the same description as these - I suppose the prisoner is a sailor; I found him afterwards sitting on his chest, at the Peacock, with the hat he had bought in his hand - the officer said to him,"You must go with me;" he made no answer, but took his key, opened his chest, and gave me the trousers - he said, "I thought I had paid you; I will pay you for them;" he offered to pay the officer, who said he dared not take it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was not I standing in the shop with the trousers under my arm? A. No, or I should have taken them from you.</p>

            . The prosecutor complained to me that a man had stolen his trousers; I went to the house- there were three persons in the passage; I told them to remain, and sent for the prosecutor, who came and pointed out the prisoner - I told him to consider himself as my prisoner; he said, "For what?" I said, "For taking a pair of trousers from Mr. Davis' shop;" he took out the key, unlocked the chest, and took out these trousers, which the prosecutor said were his, and had been taken from the shop - the prisoner said, "Have I not paid for them?" the prosecutor said, "Certainly not;" when we got outside the prisoner said he would pay for them, and pay me for my trouble.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you inquire whether he was in a hurry to go on board ship? A. The men in the passage said they were waiting to take him on board.</p>

He showed me these trousers, and I wanted to exchange them for the hat; he would not, unless I gave him one shilling - I staid half an hour with them under my arm; I got tired, and said, "I must go and get my things out before they shut up" - I went and got my hammock, and took it to St. David's stairs; I went back for my chest, and he came with the Policeman, and said I had not paid for them - I said I thought I had.</p>

            . The prisoner had left my vessel three weeks or a month ago, and went to the hospital-ship; on that evening the boat was lying off the stairs, and when he had got his hammock on board he went back for his chest, and was taken; he was to have sailed early the next morning - the mate was with him, and hurrying him off.</p>

               <p>COURT to THOMAS COLLINS. Q. Was he in liquor? A. I considered he had been drinking a little, but was not drunk.</p>

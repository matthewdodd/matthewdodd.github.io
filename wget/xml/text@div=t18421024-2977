                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Arthur Barlow, a cloth-worker, in Marshall-street, Golden-square. At half-past five o'clock, on the 12th of October, I saw the prisoner and another outside the premises—I after<lb></lb>wards saw them walking backwards and forwards before the prosecutor's door—the prisoner put his fingers on a roll of linen cloth, which was standing just outside the prosecutor's door—they walked backwards and forwards—then the prisoner took up a piece of linen cloth, walked about eighteen yards with it, and gave it to his companion—they went up Mar<lb></lb>shall-street, towards Craven Chapel—I then lost sight of the one that had the goods—I kept my eye on the prisoner—he got to Oxford-street about ten minutes to seven—I gave notice to the policeman, and he took him—I am sure he is the person.</p>

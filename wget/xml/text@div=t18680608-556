                  </hi>. I am a miller, of 38, Strickland Street, Deptford—on the 24th May, about 12.30, I was returning home up Mill Lane, and was suddenly seized from behind round the throat by three or four men, and thrown violently on the ground—I struggled—they robbed me of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in a purse, a knife and everything 1 had except a bunch of keys, and then ran away—it was dark, but there were a good many lamps—I cried out "Police" loudly, and they put my handkerchief over my mouth—the prisoner is one of the men, I knew him by sight—I saw him when he was going away—my handkerchief was left on the ground.</p>

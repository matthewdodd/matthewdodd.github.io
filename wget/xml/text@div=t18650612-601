                  </hi>. I am postmaster at Nether Stowey, near Bridge-water—money-orders are issued and paid at my office—I am supplied with a number of forms by the General Post-office, in books, each form is num<lb></lb>bered, the order and advice are on one sheet—our practice is to enter the name of the payee and the remitter in a journal, then enter the amount and the office upon which they are drawn on the order, and give that to the person; the advice is made out with the names of the remitter and the payee and sent to the postmaster upon whose office the order is drawn—on 12th May a short dark man drove up to my office in a gig; his right eye ap<lb></lb>peared to me larger than the other; be alighted and walked into the office, carrying in his hand a black bag—he addressed me by name, saying he wished to be shown into a private room—he then said he was an inspector of the General Post-office, sent by the Postmaster-General, and that Mr. Cresswell was to have come with him but was prevented—Mr. Cresswell is the surveyor of the Western district I believe—he opened his bag and pulled out some papers and began to read them; he said that several letters that were posted at the offices at Nether Stowey, Carrington, and Holford had never been received; that a letter addressed to Sir George Crowe, Belgrave-square, had not been received, that a letter posted at Nether Stowey contain<lb></lb>ing coin, the posting of which could be attested, had never come to hand—he also said that Sir Peregrine Acland had made complaints respecting his letters—I said that Sir Peregrine Acland's letters did not pass through my office; he said that some of them did, which is the case—he said that the Postmaster-General had issued peremptory orders for a searching inquiry to be made with respect to those letters—he said "1 have received a letter from some persons in London respecting a letter containing bank-notes, I have seen the reply to that letter, the letter was from a person who called him<lb></lb>self Hamilton, and the address was, "Post-office, Camden-town, "I answered that letter and signed it, requesting him to make the loss known to the secretary"—I told him I could not give him any information respecting those letters, but most certainly every letter that was posted was despatched the same evening in the bag to Bridgewater—he then asked me what my average issue of money-orders daily or weekly was, and asked to see my</p>

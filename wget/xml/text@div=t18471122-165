                  </hi> I am a stove-maker, at 302, Oxford-street, London, and at Birmingham.

                  </hi> I live in Noel-street, Islington. On 12th July I paid the prisoner 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of Mr. Walker; on 16th Aug.

                  </hi> I am in Mr. Walker's service—he gave me instruct<lb></lb>tions to give the outstanding debts into the prisoner's hand to collect for him—I never received from the prisoner either of these sums—I gave him the accounts to collect, and he was to bring them in as he collected them—he brought in some accounts, but not these—he was to be paid ten per cent.—he paid me the money which he received net, and said he would settle with Mr. Walker, and take off his commission at last—I gave him a list of the accounts due in the lump—he had to collect 58<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he has paid in 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. but nothing on Mr. Lee's account—Mr. Lee's accounts were amongst those I gave him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Was I to pay in the accounts every day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; you were to bring them as you collected them—you acknowledged collecting 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—you paid in 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> Mr. Walker told me to receive this money; not to put myself out of my way, but to do it at my leisure; I intended to pay in the whole in one lump. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I discovered he had not paid in what he had received, about the middle of Sept.—I then went seek him—I could not find him at the address he gave—I found him at a public-house in Long-acre—he told me he had collected about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he came next day, and gave me this account of what he had collected (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it has no date, but as near as I can recollect, it was on the 21st Sept.—he told me he had collected 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and gave me this bill—the account of these three sums are down in it—we took him in Oct.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I said, "Here is an account of all I have received," and brought him the list; he said, "Can you pay it?" I said, "No, but I have money to receive of a person who will be in town in three weeks or a month; if you will wait, I will give you the money;" he said he would not write to Mr. Walker if I would; I said I would; he gave me time, and when the time came, I wanted a fortnight longer, as the party was not come to town; shortly after Mr. Walker came to town, and I was arrested; I dare say I shall be able to pay him the money before Christmas if I get my liberty, if I do not I cannot.</p>

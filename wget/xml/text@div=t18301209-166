On the morning of the 10th of November I left my whip in the yard - I went away, and returned in two minutes; my whip was then gone - in the course of two minutes and a half I saw the prisoner covering something over in a cart; I went up into that cart, pulled off the cloth, and found my whip under a great coat - he said some one had thrown it up into his cart.</p>

            . On the 10th of November the prosecutor brought the prisoner to the watch-house, and I took him - the whip was brought by the prosecutor; on our way to the office the prisoner said it came from one or other of the stables, but did not say he took it himself.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had my leg hurt, and was going to the hospital; when I came back I saw a man with a whip in his hand, which he put up into the cart - I walked a little way, and was just going to leave the carter to go to the hospital, when the prosecutor came, and said, "You have my whip;" I said I had not - I went back, because he said he thought somebody saw me in the yard; I was not in the cart - my father went to the prosecutor's two or three nights, and said he had witnesses to bring; the prosecutor said there was no need of that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engraver, of 20, St. James-street—I was in Princes-street, near the Mansion-house, between half-past 2 and 3, on the day that Mr. Garibaldi went to Guildhall to lunch—a gentleman spoke to me, and then I missed my watch—it cost 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., English money—the prisoner was close to me at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dressmaker, of 6, Richardson-street, Mile End-road—on 20th April, I was standing on the pavement in Princes-street, and saw the prosecutor coming through the crowd, and the prisoner, who was on my right side, took a gold watch out of the prosecutor's pocket, and broke off the ring which attached it by a silk ribbon round his neck—I told Blazey, and saw the prisoner given in custody—I did not lose sight of him—I turned round and said to him, "You have got that gentleman's watch"—he said, "No, that man along there has got it"</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you talking to a man named Bryant? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I only know him by his coming up to me—I never saw him till the Wednesday night before the prisoner was remanded—I was not talking to anybody—I said to Blazey," That gentleman has lost his watch," as the prosecutor had not missed it—I looked at the prisoner's face as well as at his hands—I watched him very carefully, but did not see him throw the watch to anybody.</p>

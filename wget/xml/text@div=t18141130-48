               <p>Q. In the month of July last, did he mention an acceptance to you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the first he said about it - A. He made some application respecting an acceptance of Mr. Larking, he said that Mr. Larking had given him an acceptance in compensation of excessive damages of a levey; that was in July last, he applied to me. He said, he wanted thirty-nine pounds ten shillings, for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181411300037"></xptr>a particular occasion to pay to the Gravesend Bank; he said, he had the bill at home on the 23rd of July, and he had omitted to bringit up with him. I then gave him a check upon Mr. Collins to the amount of thirty-nine pounds ten shillings, upon his putting Mr. Larking's bill into the post for me, addressed to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come to you on a subsequent day, and bring this bill to you with the acceptance of Mr. Larking - A. I believe he came on the 4th of 
               <persName id="t18141130-48-person569">August.</persName>
             I said to the magistrate I believed on the 2nd of August; I know now it was on the 4th; I lived then in Ely-place, in the County of Middlesex; he came to me, he brought to me this acceptance.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that - A. That is the acceptance he brought, exactly as it is now; he brought this to me on the 4th of August; in consequence thereof, I then gave him a draft upon Brown and Co. of thirty-nine pounds ten shillings; the first draft was not paid. I afterwards handed that bill over to Mr. Collius on the same day, I put a mark upon it before I parted with it; October 3rd, that is the day it became due; I put on it before I parted with it October the 3rd.</p>
               <p>Q. On or about the 5th of October, did you receive a letter from the prisoner - A. I believe it was on the 6th. That is the letter.</p>
               <p>COURT. The date, October the 3rd on the top of the bill, is your hand-writing - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. On the 6th of October, did you receive these two letters - A. I received this letter on the 6th, by post; it is dated the 5th; it is addressed to me at Ely-place. I have seen the prisoner write. I have no doubt it is his hand-writing.</p>

About the 3rd of August, I carried the bill to Mr. Russell; Mr. Russell gave me a draft upon Brown and Co. for the sum of thirty-nine pound ten shillings, and a little time before the bill became due, my wife asked me to get the money to take this bill up, I could not get the money; my wife was very uneasy; I have not got my witnesses here that heard what my wife said, they were here the day before yesterday.

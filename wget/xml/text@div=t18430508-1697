I produce an examined copy of the register of marriage between William Holmes and Maria Budd in Oct., 1829—I got it from the first wife—I went to the parish church at Teddington, and examined it with the register, in the clerk's room at his private residence, where the books are kept—they are not kept at the church—when I went about the certificate of the second marriage the book was fetched from the church to the clerk's house for me to examine it by—I had never seen the clerk before—I went to the church; the people opposite told me I should find the clerk at the house, and he showed me the book—there are several blanks in this certificate—they were so in the register.</p>

I was occasionally employed as journeyman by the late William Turvey, who acted as parish clerk of Ham church—he was a master carpenter—I have known the prisoner eight or nine years—in 1840 I was at work at Turvey's house, and saw the prisoner and a woman named Harriet Talley, whom I knew before, go into Turvey's house; after remaining there some time they came out, and went with Turvey towards Ham parish church, which is about fifty yards from the house—I do not know whether they went into the church—they afterwards came back to the clerk's house, and went over to the Jolly Gardeners beer-shop.</p>

James Hough is the clergyman who married them—the clerk is since dead—I did not know Talley before her marriage, and did not know her name, or whether she was single or a widow—she was described as a widow, and was asked in church by the name of Harriet Talley—I recollect that—the registers are usually kept in an iron chest in the vestry; but the clerk being very ill in bed, and not able to get up, and the clergyman being from home, they might be sent for to his house.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in my brother-in-law's shop, Joshua Thomas Pealing, on the 18th of January, about eleven o'clock in the morning—I left the shop, to go into the parlour—I returned, and saw a boy named Fox run out of the shop in a very desperate manner—I looked, and missed a large piece of bacon from the shop—I do not know who took it.</p>

On the morning of the 18th of January my sister called me—I came down and missed a piece of bacon—in the evening my sister asked me to go out with her—we brought the boy Fox to our shop, but a person came in, and Fox ran out—I and my sister went and gave him in charge.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 206.) On Saturday evening, the 18th of January, a person named Doughty was given to me on suspi<lb></lb>cion of stealing bacon—he said it was not him, it was Fox—I went after Fox, and took him—he said, "It was not me, it was Doughty"—I took him to the station-house, and then he said to Doughty, "It was not you stole it; you know who it was;" and when they were before the Magistrate they said it was Leadley—I went and took the prisoner, and they both said it was him that took it.</p>

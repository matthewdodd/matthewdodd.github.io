               <p>Mr. Skinner and Mr. Holloway both depos'd, That being present in Court at the above mentioned Trial, the Prisoner made Oath, that he had lived with Mrs. Pusey eight Months, and that during his Service there, he was paid his Wages by Mrs. Pusey, and that he never received any Wages or Money from Mr. Russel.</p>

             depos'd to the same Effect, and added, That the Prisoner was paid his Wages, Chariot Expences, as Mops and other Necessaries, by Mr. Russel, and that when the Prisoner was discharged from Mrs. Pusey's Service, which was in April 1721, she see Mr. Russel pay him Seven Pounds odd Money; and that the Prisoner John Brown, gave a Receipt for the same: But being call'd upon to produce that Receipt, she declared it could not be produced by them, because all the Vouchers were delivered up at the Time that the Accounts were settled and adjusted between Colonel Pusey and Mr. Russel,</p>

There was another Evidence, (tho' not quite so full) to the same Effect.</p>
               <p>The most material Circumstance in the Prisoner's Defence was, That the Receipt delivered up to Col.

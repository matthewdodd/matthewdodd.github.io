On the 5th of January, about twenty minutes to five o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner standing at the door, folding this coat up, which had been laying there all day; he put it under his arm, and ran down to the bottom of the market; I followed him to the corner of Sloane-street, calling Stop thief! I saw him take it from under his arm there, but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182401140044"></xptr>do not know what he did with it; he then stopped, and Treadaway caught him. He was never out of my sight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Had he not turned any corners - A. Yes; but I was not a yard behind him. The coat was found inside a garden gate, which he ran by. I could see his head all the way, but not the whole of his person. I said at first that I saw him give it to somebody, but was not quite sure of that. I never lost sight of him.</p>

I was running down Great George-street, heard a cry of Stop thief! and kept running; a man passed me, and I was stopped till the girl came up, and said she saw me give it to another person; and after it was found, she said she saw me throw it into the garden.</p>

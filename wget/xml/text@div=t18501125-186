                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 20, Tennison-street, York-road, in the parish of St. Mary, Lambeth. On Saturday night, 2nd Nov., I fastened my door at half-past nine o'clock—I sleep on the ground-Boor front—on Sunday morning, about half-past six, I heard some one come on the step of my door—a short time afterwards, I heard some one scrape their shoes, and put a key into the door, and not knowing the door was unbolted I felt no concern—I called my servant, heard another attempt, and heard the latch open, and a person walk in, and go up the hall towards the staircase—I went towards the stairs, and saw the shadow of some one about a yard and a half from the front parlour door—I called my servant again, very loudly, and the party turned round and went out, slamming the door—I cannot say who it was—I was agitated—there was no one but my servant and me in the house—the prisoner was afterwards brought back by a policeman—he is not a lodger of mine—I gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, L</hi> 65). I know the prisoner—I have seen him several times—on this Sunday morning I saw him start from home, in White-horse-street, New-cut, and followed him and another party to Stamford-street, Blackfriars-road—I saw him go to the door of No. 27 or 28 there, and fumble at the key-hole, and try to open it—he did not open it, and walked away, looking at all the doors till he got into Tennison-street, where I saw him go to Mrs. Duke's door, No. 20—he scraped his feet, stood for a minute or two at the door, while some parties were coming by, and after they had passed he opened the door, apparently with a key, and walked in—I ran down Sutton-street, and when I came back he had run out, and run to Commercial-road—he returned to the house again, but did not go in—he went up to the door, apparently to try it again, and then ran away again down the Belvidere-road, where I took him, and took him back to the house—Mrs. Duke sent her servant to the station-house with us, where I searched him, and found two keys on him, one of whichopens Mrs. Duke's door—I was forty yards from the house when I saw him go in, and I ran round Sutton-street, to get as near as I could without passing the door, as I was afraid it might be open—I left some one watching.</p>

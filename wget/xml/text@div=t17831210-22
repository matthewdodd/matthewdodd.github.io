               <p>I met the prisoner in Spitalfields parish, within a few hundred yards of where the lead was stolen, with a sack on his shoulder, on the 25th of October, about nine in the morning, I asked him what he had got there, he said some lead he had found that morning; I took him before the magistrate, and marked the lead.</p>

               <p>I went after the prisoner was in custody and searched his lodgings on the 24th of October, and I found concealed in a little back place adjoining the room where he lives, a parcel of old lead, I suppose about thirty or forty pounds weight, covered over with different cloths and rags, and I brought it away with me, and in his box I found a thing that the brewers use to pull out bungs with; this piece of lead has the letters on it.</p>
               <p>(The lead produced, being the same that was marked by Yardley.)</p>
               <p>Lefcure. My Lord, part of these premises have been in the possession of a brewer.</p>
               <p>Court. What may the value of that lead be? - Four or five shillings.</p>

               <p>I found these four pieces of lead in a sack standing against a door, and I kicked against them, and I thought I had a good right to go and sell them, Yardley met me and took me.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Was all the lead you found in a sack? - Yes, I took two pieces to sell, and left the other at home, I know nothing of their being covered over.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five Witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. You observe nobody has told us when this theft was actually committed, and nobody says the prisoner was seen actually on the premises, but the constable says he took him about two hundred yards from the house.</p>

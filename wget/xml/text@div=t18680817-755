                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman V</hi> 100). On the night of 29th July I was on duty in the Upper Richmond Road, about 12.30—my attention was attracted to Tynborough Lodge by a window opening—I went to the gate and tried to open it, but found it was resisted by someone—it was a high gate—when I got it open I found the female prisoner on the other side, holding it—the male prisoner was in the act of getting out of the window, and another man, not in custody, was standing on the area steps—the two men ran away—I ran after them, but could not overtake them—the woman went out of the front gate, and when I came back I took her about 200 yards from the place—I said I should take her for being on the premises of Mr. Cobbold, and she pretended to be very drunk—I asked her what business she had there, and she said she knew nothing of it, and offered me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to let her go—I had seen the male prisoner before that night, about half a mile from the place—I saw him eight days after at the Wands worth station—he was with five men, and I picked him out—I am sure he was out of the men—I ran about two or three hundred yards after the men, but I could not get over a hedge, and they got over and went down the embank<lb></lb>ment.</p>

I took the male prisoner into custody at the Striped Horse, Putney, about 3 o'clock on 30th July—I told him I should take him on suspicion of being in enclosed premises on Tuesday night, the 28th—he said, "I slept over at Kew Bridge; I was there about 11 o'clock—he asked me if I had seen his wife—I said, "No"—he said, "I have not seen her since 1 o'clock on Tuesday afternoon—I took him to the Wands worth station, and placed him with five men out of the street, and the constable picked him out—I took him in consequence of a description—I did not know him before.</p>

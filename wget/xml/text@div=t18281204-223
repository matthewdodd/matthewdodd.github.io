            . I am a partner in the firm of Eastman and Co. - there are two other partners; Hill was employed by Baily, a carman in our neighbourhood - Hill lived at No. 31, Paul-street, Finsbury, and Sherrin at No. 85, Paul-street, exactly opposite - our employ of Hill took up the whole of his time. In consequence of something Hill told me, I went to Sherrin's on the 11th of November, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, with Roberts the officer, and my partner Mr. Mayne; Sherrin was at home - on first going in I asked him if he knew a person named Hill; he hesitated for a second or two, and I think he said No, but I will not be certain as to that - I said,"Hill, over the way, at No. 31;" he then said Yes, he did; I asked if he bought any articles of him - he said he had; I asked what articles - he said ginger, cloves, mace, pepper, allspice, and juice, which is the name in the trade for Spanish liquorice - he said all that in answer to the first question, and said he believed he was buying them in a fair way, because they were wrapped up and made up in a tradesman like manner; I asked if he had invoices - he said he believed he had had invoices; I asked him to produce one - he said he could not put his hands upon them, or they might have been destroyed; I said it was a very untradesman-like way of taking in goods, and asked if the ginger I saw in a glass in the window was what he took in of Hill - he said, part of it; I then asked how much ginger he bought of him - he said three pounds; I said I thought the top of that glass was what he bought of Hill - the top part which I distinguished was near upon three pounds I think; I then asked if that was all he bought of Hill - his reply was Yes; I looked further into the window, and saw another glass containing about four pounds of ginger, corresponding with the top part of the other glass - I then asked where he got the bottom part of the first glass; he said he bought that of some person in St. Mary Axe, but would not tell me who - I said it looked very strange; I asked if he had any objection to shew me the other spices he bought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040110"></xptr>with the ginger, and he shewed me some cloves, mace, and pepper - I asked how much pepper he had bought of Hill; he said three pounds, but there was some in the drawer before - there was about three pounds and a half in the drawer which he shewed me; I asked if he had any more pepper - he said he had not a bit more pepper in the house; the officer then went behind the counter, and took a bag from under it, containing eleven pounds and a half of pepper - I knew the bag to be one of mine; the prisoner was very much agitated - the officer told him he had better shut up his shop, as he must go with him: he gave no account of how he got that eleven pounds and a half; I saw the cloves and mace - there was one pound of mace, one pound and three-quarters of cloves, and one pound and three-quarters of Spanish liquorice; the cloves and mace were in a drawer, the juice was in a glass - when the officer brought him out he wanted to go as far as Hoxton, but he was taken to the Compter: he said it was a bad job, and hoped I should not be hard with him, or words to that effect - I am sure that is the sense of the words he uttered; I had never in any way commissioned or authorised Hill to sell any goods for me at any time - the fair price in the market for ginger at that time was about 1s. 8d. I was selling to trademen for more than that in a wholesale way - I have stated the price of pepper at 1s. 3d., but it was worth 1s. 4d. to sell in like manner - cloves were worth 4s., mace about 8s., and juice about 1s. 2d.; Hill had one room only in the house where he lived - I cannot say whether I went up two flights of stairs or one, but there was no shop or any appearance of business; the price of nutmegs at that time was from 5s. 10d. to 6s. 2d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Had you known Sherrin before? A. No. It would not be easy to identify Spanish liquorice, cloves or mace; those things which I could not have identified he produced - he stated how Hill had introduced himself to him, and said he sold things upon commission; the money was to be paid to the persons for whom he sold, and he had 1d. or 2d. in the pound, as the thing might be - that Hill had represented to him that his employers would sell the articles as good and as cheap as he could get any where; 1s. 6d. would be a fair price for the pepper, and 3s. or 4s. for the cloves; I believe I was talking of one of his dealings with Hill, and he said, that at that time he bought 3lbs. of ginger - I then asked if he had bought any more; he denied buying any more: I am not going to swear to the ginger - he said he had not bought more than 3lbs. of pepper - that he had never bought more than 3lbs. of ginger of Hill; I have not the least doubt the pepper found in the bag was mine, but I cannot swear to it - the bag is here; I can swear to that: I cannot state that it was in my possession at the time it was stolen - I do not recollect his saying it was a had job for him to be taken into custody; I never said to him, "Don't be alarmed - you shall not be hurt," nor any thing to that effect; I made him no promise of any kind: I believe I did say, "We shall deal no harder with you than the case requires" - that was in answer to what he said; we were at that time conveying him to prison.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did Sherrin tell you the name of Hill's employer? A. No; he did not state he had ever asked him - he said he had dealt with him more than once, and had bought some nutmegs of him, but we did not find any - a man in business might have 1s. 6d. per lb. for such ginger as this; no man would have given 9s. per lb. for cloves - he might have given 9s. per 1b. for mace, but if the cloves and mace had been mixed in equal quantities, the value would have been reduced; he said he never bought but 3lbs. of pepper of Hill, that in the drawer was the article, and he had no more in the house - I was present when the bag of pepper was found under the counter; It was rather a concealed place, I should think: in going to the Compter he spoke first to me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Immediately before he said he had no more pepper in the house, had he said he had bought no more than 3lbs. of Hill? A. I believe he did - all our conversation, decidedly, related to what passed between him and Hill - I did not go behind the counter, but I understand there were many parcels: when this further quantity was found he did not say "I did not buy this of Hill"- I said I had no doubt it was mine; he did not say a word to that; I stated before the Magistrate that I told the prisoner I had no doubt the pepper in the bag was my property, and all the other articles.</p>

            . I am an officer of the Mansion-house. On the 11th of November I went with Mr. Eastman to Sherrin's shop; I went in with him, and Mr. Eastman asked him if he knew a person of the name of Hill-he said he did not; "What (says he) not Hill over the way?" Yes, he said, he did - Mr. Eastman then asked him if ever he bought any thing of Hill; Yes (he said) he had - Mr. Eastman said, "What might it be?" he said 3lbs. of ginger, and he pointed to a shew-glass which it was in - he then lifted the glass to the counter; it contained 9 1/2lbs. of ginger: he said, "The top part of it. 3lbs., is what I bought of Hill, and the remainder of a person in St. Maryaxe;" Mr. Eastman said "What price might you give for it?" he said, "A very good price;" Mr. Eastman said,"Did you have a bill with it?" he said Yes - Mr. Eastman said, "Could you produce the bill?" "No (he said) I cannot - I believe they are destroyed; I don't know what's become of them:" on looking round further Mr. Eastman saw another show-glass in the window, with 4lbs. of ginger in it - he said, "Halloo! there's some more of my ginger there," and then asked the prisoner if he bought any pepper - he said, "Yes, I bought 3lbs. of pepper of Hill:" we said, "Can you shew it?" "Yes (said be) I can," and produced a drawer with 3 1/2lbs. in it, and said,"There was a little before I put the 3lbs, in;" he was asked if he had any more pepper, and said, "No, I have no more in the house at all;" I then found a bag under the counter, with 11 1/2lbs. of pepper in it - there was a little bag of rice, and several other things there; I put the bag of pepper on the counter, and Mr. Eastman said,"That's my property - I can swear to it;" the prisoner made no reply whatever - some juice, mace, and cloves were produced; the prisoner said he bought the greater part of them of Hill - I told him he must shut up his shop and go with me, and I took him into custody.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were there any other persons in the shop? A. No - there was a young girl in the parlour adjoining, but he was the only person in the shop serving; I took him to the Compter, and he said to Mr. Eastman, "I hope, Sir, you will be as lenient as you possibly can, as I have given the best price for the goods;" Mr. Eastman said, "I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040111"></xptr>cannot answer any question whatever - you must go before the Magistrate."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You went to search the house? A. Yes; Mr. Eastman pointed out the shew-glass with the 4lbs. of ginger - the prisoner said he had bought 3lbs; I am quite certain he did not say ginger, cloves, mace, allspice, and juice - I recollect that I am upon my oath; he first said ginger, and afterwards he went on with the other things; in answer to the first question, whether he bought any thing of Hill, he said 3lbs. of ginger, and that was produced before he mentioned the others; he never said he had bought cloves, mace, allspice, and juice, till we found the other things; he never said, in answer to Mr. Eastman's general question, whether he had bought things of Hill; that he had bought ginger, pepper, allspice, mace, and juice: when Mr. Eastman saw the bag, he said "That is my property;" that was before it was opened, and of course what he spoke of related only to what he could see; I never heard Mr. Eastman say he would be as lenient as the case would allow - he did not tell him not to be alarmed.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. As soon as the bag was produced, Mr. Eastman said "That is my property?" A. Yes, it was opened, and there was pepper in it; the prisoner did not then say it was what he bought; the pepper is here, and the ginger, and other articles; the prisoner said he bought ginger, and he then stated the other articles; I have stated all that I heard pass in going to the Compter -the prisoner and I walked arm and arm, and I think I must have heard what passed.</p>
               <p>MR. EASTMAN. This bag contains 11lbs. of pepper - it is marked H. and Co. - that is not the mark of our firm, but I believe we bought all that were sold of them at the Victualling-office, Debtford- it is an unusual bag to send pepper out in; I would not have sent pepper out in it; I had never sold any thing to the prisoner - there are many different sorts of pepper - our shop has different; I do not, for a moment, suppose this was taken at one time; I have no doubt I have pepper of these different qualities - some of the ginger is mixed, and it is difficult to separate; I have selected a few pieces from that which was in the first glass, which decidedly corresponds with that in the second glass; we have often missed goods from our stock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. The bag is not proper to carry out pepper? A. Certainly not; I bought these bags with some others which were more serviceable. but these were of very little use - I might use them for wiping a lamp, or any other dirty purpose; we might have put ginger into them; the pepper is of different qualities - other persons who deal in pepper may have the same qualities; I believe an application was made for the prisoner to be bailed.</p>
               <p>An affidavit made by the prisoner, Sherrin, for the purpose of being admitted to bail, was read, in which he deposed that he had known Hill about four months, and about two months ago he called at the deponent's shop, and represented that he had these articles to dispose of for a respectable house with whom he then lived; in consequence of which, he ordered, at different times, 3lbs. of ginger, 3lbs. of pepper, 1lb. of cloves, and 1lb. of mace, which were brought in about a week; that he paid 1s. 6d. a 1b. for the pepper, and 9s. for the cloves and mace; and that upon the prosecutor calling, he related the whole transaction to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I must evidently be to blame, because I must have been misled by the man; he came to me, and told me he was commissioned to sell goods, and was alallowed 2d. in the pound - I gave him an order, not thinking I was doing wrong, and when I received the goods, I little thought any thing of the bill, as he said he was employed by the house - I considered that I was doing a fair and upright transaction; I had no reason to suppose any thing else; if I had, I should not have done it; I have been seventeen years in the house.</p>

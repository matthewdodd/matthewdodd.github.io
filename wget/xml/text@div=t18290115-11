On the 18th of December, about eleven o'clock in the morning, we had three chests of tea corded up in our warehouse, for delivery - the counting-house is parted from the warehouse by a glass door; I could not see into that part of the warehouse from where I sat - I was writing, alone, in the counting-house and heard a chest of tea being moved by the door- knowing none of the porters were at work, I just opened the counting-house door, and saw a man, whom I believe to be the prisoner; his face was towards me, but I am near-sighted - he had on a blue coat, with metal buttons, also a blue waistcoat and trousers; he was about the prisoner's height: I do not swear to him, but believe him to be the man - I cried Stop thief! he immediately ran off towards Borer's-buildings; he had nothing when he ran, but before he ran he was in the act of disengaging himself from the chest of tea - he had got it out of the warehouse on to the first step, in the street, and on my crying out, disengaged himself from it; the chest had been on the top of two others - he dropped it immediately I opened the counting-house door; having nobody in the counting-house I did not like to leave the premises, and did not pursue; I found the chest on the steps - there were 80 lbs. of tea in it, worth 20l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.How many partners have you? A. Only one; the person was about three yards from me - he went off a few seconds after I opened the door; our warehouse is part of the dwelling-house.</p>

            . I am beadle of Devonshire-square. On Thursday morning, the 18th of December, I was on duty in a watch-box in the square; the box commands a view of the prosecutor's premises - about eleven o'clock I saw the prisoner and two others walking to and fro; the reason I noticed the prisoner was that he came to my box door, and hallooed out, "Jack, Jack" - I looked out of the window, and saw one of his companions walking round the square; I suppose he came there to see how far my window commands a view of the square - I could see the prosecutor's door from the box; they passed to and fro - the prisoner gave his umbrella into the hands of one of his companions under the archway; he then crossed towards me, and then took a circuit to Mr. Otley's door, walked up the steps into Mr. Otley's warehouse, and laid hold of the tea-chest - it was too heavy for him, as I suppose; he laid hold of it, and at that moment Mr. Wormald opened the counting-house door: I saw him clap his hands on the tea-chest, which was within the door - the door was open, and I could see the chest: in order to have a better view of him, I drew back the slide of my window, and when I again looked he was in the act of dropping the tea, and Mr. Wormald was at the door; the prisoner ran away - Mr. Wormald called Stop thief! I opened my box-door, with a little difficulty, to run round under the archway, which leads into Borer's-buildings and Still-alley - I went another way, and met him and his two associates in Borer's-buildings, within three or four minutes of my seeing him run from the door, and am positive of him, and his companions also; I went up, collared him. and said, "You are my prisoner;" I had no sooner said that than the other two attacked me, cut my cheek, and bruised my head - the man who had received the umbrella from him knocked me about my head and legs, and then they dragged me into Cutler-street, and rolled me into the kennel; I was a good deal ill-used, and the prisoner struck me several times with one hand, which he had at liberty, but I never let go my hold of him - assistance came, and the others got away.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you known the prisoner before? A. Not the prisoner - I lost sight of him for about four minutes, as I went round to meet him; it was about seven minutes from the time the umbrella was changed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150010"></xptr>till he ran away - I was not struck till I seized him; I told him what I charged him with - I will not say that was before I was attacked, for the attack was almost directly; I think I should know one of the other men again - my attention was directed to him also; the warehouse is twenty or thirty yards from my box - what I saw was through my window, which is about a foot and a half long, and a foot broad.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. From the time you saw him till the chest was taken were you watching them? A. Yes- I observed the prisoner particularly, and am certain he is the man who went into the warehouse and took the tea.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The street-keeper says he was not more than four minutes going four hundred yards - that is the distance he went, and I was taken not fifty yards from the prosecutor's.</p>
               <p>Three witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

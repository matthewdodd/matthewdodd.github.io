             sworn. - On the 10th of November I came to London to receive my wages at Somerset-house; my father lives at Finchley; I received my wages, and was going home down Gray's-Inn-lane, when I met a boy, who asked me what ship I belonged to; I told him none; he asked me what ship I was last on board of; I told him the Irresistible; he asked me where I was going; I told him to Finchley; he said, he was going my way, and would walk part of the way with me; going past the Pea-hen, he asked me to go in several times to drink; I had never been there before; at last I did go in, and then came in the prisoner Bowers and a parcel more people with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Which is Bowers? - A. The further one; and as soon as I went in, the boy rose up from the box I was sitting in, and said he has got a watch; he has got a watch; he said that to the peopel that came in; with that they all sat down, and Bowers next to me, and Serjeant next to him; they asked me several questions what ship I belonged to, and I told them; they said, they knew the ship very well; I had never seen any of them before to my knowledge; I saw Serjeant's left hand coming round Bowers, and as soon as he saw that I saw his hand, he snatched his hand away; I thought he intended to rob me; I afterward, found I was mistaken; I rose up then, and bid them all good bye; I told them I lived at Finchley, that I had a great way to go, and bid them good bye; Bowers said, what hurty are you in? I was getting out of the box across the vaule, and directly I rose up, Bowers made a snatch at the watch-chain; he could not get it out; it was quite tight in; he could not get it out the first pull, nor the second; then he dragged me out of the box; I kept fast hold with my left hand of his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180112020051"></xptr>collar, and with my right hand I took the banknotes I had received out of my waistcoat-pocket, and put them in my bosom; then he got the watch in his hand, and the chain was hanging down; he dragged it out, and got it from me; I made a snatch at the chain, and, after some trying to get it, the chain broke from the watch, and fell upon the ground; I immediately sung out, he has got my watch, he has got my watch; he then ran out, and three or four people absconded the house; one of them had the watch; I have never seen my watch since; it was worth five pounds.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. (Counsel for Serjeant.) Q. Have you not said, that Serjeant's putting his hand round Bowers, was to give him an intimation to put him upon his guard? - A. I thogut so.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that either of the prisoner? - A. No; soon after that there came in several more, they sat down in the box on the right hand side; Gale came into the box first, and they sat down to the right hand in the same box.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they close to him? - A. No, they were two or three off him; Bowers was next to him; Serjeant sat next but one to Bowers.</p>
               <p>Q. Next to Bowers? - A. No, they did not sit on the same side of the prosecutor.</p>

               <p>Snosell. If you refer to the first examination before the Justice, you will find what I say to be true.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Indeed, Sir, you are mistaken, I have the information, and the information is exactly as that boy has now represented it? - A. It was so, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. I should rather believe him than yougo on, Sir.</p>
               <p>Snosell. Then one of them called for a pot of purl; they drank part of it, and I then went towards the bar; one of them holloaed out they wanted a quartern of gin put into it and a pennyworth of sugar; I put a quartern of gin and a pennyworth of sugar into it; I asked them who was to pay me for it; Serjeant paid a pot towards the reckoning.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know Serjeant before? - A. Yes, and another paid a pot.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that other? - A. I don't know; it was ne'er a one that is here present; then I asked them who was to pay the other pint; at first there was no answer; then one of them made answer, and said, the sailor was to pay the pint; I asked him for it, and he said he did not see what business he had to pay; then I said, I suppose I shall have it of some of you; upon saying that, Gale started up to go away; he said he had got to go as far as Finchley, and he could not stop; what is your hurry, says Bowers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see Bowers before? - A. I had seen him once before that morning, but never before; Bowers said, what is your hurry? clapped his hand to his breast, and pushed him down in the box again; he statred up again, and said, he must go, he had so far to go, he got up to attempt to get over the table; Bowers rose up, and laid Hold of his watch-chain, and, I believe, with the hustle and his getting out of the box over the table, the watch came out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Who got over the table? - A. Gale; the prisoner Bowers then had it in his hand; I laid hold of him with both my hands, and collared him, and said, give the young man his watch again; he made me no reply; I kept him in hold, and one side of his waistcoat gave way; I then took the opposite side, and tried to get the watch out of his hand; he then stretched his hand out rather farther than my reach was, and he gave it to some one behind, and two or three then ran out at the door together; I then still held him in custody; upon that, there was a person lodged in our house, who had been a publican, came in; I commanded him to aid and assist; he then laid hold of him from me; I then told him to hold him while I went for an officer; I ran out directly to look for an officer, and I met one coming down Tash-street,

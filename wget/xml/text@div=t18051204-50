             sworn. (Examined by Mr. Alley). Q. Were you surveyor of the church of Whitechapel? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you employed to survey the lead-work<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180512040066"></xptr>of that church? A. I was; it is as far back as the month of May last.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose did you survey it? A. For the purpose of ascertaining the amount of the expence of repairing the church.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me whether you was able to make any fair calculation for the expence of the lead of that church? A. I calculated the old lead at 14 ton.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the church to undergo a repair? A. The church was to undergo a thorough repair.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was to do the lead work of it? A. Mr. Noble, the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you superintend the stripping off the lead from the church? A. It was done under my directions. Mr. Crosskey was the person appointed by me to see the lead taken off.</p>
               <p>Q. When the lead was taken off from the church, where was it deposited? A. In a closet in the church porch.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts is that closet? A. Under the south-west gallery stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was to keep the key of that closet after the lead was deposited there? A. Crosskey.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any other person entrusted with the key but Crosskey? A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that you know Noble was employed to do the lead work: was he to have the old lead? A. He was to have all the old lead; but there was no specific agreement in the contract when he was to have this old lead.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see this executed? (A paper handed to the witness). A. That is my writing. I saw this contract executed.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Did you see the execution of that with the other party. A. I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. With what other party? Mr. Alley, A. On the part of the contractors and the other party.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Best. Just read that part whether he was to have the old lead, and how he was to have it.</p>
               <p>(That part of the contract read in Court). All the old lead and new lead which may be taken out or brought in shall be weighed in the presence of the surveyor, or any other person to be appointed for that purpose; he shall regularly take an account of the same. No lead shall be taken out of the premises, nor any lead brought in, but what has been previously weighed and the account taken by the surveyor, under any pretence whatever.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. (to Sadler). Was it permitted to Noble to take any lead otherwise than in that contract? A. It never was.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as to describe the manner under the contract in which it was taken away? A. The lead was generally taken out of this closet under the south-west staircase, and put into the scales in my presence and weighed, and in the presence of Noble also. When it was weighed, it was taken out of the scale and shot into the porch, and taken away by Mr. Noble immediately in a truck.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not left on the premises for Mr. Noble to come and take it away afterwards? A. It was not in any instance that I recollect. It was taken away through the west gate of the church-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Noble render to you any account after the lead was taken away from the church? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Just show the account. A. This is it, (producing it).</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Best. Q. Is that the original account? A. It is the original account in his own hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Did he deliver it to you? A. He delivered it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us the quantity of old lead which Mr. Noble gives credit to? A. Two hundred one ton weight and twenty-five pounds; but there is a mistake in that account of twenty-five pounds, which Mr. Noble readily admitted, which made it altogether two hundred one ton weight one quarter and seventeen pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. On looking on that account are you satisfied that that was all the quantity of lead that was on that church? A. I am not satisfied that it was all the lead: It was all the lead that was weighed. I stated the deficiency at that period. I was satisfied at that period that there was a deficiency of three or four tons of old lead.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it that you made your calculation of the lead upon the church? A. By admeasurement, upon an average, the old lead at seven pound a foot. I was satisfied that the lead weighed heavier upon an average. On cutting a foot from some parts of it, I was clearly convinced that the lead weighed heavier than seven pound a foot; some pieces weighed as high as eight pound a foot.</p>
               <p>Q. So that when you take it at seven pound a foot you are satisfied that two foot must be fourteen pound? A. I was.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the difference between the account that he gave and your calculation? A. The difference between Mr. Noble's account and my calculation, I perceived there was a deficiency of between three and four ton, putting it in a fair calculation.</p>
               <p>Q. The lead that was stripped off was replaced by new lead? A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take the weight of the new lead? A. Generally. The weight of the new lead<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180512040067"></xptr>used about the church was of different weights: that weight generally run about seven or eight pound a foot: some was more and some less, taking the whole upon an average: the hips and ridges were less.</p>
               <p>Q. Having made a calculation of the old and new lead, do you think the weight of the old lead would have been sufficient for the new lead? A. I do not, because there were several places covered with new lead which were never covered before.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think that additional weight would be? A. The additional lead would have been about two ton: I do not take upon me to state accurately.</p>
               <p>Q. How much new lead was charged in addition by the prisoner? A. I cannot take upon me to say what quantity is charged for the extra work: it is all charged together in the gross sum along with the other lead.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How many tons in all of new lead are charged by Mr. Noble the prisoner? A. Sixteen tons seven hundred and twenty-seven pound weight. On the 12th of September the deficiency missing of the old lead must be upon the most moderate calculation between three and four tons.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant Best.</p>
               <p>Q. All this deficiency depends upon the accuracy of your calculation and your judgement entirely? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you call yourself a surveyor? A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been a surveyer. A. I cannot take upon me to say the number of years.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ever surveyor before this job? A. I never measured a church before in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a carpenter? A. I am by profession.</p>
               <p>Q. Your father is one of the church-wardens of this parish? A. He is.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that you have very properly told us that you never measured a church before in your life? A. I never measured the bulk of a church for the brick work and all the work of that church.</p>

               <p>Q. From that argument did you ever measure a chuch before? A. Never before. This I measured myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Talking to a man who understands figures, the least mistake in a figure will make all the difference? A. There is no doubt of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether Mr. Noble was the first contractor - I believe there were two persons of the name of Brown and Lewington, who had first contracted for that work? A. They were the first contractors of this work. They gave up this job: they would not comply with one of the conditions.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Lewington and Brown begin the work? A. They did do a part of the work, but not in the contract.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not they strip lead? A. They did not strip lead to my knowledge: they were stopping holes principally.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath were not they employed about the lead work of this church? A. They were employed about the lead work of the steeple, but that had nothing to do with the contract.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make one contract for the steeple and another for the church? Was it not a part of the lead work of the church that Lewington and Brown did? A. Their work was stopping holes in the turret.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not the lead of the steeple part of that contract? A. A part of the lead of the steeple is in that contract, but not that part of the lead which Lewington and Brown were performing.</p>
               <p>Q. While these men were employed about the steeple, they had access to the steeple of the church I take it for granted? A. There is not the least doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not with them the whole time? A. Nor a quarter of the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor with Noble's men the whole time? You have a vast number of occupations to attend to: of course you come now and then? A. Of course.</p>
               <p>Q. They were unwatched by you? A. I was not placed there as a watchman: there was a person employed by me to watch them, and to superintend over them?</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever occasion, in the course of your life, to make a calculation of this sort before for the roof of a church? A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not watch Noble's men yourself? A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How many men had Noble employed about the church? A. I believe generally from two to three or four men.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not watch them: you knew that Noble was not constantly with them? A. He should have been there frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. He was a man of considerable business, was he not? A. I cannot take upon me to say what business he has to do in Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q. You weighed this lead: you have told us that the highest was eight pound a foot the old lead? A. To the best of my recollection that was the highest that I ever recollect weighing. I did not take minutes at the time of weighing this lead, consequently I take it from my recollection only.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180512040068"></xptr>Q. You made no minutes at the time: was not there some so low as five pound a foot? A. Upon my oath, no: I do not recollect there was any so low.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the lowest? A. I cannot take upon me to say what was the lowest: I have weighed none, to my knowledge, under seven pound.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear there was none under seven? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor under six? A. I never have weighed any, to my recollection, lower than seven pound.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a great deal of dirt upon the lead? A. Yes, but there was an allowance for this dirt: the dirt was generally swept off by the plumber previous to the weighing.</p>
               <p>Q. I have no doubt but you in your judgement think that there was an allowance? A. Upon my judgement I formed opinion that four pounds was sufficient allowance for the dirt: it was a provision in the contract.</p>
               <p>Q. As it was a matter of judgement, was not there a great deal more done by Mr. Noble than was in the old contract? A. There was about two ton, including this account, on the 12th of September.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. There was a great deal more done than was covered with old lead before? A. There was a great deal more covered with new lead than was covered with old lead before: there were five large dormars that were covered with new lead, that was not covered before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Best. Q. In the first place, will you take upon you to say that these five large dormars did not require two tons? A. I will take upon me to swear, from the best calculations that I could make, that the five dormars did not take above two tons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you measure them? A. I measured them as near as I could get at them: the tiling stood upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not make an accurate admeasurement? A. I could not make an accurate admeasurement.</p>
               <p>Q. Must it not depend in a great measure upon guess? A. Of course, if it is not an accurate admeasurement it must be part guess.</p>
               <p>Q. There were four large gables: what were they? A. They were gables running up in the form of an A: the same as putting up rafters together.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of measuring them accurately? A. I measured them as accurate as I could standing on the roof.</p>
               <p>Q. Then that is a rough calculation? A. I do not say it is an accurate calculation.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, with respect to the gutters: the lead upon some of the gutters was considerably-wider than it was before? A. In some places wider, and in some places narrower.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, as you go upon averages, whether you can take upon you to swear that in the whole there was not, upon an average, in the new ones, more than a foot wider? A. There were four short new gutters, which laid up against these gables: the lead was put a foot wider, perhaps less than a foot; I will not say a foot; and the remainder of the gutters ran narrower than they were before: generally speaking, they were narrower than they were before.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I perceive you do not understand my question: my question is, whether, taking the whole together, upon an average, it was not wider than before? A. I do not take upon me to say, upon an average of the gutters, one way or the other; but, generally speaking, some were narrower and some were wider.</p>
               <p>Q. Taking them together, were they not altogether wider than they were before? A. I do not conceive that they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear that they were not? A. I am now stating to the best of my judgement; there is no man's judgement but what may be erroneous.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, the mode and manner in which you ascertained the quantity of lead used for the whole church is by the admeasurement? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you measure the whole church? A. I could measure the best part of the church; that is, so far as the gables: I could not have measured the gables unless I had applied the ladder.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apply the ladder? A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then is not a part of it guess-work? A. I measured every part of the church that I could get at.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible to get at the whole? A. It was possible to get at the whole.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you do it? A. It was possible.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or did you not get at the whole of the lead, so as to measure it? A. The whole of the lead was to be seen: consequently I could get at it.</p>
               <p>Q. Good God, if the whole was to be seen, did you do it? A. I did not: I could not get at it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you measure the whole of the lead? A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You measured the whole of the lead, though there were parts that you could not get at without a ladder, and you did not have a ladder: is not the admeasurement of the whole church, from your calculation, founded upon supposed accurate admeasurement of the church, or did an accurate admeasurement take place?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180512040069"></xptr>- A. It did.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you measure it? - A. I measured it with a five-foot rod.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say every inch of it? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how came you to answer in the way that you have answered; did you measure the whole? - A. I mean to say that I could not measure it accurately, as many parts were covered with tiles. I could form an opinion.</p>
               <p>Q. I am not blaming you; you recollect that it is swearing where a man's life is concerned. Did you admeasure the whole length of the church that was covered with lead? - A. I measured it as accurately as the state of the church would admit.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the state of the church permit you to measure it accurately? - A. It did not: it was in many parts covered with tiles; when I stated to the quantity from three to four tons, it might be something more or less than the deficiency of three or four tons.</p>
               <p>Q. The work of Lewington and Brown was not in your calculation? - A. It was not: that was stopping of holes.</p>
               <p>Q. That was in no calculation of the lead work, neither new nor old? - A. It was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Lewington and Brown take any lead from the church? - A. They did not, as I know of; they had no authority at all to take it away.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you this: was any lead taken off from the church before the prisoner Noble was employed to do the work? - A. None: after he was employed, Lewington and Brown's men never came there at all; not to my knowledge, after Noble took the contract.</p>
               <p>Q. You told my Lord that there were some places covered with lead that were not covered before, and you make it two tons to cover that place? - A. Yes; that was so, according to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. There were some places, a few inches, that you could not get at; have you made any allowance for that? - A. I will not take upon me to say what allowance I have made; I did it to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any allowance beyond your actual admeasurement? - A. I did; beyond the covering of the clock-case to the steeple, for which I could not get at.</p>
               <p>- CROSSKEY sworn. Examined by Mr. Pooley. Q. You are a clerk under Mr. Sadler? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you there at the time when Mr. Noble first began the work of taking off the lead? - A. I was there at the first beginning of it.</p>
               <p>Q. From what part of the church did he or his men take off the lead? - A. From the south-west gutter.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the first lead that was taken up any part in which Noble and his men were working, and you were not present? was there any lead taken from that gutter in your absence? - A. Not from that gutter; there was some taken up in the middle gutter, north-west, and the valley gutter, north-east; no other part that ever I missed but was taken up when I was present.</p>

               <p>Q. When was it that you missed that? - A. As to the day I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it before Mr. Noble and his men began to work? - A. No; afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Then before Mr. Noble and his men began working, did you miss any lead from the premises? - A. No, none.</p>
               <p>Q. Before Noble and his men began working, was the whole roof covered with lead? - A. Yes, before they began.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the two places that you have just mentioned were taken off after they began; were you present when they began and after constantly? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. As the lead was taken from the roof of the church, where was it put? - A. It was chucked down in the church-yard, and carried by Mr. Noble's men and deposited in the closet under the south-west stair-case of the church.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after they had done cutting it off, and they had thrown it in the church-yard, was it put in the porch? - A. Immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. That is, before they went away? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the key of that closet? - A. I had myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you keep that closet locked of a night? - A. Always.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he ever permitted to take any of the lead before it was weighed? - A. Never to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. If any lead had been taken out of the porch and delivered to him not weighed, must it not have been done without your having been privy? - A. Without my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Q. At what time of the morning was it usual to deliver the lead to him. Did you ever weigh any to him before six o'clock in the morning? - A. No, nor after six at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it weighed in Noble's presence? - A. It was weighed in his presence and in the surveyor's presence.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180512040070"></xptr>Q. That is, the last witness Mr. Sadler? - A. Yes, and in my presence.</p>

               <p>Q. When it was put in the truck which way did they carry it our from the church? - A. Out of the West entrance gate that leads into Church-lane, nearly opposite to High street, Whitechapel.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know whether any lead of that description, after it was weighed, was ever carried to Rayden's house? - A. Not to my knowledge, it was always carried out of the West gate.</p>
               <p>Q. You can tell us whether Rayden is the sexton of the parish? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many doors are there to the church? - A. There is a West entrance door, a South door, a door leading out of the back East and West, and two doors in the North front.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the keys of those doors? - A. The North door had a key, and the West entrance door had a key, the East door in the back of the church had a key likewise, and the other two doors had bolts.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that those doors that had a key that they might be entered on the outside with a key? - A. Yes with a key.</p>

               <p>Q. Could any person, having the key of the porch, on their coming into the porch, open that closet door? - A. Not without it was forced.</p>
               <p>Q. The keys that Rayden had in his possession, could he get into that part of the church where the lead was? - A. Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Q. How were the gates of the church-yard at the time that you left off work? - A. At times they were locked, and at times they were not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any communication from Rayden's house into the church-yard? - A. The back door of his house came into the church-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time weigh any of the old lead which was taken off the top of the church to ascertain how many pound there was in a foot? - A. I saw one foot weighed, which weighed ten pound.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to weigh that single foot? - A. Mr. Noble cut it out to ascertain the weight of it, because we found it very thick.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been employed about buildings? - A. I am a carpenter.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you form any opinion how much a foot the lead would weigh upon an average? - A. Upon an average I look upon it the lead would weigh seven pounds a foot, or near eight.</p>
               <p>Q. From what you saw, and you saw some part of it that weighed ten pound, some was thick and some was thinner; putting together that which was thick and that which was thin, you take it upon an average it weighed between seven and eight pound a foot; upon your oath do you believe that? - A. Upon my oath I believe that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever make any observations upon the door that is in the porch on the 22d? - A. I took notice in particular of the cupboard door.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you take the lead off the church? - A. This is a memorandum that I kept of the work while it was going on. On the 11th of July I delivered old lead to Mr. Noble, thirty-eight hundred, two quarters, nineteen pound gross; that was the first lead that was delivered.</p>
               <p>Q. Up to the 22nd of July did you continue to take off old lead? - A. We continued to take off old lead frequently in the same manner.</p>
               <p>Q. There was mortar sticking to this lead for which there was an allowance? - A. For which we took off four pounds to the hundred for the dirt.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore the less dirt there was on, the better the purchase would be; did they in general when they were taking it off sweep it clean? - A. Not always, when we were taking the gutters up there was a great deal of wet; we could not take the mortar off; if we used the broom some would stick.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did young Rayden live? - A. Along with his father.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he live along with his father in the month of July? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this church-yard a thoroughfare? - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not Sexton yet of Whitechapel? - A. I do not put myself up a candidate for it.</p>

               <p>Q. Neither on the roof or steeple, or any part? - A. They did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor Mr. Wildman? - A. Mr. Wildman's men were stopping some creeks on the turret, while I was at work there.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Mr. Wildman? - A. A plumber down the road.</p>

               <p>Q. How many men were employed there then? - A. Two.</p>
               <p>Q. How many men were employed after Mr. Noble had the contract? - A. Sometimes two, sometimes three, and sometimes four.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose Mr. Noble's duty would not call him there the whole day? - A. He was generally there most part of the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Not the whole time, of course? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. There was lead missed, that was not contained in the closet? - A. There was none missed but what I mentioned out of the gutter, that was after Mr. Noble's men began the work.</p>
               <p>Q. That was never carried to the closet? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity was that in the middle gutter North-West? - A. There was about fifty pounds missing. The valley gutter, North East, there was about forty pound likewise missed, which was never carried to the closet. The front gate was sometimes unlocked; I spoke to Mr. Rayden about it, he said, never mind it, the watchman will soon be on.</p>

               <p>Q. On the morning of the 23d of July did you happen to get up very early? - A. Yes, between four and five o'clock, I looked out of my window, and I saw a man run from Spread Eagle Alley to Rayden's house, he stopped there for a few minutes; I thought he was trying Mr. Rayden's window shutters.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that did you continue to look? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards discover who that man was? - A. Yes, I saw it was Mr. Noble; I then saw a boy with a truck turn by Mr. Barkin's house, which is the corner house, and stop at Mr. Rayden's house; I again saw Mr. Noble load his truck with lead out of Rayden's house.</p>

               <p>Q. In the passage of the truck from Mr. Rayden's house to Mr. Noble's, how near did it come to your house? - A. Right opposite.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you then discover what sort of lead it was? - A. It was old flatted lead; the truck returned back again to Rayden's; the boy returned with it to his father, and with the assistance of his father, he put it in the church-yard against the watchhouse. I then saw Mr. Rayden come out with a birch broom and sweep the mortar and the dirt right across the road, right opposite our house; he was at his own door; he swept it right across to the corner of Spread Eagle Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a fine morning or a wet morning? - A. A fine morning, the road was clean.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you ever examined before this? - A. I was examined before the magistrate about a fortnight or three weeks ago; I was examined at the vestry I believe about two months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. After you were examined about it in the vestry in September, Mr. Noble went on and finished his job, and Mr. Rayden continued to live in the house? - A. I believe they did.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw Mr. Noble occasionally after it? - A. I did.</p>

I have nothing more to say than Mr. Rayden told me that he had a cistern and a sink to dispose of, which I bought and gave a fair price for, and some leaden pipes which he said was his property, and I thought it was at the time, or else I should not have bought it.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Serjeant Best. Q. What are you? - A. I am a school-master; I live at Whitechapel school-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time, and when, sell any lead to the prisoner Rayden? - A. I sold a cistern.</p>
               <p>Q. And any pipe? - A. I cannot answer to a pipe; there was a waste pipe that carried the water away.</p>
               <p>Q. It was old lead? - A. It was; I sold it him five years last March, it was delivered to him with some other fixtures.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a fixture in the house, was it? - A. It was.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Pooley.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the size of the cistern? - A. It stood in an angle at the corner as you went in, it was in a wooden frame; a dentist had it fixed there for the purpose of washing hands after people had their teeth drawn, it held about four or five pails of water.</p>

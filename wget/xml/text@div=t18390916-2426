                  </hi>. I am footman to Allen Williams, and live in St. Thomas's-street, Southwark. On the 8th of September I was at the Roman Catholic chapel in Moorfields—I felt my pocket drop, turned round, and found my handkerchief gone—I saw the prisoner going away from me—I collared him, and he threw my handkerchief away—I gave him in charge of the beadle of the chapel—the prisoner was inside the chapel—when we got outside I asked him to own the truth, whether he took it or not—he said, "If you will forgive me I will own it, I did take it"—I told him I did not wish to prosecute him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of Finsbury Circus. I am on duty every Sunday at the chapel, and was there on this occasion—I saw the prisoner brought out by the prosecutor and another person, and the hand kerchief was dropped between the two—I cannot tell which dropped it—</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">looking at his deposition</hi>)—this is my handwriting—It was read over to me before I signed it—I do not know whether the strange man or the boy dropped it—I laid hold of the boy because I was told he was the thief—that is what I said at the office—I cannot say who dropped it because there was a gang of persons about—I do not know who the other person was who was going out with the prisoner—he had the prisoner in charge—for what I can tell it might have been the strange man who got away that dropped it—(<hi rend="italic">The witness's deposition being read, stated, "I saw the prisoner drop the handkerchief—I picked it up, and I produce it</hi>")—I deny those words—I said "Between the prisoner and the other man"—It was read over, bat I never suspected such words as those were put down.</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker, on the 10th of December, the prisoner brought those goods, which I now have here, he pledged them for four shillings and sixpence, I did not ask him whose they were, I am positive it was the prisoner, I never saw him before, it was in the middle of the day.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I carried the things three or four different times, and pawned them; the gentleman <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140032"></xptr>that I worked with had taken my wages, and carried into Yorkshire, and I had almost broke my thighs, and the men told me, if he had served them so, they should have been glad to make a shilling.</p>
               <p>(The things deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Where did you go to? - I went to Westmorland.</p>
               <p>Did you owe him something at that time? - I owed him eight shillings, but I agreed with Mr. Fox, with whom he was to work, for fourteen shillings a week, and Fox was to receive sixteen shillings instead of fourteen, and we were to settle it when I came back, instead of that I was six weeks gone.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. In the room of giving me fourteen shillings, he gave me five shillings and promised to give me the remainder and did not: I told the pawnbroker, that as soon as ever the man I worked for returned I would fetch the things, and as to the plow, it was in the shop when he returned, and I only took the things for money to keep me, and the foreman and the men said, if he had gone away with their money in that manner; they said they would have taken three or four of his things.</p>
               <p>Court to Marshall. How came you to know that these things were at the pawnbroker's? - He told me of it.</p>
               <p>Court. He was in distress and he pawned them, and you owed owed him money; this seems to be a very hard prosecution, and he acknowledges he pawned them through necessity.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. When I asked him about them he abused me very much.</p>
               <p>Court. Did any accident happen to him that you know? - None at all that I know of.</p>

               <p>The prisoner worked for me up and down for these ten years; I have known him these fourteen years; he worked for me before he came to Mr. Marshall; he always bore a very good character; I never knew any thing amiss of him.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. I will leave it to you, whether this was a felonious taking or no, it seems to be a very hard prosecution; you see the man went away in debt to his journeyman, a man of very good character.</p>
               <p>Jury to Webb. Did you ever hear that he used to pawn his own tools, or other peoples tools? - He never pawned any tools of mine, he might pawn his own.</p>
               <p>Jury to the Pawnkroker. Did he tell you that on his master's return he would fetch them out? - Yes.</p>

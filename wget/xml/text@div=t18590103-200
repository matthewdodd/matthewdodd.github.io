                  </hi>. I am in the Royal Artillery stationed at Woolwich—the prisoner was a recruit—he occupied the same room as myself in Woolwich barracks—on the morning of the 21st September, I received a letter at the barracks which was read aloud to me by my serjeant—the prisoner was present at the time—the letter contained an order for ten shillings on the post-office at Woolwich, the serjeant also read that to me in the prisoner's presence—I put the letter and the order in my bed while I went to drill about 12 o'clock—I returned in about half an hour or an hour, and found the order was gone—I told the serjeant and he took me to the post-office to stop it—as we went to the post-office, we met the prisoner—I cannot read, this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) resembles the order.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He stated in the depositions that he returned at half-past 12, and I can safely say that he never came back till after 2. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I cannot be sure about the time I came back—I gave the letter and order to two men in the room, the sergeant was present at the time—I had it back from them, and put it under my bed before I went to drill.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to the Woolwich post-office, On the 21st December, a person came to me with this order—I believe the prisoner to be the man—I have no doubt by his general appearance of his being the person—it had the signature of John Hinds to it at the time—I believe I asked him who it was from, as is general in the office, and then I paid him the ten shillings—the last witness came to the office about fifteen minutes after I had paid it—I saw the prisoner again about an hour afterwards, when the sergeant brought him down with the last witness, and I identified him as the person—I was asked if he was the person, I did not pick him out from others.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a beer retailer, and live at 54, Old Nicholl Street, Shoreditch—I have a son who goes by the name of Thomas Burton—he is now a prisoner undergoing sentence—on Friday evening, 8th November, about twenty minutes to seven, the prisoner came to my house—I did not know him before—he sat down and said he had come from my son, and asked me for five half-sovereigns, that they were to be tied up in thread, so that they should not rattle when he gave them to him—he said it would be a benefit to my son—he told me he was a warder in the prison where my son was—he did not give me any paper on that occasion—I told him I had no money—I gave him a half-sovereign on that night, and told him if he came on the Sunday I would try and get him the other 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. up—when he was going he asked me to go outside and look about to see that there were no police about, that they should not see him come out of the house—I did so, and told him there was nobody about, and he went out and went up the street, taking the half-sovereign with him—he came again on Sunday evening the 10th for the remainder of the money—I told him I had no more money that night, but if he came on the Monday night I would give it him—I asked him if he gave my son anything out of the money I had given him, and he said he had got him a little wine, and something to sleep him at night—he said he would give him something to drink on the Sunday night—he did not say what—he told me the same as he did on the Friday, to go and look if there was anybody about—I did so, and he left—he came again on the Monday night and asked if I was ready with the remainder of the money—I said, "Yes, my wife has got it," and she gave him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver—I asked him how long the money would last, and he said it would last my son three months—he had a glass of ale and left—I went out as usual to see that there was no police about—he bade me good-bye and said he would send me a letter—on the afternoon of the 18th November from what I heard I went to the House of Correction—I was there shown a number of the prison warders—I picked the prisoner out, and afterwards gave him into custody for stealing the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., by order of the governor of the place; he wished me to give him in charge, and I did so—when he came on the Monday night he brought me a slip of paper from my son—I read a little of it—I think it was my son's writing, but it was written in black-lead pencil, and I could not tell his writing in pencil so well as with a pen—I destroyed that paper; in fact, we destroyed them all, because we were frightened to have them in the place—I am sure it is destroyed—I have looked for it—I have not seen it since that night—he gave it me from his pocket—it was not sealed up—it was put on the table.</p>

I am the son of James Howard—I was convicted at the Middlesex Sessions on the 5th November—after my sen<lb></lb>tence I was taken to the House of Correction—the prisoner was an officer there, doing duty—he had charge of that part of the prison where I was at work—he spoke to me on one occasion—he wrote me a piece of paper—I tore it up after reading it—the writing on it was, "Is your name Bur<lb></lb>ton,</p>

               <p>and are you the man that was tried at the Sessions for the Great Eastern affair?"—I went to the closet to read it—I could not read it on the wheel—he was not present when I read it—I afterwards saw him and nodded to him—the paper further stated, "I am square"—that was at the end of the paper—he gave me a piece of paper and a pencil, and I wrote on it a request to my father to give the prisoner two sovereigns for me—it was before dinner that he gave me the paper and pencil, and after coming from dinner I gave it to him (<hi rend="italic">notice to produce this paper was proved</hi>)—I wrote on the paper for him to give it to my father, giving the address 54, Old Nicholl Street, Bethnal Green, and to receive the two sovereigns—I did not state on the paper what was to be done with the two sovereigns, but it was understood that it was to purchase me some<lb></lb>thing to eat—this was two or three days after my admission—I saw the prisoner on the following morning, and asked if he had been to my father—this was as we were walking—I asked if he had received any money—he said no, he had not—I spoke to him frequently after that—I wrote again to my father to the same effect, bat more positively—the prisoner gave me some paper—I think that was on the Saturday—I afterwards asked him if he had received any money—he said no; there was no one at home but my mother, that there was a fight on, and all the people were away; that he had seen my mether, and that he had to go down again to receive the money on Tuesday week—that was on the Monday—that would be the Tuesday after my father made the report at the prison—the prisoner never told me that he had received 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he stated posi<lb></lb>tively that he had received none—there was nothing said about what was to be done with the money when he got it—but he knew and I knew—it was understood that it was to purchase something to eat, as I was very hungry at the time, and every man in my position is the same.</p>

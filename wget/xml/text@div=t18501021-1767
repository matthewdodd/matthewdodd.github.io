                  </hi>. I live in Howill-street, Camberwell. On 19th Sept. I went to the prosecutor's in Houndsditch—I purchased some goods of the prisoner—he made out this bill of them, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I paid him three sove<lb></lb>regins and two shillings.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the prosecutor's employ. On 19th Sept. I was noticing the prisoner—I saw Mr. Bennett in the shop, and soon after the prisoner presented a check to me to sign—that is the ordinary mode in which business is done—this is it—it is for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this "No. 2" on it is the number of the check, and this "13" is the prisoner's number, and the "3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." the money he had received—after receiving this check signed, the prisoner should take that and the money to the desk and give it to the cashier.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You have a considerable business? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; sometimes customers come rapidly—it has not happened that we have been stopped in serving one customer to serve another—I know of nothing of that kind occurring—if two customers came in it would be contrary to the rules of the establishment to serve one before we accounted for what we received from the other—I do not take country customers out to treat them—I do not know that other shopmen have done so, and charged the money to the firm—we perhaps employ fifty shopmen—it is left to the men's judgment to refresh the customer when they have been served; sometimes while they are serving.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is that done by giving money, or something to eat and drink? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Something to eat and drink—I know Mr. Bennett; he is not a country customer—the prisoner did not say anything about any country customer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the prosecutor's service—it is my duty to receive money taken by the shopmen. On 19th Sept. the prisoner brought me this ticket, and paid me three sovereigns—each shopman has a number—the prisoner is No. 13—this "2" is the number of check he had taken that day.</p>

               <p>noticed a person who was a stranger in the shop about one o'clock—I saw him buy a hundred steel beads—I heard the prisoner mention 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. as the price—I saw him receive the money—he kept it in his hand—he did not call the attention of any young man to it, or go to the cashier—I spoke to Mr. Hyams—Mr. Bennett had already left—it would have been his duty to have given up the money before serving another customer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am partner with Alfred Davis and another as French and German merchants—the prisoner was in our service about eleven months—it was his duty to receive money from the customers—it was then his duty to call out "Cashier," and a young man would go to him, and the prisoner would take a ticket and the money to the cashier—I received a communication from Solomons, in consequence of which I spoke to the prisoner, but I had previously spoken to Mr. Bennett, and satisfied myself, and had got the invoice from him—I then called the prisoner and said, "You have just received some money?"—he said, "I have, 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I said, "Where is it?"—he said, "In my pocket"—I said, "How is that?"—I think he said, "I did intend to give an account of it"—I said, "You have received other money?"—he said, "Yes, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said, "You have received more, you have received 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he said, "I have," and he put his hand into his back coat-pocket, took out 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and gave it to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was not that the pocket in which he kept hs book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know—I asked him for the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he gave it me—I keep a shop-walker—we occasionally treat customers—if any gentlemen are there six or seven hours, or three hours, it is the duty of the young man to come to me, or to the shop-walker, and state what refreshment is required, and a ticket is made out for it—the shopmen do not go out with the customers—if they have a customer in the toy department, refreshment is sent up to them—I never heard of such a thing as for a shopman to give refreshment and then charge for it—a ticket is written on "Mr. So and So, biscuits," or whatever it may be, and that is provided for them.</p>

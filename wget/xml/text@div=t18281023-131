            . On the morning of the 7th of October I stopped Joyce in Pond-lane, Clapton, at half-past six o'clock - he was coming from Waltham Abbey towards London, but not in the direct road; in his jacket pockets I found three ducks, and buttoned in his waistcoat was one fowl, and in his hat another fowl - I suspected there was another person with him, and I sent two men to see if any one else appeared; Woodroff was brought in in half an hour, and I found on him a duplicate, a knife, 1s. 6d. in silver, and in his jacket pocket a few feathers and some scales, which appeared to have come from the legs of fowls.</p>

Adaman sent me to watch; I saw Woodroff in a field - he saw me, and ran across a field; Barrett, who was with me, ran after him to Lee-bridge-road, and took him - I found four fowls and a duck ten or a dozen yards from the spot where I first saw Woodroff; they were dead, but quite warm - Mills owned them.</p>

               <p>WOODROFF's Defence. When they first took me to the watch-house, the officer said, "You have got another;" he said, "Yes, I have;" he said, "Can you swear to this man?" "Yes," said he, "I saw him throw the fowls over the hedge, and they were found in a ditch:" I was with some friends catching birds, and it is generally the custom to run across fields to turn the birds back again.</p>

               <p>William Shudal. I live in Holloway-Street, St. Clement-Danes, and am a <rs id="t17560915-36-viclabel189" type="occupation">robe maker</rs>

About the 18th of July my house was under a general repair, and we had removed our things out of the way of the workman as much as we could. The piece of silk was in a drawer, the breeches lay open in a one pair of stairs room, and the other things mentioned in the indictment in the house. They were all taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find them again ?</p>
               <p>Shudal. I have got them all again. The prisoner at the bar hired herself to my wife as a single woman, and a stranger to our part of the town; but we were immediately convinced she was a base woman. At her first coming she would stay a great length of time in going of errands, and for other ill behaviour I turned her away at three weeks end. After which there came a man to me, and inquired if I had lost a pair of breeches? I said, I had. Then the person told me who had them. I went then and took a warrant for the prisoner, and one Bowen. Upon which Bowen came to me and told me he had bought the breeches of the prisoner; which she, when before the justice, owned also. She also confessed in my hearing, she did take all the things mentioned in the indictment; and she gave her key to Mrs. Jenkins (who was by at the time) who went to her box and found the other things.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was her box?</p>
               <p>Shudal. In her master's house, Mr. Watson in Smithfield (the goods produced in court, and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Mrs. Jenkins. I live at Fleetditch, and the prisoner had lived with me several times on and off. After I was informed the prosecutor had lost these things, I sent for her to ask her about them; at first she denied it, but before we went to the justice she own'd she stole the breeches, and sold them to Bowen. I insisted upon her keys to look over er things, imagining there might be something of mine there, and in searching her box these other things were found in it.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175609150016"></xptr>Q. What was her behaviour while she lived with you?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Jenkins. I always thought her to have the best of characters, I have trusted her with things of great value, and was much surprised to see her turn out in this manner.</p>

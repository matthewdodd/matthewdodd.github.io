               <p>Q. Are you sure the hamper he ran away with, was your master's? - A.It was; I packed it myself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.So you were standing gaping at the poor unfortunate man that was going to be executed? - A. No; I was there to rest myself, because of the crowd.</p>
               <p>Q. And it was solely for the purpose of getting clear of the crowd that you got into the cart? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>- PUGH sworn. - I am a druggist in Old Fish-street: I saw the prisoner at the bar with a hamper, going from towards the Old-Bailey to Giltspur-street; the pole of a hackney-coach that was coming from Snow-hill either run against the prisoner or the hamper, I cannot say which; the prisoner and the hamper both fell together; the prisoner upon getting up as quick as he could, was going off with the hamper; Mr. Strong's man came up to him and struck him violently, and threshed him indeed very severely; he threshed him heartily; he knocked him down, and even struck him when he was down; I conceived the prisoner very ill used, nobody seemed to take his part, and I came forward merely with a view to see the man righted, as I thought; however when I learned the cause, I insisted upon his going after the man, and I took care of the hamper, while he pursued the man.</p>
               <p>Roach. This is the hamper that I lost; (produces it;) I have had it ever since I received it from Mr. Pugh.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel.</p>

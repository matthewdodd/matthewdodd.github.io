                  </hi>. I am an ironmonger's assistant, and live at 166, High Street, Southwark—about a quarter or half-past twelve on Mon<lb></lb>day, the 6th August, I was in Blackman Street, with a young lady—the prisoner McDonald rushed out of a court and tore my watch and chain from my waistcoat—I was close by the court—he just came a few steps out—I saw three of them, and they all made up the court—he was the last one, and I followed—at the end of the court I caught McDonald and threw him down—in the struggle I saw the guard in his hand, and heard it rattle—I called for the police, and McDonald for his friends to come and pull me off—I was on the top of him—he held me by the throat with one hand and held the watch away with the other—Jones and the other man came up and the watch and guard changed hands—he handed it to one of them—I did not see who—they both punched me and hit me on the head and all over the body—they then, the two, made off, and got away, just as the witness Ann Hickey, the young lady I was walking with, came up with a policeman—I held McDonald till the police<lb></lb>man came up—I gave him into his hands and went after the others, but could not find them—I then returned to the policeman, and as I was stand<lb></lb>ing talking to him McDonald struck me a violent blow in the mouth, which made my nose bleed and swelled my mouth up very much—he was then taken to the station—I was very much knocked about; my knee was injured—I walk with a stick in consequence—I have been in bed ever since—I was attended by Dr. Hart for some time, and then I went to the hospital—I next saw Jones on the morning when the charge against McDonald came on—I saw him among the people standing in the Court—I called the at<lb></lb>tention of a policeman to him, and had him taken there and then—I have never seen my watch and chain since—there was a gaslight on the pave<lb></lb>ment at the entrance to the court where this happened, and there was a light up the court at the corner, that shone on the spot where I was pulled down, but very dimly—I did not see Jones's face—I saw him as he was running up the court—he ran first—I can swear to his back—the light was sufficient to enable me to see the figures.</p>

Q.</hi> How long did you stay by the side of me in the police-court before you called the attention of the constable to me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About a quarter of an hour—the constable did not speak to me first—I did not tell him directly, because I could not get a good view of your back for a quarter of an hour—I did not go into the inspector's office—I went in a aide place, and told the policeman to the best of my belief you were one of them—the inspector said when you were taken and charged, "Is this the man?" and I said, "To the best of my belief"—I do not swear to your face, only your features.</p>

               <p>prisoners—McDonald I can swear to, but Jones I can't—McDonald was standing at the court as we were passing, and he stepped out from the court and snatched the prosecutor's watch and chain from his side, and ran down Dobson's Court—the prosecutor ran after them, and I went across the road and fetched a constable, and went with him up the court, where the prosecutor was struggling with McDonald—I saw McDonald strike the prosecutor—there were two other men there; they anaway—I cannot swear to them.</p>

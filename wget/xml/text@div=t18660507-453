                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edmund Magee, a clerk, and live at 2, Skinner-street, Shoreditch—on Tuesday evening, 17th April, about 9 o'clock, I was alone—I was about entering the Commercial hotel, and a fellow stood on to the step of the door, and put his hand down my face, and before I had time to resent it, the prisoner knocked me between the shoulders, and sent me forward—the other man hit me back again, and I was hit more than a dozen times, and was kicked in a most violent manner—the prisoner struck me in the eye, and cut it, and the blood oozed out very much—I caught hold of the other fellow's arm, and said I would hold him till a policeman came—his coat sleeve gave way in my hand, and in wrenching himself away I fell back—I am quite sure the prisoner is one of the men—I saw him under the gas—I could see his features—he had a white coat on—I lost my brooch, half a crown, and a key—I screamed very loud several times during the struggle—my cloak was torn, and my dress too—I should known the other man again—I saw him the first day after I left Worship-street, and my husband went with me to secure him, but there was no officer near.</p>

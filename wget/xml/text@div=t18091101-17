            , he is a feather maker. The prisoner brought three bundles of feathers to our house and offered them for sale on the Wednesday after they were lost; I asked the prisoner if she had any more: she said no. I think she asked ten shillings, or ten shillings and sixpence for the three bundles. I took them up to my husband; he ordered me to stop her and to send for an officer. I stopped her and sent for an officer, he came and detained her. I told her I suspected the feathers were stolen; I was ordered to stop the person that brought them; she said she bought them; I asked her how she bought them, as she was able to sell them so cheap; she answered she bought them in a lot of things. I said, good woman, if you leave them with me, and leave your address, you shall have double that, they are worth a great deal more; she said she would; she waited till my husband came down, and, as I said before, the officer came and took her in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she taken in custody at your house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And from that time to this she has been in prison - A. Yes. She told me at last that she found them.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Was not Hewitt taken up on a charge of stealing these goods - A. No. There was no other person taken up but this woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to tell me there was no other person taken up before the alderman - A. No. There were three bundles of feathers found in the possession of Mr. Hewitt.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Hewitt lives no great way off from where you were robbed - he lives in Wilson-street - A. He does. The very next day I found three bundles in Hewitt's possession; Mr. Hewitt told me he gave eight shillings for them, to induce them to leave it; he having nobody in the shop to detain them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was Hewitt before the lord mayor - A. No. I wished to take Hewitt up; I applied at Worship-street office, there was not an officer to be found; then I applied to a city constable, he said he could not take Hewitt up without a warrant, but he could take the feathers. The feathers were returned to me.</p>
               <p>Q. You having found three bundles of feathers at Hewitt's, how came Hewitt not to be taken up - A. On that account, because I could not get an officer; and I was told after the lord mayor gave me back my property I could not take him up.</p>
               <p>COURT. Yes you could.</p>

            . On the morning that the prisoner came into my house I was in bed, my wife came up and told me that the feathers were offered for sale for ten shillings; I bid her go down stairs and keep the woman in conversation while my son went for an officer. When I came down I told her she had no business to attempt to go away, if the goods were come honestly by; she gave a written direction where she lived; she first gave the wrong name, and then she gave the right; the officer took her up in my dining room and searched her. The feathers I have kept, they are here; these are the feathers she offered me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are my feathers; I can swear to all the three bundles; they are worth ten pound.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left her defence to her counsel; called four witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

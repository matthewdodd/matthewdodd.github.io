                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Lawrence; the prisoner is my brother. I was present at Paddington Church, at a marriage between him and Sarah Cole, fifteen or sixteen years ago—they lived together after<lb></lb>wards,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185412180051"></xptr>
               <p>and she went to the Indies with him, about three years after their marriage—she came back before he did—I do not know her now—the pri<lb></lb>soner was afterwards invalided in the Hackney Asylum as a lunatic.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you present? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; the prisoner has been three or four times in confinement for insanity, and has lately come out of a lunatic asylum.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, S</hi> 145). I obtained this certificate of marriage, at Paddington church—I compared it with the register, it is a true copy—(<hi rend="italic">read:</hi> "Thomas Cuxon and Sarah Coles, married by banns, at Paddington church, March 0th, 1838. <hi rend="italic">Signed</hi>, A. R Ludlow, curate.")—on 5th Dec., about 2 o'clock, I saw the prisoner running in Little Albany-street, followed by Sarah Phillips, who was calling "Stop thief!"—she gave him into my custody for bigamy—he said, "She was aware that I was married before, and that my wife was living at the time"—she said nothing to that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joshua Clements, a tailor of Bromp<lb></lb>ton. Sarah Coles is my sister—I knew her living with the prisoner as man and wife, she has had a family by him—I saw her last about two years ago, and have not heard of her since.</p>

                  </hi>. I was married to the prisoner on 14th July, 1850—he represented himself as a widower—this is the certificate—(<hi rend="italic">read:</hi> "July 14th, 1850, Thomas Cuxon and Sarah Phillips, married by banns, at the church of St. James's, Westminster.")—I lived with him for two years—since I gave him into custody, I understand that he has been three times in a lunatic asylum—I know that his wife has married again; he gave her in charge for bigamy, and she has been exonerated by letters received from India, stating that he was dead—I have no ill feeling against the prisoner, but being sixteen weeks afflicted with illness, and in St. James's workhouse, I was interrogated whether I had a husband, and I wanted to find out whether I had a husband or not.</p>

               <p>married; I was in confinement for three years, and then settled myself as quickly as I could; her friends never told me that she was married; I did not know whether she was dead or alive, and I got married again; I was fond of her, and had five children by her, but as she was married to another I considered that she had no further claim on me, and I think, but I will not be certain, that the Magistrate said that I was quite a free man; with respect to this wife she ought not to have done as she has, because she has denied me my home, and would not let me come there; I had to walk about the streets eighteen days and nights, which caused me again to go to a lunatic asylum; it was ten years since I heard anything of my first wife.</p>

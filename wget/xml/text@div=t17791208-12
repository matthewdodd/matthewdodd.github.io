I lost the things mentioned in the indictment last Wednesday night, the 1st of December, between the hours of eight and nine; the prisoner came into our house, and called for a pint of beer, and paid for it immediately; she staid about five minutes; when she was gone out my daughter asked me if I had taken the tea-kettle away; I said no; she then said she supposed the prisoner had taken it. I went after her immediately, and overtook her about eight or ten yards from the door. I laid hold of her shoulder and stroked her down, and to my great surprize I found, what I had not missed before, a pair of bellows hanging down before under her petticoats. I took her back to the parlour, where there was a constable, and presently delivered her of the bellows; as we were stroking her down some water ran about the floor, and we found the tea-kettle under her petticoats on one side, about half full of warm water. My daughter then said she missed a flat-iron; we searched her, and found it in one of her pockets, and a brass candlestick, but that was not mine, the rest are. I gave the constable charge of her, and he took her to the Compter.</p>

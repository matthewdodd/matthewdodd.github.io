               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Mrs. Jones was admitted to bail by the Justice? - A. I do not know; the Justice told me I was done with, and I did not stop in the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that she surrendered this morning to take her trial? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to Mrs. Jones's, in consequence of information you received from the other prisoners? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not she tell you from whom she had them? - A.She did not tell me first.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that you saw the handkerchief in the shop, or whether she did not bring them herself to the Justice's? - A. She brought one of them down.</p>
               <p>Q. And that is one of these? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she say any thing else? - A. No; when Mr. Kelly came home, he went to the Justice's directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mrs. Kelly bring the things away with her from Mrs. Jones's? - A. Yes, she did.</p>

               <p>Caslin's defence. Underhill brought these things to my room, and asked me to let him leave them in my room, and if I would sell the petticoat for him, which I did, for one shilling, and gave him the money.</p>
               <p>Jones's defence. I bought these things, and, to my judgement, I gave the full value for them; I gave one shilling for the petticoat and pin-afore.</p>

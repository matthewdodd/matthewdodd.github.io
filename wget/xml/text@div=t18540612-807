                  </hi>. I am a widow. On Wednesday, 24th May, the prisoner was brought to my house by Mary Murphy, who met her at the top of the court, and she slept with me and my two children for two nights—next day I went to Kennington workhouse, where I receive relief—as I was going, I went into the Roman Catholic chapel, and staid there about three-quarters of an hour—I then went on to the workhouse, leaving the prisoner and Mary Murphy in the chapel—I was gone about an hour and a quarter—when I returned, I found the prisoner and Murphy still in the chapel—we stopped there some time, and all three came home together, at least the prisoner and I did; Murphy went a little before, after giving me the key of my room—the prisoner said that a lady in the chapel wanted a servant, and she would go and look after it—she went away, and did not return—I missed the key of my drawers, which had been safe in my pocket the over night—I forced them open with a poker, and missed my shawl and half a sovereign, which was tied up in an old table napkin, and 8 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and some farthings, belonging to my child's money box.</p>

That it was a melancholy Scene to see a Clergyman in that Habit Mr. Kinnersley appearing at the Bar in a Clergyman's Habit, arraign'd for such unjust Proceedings, in being concern'd with Mr. Hales, in contriving counterfeiting and forging this Note, for which they stood indicted. That the good Nature of Mr. Edwards, in giving frank Covers to Mr. Hales, had given them this Opportunity to counterfeit a Note, and contrive Mr. Edward's Name to the Indorsment. That the Hand Writing in the Body of the Note was Mr. Kinnersley's. That the Paper on which the Note was drawn, appear'd to have been cut, or torn from some Writing, the Bottom of several Letters being visible at the Top of the Note, and the Note cut, and as it were indented to give the more Room for the Note to he wrote on, that the Word Free, as in all Probability, and even Appearance, was upon the Note, was chang'd to the Word For, to serve the Purpose of the Prisoners.

             the Constable depos'd, That a Warrant was brought to him, to execute on Mr. Kinnersley, and told his Inventions to take him, (too many of them to repeat) but as Mr. Kinnersley's Council made use of the most material Part of this Evidence, to Mr. Kinnersley's Advantage, it would seem partial to escape it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172901160007"></xptr>He told of his running and sending after him to little Effect, but at length got Admittance into his House and Person, though he had been before deny'd. Mr. Kinnersley asking his Business, he said, A young Couple wanted to be marry'd with a License, and he heard he had Licenses by him; that they waited at the Magpye Tavern near Aldgate, and desir'd he would perform the Ceremony. That Mr. Kinnersley ask'd him the Man's Name, which he said, was Bird of Fleet-street; and farther asking if she the young Gentlewoman was of Age, he said he could not tell; and asking if she had the Consent of her Father, he said no, to which Mr. Kinnersley answered, He would not marry them for a hundred Pounds, the Penalty for doing such an Action was 50 l. by Law. That he then ask'd Mr. Kinnersley to drink a Glass of Wine with him, at the Magpye at Aldgate, and satisfy the young Gentlewoman, and her Brother, who was with her, that he did not care to undertake it; but Mr. Kinnersley would not go with him. This he said, was to decoy him into the Freedom, for his Warrant did not extend to the Suburbs, where Mr. Kinnersley lived; but this Sham not taking, he waited, and had his Ends soon after.</p>
               <p>The Council for Mr. Kinnersley observ'd on this Conduct of his, That he acted like a Man of Conscience, in not performing an Act so unlawful, tho' so frequently practis'd.</p>
               <p>The Council for the King then said, they would endeavour to prove, That Mr. Hales, and Mr. Kinnersley, had for the last seven Months, before this Prosecution, frequently had private Meetings together, in such Manner, as it might be reasonably be believed they mutually agreed together to form these Designs, and doubtless Mr. Kinnersley was Guilty of this Forgery.</p>

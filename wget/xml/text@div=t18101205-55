               <p>Q. You did not know him at that time - A. No; he went by that name at Bow-street, he was one of those before the horses.</p>
               <p>Q. How were the other dressed - A. He had a short smock on, or a jacket, I cannot say which, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181012050032"></xptr>man behind the cart had on a large darge dark coat, it appeared to me.</p>
               <p>Q. When they came up to you what did they do - Gill came up to me and put something to my breast, which appeared to me to be a pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. The man you think was Gill - A. Yes, he said, see this, see this, your money or your life; the man in the dark coat, who was behind, took the money out of my pocket, a letter, and a knife.</p>

               <p>Q. How much money did he take from you - A. Seven pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the seven pounds made up - A. In the first place there were sixteen dollars, four half crowns, an old crown piece with some letters on the head of it, twenty-five shillings in silver, and a one pound bank note.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you receive this money - A. As payment for a load of hay; I received it that same evening, about four o'clock, in London for a load of hay. When they took my money out of my pocket they took me behind the team about two hundred yards, as near as I can tell, back upon the road, the team was going on slowly, they let me go then, and I did not see any more of them, they walked towards town.</p>
               <p>Q. While they were robbing you and taking you two hundred yards back on the road, did you take any notice of their persons - A. I looked at Gill, he was the man that was facing of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at him enough to be able to recollect his countenance afterwards - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the other men - A. No, I did not; one stood behind me, and the other on the side of me, I did not observe them.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see these men, or either of them afterwards - A. I saw them the next day at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. That is you saw three men - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now these three men that you saw there, did you recollect any one of them - A. Yes, Gill, the right hand man; I told the officer before I went in I could swear to him, and when I went in I recollected Gill, I said that is the man that presented the pistol to my breast, in his presence, he was by, he could not hear me speak.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, can you say that man put what you took to be a pistol to your breast - A. Yes, I can safely swear that.</p>
               <p>Q. Now when these men left you what did you do - A. I went into a public house and told the people that I had been robbed, that was before I got up to my team, I went on then after my team; at the public house there were two or three people said they would go after them, I did not see them go.</p>
               <p>Q. You went after your team - A. Yes; I went up to the stable's with the horses; master's house is not where the stables are, I did not go to my master's house that night.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you arrive at the stables - A. About half after eight, as near as I could tell.</p>
               <p>Q. How far are the stables from your master's house - A. Above a mile as near as I can tell. I live in the parish of Hendon, about a mile from my master's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a single or a married man - A. A married man.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to go directly that night - A. I do not know; I did not go there till the next morning, I never go there of a night only once of twice a week to know what I am to do. My master came to me the next morning to the stable about nine o'clock, I told him I had been robbed on the over night.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to go and tell your master before nine o'clock, you were up before that time, what time did you get up that morning - A. About six.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your master heard of the robbery before he came to you - A. Yes; I told him I had been robbed, and while I told him there was a man came up and told me these men were taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Then in consequence of that I suppose you went up to London did not you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were shewn the three young men at the bar were not you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you have told us one of them you know, which was Gill, and respecting the other men did you take any notice of the height or size of them - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. How old are you yourself - A. I am about twenty-seven.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you are married, how many children have you - A. One child.</p>
               <p>Gill. I would wish to ask him who told him I was the man that put the pistol to his breast - A. No man told me so.</p>
               <p>Q. I was told that you were in the public-house conversing with some of Mr. Franklin's men, and you were told to say I was the man - A. I never had any conversation with Mr. Franklin's men.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did either Mr. Franklin's men, or any men whatever tell you to swear to Gill - A. No, no man whatever.</p>
               <p>Gill. I never had a pair of trowsers on, these are the clothes that I had on when the officer took me; I shewed him my things, they searched my room; I had no trowsers whatever.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to be so late taking Gill - A. My detaining Fordham, that took up the time. When I took the three prisoners I took them to the Crown, about the three mile stone, where I had left Fordham, the Crowns is in the Edgware-road. My partner came up when I had taken the third man.</p>
               <p>Q. Another man assisted you likewise - A. Yes, and he came with me to the Crown.</p>
               <p>Q. You and your partner went with them I suppose - A. Yes; I rode before, my partner behind, and a lodger or two walked along side of them.</p>
               <p>Q. They made no attempt to get away, did they - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you apprehended them did any conversation pass - A. No further. I searched them and found nothing but knives upon them, I searched them all, I found no money upon either of them at first; I kept them at the Crown untill my inspector came down, he told him if he would go with him he would shew him where the money lay;

               <p>Q. Was Cogdale by - A. No. In the bank of the garden of Norris's lodging, the inspector and me proceeded along with Norris, he took us into his garden, from thence he searched with his hands in the bank, and scratched the money out there and gave the money to me, I have kept it ever since, this is it.</p>

               <p>Wright. After this I took him to Bow-street, the next morning with the three prisoners, I sent a man off for Weston in the morning, he came to me at the office, he was shewn the three prisoners at the bar in my presence, he pointed out Gill, he said he pointed something like a pistol to him, but he could not tell whether it was a pistol or a knife; Gill made no answer to that, but said as to Norris telling of the money he had been the ringleader of the whole, Norris said they had been the ringleaders, and had brought him into all this trouble.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not hear Cogdale say any thing - A. No, only what Gill said was perfectly right.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barry. You were upon that road at half past seven o'clock, you found Norris in his bed, you did not see him on the road - A. I cannot say I did to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the hour of the robbery - A. About eight o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you know that if these men are convicted there is a reward - A. Yes; I have had the the premium before, there is forty pound reward for each man.</p>
               <p>Q. Now when this man told you where this money was, was any inducement held out to him - A. Not any; I never spoke to him, he wished to speak to the inspector, he said he saw it hid, he was sorry for it; he acknowledged that he was led into the error by the young men.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you he saw another man conceal it - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not tell you that he was guilty of the robbery - A. No; I found him in bed by eleven o'clock, his door was locked, and he was gone to bed.</p>

When the prisoners were there, I went into another room to where the prisoners were, I had not been in more than ten minutes before Norris came in, he expressed a wish to speak to me, I asked him what he had to say, he told me he could tell me where the money was, and that the other prisoners were the men that robbed him.</p>
               <p>COURT. We will not go into that, the other prisoners were not by - A. No, they were not; I saw the other prisoners before Norris came to me.</p>

               <p>Q. Before Norris had made this proffer of shewing you where this money was, you had not held out any promise had you - A. No, not to any one of them. I brought the prisoner back to the Crown. When he came there I went into the room where the two other<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181012050034"></xptr>prisoners were, and I believe there were some little murmur with the others, what it was I do not know; then I left them, when I saw them with the two patrols, with directions to bring them up the next morning. Wright and Vickers, the other patrol, staid with the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barry. Norris told you where the money was put - A. He told me Cogdale hid the money, and he told me that there was the money.</p>

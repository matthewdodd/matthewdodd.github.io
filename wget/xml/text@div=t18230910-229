            , SEN. I know this half-crown and shilling to be what I gave my son with another half crown, to buy six bottles of blacking. I did not mark them; but my children had rubbed them with nails, and scratched them and several more on the night previous. I am positive to them by the scratches.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If asked by any one what money you gave the boy, could you describe the place where the scratches were - A. Yes; I could point it out from among fifty. I do not know on which side they were scratched; my son had no money of his own.</p>
               <p>MR. WARREN re-examined. He should ring the bell when the customer arrives. But if I am not down, he would take the money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I served two or three customers, and gave him the money.</p>
               <p>MR. WARREN. He paid me no other money on that morning.</p>

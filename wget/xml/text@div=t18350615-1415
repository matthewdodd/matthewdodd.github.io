On the 18th of May I was going home to Tottenham, about ten o'clock—the prisoner came up to me in the Kingsland-road, and asked me to go with her—I refused, and said I had no money—she said she knew I had some—I said I had but 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she said that would do—we went to the back of Acton-place, and while I was with her there she drew my watch—the policeman came down at the time, and I ran away—a few minutes after that I missed my watch—I did not feel it taken—I did not perceive her take it from me—she felt in my pocket, and said she knew I had some halfpence, and I said, "No," it was my watch—I did not unbutton any clothes, except my flap—I saw a policeman come, and then I ran a few yards, and missed my watch—I went to the policeman and told him—he went in search of her, and found her at one o'clock the next morning near Shoreditch church—I found my watch at a pawnbroker's—I had never seen her before—I am quite sure she is the person—it was a wet and dark night.</p>

Mr. Clark and Mr. Bradley, the two marshalmen were in my back room, I went to them and told them; I had the money in my hand, Mr. Clark came into the shop, he asked him how many more he had of them? the man had three more of them in his hand; before that he told me that he worked in the leather business, and he had let the money fall into some leather water, and that had taken that effect on it that made them look so bad. Mr. Clark then searched him, but there was no more found on him, Mr. Clark asked me what he should do, I put all the seven together, and sealed them in a paper and gave them to Mr. Clark.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. So he uttered one after another to the number of seven? - No, four, and three were in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you think it pretty odd that a man that had seven bad shillings<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179312040166"></xptr>about him should offer these one after another? - I asked him if he had not good money to pay for the gin, he had not, he was searched.</p>

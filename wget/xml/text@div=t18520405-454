                  </hi>. I am the landlord of the Hoop and Grapes, Broad<lb></lb>way, Westminster—I know John Stowell—I have been intimate with him four or five years—I have known him a great many years—I became bankrupt in 1850; and owed him the sum of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and after that time, on 28th Jan., I borrowed 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of him, which was to be paid him on 28th Feb.—I was to pay 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for interest—on 11th Feb. I borrowed 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of him, for which I was to pay 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. interest—he had been in the habit of lending money to me—the interest was regulated in many ways—he used to have my horse and chaise, and drive with me, and he used to have gin, ducks, fowls, and cigars—I was in the habit, besides paying him interest, of supplying htm with articles which I had in my house—I stated these circumstances in the County Court, in Oct. 1851, and John Stowell admitted it himself in the County Court—I heard him asked questions as to whether he had not had gin, and articles, I deal in—he said he had had gin, fowls, cigars, and various things—the ques<lb></lb>tion put was, whether he had received anything else besides money—when he has had these sort of things for money, I would say, "What am I to pay you for this?" and he would say, "I have had the horse and chaise, and I have had the gin, I shall only charge you so much for this"—the interest was generally regulated when money was borrowed—I paid him the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on 28th Feb., and the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 18th or 19th March, at the Elephant and Castle—my wife paid him the 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in. our house—Mr. Younger was with me when I paid the ten guineas—I took the money from the stables—I carried on a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> business besides that of a publican, and that was the produce of the stables—I have a desk in the stables, but in the stables I had then, I had a counting house—there was a place for books, which was locked up—the foreman takes the money every night, sometimes I ask him for it once in two or three weeks, and sometimes oftener—I have taken sometimes 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a day—I do not known whether Mr. Younger saw me take the money from my wife—I think he was in the room when I took it off the table—my wife counted it—I gave it, to her—I think there was more than I paid Mr. Stowell—I am sure my wife counted it—an entry of the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Was made at the time in this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is a day book which is kept in the house for any payment my wife makes, or anything—these are all payments—here is an entry of 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., on 28th Feb.—that entry was made on the day I paid it—I believe this adding up over leaf was made at the end of the week, but it is not my adding up, it is my wife's—about 6th June, 1850, I quarrelled with Stowell—I had some words with him, and from that time down to Oct. 1851, I did not see him or have any con<lb></lb>versation with him—he did not, during that period, directly or indirectly apply to me for these two sums—I gave two I O Us for these two sums, but did not get them back from him when I paid him—when I paid him the 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I asked him for the I O U—he put his hand into his</p>

               <p>breast-pocket, and said, "Dear me, I have left my pocket-book behind," or "I have left my pocket-book at home"—when I paid him the other sum I said, "Now, John, you have the two documents to give me"—he said, "Dear me, I forgot it; I will tend them over in a <hi rend="italic">poster</hi>"—he never sent them to me—after I quarrelled, or bad words with him, at the beginning of June, I instructed my solicitor to apply for them; that was shortly after June, 1860—I never received them—he never applied, directly or indirectly, for them till I received the summons in the County Court action—when the sum<lb></lb>mons was heard the plaintiff was no suited by the Judge—the case was after<lb></lb>wards tried by a Jury, and a verdict given in my favour—I never got any answer to the application I instructed my attorney to make—Thomas Stowell was examined in the first action; Mr. Garnett was not examined—he was on the second examination—I do not recollect John Stowell being sworn; I was not in Court—I did not hear him examined the second time, nor Garnett—on the second occasion all the witnesses were ordered out of Court—I heard Thomas and John Stowell examined on the first occasion—Garnett was not found then—I should think a month or six weeks elapsed before he was appre<lb></lb>hended—I was not present at his apprehension; I saw him after he was apprehended—I was sent for, and rode with him in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to the police-court with the policeman—I said to him, "I never saw you before I saw you at the trial"—he said, "I am aware you did not"—I asked him if he had been a witness for Thomas Stowell before—he said, "Yes," and said he would tell all in the morning; that he had been drawn into it, through poverty, by the Stowells—he said the last time he had been a witness he put his name to several bills of indictment (I think he said four) against brothel-keepers, and one was against a man of the name of Lewis, or Levi, in Exeter-street, and that Stowell told him to put his name to it, it was no matter, and he went before the Grand Jury, I think he said at Middlesex, and then he ran away—I think that was all he said—Thomas Stowell did not call on me after the end of 1850, or at any time, and ask me for payment of the I O U's—after these indictments were found, he was out of the way from Jan., in this year, and I had to offer a reward of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for his apprehension—he was appre<lb></lb>hended by a man named Richard, or Richards—I found a man who I gave 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to tell me where he was, and he was apprehended through my instrumentality—there is no entry of the payment of the ten guineas in this book—we never enter any money in the book, except it is paid for the house—if you look at part of that book, you will find a part of the money I took home from the stables to the house—my wife enters it in the book, and money she takes she books against me—this book contains nothing but the payments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But you say your wife gave you credit in this book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not a very good scholar; I will show you (<hi rend="italic">looking at the book</hi>)—if you look over leaf you will find the payments for wages—the book is begun two ways; you will see it on the back leaf, at the top of the leaf; it is "Cash—cash," and if you turn over you will see where my wife has paid the coachman and the ostlers—we have only latterly kept the account of the stable in this book—if my wife takes anything for me, she keeps the account there against me—the account for the stable is in this book for Feb. and March, 1850—that it since we have had a new man—this account, March, 1850, is when my wife has paid the wages on Saturday night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I understood you to say, in the early part of your examination, that you made no entries in this book of what you paid at the stable? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; this was paid at the house—it is entered in this book—this is where it was paid from—all moneys paid by me or my wife were entered in that book—if</p>

               <p>it is for the use of the stable, it is entered in this book, all money for the use of the stable, be it for what purpose it may—I was incorrect in saying no payments for the stable were entered in it—what I mean is, that all moneys which my wife pays, are entered in that book, for whatever purpose it may be—if I pay money, or my men pay money in the stable, we have a book there for the purpose of putting it in, or else when we count up our takings and expenditure for the week my wife could not do it, unless she could show me where the money was gone.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Some time ago you were in difficulties; when was that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In 1850; I became a bankrupt and got a third class certificate—I have, since yesterday, ascertained from my solicitor that my debts were 1,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I knew within a little, but you wanted me to swear to a particular amount—the dividend was nothing in the pound—my sister, who was living with me, has been in service—she is a most respectable person—she had money, but she did not get it from service; it was some property which was left—her name is Miss Maslin—I owe her now about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I owed her between 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the time of my bankruptcy—she put an execution on my premises—the <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi> were seized by the Sheriff under a bill of sale which she held—they were not all seized by her, but some of them were, and I superintended them for her while I was going through the Bankruptcy Court—I have paid some of my creditors since the bank<lb></lb>ruptcy—no dividend has ever been declared—when I received my third class certificate, I continued my business with some of the same <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi> and horses—my sister had not seized any portion of the furniture at my house; it be<lb></lb>longed to Calverts', the brewers, it never belonged to me—my sister seized what would satisfy her demand—I still owe her 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I am paying her by instalments—I have an arrangement to pay her 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—John Stowell was one of my creditors—I owed him 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not paid him a farthing of that—he proved under the estate, and said at the time he was perfectly satisfied, and if I wanted 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more he would let me have it—I told him I should pay him—I did not pay him; and although he still has the I O U's, he has been paid them both back—I again swear that to-day, and that he still retains the I O U's (<hi rend="italic">the I O U's were here produced</hi>)—he made some excuse which prevented my getting these I O U's—we were on great friendship and great confidence—the words I had with John Stowell were in consequence of 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he had advanced to Miss Maslin on 22nd Jan.; no, Feb., I think—it was to be paid in a month—it was all borrowed for a month—it was not paid, because we could not spare the money—John Stowell gave her a couple of months before he took proceedings; March and April, and until 6th June, I am not certain, but I think there was some consideration given for the time—he then commenced proceedings—he was not paid directly he commenced; it was paid, I think, by instalments, which were finished in July—I paid the money through my solicitor—I got it out of the money from the business, out of the produce of the <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi>, getting Mr. Preston to discount a bill for me—that was after the bankruptcy was over, before I began taking to the <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi> again—I got my certificate, I think, on 28th or 29th Jan., 1851—it was sus—</p>

                  </hi>. I am gaoler of the Southwark police court—Garnett was in my custody—he made a statement—inspector Barry and a City police-officer, the last witness, were present at the time, and also Mr. Preston—the prisoner was cautioned by me before he made his statement—how we came to be all assembled was, that an application had been made to the Court, a mes<lb></lb>sage had been conveyed from the Court to me that Mr. Preston was to see the prisoner, and that if he pleased to make any statement he was at liberty to do so—inspector Barry did not bring me that message, Mr. Preston brought it, it was a verbal message—Mr. Preston wrote the words down—I and inspector Barry were present—Garnett signed it at the end, and I and the inspector signed it as witnesses—I heard it read over to him before he signed it (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—George Howson Garnett says, "The first intimation he had of the action in the County Court was an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Morning Advertiser</hi>, of 8th Oct., which was put into his hands by Mr. Oglethorpe, at the wine vaults, at Duke-street, Manchester-square; he at first took no notice of the advertisement for nearly a month, being fearful it was something emanating from Stowell, and I wished to be entirely quit of the transaction; I ultimately received two letters from Thomas Stowell, begging me to come over to his residence, 6, Swan-street, Trinity-square—on 10th Dec. last I went over, and Thomas Stowell said he wanted me to be a witness against Kennett; I said I had heard Mr. Kennett acknowledge a debt due to Thomas Stowell, but I understood it was the one before his bankruptcy; Stowell asked me to swear that when I called with him on Mr. Kennett, two I O U's were produced, one for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and another for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and that I heard him ask Mr. Kennett for the money; I agreed to do so, and he gave me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and John Stowell</p>

This is my state<lb></lb>ment, made before the inspector of police, and George Downe, the jaoler of the Court, at Southwark, contained in four sheets of paper, and read over to me, 21st Dec, 1852."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you get anything in this matter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I received nothing whatever from anybody—it was Mr. Preston who brought the message from the Magistrate—he said he had mad an application to the Court, and he was to see the prisoner in my presence and that of the. Inspector—Mr. A'Beckett was the sitting Magistrate—I did not go and ask whether that was a fact—I frequently receive those messages—I do not often have the message from the solicitors, but I do from other parties—I do not know that I ever received such a message as this before—I have very reason to think that the message came from Mr. A'Beckett, because I frequently receive messages from the Magistrate—I will not say that I receive them through the attorney for the other side—I have been gaoler there three or four years—I do not know of Mr. Preston going in to see Garnett before or afterwards, only on that occasion—the prisoner was there twice in my custody, but the time that statement was made was the first time—I do not know whether Mr. Preston saw him the second time, but it is very likely he did—he certainly could not have seen him without my knowledge—I do not think he did—it is not unlikely that he did see him a second time—I should not like to swear I did not introduce him to the prisoner a second time—I think the second time was about a week afterwards—it would not be at all contrary to my duty to introduce Mr. Preston to him—I mean to represent that I, as gaoler, am permitted to introduce persons without orders—I admit some thousands in the course of twelve months—I do not admit the attorney; that would perhaps be a remarkable thing—it is very likely I might have done it the second time, but I would not swear it—I hardly know how the paper was procured on which the supposed confession was written—I do not know—I cannot give you an idea, perhaps you can give me one—I very frequently do procure paper—it is not unlikely that I procured the paper on which this confession is written—I did procure it—I got it out of my desk—I was not</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you had some brandy with the prisoner; who paid for it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—it was with my own money, I think; yes, it was—I do not think I had received it from anybody else—it was my own; it was not given to me; it was not handed to me by any one that I am aware of—I think I may say there was a quartern; it cost 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—I was not repaid that 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; I went to that expense of my own accord—I am allowed to give the prisoners any reasonable refreshment—Inspector Barry did not come with Mr. Preston when he brought the message, but he came into my room afterwards.</p>

BALLANTINE</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not mention that there was a reward offered? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I have not been in Court during the whole of the examination; I did not go out towards the end; I came in late—I heard the policeman examined—I am no connection of Keanett's—I am Mr. Preston's uncle—I was in the habit of going to him on private business of my own, and I heard the case of Kennett and saw him there—I knew Garnett by sight, but I never spoke to him; hearing that there was a reward I gave him into custody—I met him first in Broad-street—Mr. Preston's office is 28, New Broad-street—I did not expect to meet Garnett that day, it was mere accident—I had often seen him in Mr. Newton's garden, in the Regent's-park; he is a private gentleman; and when I have been sitting in his dining room, I have seen garnett walking about the garden; that was in Aug. or Sept.—I was on friendly terms with Mr. Newton—I am a baronet, and live on my means—I do not live on bill discounting; I do sometimes discount a bill—Mr. Newton is not a person with whom I discount—I have not dis<lb></lb>counted for him, or obtained discounts for him; he is not a bill discounter; I daresay he may discount bills at times—Mr. Preston has had a bill dis<lb></lb>counted by me—I cannot say exactly how many matters of bill discounting we have had together, perhaps five or six—I should not say it was double that number; it is very difficult without a book to swear—I have never discounted any bills for Kennett; I never did any business for or with him—I never saw Miss Maslin; I have not done business on her behalf—I walked by the policeman—I went to the police-office because the policeman said he would not take him in charge unless I went down—I am here to see my nephew on private family business; I was here yesterday for the same purpose—I was not here last Session, except at the door of the Court, to speak to my nephew.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the clerks acting in this Court. I took in plea of Garnett on an indictment for perjury—I read over the indictment to him, I believe—I do not think I read the assignments of perjury to him or any of them—my usual mode, in a charge of perjury, is to say, "You are charged with wilful and corrupt perjury, committed by you at such a place, before so-and-so"—I called his attention so far to the contents of that indictment, and he pleaded guilty.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an attorney, of New Broad-street, I have been admitted about eight months—I have been attorney for Mr. Ken<lb></lb>nett throughout this case, and have conducted the prosecution for him—I conducted the action in the County Court on his behalf—I remember a sum<lb></lb>mons being taken out against Garnett, along with the other parties here; it was the day after the verdict in the County Court; it was taken out by Mr. Kennett's instructions—Garnett did not appear—I was out for three or four evenings to find him—I went to the address he mentioned, in Thomas-street, Oxford-street, four or five times, but was not able to find him—a reward of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was offered for his apprehension, and bills were sent to nearly every police office in London—a bill was posted in my office; my uncle, the last witness, had an opportunity of seeing it, and I told him of it—I remember Garnett's apprehension—I was attending a meeting of creditors in Cornhill, and was sent for; I went to the station in Bow-lane—I went in company with Mr. Kennett and the policeman to the police court in the Borough—I was requested to go to identify him, Mr. Kennett not being present when he gave his evidence in the County Court, he could not identify him, and I went—during the journey, Mr. Kennett asked Garnett if he had ever seen him before—Garnett said, "No"—Kennett asked him if he had ever been with Stowell, engaged in transactions with brothel-house keepers—he said, "Yes," and he had gone in the name of George Gardner, in an indictment against Lewis; but he could not recollect the names he had gone in against the others; but he thought it was Gardner—this was between five and six in the evening—he was given into custody at the police-station in the Borough—I first saw this piece of paper when Mr. Kennett brought it over to me, or gave it to me at the police court, when he came over there—I saw it before the examination of Garnett.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Prior to Garnett's apprehension you offered a reward for him, and prior to his apprehension had you had any communication directly or indirectly with him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I had not the slightest idea he was apprehended till I was sent for to the meeting of creditors where I was engaged—I got this paper on the morning of the examination—soon after, or almost directly after, Garnett came before the Magistrate he said, "I am guilty, and I throw myself on the mercy of the Court," or words to that effect—I had never seen him before, and knew nothing at all about him—the Stowells were both there on the examination—that was the first examination when Garnett was examined—I will not be certain whether it was the first examination; I am nearly certain it was the second—Thomas Stowell stood in front, and John Stowell behind—I am certain now that it was the second, because it was when Mr. Prendergast appeared—this statement (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) is in my handwriting—that was on the day of the first examination—I made an</p>

               <p>application to Mr. A'Beckett, the Magistrate; I asked him if he would object to my taking Gamett's confession—he had said he was guilty, and he would confess it all, and I applied to Mr. A'Beckett—he said, "You may take it on your own responsibility, and if you take it it must be taken in the presence of some superintendent of police"—I communicated all those facts to you (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Parry</hi>) and it was under your advice that I took it—you told me that if it was taken, before the inspector, and no hopes were held out to the prisoner, that I decidedly bad better take the evidence—you told me distinctly to caution him that whatever he said would he used against him as evidence—it was never suggested in any way at that time to call Garnett as a witness—you also advised that whatever statement was taken should be taken in the presence of an inspector of police, or a responsible person—upon that I took the statement—it was voluntarily made by him—it was read over to him—he signed it, and said it was all true—I had held out no hopes to him whatever—he said he could not give me a long statement of how he became connected with the Stowells, but when he was committed to prison he would write me another statement, and I should have that—I remember calling and seeing Garnett in Newgate—I went to the Governor and told him I was the solicitor for the prosecution, and he had pleaded guilty, and asked him if he would send somebody with me to see Garnett—one of the officers stood close by—I do not know whether Garnett could see him, but the officer could hear everything that took place—I did not read over to Garnett all the statement of his evidence—I do not doubt that the per<lb></lb>sons I requested to be with me, could hear, they stood as close to me as that gentleman is (<hi rend="italic">pointing to some one in Court</hi>)—since these indictments have been preferred, Thomas Stowell has absconded; ever since 2nd Feb—after the warrant was granted for his apprehension, the indictments were removed to the Queen's Bench, and the bail was so bad that they granted a <hi rend="italic">procedeado</hi>, so as to have a speedy trial in this Court, and from that period we could not apprehend him—I know the names of the bail, one was Boucher—since these indictments have been preferred I have seen John Stowell at my office; it was just after last Session; no, the Session before last—at that time his brother Thomas was out of the way—I did not send for him to my office; I was over at the County Court one day, and Mr. Davis, who was the attorney for the defendants, came to me and said something—Stowell asked me whether this thing could not be compromised; I told him Mr. Kennett had no vindic<lb></lb>tive feelings against him, and if he could prove it was a mistake we would not continue the prosecution—he told me it was a mistake, and that he had been suspended from the Inland Revenue Office—I told him I did not mind writing a letter to the Inland Revenue Office, with any explanation he could give; upon that I believe they instructed Mr. Ballantine to see you on the subject, and to compromise the matter—it was not with the intention of any<lb></lb>body compromising it unless it was proved to be a mistake—I did not see John Stowell on any other occasion, but on that occasion he offered to give me up the I O U's, and to pay the expenses of the prosecution—I do not know whether he mentioned any sum, or whether Mr. Davis did—Mr. W. B. Davis, was his attorney at the time—I know that from John Stowell—he acted as his attorney up to two or three weeks ago—I saw him here attending to this matter the Session before last, but not this Session—Thomas Stowell was a clerk to Mr. Davis—I have proceeded with these indictments.</p>

               <p>I heard the summing up of the learned Judge, and the verdict of Not Guilty of the Jury—I have not been in communication with Mr. Parry as to what evidence I could give; I told him what I was able to state—I told him that last Session—I was going to have been examined last Session if it was neces<lb></lb>sary—I left it to Mr. Parry to say whether he called me or not—I have told Mr. Parry to say exactly what my evidence was—I should think I have known Kennett about eighteen months—John Stowell has been to me to offer me to compromise—I did not dine with him, I had some dinner in the same room as he had last Session, and at the same table—I never told him that if I had been concerned for him I would have got him his money long ago; never in my life that I am aware of; never to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I am speaking of a thing which if it occurred at all, occurred within the last five or six weeks; will you pledge your oath you did not say so? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have no doubt whatever if I had said such a thing I should have remem<lb></lb>bered it, and I have not the slightest knowledge of saying anything of the kind—I positively swear I did not say it—I did not share the dinner with Stowell—they were in a room up stairs—I went and had a little bit of dinner, and I paid for my own dinner—I paid for the wine, Stowell did not drink any of it—I have known Kennett eighteen months or two years, he gave a piece of paper to Broome—I was in custody at that time, I do not mind stating that I gave a bill—I was in custody on a charge of bill stealing, there was no prosecution at all—Broome was the person who charged me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> After he had received the piece of paper he let you off? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did not let me off, for he swindled me; but the charge was withdrawn by Mr. Roberts, who apologized to me—that was after the piece of paper was given by Kennett to Broome—I have paid 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on that piece of paper—the bills I was charged with stealing amounted to 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not call on John Stowell at any time, or send any card to him, or call on anybody on his behalf, or leave any message—I do not know of any dinners being sent to Garnett while he was in gaol—I believe that none were ever sent to him—I sent no clothes in to him, nor do I believe any were sent—I sent none to him in Newgate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Directly or indirectly have you contributed to that man's support, or done anything to induce him to believe you were support<lb></lb>ing him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nothing whatever; Mr. Broome is the prize fighter of the Haymarket—he came to the office where I was articled, and asked me if I could get him the money—he came on Saturday morning and said he wanted the money very particularly, and if I would go with him he could get it—I went with him to Mr. Jones, of the Paragon, and he said be would do it on Monday—Broome was stopping outside with his horse and gig, and I had given Mr. Jones a check for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that morning—Broome wanted the money very badly, and I gave him the check which I had got back again, and on the Monday afternoon I handed him a check for the balance—I refused to give up the bill till he paid the money, and he gave me in charge for stealing the bill—I was defrauded to the amount of 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I was afterwards told how they divided the money, and I have got a letter from one of the party who defrauded me, giving me the history of it.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you asked me if I wanted anything, and I said I wanted a pair of stockings, and a clean shirt, you sent it to me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never did; I do not know who paid for your victuals from 28th Jan. to 4th Feb.—I visited you in this prison; I have stated exactly what passed—I never heard you ask me to send you in two pairs of socks; I never contributed a penny, or sent you anything, or let you have a farthing of money, or paid for any single thing for you—I do not know who sent you the last two shirts and a pair of new drawers—I never contributed anything towards them, and I do not know who did—I never told you to write to any body—I never sent anybody to you to tell you to plead Guilty; I do not know Hawse.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Garnett. Q.</hi> Which prison did the party come to see me in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was not in the prison, it was at the Southwark police-station; on the evening you were apprehended, a gentleman named Bevitt came—I think he came from Mr. Charnock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. EDWIN</hi>. I am chief clerk of Southwark police court. There were no depositions taken by me in this case—these depositions are in the writing of the second clerk; that indicates that he took them—he is not here.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you here last session? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yea; I was in a room in the neighbourhood in which John Stowell was—I saw Mr. Preston come in, he did not join Stowell more than he did me—we had a rump steak, and a bottle of port wine—I do not think he spoke to Mr. Stowell so much as to Mr. Bussell, who was there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wagoner, and live in Buckinghamshire. On the 19th of September, I went into a beer-shop at Ealing and drank, and took my whip with me—I sat down in the corner, between twelve and one o'clock, for about an hour, and then missed my whip—they said that a young man with a striped jacket had taken it—I went into the stable where my horses were feeding, and took the traces off one and rode after him, and took the prisoner with the whip.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable T</hi> 67.) I met the prisoner and the prosecutor as I was on duty—the prosecutor said to him, "Where is my whip which you stole?"—he said, "I did not steal any whip, I have not got any whip"—I then stopped Deane's cart of fruit that he was driving, and found this whip concealed in the back of the cart among the fruit baskets.</p>

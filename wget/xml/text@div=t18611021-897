I keep the Freemason's-arms, Hill-street, Wail worth—it is in Lambeth parish, I think—I have been there but a short time—on the night before 19th September, I shut up the house about a quarter to 12 o'clock—I saw the doors and windows safe—I was called up about a quarter past 4 by the police—as I went down stairs I heard a scuffling at the back part of the house—I went to the back of the house and saw two men getting over the walls—I looked to see which way they went—they went over the back garden walls in the direction of where William Moss lives—there is no other way to get away—I looked over the place—I went to the bar first, and found this jemmy lying on the floor, and then I went to the door and let the police in—there was only one policeman there then, and he had custody of the prisoner Lawrence—he did not come in, nor any one else at that time—I then shut the door again, and went in the cellar, and there I found this pair of boots—they do not belong to any one in my house—I found they had got over the wall and come through the window that is made in the cellar to let in the air and light—I had shut that myself the night before—that is not what I call the cellar door—I then came up stairs, found that the lock of the cellar door had been forced, and by that means they had got access to the passage—they then broke the bar parlour door open, and that gave them access to the bar—they emptied the tills—there was nothing in them but fifteen, sixteen, or eighteen shillings in coppers; I do not know exactly how much—I went and looked in the bar parlour, and found that this work box had been broken open—I missed six silver tea spoons, two bracelets, a silver snuff-box with an inscription on it, a five-shilling piece,</p>

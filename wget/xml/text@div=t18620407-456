                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, H</hi> 169). On 28th November, about half-past 1 o'clock in the morning, or the middle of the night, I was on duty in High-street, Whitechapel, and saw the prisoner, and one named William Smith,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186204070086"></xptr>
               <p>and two others whom I do not know—the prisoner had a basket with a little straw in it—I observed him and Smith go up to Mr. Crouch's window, 110, High-street, Whitechapel—the other two placed themselves apparently to watch for the police—I was watching—I placed myself in a dark doorway a hundred yards, I may say, from them—I saw the prisoner and Smith pull the bar out and slip the shutter on one side, smash a pane of glass, and pull out something white, which afterwards appeared to be calico, and several other articles—Smith gave them to Barrett, who placed them in the basket, which was standing in a doorway close by—that was the basket he was carrying—I then pulled the tails of my coat round me, put my hat under my arm, made a rush at them and secured Smith—the prisoner ran up Com<lb></lb>mercial-street—I then went back and found the calico in the basket, and several other articles—I found that the window had been broken—that house and shop are in the parish of Whitechapel—the place where the offence was committed was right under a lamp, so that I could see very plainly—I got up to the men before they retreated: in fact, I had Smith in custody before the men saw me—Barrett ran away, and I next saw him on 10th December, at the Thames Police-court—he was remanded till the 20th on a charge of haying a quantity of clothes in his possession—he was sentenced on 20th December, to two months' imprisonment—I had no doubt what ever, when I saw him, that he was the man I had seen at Mr. Crouch's—I was certain of him—when he was discharged I took him into custody on this charge of burglary—I gave the calico up in December last when that sentence was passed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a draper, living at 110, High-street, White<lb></lb>chapel—on the morning of 28th November, the police called me up about half-past 1 o'clock—I went to the station and found a man, named Smith, in the custody of a policeman—another officer came there subsequently—I lost a considerable quantity of goods from the window, but the calico was the principal—they had been safe the night before—the place was all properly secured when I went to bed the night before at 11 o'clock—I saw the property that the policeman produced, and identified it—my house is in the parish of St. Mary, Whitechapel—the property was produced at the trial, and I swore to its identity.</p>

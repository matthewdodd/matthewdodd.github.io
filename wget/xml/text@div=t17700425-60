He walked with me seven or eight yards, I believe, and then bid me stop, and put a pistol to my head, and said, If I spoke a word he would blow my brains out; then Milbank, the evidence, came up, and put another pistol to my head, and said the same; then up came Newman, and put a pistol to my head, and took hold of Milbank's pistol while Milbank placed me against the wall. (I had seen Newman before about the street). Then they began to take my money out of my pocket. Newman and Bowers held the pistols; Milbank unbuttoned my breeches to see for my watch. I had none. Then he took three guineas and a half out of my fob, a quarter guinea and sixteen shillings out of my breeches pocket; they felt in my other pockets, and found nothing else. They then bid me go about my business, and not speak a word, for if Idid, they would kill me on the spot. I went about seven or eight yards; they followed me, and bid me shop again, and placed me up against the wall, with the pistol at my head again. They cut off my waistcoat pocket, with seven shillings worth of halfpence in it, and a pen-knife: they then bid me go about my business, and not say a word. I went a little farther; there came a cart and three or four men; I hallooed to them for assistance; they did not hear me; the cart making such a noise, I imagine, prevented them. Then the prisoners called to me again. I ran as hard as I could till I got into the Crooked Billet alehouse. There was a fourth man, but he stood behind Milbank; I could not make any observation of him; he did not come near me. The prisoners were taken the same night, and the people came to me at the Crooked Billet for me to see them. I went to see them, and they had broke out of the Bail-dock in Whitechapel, and were not taken again till the last day of last sessions. I went upon the Sunday after to Tothill-fields Bridewell, there I saw Milbank, and knew him directly. I did not see the rest till they were brought before Sir

            . On the 26th of January I took Kellyhorn, about eleven at night, out of his lodgings in East Smithfield. I brought him about half way from Salt petre Bank; he said. Put a pair of hand-cuffs on me, and I'll go and shew you the others that were with me, that did a robbery this night: accordingly I did; he went where Bowers was in bed. I took him, and Newman came to see what was the matter; then Kellyhorn said, That is another that was with us in the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this?</p>
               <p>Paggett. This was in Black-horse yard in East Smithfield. He said, Bowers, Newman, and Milbank, were with him; Milbank was in bed in Black-horse yard, at another house; he got off: we took them up to Whitechapel, and locked them up in the Bail-dock; Bowers and Newman broke out; we had Kellyhorn in another lock-up place, thinking he should be admitted an evidence; and he was admitted at the Rotation, and was out upon bail, on purpose to find Bowers and Newman again.

               <p>Paggett. I do not know whether he did or not; he was told of it afterwards; and he said he could not then go from it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take Kellyhorn again when he was upon bail?</p>
               <p>Paggett. He was taken up upon Milbank's evidence for this robbery, by Sir John's warrant, and carried before him. I told Sir John what had passed, and produced the information. I think Mr. Camper was one that took the information.</p>

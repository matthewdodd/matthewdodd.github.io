            . I am a patrol of Bow-street. On the 15th of April I was going down White Horse-street, and met the prisoner Harris carrying four deal boards on his shoulder. I asked him where he was going - he said to Westle's house, (the other prisoner.) They were both strangers to me. I then asked where he brought them from - he said from Fox's, in the Commercial-road - that Westle had bought them of Mr. Fox, and was to pay him so much a week. I took him back to Mr. Fox's, and some persons were working there. I then asked Westle who was there where he got these timbers from; he said it was his own; he had been doing a job at Limehouse. I sent the foreman over to Mr. Fox - he said it was his property, and he had given him no liberty to take it; they then both begged his pardon.</p>
               <p>The property was produced, but the prosecutor declined to swear to it.</p>

In the morning he and I went about in St Katherine's, where the Spaniards and Portugueze use, and in every house left a description of the watch and man, and told where I liv'd. We could find nothing of him. Before I sat down to dinner came the landlord of the first house that we had call'd at, and said, he had heard of the man that robb'd me, and the watch too. He said the man had been taken up on the other side the water for stealing a watch, and he was set clear, on condition of being sent to sea. I went along with him, and found the prisoner. We search'd him, and found an arbitration-bond upon him, which he pretended was a protection. Produc'd in court.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my property. This was in my pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Neal. He speak tolerable English. I charg'd him with stealing a watch out of my shop. He acknowledg'd he had sold one that morning, and took us to the place where he had sold it in the Minories. It appear'd to be the prosecutor's watch. We brought him before my Lord-Mayor. Then I begg'd of my Lord-Mayor to let an officer go and inquire after the directions of that bond; and the result of that inquiry brought out this matter. Captain

The prisoner is my son-in-law, and has been to sea; I married his mother - he came to my house when he pleased; he slept there on Monday and Tuesday, the 3d and 4th of December; and on Wednesday, after dinner, he went off, to go to Gravesend. I missed twenty-three sovereigns, and 15l. in Bank notes, on Thursday, when I came home to dinner - it was in a box; I may not have seen it safe for four or five months before - my wife found the box broken open.</p>

            . Between five and six o'clock last Friday, the watchman brought the prisoner to the watch-house, charged with robbing Brown of 38l.; I asked Brown how he knew it was him; he said, "Because nobody else was there;" his wife was not there: he said, that in coming home the prisoner had ran away - he called Stop thief! the watchmen caught him, and they brought him to me - I found seven sovereigns and 16s. 1 1/2d. on him. When I took the charge, the prisoner said he had taken the money at different times; he said, "I took eleven sovereigns last Wednesday;" he said so to Brown, when I was taking the charge.</p>
               <p>JAMES BROWN re-examined. I went to Gravesend after him, and brought him back; he offered me seven sovereins to let him go, but did not then say he had taken the money.</p>

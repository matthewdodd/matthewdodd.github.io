               <p>Mr. SIMEON sworn.</p>
               <p>On Monday the 19th of August, I was going out at the fore door between 11 and 12, and I perceived the prisoner coming up the area steps, I followed him into Love-lane, and asked him what he had there, he said he did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178209110039"></xptr> not know, but he was to carry it to Billingsgate; I bid him set it down, I sent for a constable who inspected the hamper, and it contained seven bottles of wine, and a bladder full of wine, all red-port, except one bottle of white-wine; I charged Buston with the fact.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am clerk to Mr. Simeon. On the 17th of August the prisoner Buston told me he had orders to bottle three dozen of wine; he came a quarter past 9 on Monday morning, I went down to the cellar and found him and

             the other prisoner talking together in the cellar, and saying that he was almost ready; he told me he suspected the cellar was robbed, he was obliged to carry the empty bottles in from another place: after Mr. Simeon came in I followed him down the cellar, Buston begged not to be exposed, Ashley said nothing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That gentleman delivered me the keys of the cellar.</p>
               <p>Court. What is Ashley? - I do not know, I did not expect to see him there.</p>
               <p>PRISONER BUSTON's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was employed by that gentleman, he gave me the keys out of the counting-house, and he followed me down into the cellar, and he gave me another key to get some bottles, I could not get them down by myself, this man whom I have long known, chanced to be there, and I asked him to lend me a hand; this gentleman followed us down into the cellar, and he gave us two glasses of wine a-piece.</p>
               <p>Martinius. What wine was this that was in the bladder and in the bottles? - I believe it was red wine.</p>
               <p>To Simeon. What wine was it and where was it taken from? - I know nothing more than the man's own confession; he unpacked it in the presence of the constable, I tasted it, and found it to be red-port, it has been in his possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any seal upon the bottles? - No my Lord.</p>
               <p>To Simeon. What did Buston say when you brought him back? - He appeared by his countenance as I thought to be guilty, he desired to speak with me in a private room; he then begged I would not prosecute him as we had got the property again, I told him I could not pass over it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Buston, called five witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>

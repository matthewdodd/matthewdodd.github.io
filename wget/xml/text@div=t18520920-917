Smith, and the woman who is not here, passed our shop, and looked very hard in—they then went a little way past it, returned, and looked in again—in consequence of that, I went and watched them into Mr. Vaughan's shop—I watched them out—they walked a little way up Aldgate, towards the Minories, and I followed them to a public-house, where they went in—I looked through the door, and saw them pull out what appeared to be the alpaca, and look at it—I then went to Mr. Vaughan's shop, and spoke to Tomlinson—I saw the prisoners taken into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of William Abner Vaughan, draper, of 19 and 20, Aldgate. On Thursday evening, 26th Aug., Smith and another woman, who is not here, came into my master's shop—I waited on them—the woman who is not here asked for some calico, which I showed her—she purchased some, and then asked to see some silks—in order to get the silks, I had to go to the show-room upstairs, and I left them by the counter—there was no one but them on that side of the shop—I brought the silks down to them, and showed them to them—they did not purchase any from that lot—I showed them some more, and the other woman purchased two yards of black—while I was serving them, they looked at some alpacas which were on the counter, but did not purchase any—they did not look at any shawls—I recognise this alpaca produced as ours, but I know nothing of the shawls—nothing more here belongs to us, except the goods they bought—I am quite sure I did not sell them the alpaca—we have lost a piece of a similar pattern to this, which I had seen safe the evening these women were there.</p>

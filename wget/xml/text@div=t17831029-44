               <p>Prisoner's Council. Your only wish was to come at the goods? - I am a man of property, and I could have afforded to have lost it.</p>
               <p>But in your lenity to the prisoner, you informed him that if he would give a clue to the goods, he should receive favor? - He said, I had been the best of masters, and he would tell the truth.</p>
               <p>Do not you apprehend he expected favor? Was not he threatened by the Magistrate? - The Magistrate behaved exceedingly well throughout the business, and that you said yourself: You said, he knew the law very well.</p>
               <p>The locks were not found on the prisoner? - No, Sir, but he sold them to your client.</p>

I hope the prosecutor will give me a character.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. You know prisoner, I had the highest opinion of you, and if you had wanted ten guineas I would have lent them to you: There were no threats used: You looked at the things on the desk, and owned every circumstance.</p>

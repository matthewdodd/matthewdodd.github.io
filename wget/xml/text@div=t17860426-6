               <p>I live at Mr. Lewis's, the King's Arms, Little Chelsea; on Tuesday morning the 11th of this month, I remember a person came to our house between six and seven, I was in bed, I came down and opened the gate.</p>
               <p>Who did you find there? - There was a young man with five horses, he rode one of them, and led the other four.</p>
               <p>What fort of a horse did he ride? - It was a chesnut horse, a very tall horse; he took the horses into the stables, he came into the kitchen where my mistress was lighting the fire, from thence he went to the tap room and pulled off his boots; and told me to clean them; he had one spur on, and he pulled that off, and hung it up in the kitchen; he ordered me to buy him a pair of stockings, and he put them on, and put his slippers on, and went to the barber's, and staid there till breakfast time; the horses were in the stable.</p>
               <p>How long did they all continue there? - They were there for three days; over night a person brought two more, and took away one of his, that was a little black horse; the prisoner laid there one night.</p>
               <p>Do you remember any thing particular of the chesnut horse? - I took him to the farrier's to have one bar shoe put on his fore foot, I cannot say which foot, I believe I took him on the Tuesday afternoon, he wanted a shoe when he came in, I had no conversation with the man.</p>
               <p>Should you know the man again? - Yes, I believe I should, the justice's men took him into custody, and one of them took the spur away, it was hanging in the same place in the window.</p>
               <p>Was the spur they took the same he took off and hung up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is that the person that came with the horses? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure about it? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did you find any thing else in the house? - No Sir: after this I came home and saw my lord's servants, they shewed me an odd spur, and I recollected that I had seen such a spur in Lewis's kitchen, and I desired Shallard, who went down, to take care of it; and I shewed the tall chesnut horse to several people that came from the country, he is at Froome's livery stables in Covent Garden.</p>

               <p>My Lord I have employed counsel.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. It is not in my power to make a speech to the jury for you; if you think you can relate any facts, you may.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury. I was at Gainsborough fair on Saturday preceding the Monday evening, when these horses were stolen from thence; I went to London on a horse I then had, and from London I went to a place called By-waters; at Aylesbury I bought two long tailed horses, which have since been owned, for which I paid eighteen guineas, and I bought a chesnut horse for six guineas, he is foundered; Mr. Williams observed to me that he knew I had some connections in the New Forest, in Hampshire, and that he could help me to some forest colts, he should be at Hammersham on the Monday evening, and he desired me to meet him; accordingly I went to Two Waters, to Cheyney, and from thence to Hammersham; he is, I find out now, a notorious horse stealer; I had bought many of him before, but they never turned out in this way; I met him with only one horse, I was surprised he had no more, he said, I have some in the neighbourhood, and my horse is almost tired; says he, if you will lend me your horse, and one of your spurs, I shall overtake you; accordingly I proceeded on, and got as far as Hounslow Heath, at the further end there his horse was tired, and knocked up; I tied him to the gate and walked on to Shepherds-bush, and there I met two gentlemen, one of whom I knew extremely well; and while we were in conversation, up came Williams with the horses in hand; I told him he was tired, the horses came up, I agreed for them, and I paid twenty-eight pounds (two ten pound notes, and the rest in cash;) he gave one of the gentlemen the notes to look at, for he could not read; after that he went about his business, I saw him no more; I found I was cheated in my horses, one was broken winded, and the other horse had an injury in one of his fore legs, so that he was not worth three guineas, the broken winded one was not worth two guineas and a half. This is all I have to say in my defence, Gentlemen, which I submit to the Court.</p>

I received a jacket from Starling, and put it into my box - I did not miss it till it was found in the possession of the witnesses, who are here. The prisoner had lodged in the house for two nights, but she had no right in my room - I had not seen her before.</p>

            . I live at Chelsea. The prisoner lodged at the next house; I met her in the street with a bundle; she asked me if I would have something to drink, which I did - she then went out, and came in with some College men - she afterwards came to my house, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182512080037"></xptr>said, "Here is a jacket, which has been given to me by a friend - it will make your husband a good waistcoat" - she said I could take the lace off, and she would call for it at ten o'clock next day - when my husband came home he said it was too good to be given away.</p>
               <p>THOMAS GAHAGAN. I saw the jacket, and over-hauled it - I saw the serjeant's name on it - I went and found him, and gave information.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. That man gave me the jacket for 1s., which I had lent him when I took my dinner on Sunday in his room. I did not know what to do with it - I asked this woman, and she said she could take the lace off and make a jacket of it.</p>
               <p>JURY to JOHN BLIGHT. Q. Did not you say she had no business in your room at that time? A. She had no business at all there; she lived in the lower room. I did not give it to her.</p>

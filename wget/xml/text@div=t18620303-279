                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Brown, a stationer, of 68, Leadenhall-street, at that time, but we were removing—we kept a post-office there, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186203030019"></xptr>
               <p>for that purpose kept a considerable quantity of money in the second till at the window-end of the counter—on 15th February there were 56 sovereigns in a bowl in that till—a person standing on the ground, could not reach over the counter to the till—between 1 and 2 o'clock that day the prisoner Hall came into the shop for a sheet of paper to wrap something in—he had nothing with him to wrap up—I handed him one or two sheets which did not suit, and he went with me to the back of the counter, where he took a seat, selected a sheet, and paid for it—I was alone in the shop, Mr. Brown was at a funeral—I am not aware whether Hall had an opportunity of seeing where the money was kept, as I do not know whether I served a customer while he was there—having obtained a sheet of paper he left the shop—shortly afterwards he came in again for a larger sheet—I had several money orders to attend to, and said, "Will you go to the other end of the shop and see if you can find a larger sheet, while I am serving these customers?"—not many minutes elapsed before I went to him—no one was then left at the other part of the shop; he and I were the only persons in the shop (in attending to the customers I had had occasion to open the drawer where the money was; it was the money-order drawer)—I heard a slight noise, raised my head, and saw the other prisoner on the counter lifting the bowl of sovereigns up in his baud—I rushed to him—I do not know whether I shoved him round; but he tried to put some of the sovereigns into his pocket, and some of them were thrown upon the ground—some one came to the door, and I held George till a policeman came—not above a minute or two had then elapsed—Hall stood looking on, but did nothing; he was standing about six or seven feet from the door—he emptied the money out of his pocket when he saw that there was no means of escape—George opened Hall's pocket and put the money into it, while Hall stood perfectly still—he emptied it on the counter almost directly it had happened—he did not endeavour to assist me in any way—he said something, but I forgot what—they were both given in custody—two sovereigns fell outside on the door eill, which were picked up and given to the policeman—they were all found.</p>

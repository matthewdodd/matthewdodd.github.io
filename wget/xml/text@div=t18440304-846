                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist, and live at No. 8, Wentworth-place, Mile-end-road. On Friday, 1st March, I went out in my chaise with Mr. Oldmeadow—I returned home about half-past nine o'clock in the evening—I am sure it was past nine—I went in doors—I observed that the window was not broken at that time—about a quarter past ten I was called out—I went out, and crossed the road, through Assembly-place—I saw the prisoner there with Oldmeadow—I assisted him in picking up some cigars—this band was also found at the place, which I can swear to having put on the cigars in my shop—the cigars exactly correspond with those I lost—about a quarter of an hour after, I examined my shop window, and found a third of the square broken out, which was space sufficient for a hand to be put in, and the bundles taken out—I missed a bundle of cigars from the window, and a great number of bundles had rolled close to the opening, and would have rolled through had it not been blocked up with boxes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an artist. I went out with Mr. Jones in his <hi rend="italic">gig</hi> on the 1st of March—we returned about half-past nine o'clock—he went in doors, and I took the chaise to the stable—about ten minutes or a quarter past ten, as I was crossing the road, returning to the shop, I saw the prisoner at the window, going from one end of it to the other, in a stooping position—he did not see me—I went towards the window—one shutter was put up, and the man was coming down with another to put up—I saw the prisoner run away from the window—I followed him across the road, laid my hand on him, and said, "What did you do against that shop window just now?"—he said, "What?"—I said, "What did you do at that shop win<lb></lb>dow?"—he walked about three yards, till we got by Assembly-passage, when he struck me under the chin, and said, "What the h—is that to you?"—I staggered back a little, and he ran down a passage as hard as he could—I followed, crying, "Stop thief"—while following him, I saw him hurl some<lb></lb>thing from him up against a dark corner—it struck against the wall, and something rattled about—I did not know at the time what it was—I conti<lb></lb>nued chasing him, hallooing, "Stop thief"—a boy was also running, hal<lb></lb>looing too—when he got to the end of the passage he made a little bit of a shoot to the corner, and then came walking gently back—I never lost sight of him—I was close to him—a policeman ran from the other side of the way, and took him into custody—he was brought back, in my presence, to the spot where I had seen him hurl something against the wall—the policeman lent me his lantern—I looked on the ground, and saw some cigars lying all around—I picked some up—Mr. Jones came up, and also picked up some—after we returned from the station, I saw this band picked up, about a yard and a half from the corner, opposite where the things had struck against—the passage is not very wide—I have been by the place since, and find it is a dark corner, where there are two or three coach-houses.</p>

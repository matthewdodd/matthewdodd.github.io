Hoare's—I miss a leaf from my blank cheque-book—the cheque which was produced is the same number and the same appearance—the entire leaf is taken out—I did not join it into the book, because it has been cut or torn afterwards, and would not have fitted—part of the counterfoil was left when it was pro<lb></lb>duced—on the Saturday morning, at 12 o'clock, the prisoner went out and never came back—I was not in the least aware that she was going to leave—my cheque book was kept sometimes in a drawer, and sometimes in a desk, both of which were locked—the prisoner may have got access to my keys—Crouch left my service on 7th June.</p>

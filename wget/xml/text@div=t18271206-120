On the 26th of November these articles were taken from the stables of the Earl of Darnley, which are occupied by Mr. Stanley - I saw the prisoner in the house that morning; he was in his service; he came on the 3d of November, and I delivered him his livery, and on the 26th, he suddenly absconded from the stables, and we found his clothes were gone; they were to last him twelve months, and his greatcoat two years - I told Mr. Stanley, who desired me to go to the office; he was taken on Wednesday night.</p>

            . I am coachman to Mr. Stanley. I was sent into the country with a note, on Monday morning - I returned before one o'clock, and missed the prisoner from the stable - I went up stairs, and missed his clothes from the room - I met him in Oxford-street, on Wednesday night, and asked him about the things; he said he could get them, and would bring them in the morning, all but the great-coat, which he had sold to a Jew for a sovereign; his brother was with me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Had he not warning to leave? A. Yes; he said he would bring the things to his brother's - I said, if he brought them back, nothing would be done to him. I took him the same night, as he said the coat was sold; he said they were in the care of Sarah Scott - I did not go to see for them. I believe he is a respectable lad.</p>

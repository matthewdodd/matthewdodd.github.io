I met the prisoner in Quebec-street, New-road, on 18th Dec, about ten o'clock in the evening, with a sack on his shoulder, and something in it—I followed him to Gloucester-street, New-road, where I met another constable and took him with me—I stopped the prisoner, and said, "Lake, what have you got in that sack?"—he said, "Nothing"—I said, "I think you have"—he threw it down and said,</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Thomas Langham, a butcher, of Oxford-terrace, Edgeware-road. The policeman showed me the mutton—it had been in my employer's slaughter-house—I had dressed it—there was the whole sheep, except the entrails—it had been hung up to be sold—I have seen it since—this is a bone of it, I know it was the same animal—the staple of the slaughter-house was forced off the door, the tiles taken off, and some one had got in, and forced open the door with a pole-axe—I saw the sheep safe about half-past six o'clock that evening—I should think the prisoner was taken about three-quarters of a mile from our place.</p>

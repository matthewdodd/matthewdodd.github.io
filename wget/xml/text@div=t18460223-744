                  </hi>. I live with my father Mark Mayhew, in Richard-street, Limehouse. On Tuesday morning I was cleaning the doorway, there was five yards of flannel on the dining-room table, near the window—I saw the prisoner pass by close to the window, with his arm in a sling, and turn back—I then went into the house with a broom, and came out with a pail, to clean the door, the prisoner turned back to the next door, and stood still while I cleaned the step—I went in and missed the flannel off the table—it could be reached by a person putting his hand in at the window—I called out, "Some<lb></lb>body has stolen my flannel"—Mrs. Pitts said, "Run round the corner"—I ran and saw the prisoner with the flannel in his hand—I called, "Stop thief," and he dropped it—I took it up and gave it to the policeman.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did not you tell the Magistrate at the first examination you could not say it was me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I said I could swear to you—the prisoner had another person with him, when he first passed the window—(<hi rend="italic">the witness's deposition being read agreed with her evidence.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I apprehended the prisoner in Limehouse, and told him I took him on suspicion of stealing flannel—he denied it—on the way to the police-court, he said, "I will defy you to give me more than ten years"—I was before the Magistrate, and did not hear the witness say she did not know him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am errand boy to Mr. Sykes, a commission agent, of 57, Carter Lane, Doctors' Commons—on 21st November, about noon, I was in the office by the fire; I turned round, but saw no one—I heard another footstep, turned round, and saw the prisoner taking the coat—I jumped up instantly, and the prisoner walked through the passage, I followed him, and took the coat from him on the doorstep—he got shuffling about and said he would tell Mr. Sykes—I followed him across the road—he said he would go and have some dinner—he went down Creed Lane—I brought him back to my place, my employer was not there, and I asked him to go with me to the Horn Tavern in Knightrider Street—when he got as far as Paul's Chain, he said he would not go any further, and he offered me money to let him go—the policeman came up and I gave him in charge—this is the coat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

On 21st November, about noon, I saw the last witness and the prisoner together in Paul's Chain—the witness charged him with stealing a coat from the office—the prisoner said he had not touched the coat—I took him to the station, and found on him thirteen keys, a pocket-book containing letters and documents, an empty bag, a purse containing 7 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and three duplicates.</p>

I had business at his master's office as the documents found on me will show, I was trying to get orders as an agent—unfortunately I was convicted six years ago, but I have since earned my living respectably, and was in actual employment at the time I was accused of this offence. I have a sick wife and four infant children.</p>

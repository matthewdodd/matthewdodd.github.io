            . I saw Hodges turn into the prisoner's house one day, but I do not know on what day, nor what month - it was in the last year; I was on the opposite side of the way, and did not hear what passed.</p>
               <p>JAMES HANLEY re-examined. Q. When did you find this hair? A. On the 18th of August; we had apprehended the other four men on the 17th, and a warrant was taken out for the prisoner - we went there the next day, but he was not found till the 4th of this month, when the prosecutor met him in the street.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182810230051"></xptr>WILLIAM PURKIS re-examined. Q. Do you know at what time you were robbed? A. I had been robbed for two months before August, 1827. I can swear to this hair, as it had been washed out on the Monday before it was found - it was not washed to my mind, and I sent it to be washed again; I can swear to it - it must have been taken in that week: all the hair I lost was worth 3s. per lb.</p>
               <p>COURT to DANIEL MURPHY. Q. You were before the Magistrate on the 18th of August in last year; How long before that did you see the men take the hair to the prisoner's house? A. About a month; I was afraid of them, they were all big fellows - I saw them take the hair and put it round their waists, under their shirts; they took it to this man's house, and there they took it from their waists, and gave it to him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you come into my house? A. No- I stood at the door; I saw you standing at the door when they came - you went in, and they after you.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My friends are not here to rectify it; if you could put it off to another day I should be obliged; I can bring plenty of proof that it was not worth more than I gave for it.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. PURKIS. Q. Had you ever sold any horse-hair to the prisoner? A. No, never. I have some hair at 1s. per lb., but what I lost was worth 3s. per lb.</p>
               <p>JURY to DANIEL MURPHY. Q. What part of the 1s. per lb. did you have? A. I had none; they asked me to go and have something, but I did not; I had no promise of any thing - they said I knew of it, and if I told they would give me a good hiding, and be the death of me, no doubt. I staid away from Mr. Purkis' above a month.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the men take the hair from their persons, in the presence of the prisoner? A. Yes - I can swear he saw it there.</p>

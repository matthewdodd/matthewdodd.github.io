On the 7th of December, about ten o'clock in the morning, I had 13l. 4s. in silver in a bag - there was one crown-piece, upwards of twenty half-crowns, more than one hundred shillings, and more than twenty sixpences - I gave the bag to my lad to take to a place where I generally send my silver - he put it at the furthest end of the counter, from the door; I saw the prisoner about ten o'clock that morning - he came immediately the lad had gone down stairs; he asked for 1lb. of sausages - I served him with them; he gave me 1s., and I put 8d. in copper, which was the change, into the meat scale, but he did not take it up - he was at that time standing within reach of the bag- he left the shop without his change; a woman came in before he left - she stood about three yards from where the bag of silver was; the lad came into the shop while she was there, and the bag of silver was missed; I ran out to look for the man, and when I returned, the woman was still there, and they said had been there all the time - no other person but the prisoner and the woman came into the shop after the bag of money was put down till it was missed - I could not find the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe you found the man afterwards by his coming to your shop to ask you if you accused him of taking any property of yours? A. Yes, he came with another person, and I charged him with it - he asked if I had any charge against him; I gave him in charge - he was let go, and came of his own accord to the office next day, but I understood there was some guarantee for his appearing; the woman was not searched - another man surrendered; I did not describe him as a tall man - I did not say so to Mr. Lamonte; the prisoner said he worked at the engine, at the London-docks - I went there, and Heatley was taken, as he worked at the engine.</p>

            . I am in the prosecutor's service. On the 7th of December he gave me a bag of money - I laid it on the end of the counter; there was a scale about a foot from it - there was no one there but my master; I went into the cellar for a piece of beef - I returned in five minutes: my master told me to take the bag, and it was gone - there was only one woman in the shop, two or three yards from where the bag had been; my master went out, and the woman remained till he returned. On the evening of the 8th of December the prisoner came to the shop, said he had heard that master had been robbed, and that he was the man who had been in the shop at the time; I told him my master was not at home, but he would be in half an hour - he went out, and returned at that time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This was after your master had been making inquiries at the London-docks? A. Yes, and a man named Heatley had surrendered.</p>

            . I am headborough of Shadwell. On the 8th of December I took the prisoner, in the prosecutor's shop - the prosecutor charged him with stealing the bag; I took him to the watch-house - when we were there, he said he had taken the 6d. and 1 1/2d.; I put some questions about the pawnbroker, which he declined to answer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe you found him working at the docks? A. Yes, occasionally - I was loath to lock him up, and I left him with a friend or two while I went to make further inquiries - I let him go that night, and he came to the office next day of his own accord; before we parted that night I took a share of a pot of porter, and I believe there was a quartern of gin between six of us - Mr. Lamonte was present; the prisoner said Mr. Hows had given him trouble enough, and if he did not pay for it he would - I let him out because I had been to Mr. Hows, and he had received information that Samuel Heatley was the person who had committed the robbery: I knew where to find him, but Mr. Hows then came and said he was not the man, it was the prisoner he thought; we then parted- I went to the prisoner's house, and his wife said he had been to the shop, and I advised Mr. Hows not to press the charge - I then went to the public-house where the prisoner and his friends were, and I said, if he and his friends would answer in the sum of 20l. I would let him go; I took no regular bail - he came and delivered himself up the next morning; I ascertained that he was well known.</p>

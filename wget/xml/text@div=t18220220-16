            . I am a plumber and glazier. On the 28th of January, I was at work on the roof of Mr. Parson's house, in the back fields, Westminster; Carpenter's house is about thirty yards off; I was looking over a parapet, and saw Mascoe get in at the front parlour window of Carpenter's house; there was three men then standing by; I saw him give something out, which appeared to be linen - all the three had brown coats on; I could not swear Davis received it, but believe it was him - I saw him give it to another of them; Mascoe gave another bundle out, and all ran away; I went down and ran after them; I ran the contrary way, thinking to meet them - I saw Carpenter pursuing them, and saw him pick up the great coat in Palmer's-village, and in about two minutes, I saw Davis and Desman in custody, in a public-house; I believe them to be the men, for their dress, appearance, and size corresponded. I did not see the other two till last Saturday.</p>

            . I am a locksmith. On the 28th of January, I was at work opposite Carpenter's house, and heard an alarm; I ran out, and saw two young men running in a direction from Carpenter's, about one hundred yards off - I pursued, and called Carpenter out; I lost sight of them in turning the corner. One of them had a great coat under his arm, it was neither of the prisoners; I afterwards saw that coat in Carpenter's possession. We went into a public-house, and saw Davis and Desman having a pint of beer, and took them.</p>

            . I am the son of the prosecutor. I was at work just by the house; Milton called me - I joined him, he took a different direction; I saw nobody till I turned the corner, I then saw two young men running, and a great coat under one of their arms, and in turning the corner of the Bridewell, I lost sight of them; I saw them again on turning the other corner, three or four hundred yards off, they appeared to be the same, and were dressed in the same manner; I saw, what appeared to be the same great coat, on one of them - I cannot say whether it was either of the prisoners; he threw the great coat down,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200012"></xptr>I picked it up, it was my father's. I saw them in about five minutes, in the Prince of Orange, public-house, drinking a pint of beer; it is six or seven hundred yards from where the coat was thrown down.

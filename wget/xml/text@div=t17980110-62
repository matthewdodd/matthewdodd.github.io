               <p>Q. Were they in sacks, or in a heap? - A. In a heap; I missed the oats from there being a hole in the heap, of about a bushel, or such a matter as that. Last Friday week, about half past four in the afternoon, they had then done their day's work, I met the prisoner about half a mile on the high road, towards his own house, he had a bundle of straw upon his back, and I ordered him to lay it down, that I might look into it; he looked at it, and said it is very clean, and took some straw from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179801100083"></xptr>the bundle; I said, that was not what I was looking after, this is what I am looking after, and I took out a bag, which contained a little better than a bushel of oats; he said he did not know any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the bag of oats weigh more than the bundle of straw? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Could a man have a bag of oats in a bundle of straw without knowing it? - A. No; the oats that I found in the bag were of the same kind with those we had in the barn.</p>

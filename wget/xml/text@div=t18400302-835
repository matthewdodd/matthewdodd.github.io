                  </hi>. I live in George-street, St. Giles's—I have the care of a house belonging to Harriet Milberry—it is a house to which men and women are admitted. The prisoner applied for a lodging there on the 3rd of February—a young man came with her, who went away the next morning, at seven o'clock—the prisoner came down between nine and ten o'clock—she said she was very late from her work—she appeared stout—I went up stairs before I would let her go out, and on going into the next room to where she had been, I missed two sheets off one bed, and one off another—I came down, and met her going up—she said she had left some money under the pillow—I said I had missed three sheets, she said she had not got them—I searched her, and found two under her petticoat, and one under her shawl.</p>

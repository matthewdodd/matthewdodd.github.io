                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). On Friday, 24th July, I was at Messrs. Price's premises and saw Roberts loading a one horse van there—Archer was in the warehouse against where he was loading—I saw them speak to each other, and then Roberts handed Archer out a bag from his van—I saw Archer put his keg of driers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) into Roberts' provender bag—he handed it to Roberts and Roberts took it in the van—he took the van out<lb></lb>side and left it there to go back, I think, for his bill, because he brought some papers out in his hand—I got up in the van while he was away and marked the keg with a piece of chalk—the van was then driven away and I followed it as far as the new street and left it there—on the Sunday, in con<lb></lb>sequence of a communication I received from the officer Roper, I went with him to Grey's house, 2, Stacey Street, Soho—he is a painter and has a work<lb></lb>shop and cellar there—I told him we were two detective officers, and said "You were seen by this officer to take a keg of driers from a man of the name of Roberts, in the employ of Messrs. Price, on Friday morning"—he hesitated a little and then said "Well, yes, I had it"—he said that a man had left it at his place and that he had not paid anything for it—he said he had never seen the man before and did not know who he was—I said "Where is it," and he said" Down in the cellar"—we went into the cellar and I pointed to it and said "That is the one"—the chalk mark was on it then—Grey said "Well there are only three of us here, you need not take any notice of it unless you like; if a little feeing will do it I am your man, although only a little one"—when I got upstairs he said "Will you go and square it with your mate, I will give you 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the stuff shall be taken away from here, and it shall never be seen by anyone again"—I called Roper up then and Grey stated the same in his presence—I took him to the station.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I asked him how he could account for the colza oil, and whether he had got any bills for it—he said "No"—he did not remember how he got it or where he got it from—I said "Painters don't use colza oil, what are you going to do with it?"—he said "I don't know."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). I followed the van which contained the keg of driers to Grey's house—Roberts was the carman, and there was another man with him, who is not in custody—when he got to Stacey Street there was a little girl standing at the door, and she recognised him—he laughed at the little girl, and spoke to her, and took the keg into the pas<lb></lb>sage, he came out again followed by Grey and Roberts, led his horses</p>

               <p>down to the corner of Crown Street, and they went into a public-house—I went into another compartment—Roberts asked 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the keg first, and Grey told him he could not give him 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., as he was full of driers—Roberts then asked him to give him 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he said he could not, he could give him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., that was all—had it been oil or <hi rend="italic">turps</hi> he could have done with it—Roberts said "Well, let us have that," and I heard the jingle of money, as if it was passed, of course I could not see it—I was with Davies at the time he took Grey—I have heard his statement of what took place, and it is correct.</p>

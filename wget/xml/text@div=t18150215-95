            . I am a neighbour to Mr. Higginson, I saw the two prisoner's go out of my neighbours house, I knew one of them to be a bad character, knowing Greetrix, I watched her, I saw her go into the prosecutors shop, she came out she went to the other, I thought she gave her something, Greetrix immediately returned to the shop door; I immediately went and gave the prosecutor information, he looked round directly, and missed a piece of cotton.</p>
               <p>Q. to Higginson. Did you miss any thing - A. Yes, I missed a piece of cotton print from the door.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the prime cost of it - A. Twelve shillings. I had put it upon the horse inside of the shop, between five and ten minutes before, on my receiving information from the last witness, I went with the witness, and met Greetrix. I took her into custody. I took her into the shop, and charged her with the theft, she denied it, I sent for an officer. Plank the officer came. When Plank came she told me where to find the print.</p>
               <p>MR. PLANK. I took Greetrix into custody at Mr. Higginson's shop, I went with Greetrix to No, 2, Malborough-row, she told me the prisoner Adland was there in the kitchen, Adland was sitting there before the fire with something in her lap, I asked her what she had there, she said bacon, I took the bacon out of her lap, and under the bacon was this cotton.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is my own cotton, my own hand writing is upon it, in figures to the amount.</p>
               <p>Greetrix's Defence. The gentleman searched me and found nothing, he asked me where I was going to, I said to Malborough row, and on our going there the officer found the cotton in her lap. I am innocent of it.</p>
               <p>Adland's Defence. On my passing Cranby street, I had my apron on, a woman threw something into my apron, and instantly departed, it was dark, I could not see what it was, I had scarcely entered my home when a man entered my room, and owned the property I had in my lap, and took me in custody.</p>

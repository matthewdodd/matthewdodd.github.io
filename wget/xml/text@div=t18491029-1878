                  <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM SMITH</hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 244). On Sunday afternoon, 7th Oct., about four o'clock, I was on duty in West-street, Smithfield—I passed from John's-court into West-street, facing the end of Sharp's-alley—I there saw the prisoner, he had four or five thick sticks in his hand, similar to the one I pro<lb></lb>duce—he gave two, three, or four to other parties standing by his side, retaining one himself—I passed him, and at the end of Sharp's-alley the prisoner said, "Good morning"—I did not bid him the morning—he then said, "Good night," and flourished the stick about in his right hand, as I was passing him—he came up behind me, holding the stick in his right hand, and said, "I don't care for all the bpolice together;" and with that he aimed a blow at my head, which</p>
               <p>I attempted to ward off with my left arm—I knocked the stick out of his hand, and instantly caught him by the collar, and asked what he meant—I told him if he did that again I should take him to the station—I then let him go, and he made a blow at me on my collar, with his right hand, without a stick—I then took him into custody—he threw himself down—a struggle ensued, during which time I was stabbed—I did not see a knife in his hand—I received a slight scar in the neck, on the left hand, the left breast, and also on my knee—the stab in the breast had gone through my uniform body-coat, through my handkerchief doubled up, and two shirts, a linen and flannel shirt—that on my knee went through my trowsers and drawers—a great number of persons were standing round during the struggle; I should say from 120 to 150—the policeman, Savage, came to my assistance, and an officer of the Union—a great number of stones were thrown—the prisoner kicked and struck me very violently—he was taken to the station—I went to the police-surgeon on the Monday, and was under his care two days.</p>

                  </hi>. On Sunday afternoon, 7th Oct., I was standing at my father's door in West-street, Smithfield—I saw Smith, the policeman, standing a little way up Sharp's-alley, and saw the prisoner standing at the corner—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184910290030"></xptr>
               <p>walked up Sharp's-alley with one of the sticks in his hand—he brandished it behind the policeman's back—he would not take any notice of him—he then went before him and attempted to strike him—the policeman warded off the blow, and desired him to go away, which he refused to do—he then immedi<lb></lb>ately commenced again—with that the policeman took him—there then com<lb></lb>menced a terrible scuffle—the prisoner was very violent, and when he got to the end of Sharp's-alley, just into West-street, I observed, as he lay on the ground, that he had a clasp knife in his hand—it was open, and had a largish blade—he brandished it several times before the policeman—I went behind him and seized his arm, and he <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the knife out of his hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I live at 64, West-street, Smithfield. On Sunday after<lb></lb>noon, 7th Oct., I saw the prisoner and Smith scuffling together—the prisoner was underneath—he had thrown himself down—while I stood looking on, a knife flew out of the centre of the crowd and fell at my feet—I picked it up—the prisoner and Smith were in the middle of the crowd—the police after<lb></lb>wards came up, and he was taken into custody—there was a great struggle to get him away—I gave the knife up at the station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you see any policeman come up and strike the prisoner with his truncheon? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, the third one—he was kicked on the leg, or something—the policeman struck him a smart blow on the lower part of the leg—he was then on the ground, kicking—I think there were five policemen there at last—some stones were thrown—I did not see any of the other policemen strike the prisoner—I did not observe whether the prisoner was much hurt—I thought he was bruised, from the way in which he threw himself down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and a fellow of the College, and am surgeon to the City police—I examined Smith on 8th Oct.—he had received three punctured wounds, which were simple in themselves, but very important in regard to their locality—one was situated behind the angle of the left jaw, immediately over the most superficial part of the external carotid artery—one between the second and third ribs, on the left side, close to the breast bone, and the third immediately over the left knee-joint—I consider it a miracle that the man escaped with his life—I only had to attend him a day or two—it was not necessary for him to lay up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The wounds were so slight? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very slight—the wound in the neck was a punctured wound, it could not be done with a nail—it was about one-eighth of an inch in depth—my impression is, that the thickness of the covering prevented the wound in the chest from taking serious effect—I think the injuries were inflicted with the large blade of the knife—they were all wounds, the skin was divided. (The prisoner received a good character.)</p>

            . I am a policeman - on the 4th of December I had occasion to apprehend Colefax, and on his person I found a duplicate - I had heard of this robbery, and took the prosecutrix to the pawnbrokers, who identified the linen that was pawned to be her property - it was at Mr. Till's, St. Alban's-place, Edgware-road.</p>
               <p>RICHARD HALL re-examined. That duplicate refers to the linen I produced.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALESBY. Q.What is the duplicate for? A. A piece of linen pawned for 3s. - it was not written by myself, but by a lad who is in our shop - he is not here, but I took the linen in myself, and can swear it is the ticket I saw him make, and I pinned it on the linen.</p>
               <p>EDWARD JAMES LEVY (policeman). I had information that Abel was wanted, and apprehended him in Black-lion-lane - I told him I wanted him for felony - he said, "Very well," and walked a few yards with me; then said, "I have been had a few hours ago by a policeman, and am now going home, being discharged" - I found his statement false.</p>
               <p>MRS. STORTON. This is our linen.</p>
               <p>Abel's Defence. The pawnbroker told the magistrate he did not take the linen in, but his fellow-servant did; and he could not swear to the person.</p>
               <p>MARY WILLETT. I am married - my husband is a bricklayer, and lives at Kensington - I know the prisoner Colefax - I was present some weeks ago when he bought some cloth - it was fine linen cloth, very good - about a fortnight after he bought it, he took it out to pledge - I did not see him pledge it, I saw him take it out of the house - he was going to pawn it to get some money to go to market with- he bore a very good character indeed - he lives in Pell-street with his parents - he has lived there fourteen years- I never heard anything against him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.What is he? A. He goes to Portman-market, and Covent Garden - he goes about the street, selling fruit - he does not keep a donkey - he sells fruit, or fish, in a basket - I know he bought the cloth at the door of a hawker - it was a remnant - he paid 7s. for it - there was about five yards - I don't know whether that is the linen - I should not like to swear to it - this is the colour of the linen - it was bleached, and was white.</p>

               <p>John Orchard, of Grafton-court, Marylebone, and Mary Topping, of Kensington, gave the prisoner, Colefax, a good character.</p>
               <p>Abel. I was taken to Marylebone Office on the night of the robbery, and was discharged that very night, and afterwards taken again.</p>

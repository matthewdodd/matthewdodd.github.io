               <p>Q. How was it cut through? - A. By means of a centre-bit.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of an aperture was it? - A. Large enough to admit an arm in up to the shoulder, because I tried it. Upon looking, I found the most valuable part of my property in the lower window gone; watches, seals, rings, bracelets, and a number of articles stated in the indictment, to the amount of upwards of 200l.; how much more I cannot say; there were seven or eight pair of sugar tongs, I think eight, and there was a silver breast-plate, which I make for the Artillery Company; there were two or three hoop rings, and the settings of some pictures.</p>
               <p>Q. I am asking you as to those things that are found? - A. Yes, and many other articles. I gave information at Bow-street immediately, but heard nothing for a fortnight; I got my information from the accomplice (Clark, otherwise Lewis); in consequence of which, I went with Armstrong, Harper, Peach, and Wray, to the sign of the Trumpet, in Shire-lane, Temple-bar; I found Clifton and Seaton there; I went in first, and knew them to be the men by the description given me; in consequence of that, the officers put them in a coach and took them to Coldbath-fields; from thence we proceeded to some lodgings in Pinner's-court, Gray's-inn-lane, but they were locked; then we went to other lodgings in Wych-street, Temple-bar; there we found Mrs. Seaton, but no property; we took Mrs. Seaton back with us to Pinner's-court; and there, in a tumbler upon a shelf in the fore room, I found a ring, which I am very sure is mine; in a small trunk in the back room, which is a bed-room, I found a pair of silver sugar-tongs, which are mine, and I am sure were in my house the night previous to the robbery; the next day the prisoners were had up to Worship street and examined; I swore to the property found; I also got a warrant to search the house of one

That man I saw more than twenty times in the night; he was in company with two more; and that man in the white waistcoat (Clifton) is very much the size of one of them; he had a light-coloured coat on them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did these people say any thing to you in the course of the night? - A. The tall man spoke to me; he asked me what the coach was standing there for, I told him I was about my business, as I supposed he was about his; my coach was on the stand, within about four doors of Mr. Nicholson's house; Clark moved my hat over my eyes as I sat; I was neither asleep nor awake; I asked him what he did that for, and he said, he was only larking, or joking, or something of that sort.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What did these men seem to you to be about? - A. I cannot tell what they were about; they kept passing me, sometimes on one side of the way, and sometimes on the other.</p>
               <p>Q. You observed Clark-did not you observe the other? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How often did you see them at the Justice's? - A. A fortnight after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know them again? - A. The one in particular, and the tall one; and I thought I knew Clifton, but I could not swear to him.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think now? - A. He is like the person that was there.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of you at three o'clock? - A. I went home, and put my coach up.</p>

            , otherwise CLARK, (an accomplice) sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes. On Friday the 9th of February, Seaton and I were walking up Cornhill, and we observed a boy taking down the shutters of Mr. Nicholson's shop, the corner of St. Peter's-alley; that was about half past seven in the morning; I said to Seaton, there is a boy taking down the shop shutters, and they do not appear to me to be lined with iron; accordingly we went over the way, and Seaton looked at them; Seaton said to me, no doubt but we might cut a piece out of them; accordingly we went away, and met the same evening at the Trumpet in Shire-lane, myself, Seaton and Clifton; we told Clifton what we had seen in the morning, and we agreed to go on the Saturday night to cut a piece out of the shutter; accordingly we met the next night at the same house, the Trumpet, and staid till half past two o'clock in the morning; from thence we went to this house, the corner of St. Peter's-alley, and Seaton, with implements that he had got, cut a piece out of the shutter.</p>
               <p>Q. What implements were they? - A. What we call a spike-bit, and a chissel; after the piece was cut out of the shutter, the window was broke by cutting the shutter, a great quantity of property was taken out, watches, rings, seals, and bracelets.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Who put his hand in? - A. I did myself, and Augustus Seaton.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body else? - A. No; Clifton was standing by on the pavement; I and Clifton received part of the property that was taken out by Seaton to take it away; after that, we went to Seaton's house, in a court in Gray's-inn-lane, I do not know the name of it, and there they were sorted by the receiver in two different parcels; accordingly myself and Seaton, and Clifton, took them to a house in Flower-de-luce-court,

             I heard his name was, but I do not know the man; we took one half of the property then, and Seaton knocked at the door, and a man looked out of the window that I never saw before, I understood it was Dudfield, he came down to the door, and opened it, he shewed Seaton and I up into his bedroom, Clifton staid in Fetter-lane; Seaton and the man agreed for the property, the woman at the bar was there at the same time, sitting upright in the bed, I stood behind them while they were agreeing for the property; there were two gold watches, several seals, rings, sugar-tongs, ear-rings, bracelets, necklaces, &amp;c. Seaton asked eighteen guineas for the property; Dudfield said, he could not afford to give any more than twelve guineas; the woman at the bar replied, she did not think her husband could afford to give more than twelve guineas, upon account of the tax that had been laid upon gold watches at that time; then Dudfield said, he would give thirteen guineas for them, he gave the money to Seaton; as we came out of Dudfield's house, we met with Clifton, and we all three went to Seaton's house in a court in Gray's-inn-lane; we told Clifton what money we had got for the property; then we agreed that Seaton should take the remainder of the property to Dudfield's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you divide that money? - A. No. Seaton kept it; Clifton and Seaton went back again to go to Dudfield's house, but I did not go with them.</p>
               <p>Q. At any time did you receive any part of this money? - A. After they came back, which was in about three quarters of an hour, they told me they got fifteen guineas more for the remainder part of the property, and then it was all equally divided amongst us three.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other implements about you than you have described? - A. Each of us had a pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any thing else besides pistols? - A. Not to my recollection.</p>

               <p>Q. You began to be frightened with the idea of the gallows? - A. No; I was not frightened with any idea of coming to the gallows for what I was apprehended for.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you begin to think you might come to the gallows before you wished for it? - A. No doubt.</p>

               <p>Q. You knew if you got somebody else to take your place, and swear against some other persons, they would be hanged and you saved? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then it was after you had been in custody a week, or a fortnight, that you made this charge upon these young men? - A. In less than that.</p>
               <p>Q. You staid at the Trumpet till half past two, and then you went to Mr. Nicholson's house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you could not have been one of the persons who was walking about Cornhill from one o'clock till three? - A. We were there by half past two.</p>
               <p>Q. I say, you could not be one of the persons who were walking about Cornhill from one till three? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Then I am sure I will not ask you a single question more.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When you got to Cornhill, what did you do with yourself? - A. I stood on the opposite side of the way to Mr. Nicholson's house.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you do any thing to him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Recollect yourself? - A. No farther than walking past him; I did not do any thing to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you touch him? - A. No; I walked past him several times, and looked at him, that was all.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you did not do any thing to him at all? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he speak to you? - A. He was standing up against the door of a house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you touch his hat? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At what house was he sitting? - A. At a house opposite his coach.</p>
               <p>Q. You did nothing till the coaches were drove away? - A. The coaches drove away before the property was taken out of the shop.</p>

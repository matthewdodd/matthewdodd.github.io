                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Bailey, who keeps the Fox and Hounds public-house, at Sydenham—on 13th June the prisoner and another man came, about half-past 11 in the evening—the prisoner called for pint of beer, which was twopence—I served him—he tendered a shilling, which I put in the till, and gave him a sixpence and fourpenny worth of halfpence in change—there was a sixpence, a fourpenny-piece, and threepence in the till at that time, but no other shilling—after drinking the beer they went away, and in about five minutes they both returned, and the prisoner called for a half-quartern of gin, which was twopence-halfpenny, tendered a shilling, which I examined and found to be bad—I marked it with my teeth at once—I told him it was bad—he seemed surprised, and spoke to his friend—I put it on the counter, and he took it up—I then went to the till—no one had been to it, or had tendered any money, between that time and the time when I put the first shilling in—I found the shilling he had given for the pint of beer was bad, and said to him, "This is a bad one too"—he appeared surprised, but said nothing—I called my husband, told him, and he went round, detained him, and sent for a policeman—I gave my husband the shilling I took from the till, and he kept it in his hand till the policeman came—I did not see him hand it to anybody—the man who was with the prisoner went off as quickly as possible—I marked the shilling I took from the till—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it; I am sure of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Sydenham, and am a shoemaker—about half-past 11 on 13th June, I saw the prisoner opposite the Fox and Hounds, and heard Mrs. Bailey say to the prisoner, that she had a bad shilling—that attracted my attention—the prisoner seemed very much surprised, and said, "Is it?"—he took it off the counter, turned round to the gentleman, in appearance, and said, "This is a bad one;" and the gentleman took the</p>

               <p>shilling, put his hand in his pocket, and gave the prisoner something; I cannot say what—Mrs. Bailey spoke to her husband, and he came round—before he got to the prisoner, the gentleman <hi rend="italic">shot</hi> out of doors, and the prisoner could have got away easily, only he was rather the worse for liquor—Mr. Bailey detained him, and sent for a policeman.</p>

Q.</hi> What did I give the other man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know; I believe it was the bad shilling which you took off the counter—I was some distance from you—there were three or four others between us—you never spoke to me—the other man was respectable in appearance—he had one black glove on—I believe I mentioned about your giving him something the first time you were before the Magistrate—you said, when you were searched, that you could make a dollar before breakfast sooner than the policeman—I did not stand between you and the door, to prevent you from running away.</p>

On 13th June I took the prisoner, and told him it was for uttering a bad shilling—he said it was no use his saying anything, for what he could say would go up in one corner—Mrs. Bailey gave me this bad shilling at the time—I took the prisoner to the station, and found on him a shilling, a sixpence, a fourpenny-piece, and twopence-halfpenny in copper; all good—he refused his address—he said he came from Brighton, and then from Guildford, and then from Deptford—he said those all at one time—I found this piece of paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on him.</p>

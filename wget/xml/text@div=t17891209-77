               <p>Barrett. I will not particularly swear these are the same things, they are the same quantity, but not being in my possession, I cannot swear, they might be changed.</p>

I can swear to one pair of white thread stockings, lined in the feet with white cotton, they were in my box all the summer; and to one odd stocking mended in the foot, here is the fellow, it was mended by myself; I swear to this knife, there is a lancet on one side, and a hook on the other; and this pincushion and scissars I swear to.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave him a very good character.</p>

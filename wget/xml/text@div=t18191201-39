            . I am servant to Mr. Cobbett. On Monday morning, about six o'clock, I missed the mare, and went with Gibson to find the thief - I knew the prisoner before. I met him just by the White Lion, public-house, at Sapswell, on the Thursday following, in the afternoon; he was coming towards London. I said,</p>
               <p>"That is the man!" Gibson secured him, and left him with me. I asked him if he knew any thing of my master's mare? He said Yes, he took her down into the country with him, within about a mile and a half of his father's. He said he took her out of my master's yard between eight and nine o'clock on Sunday night. He said he came down the road by the public-house, that would be through Wormley.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The mare was found where he said it was - A. Yes, he said he was going to see his father, and gave that as a reason for taking her.</p>

            . I am a constable. In consequence of suspicion, I went with Allen in pursuit of the prisoner; we went to Wormley, and on Thursday we went on the road to Sapswell, and found the prisoner there. I jumped out of the chaise, and collared him - he was going towards town, quite a different road from the Edmonton road. I said,</p>
               <p>"You are my prisoner;" he said,</p>
               <p>"I don't know that." I asked him what he had done with Cobbett's mare? He said he knew nothing of it; Allen was then in the cart, and in hearing. I afterwards left him with Allen. I found the mare at the Red Lion, public-house, at Callow, Rattan, Suffolk, within a mile and a half of his father's. I knew his father lived there; I brought the mare back, and knew her to belong to Cobbett - she is here to day. I attended before Mr. Mores, the Magistrate; and saw him write and sign this paper; I also saw the prisoner put his mark to it. No promise or threat was used to him; it was taken from his own mouth, and read over to him - Rattan is about fifty-six miles, and Wormley eight from Edmonton - (read).</p>
               <p>"The prisoner being asked if he is Guilty or Not Guilty, says,</p>
               <p>'I am Guilty, I took the mare on Sunday night from Cobbett's stable, rode away to Suffolk, about sixty miles, and stopped at Buckeridge for refreshment, and said, I was going to Cambridge, stopped about five miles from Cambridge, and said I was going to a clergyman with the mare. I rode across the country, and proceeded to Rattan, put up at the Red Lion, and told them it was my master's,

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Susannah Taylor, who keeps a butcher's shop in Newgate-market. On the 6th of Feb. I was outside the shop—I saw the prisoner take a piece of beef in her hand—I told her the price was 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound—she gave me no answer—I turned to give the price to other persons—I then missed the prisoner and the beef—I went after her—I found the beef in her hand, wrapped-up in a cloth—I should think she was 100 yards from the shop—I gave her into custody—the meat weighed seven pounds two ounces—it was the middle of the half-round, and it was too salt, or the price would have been 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Priosner.</hi> I asked the price of it; he told me 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; I asked if he would sell part of it; he said, "No;" I took it in my shawl; it was weighed, and I put down half-a-crown to the woman in the shop; I had the change in my hand then; he said a woman came and said, "Did you see that woman take the beef?" he said, "No;" and when I was before the Magistrate he swore he saw me take the beef himself; I paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it to woman dressed in black. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> My mistress takes money in the shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I serve in the shop, and only myself. I was not paid for this beef, to my knowledge—there is a probability that in the hurry of business I might have had the money given me, but it was not, to the best of my knowledge—there had been no salt beef weighed for an hour—I do not recollect the prisoner at all—I can positively say she did not pay me—I could not have taken less than 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the only reason I should have taken that was, it was too salt—it cost me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I put the half-crown on the block; there was a younger lady in the shop, and the lady said 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; she gave me three penny-pieces and a half-penny.</p>

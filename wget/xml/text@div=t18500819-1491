                  </hi>. I live at 9, Tindall's-buildings, Gray's Inn-lane, and am a fur skin dresser. I know both the prisoners, and lodged with Johanna, who is the mother of Ellen—on 25th July, about four o'clock, I was in the next house, and saw Ellen go into No. 9, where my wife lay in a dying state—I went into the house, and heard her ask Mrs. Harvey, who lives there", for a halfpenny—Mrs. Harvey said she had no halfpence to give her; I went in and she asked me—I said I had plenty of calls for my halfpence without giving them to her, and she ran at me directly, and caught hold of my neck-handkerchief—I shortly after went out, and returned in about an hour to see how my wife was going on—as I went to her bed-side, both the prisoners rushed at me, and Ellen said, "I have got him, I have got him;" and the mo<lb></lb>ther says, "Give it him well, he deserves it;" and Ellen directly ran to the dresser, caught hold of a jug, and threw it at me—I stooped my head and escaped it—Ellen ran into the next room, caught hold of the poker, and some</p>

               <p>person there pushed her out of the room—I then took my seat on the bed-fide with my wife—I could hardly hear her speak, she beckoned me to come near, and I took off my hat and laid it on the pillow, put my hand inside the bed to her, and stooped my head down to hear her speak, and Ellen <hi rend="italic">heaved</hi> at me, struck me on the head, and threw me on my face and bands on the bed—Johanna kept calling me all manner of names, saying <hi rend="italic">that the woman that was in bed I had done it myself,</hi> and she was encouraging her daughter—I was taken up from the bed, and led up to the next room—my head was cut open and bled <hi rend="italic">wonderfully</hi>—I was stunned by the blow—I had never had any quarrel with either of them—Ellen often asked me for a halfpenny, and I have given it to her to get rid of her—I have given her no provocation—they were both between drunk and sober—I think Ellen was in a state to know what she was about—they could see my wife in bed, and knew she was ill.</p>

                  </hi>. I lived at 9, Tindalr's-buildings, and am Maloney's father-in-law. On 25th July I saw him sitting on the bedside—I was in the kitchen—there was no door—Ellen took a jug off a little dresser and flung it at Maloney, and but for his stooping down he would have caught it—a few minutes after, she went round to the fire-place, took a poker, and thought to strike him—I ran down and <hi rend="italic">turned her up</hi> out of the room, and as soon as she got away she flung the poker, hit his head, and down he came senseless—Johanna said she was well pleased in his getting what he did—I did not see her do anything—I did not see Maloney do anything to provoke her.</p>

I saw Maloney led out by two men, with his head all over blood—he told me what was done—I took Ellen, and told her the charge—she said, "I have done it, and a very good job too if I get sent out of the country, for the House of Correction is nothing but a dream to me"—I saw blood on Maloney's head and face—he was very faint, and was taken to the hospital.</p>

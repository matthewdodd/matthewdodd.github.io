I keep the Three Kingdoms public-house, Lower Thames-street—on 19th May, the prisoner came with another woman, between 2 and 3 in the afternoon, and asked for a pint of porter—the other woman paid for it; they both drank of it—the prisoner then asked me for change for half a sovereign—I gave her a good crown, and two good half-crowns—she then said, "Will you please to give me change for this half-crown?" holding it out to me—she gave it into my hand—I gave her the change, and kept it in my hand, as I was very busy, but somebody spoke to me, and I then found it was bad—they had both left the shop—I marked it, and put it on a shelf in the bar; it remained there a few days, and I after<lb></lb>wards gave it to the police—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); here is my mark on it—I went to look after the prisoner, but could not find her—about a week afterwards she came again with the same woman, and I gave her in custody.</p>

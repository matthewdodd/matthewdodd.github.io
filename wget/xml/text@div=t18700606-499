                  </hi>. I am a spice merchant, in partnership with John Clarke Foster, at 23, Eastcheap, and 3, St. Mary-at-Hill—about June last year the defendant applied to us for an engagement as traveller—certain negotiations were entered into—he was to take orders in the Birmingham district and receive money, which was to be remitted to us immediately—at the time of the engagement we mentioned Manchester, Liverpool, Bristol, Cheltenham, and Gloucester—if he went to those towns we were to pay his expenses on his sending an account—and I think after going twice he sent an account for the joint journeys, twelve guineas, which was paid—during the whole time he was in our service he did not make any claim against us for any other journeys outside the Birmingham dis<lb></lb>trict, nor for the Birmingham district—his salary was 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year; and he had an engagement with another house which was rather more than ours—if he received a cheque payable to order, it was his duty to send it to us at once—he had no authority from anyone to endorse a cheque, and in no other case did he do so, except that which is the subject of this indictment—in consequence of information we wrote him this letter on 15th December: "We have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th, enclosing bank note value 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. We are much surprised at your request, as one of our fixed rules is that our representative should remit all sums collected on account <hi rend="italic">at once.</hi> We enclose your journey account to date, and must request that the balance be remitted without delay. We trust you will not give us cause to complain of this again, as we never allow this rule to be broken through; if so, it may lead to a termination of our engagement"—About the end of December we communicated with some of our customers as to a settlement of their accounts, and in consequence of the answers we received we discharged the prisoner—we had a customer named Henry Chandler, grocer, 73, High Street, Birmingham—on 6th October, 1869, we received the sum of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from him—it was included in the prisoner's account—this is one of the prisoner's accounts (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—we did not receive 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from him on 22nd November—we have also a customer named Henry Thomas, of 27, Smallbrook Street, Birmingham—the prisoner did not send us a cheque for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., received from him on 27th November—this is a detailed account, made up subsequent to his dismissal.</p>

BROMLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That account is not the only ac<lb></lb>count the prisoner has delivered to your firm? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—as he went on with the business he used to seed us accounts—the Midland District is a very expensive one to travel—we were aware that a man could not possibly travel over that district on 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—the travelling expenses would come to something like that—there is no sum of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in this account received from Andrews &amp; Chandler on 22nd November, but there is on the 27th—we do not think it necessary to oblige our traveller to send up every small cheque, the bankers do not like it: they prefer having them put together in a lump—this cheque of Thomas's for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. he endorsed without our consent—if he endorsed a cheque under any circumstances we should look upon it as a forgery—the sum of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is mentioned in the account on the 27th—I cannot say whether we wrote to him telling him not to send up small country cheques, as they caused so much trouble—there is no such</p>

               <p>letter in this letter-book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he used to send us accounts at in<lb></lb>tervals of three or four days—this account is a <hi rend="italic">rest</hi> of all the small accounts—I have not compared it with the others—when we took the defendant into our employ, we had a guarantee from the Guarantee Society—we commenced these proceedings on 19th May—200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year was all the prisoner was to receive from us, with the exception of when he went to Liverpool and Manchester—I will swear we never agreed to pay his travelling expenses, and he never made any claim upon us for those expenses until long after he was dismissed—we received a writ on 23rd April, and that was the first time we received any application for travelling expenses—we dismissed him on 20th December—we never gave him, or anyone else, to understand that we were going to pay part of his expenses—we say in answer to the twenty-first question of the Guarantee Society, that part of his expenses are allowed; that was when he went oat of the Birmingham district—the Guarantee Society refused to pay us anything until we had prosecuted him, and it was not until then that we took proceedings—I swear that he never made any application to us for expenses till four months after he left—we had no letter from his solicitor—I believe the Guarantee Society and he, between them, made out that the expenses had been incurred, and that made the groundwork of the action against us—the date of the writ is 19th April, and perhaps we heard a fortnight before that that he had a claim against us—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is from our firm—as early as 19th February we had received notice of it, but not from him direct—in this letter we acknowledge to have received notice on 19th February—I was not aware of the existence of the letter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am book-keeper to the prosecutors—all the accounts iron the prisoner passed through my hands—I have them all here—everyone has passed under my notice, and I have compared them with the document which came on 27th December—the item of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. paid by Andrews and Chandler on 6th October is not mentioned in any one of these letters—the cheque for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. has not been remitted to London—I know of no money being paid after this account was handed in—I am unable to say exactly the last date I saw the prisoner at the prosecutor's premises—it was towards the Autumn—I did not see him after that—I did know that he was holding these sums of money, amounting to 68<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—sums are mentioned here which have not been paid—the amount was constantly changing, it was never the same two days alike.</p>

               <p>moneys which he never advised—he was dismissed summarily—the terms were six months' probation, and he was not to have any notice—he for-warded this long account after repeated letters pressing him to do so—he ought to have advised the moneys at the time he received them—on 2nd December he advised us payments to the amount of 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; there was 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

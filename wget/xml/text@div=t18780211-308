I am a chandler, of 47, Henry Street, Kent Street—on the evening of 21st January last I was walking along Tiverton Street, about a quarter-past 6, going home—two men followed me and knocked me down and stole my watch and chain—one hit me on the back of my head and on the eye—they knocked me down with their fists—I fell and one of my ribs was fractured by the fall—I had my watch safe at half<lb></lb>past 5—it was taken from me by those two men—it was a dark street and I could not identify them—they struck me three or four blows.</p>

                  </hi>. I am 13 years old—I live at 49, Lion Street, New Kent Road—on this night I was coming along Tiverton Street and saw the prosecutor lying on the ground—I did not see him knocked down—I saw him walking along two or three yards before me, with the two prisoners, one before and one behind—I was going to knock at my door, and when I looked round he was on the ground, and I saw the prisoner snatch at his watch and take a purse out of his pocket—I said "Look out," but I don't think they heard that—I then said I would tell a policeman—they looked round but did not take any notice—I halloaed out again, and they said they would shake my brains out if I did not shut up my row—they then ran away—I knocked at the door and told my uncle, and he came and picked the prosecutor up, and I ran to the station and gave he information—I am quite sure, of the prisoner—I had known him before by seeing him about the New Kent Road with a shoe<lb></lb>black box—two or three nights afterwards I went with the detectives outside the South London Music Hall and pointed him out.</p>

On Friday, 25th January, I went with the last witness and Robinson, another officer, outside the South London Music Hall, where he pointed out the prisoner and said "I think that is the one"—I think the prisoner heard him; he walked away immediately till he got under a lamp-post, when the boy said "I am sure that is him"—he ran away down St. George's market—I followed, but lost sight of him—I took him about a quarter to 9 that evening near the Elephant and Castle—the boy was with me and said "Here he comes"—I told him what I wanted him for—he said "I know nothing of it"—I said "What did you run away for"—he said "I don't know"—there were about 150 people waiting outside the music hall, where the boy first pointed him out.</p>

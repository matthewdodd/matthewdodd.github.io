                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Joseph Wallace; he keeps a shop in Silver-street, Stepney. The prisoner came there about six o'clock on the 29th of December—I knew her before—she asked me for three pair of half-boots, two children's and one woman's—she said my master was at her house, and had sent her for them—I asked if she was sure of it, as I knew he was gone into the City—she said, "Yes"—I let her have the, and went to her house in half an hour, to see if they fitted, and found she had left her husband for a week—he sent me to a gin-shop, where I found her—she had pledged the boots—these are them.</p>

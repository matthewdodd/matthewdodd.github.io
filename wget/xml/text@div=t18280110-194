            . I was in the tap-room. I saw the prosecutor and prisoners there; the woman was fondling round him - they called him father: Lardon kissed him, and called him his dear father. I told the landlord my suspicions, and he sent for an officer; I took the ticket from Melsom's hand, and gave it to the prosecutor; she said her father's hat had dropped off, and it fell out.</p>

            . I am landlord of the King Arms. Last Tuesday I saw the prisoners and prosecutor in my tap-room; they seemed to make a great deal of the old man - there was another woman in company with them; she brought a sovereign to the bar to change; I stopped it, and said I should ascertain where it came from; she then went away - I kept the sovereign, and sent for an officer. Notcher took the ticket from Melsom's hand, and returned it to the prosecutor. The prosecutor gave no alarm, to my knowledge; they came to the house together - the other woman was with them; they were not there above half an hour; the other woman left before the officer came.</p>
               <p>THOMAS JENNINGS re-examined. I saw Melsom take the ticket and money from me, and gave an alarm directly; I sent the sovereign to the bar to change - that was before I was robbed; I then wrapped the other three in my ticket again; I then found Melsom's hand in my pocket - I am sure it was her hand; I have not got them again; I believe the prisoners were not searched - the other woman had slipped away.</p>
               <p>THOMAS OBORNE. I am an officer. The prisoners were brought to the watch-house; nothing was found on them; I asked Melsom how she came by the pension-ticket; she said it fell out of his hat.</p>
               <p>MELSOM'S Defence. The prosecutor met me, and asked me to shew him Tower-hill; he forced me into the public-house; the other prisoner came in, but I did not not know him.</p>
               <p>LARDON'S Defence. I went into this house with a woman, and fell asleep - I know nothing of it.</p>

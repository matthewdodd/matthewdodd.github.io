            . I am a Bow-street officer. I was sent for to take the prisoner, Stuart, in custody on the 30th of June last; I accompanied him to his lodging in the Borough; on my way there I asked him what books he had at his lodging; he said a vast quatity; he said they were his own; he had purchased the greater part at Edinburgh, and part at the West end of the town and some at Saunders's, the auctioneer, in Fleet-street.</p>

            . I am in the house of Leigh and Southerby. I accompanied the officer to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181307140048"></xptr>prisoner's lodgings, on the 30th of June. I, and Mr. Southerby selected the books in the prisoner's room; I selected most of them. I selected Drunken Barnaby's journal; it was in Dr Johnson's sale, which began on the 17th of June; that book was sold, but had not been delivered; Lewis's history of the translation of the Bible was also in Dr. Johnson's sale; it was sold to Mr. Ogle, but had not been delivered; Massey's Origin of Letters was in the Doctor's sale; I believe it was sold to Mr. Willoughby, but not delivered; Dr. Oakes's history, I missed that day it was to be sold; the grammer of seven languages, that book had not been sold; I remember it wanted a title, this was in Dr. Johnson's sale; also Whittaker's History of the Britons, that I do not speak to.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any that Mr. Southerby selected that you can speak to - A. I remember this book by it wanting four leaves; it is the art of wooing; it does not mention imperfect in the catalogue; Coleby's Cape of Good Hope, I know that; it is only one volume we have the other volume I left on the shelf, that was in Dr. Johnson's sale; Levi's Jewish ceremonies, I remember this book very well it was lost; and Granville on Witches had not been sold; I know all these books.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at Balaam's Ass - A. I know that by the coat of arms; that was in Dr. Gossack's sale; it was not sold.</p>

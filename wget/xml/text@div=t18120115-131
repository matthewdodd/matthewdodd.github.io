About a quarter of an hour after, she came with the third, her coming so often I had suspicion that it was not good, I cut it with a knife, and found that it was copper; that is the one, it has my mark.

I took it to the prisoner, I asked her whether that was her three shilling piece, she said it is, is it not a good one, I said no it is not, she said she had taken it of a man just gone, she took it out of my hand and said she would run after the man and get him to change it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any man near her. - A. No. I went into the office and told Mr. Pirch, Mr. Fagg came in just after, he sent me for a constable, the constable took her into the coach-house and searched her.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took the prisoner in custody, and while I was searching her she endeavoured to turn two or three shillings of one side that I might not see them, they were in a little purse in her bosom. In her throwing the purse down on the ground, she had a method of throwing them two dollars of one side; there were twelve shillings and sixpence in the bag, independant of the dollars, and two of the shillings were bad. The prisoner was rather intoxicated, but she was able to run away while I was talking to the ward beadle, she was stopped almost immediately. I picked up three tokens, two were bad and one was good. I produce the counterfeit money.</p>

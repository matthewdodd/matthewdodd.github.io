On the night of the 2nd of December I was in High-street, St. Giles's, about half-past twelve o'clock—the prosecutor, James Child, was between the prisoners, in a state of intoxication—I saw Moore draw his hand from the prosecutor's pocket with some money, which fell on the stones—the two prisoners then threw him into the road—Simmonds stopped to pick up the money, and Moore</p>

               <p>ran to the prosecutor, and tried to get his watch out of his pocket—I took them both into custody—Simmonds said, "It is all right, that man is my brother." Child stated he had lost half a sovereign and 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the presence of the prisoners, and he gave his name as James Child—I found this money, which I produce, on Simmonds—there was a scramble, which I suppose was the reason of the rest of the money being lost.</p>

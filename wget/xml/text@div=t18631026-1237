I am a coach-painter, and live at 41, Thomas-street, Oxford-street—about half past 6 on the afternoon of 5th October, I saw the prisoner with a child in Gloucester-place, Paddington—I saw her throw the child down on the pavement—I asked her why she did so—she told me to mind my own business, she had a right to do as she thought proper with her own child—she said the child had been very impudent to her, and slapped her face—it was about five years old—she walked on towards the New-road—I followed her, and on five or six occasions she beat the child—I ran up to its.</p>

            . On the 2d of June, I was residing in Basinghall-street. About four o'clock in the morning I met the prisoners in Covent-garden, and went with Hayes to a house in <placeName id="t18200628-44-crimeloc244">Vine-street, Chandos-street</placeName>

I gave Hayes some silver, and paid one of the others 18 d. for the room. they left the room to get something to drink. I went to bed, and about half past five o'clock the two prisoners and the other woman came in. I am sure they are the women - it was daylight. Hoby and the other took my coat and trowsers, and all went away together with them. I came down stairs as I was, and left the house shortly after. I met Hayes; she had nothing with her, and I did not stop her. I was not perfectly sober, but I knew what I was about. When I returned, I found the rest of my things gone. My coat and trowsers were worth 8 l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. Were you not very drunk - A. I was not; I am certain they are the women.</p>

            . On the 1st of June I lived with Mr. Brewer, in Chandos-street. I saw the prisoners with another woman, about five o'clock in the morning, at the corner of Bedfordbury. Hoby had a blue great coat in her apron; they went through May's-buildings. Hayes turned back. I afterwards saw the prosecutor in Vine-street, and told him; he went after them. I saw Hoby after this at the corner of New-street; she still had the bundle in her apron; she saw us and ran away - we lost her; it was a blue coat with a velvet collar.</p>

            . I am clerk to the prosecutors. I received this letter from Mr. Flint, enclosing a 20l. Leicestershire note; I took it to Messrs. Pares and Heygates' Bank, and got three 5l. Bank notes and five sovereigns for it - I did not take the numbers of the notes; I deposited them and the sovereigns in a drawer, in a desk in the office - I paid away the sovereigns, and saw the three notes there on Tuesday, the 11th of November; the drawer was not locked - the prisoner had access to it; he has a salary and is not an articled clerk - he had only been there a week: I missed the notes on Thursday, the 13th.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many clerks are there? A. Only him and myself: the notes were in the clerk's office - there is a passage leading from the Inn; the desk was not locked - I am certain I had received the notes at Messrs. Pares and Heygate's; when questioned about them, (from the state of my feelings at the moment, thinking I might be charged with it myself,) I stated that I could not, at the moment, state where I changed the note, and stated to the Magistrate I thought it was at Messrs. Williams and Co's. - I am sure I said I thought so; I did not speak positively - that was the impression on my mind then, and that I had received four 5l. notes and no sovereigns; I signed a deposition containing both those statements.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you account for the difference? A. From the agitated state of my feelings, fearing I might be suspected: the notes were missed on the Thursday, and he was before the Magistrate on the Friday - my agitation would have continued up to the present moment if he had not confessed it: the impression on my mind was that I changed it at Williams', but I afterwards looked at the book and found there were more Leicestershire Banks than one, and seeing that one paid their notes at Pares and Co's. it came like an electric shock upon me, and I recollected going to Pares', where I had never been before, and had to inquire where it was; I corrected my deposition at the second examination, which was on the following Friday.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever change a country note at Williams? A. I beheve not; I have been there with cheques shortly before, but had never been to Pares'.</p>

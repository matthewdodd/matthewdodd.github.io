Graham and Keeling's, Lower Thames Street—they are brokers, I believe—I saw these two pieces of net not numbered, but they were the two pieces de<lb></lb>livered to the defendant—I said to the defendant "Are you selling our nets in London?" he said "No, I do not know anything about them," and suggested the names of several good houses which might be selling them—I told him that I had seen them—he did not say where he had sent the net which I had supplied—the value of it was 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and payment was to be made a month after delivery, but it was not—I then went back to Graham and Keeling's, and while I was there the prisoner came in and saw me; he coloured up and ran down stairs again—he also gave me a verbal order about 3rd September for 100 pieces of net value 64<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I sent to Nottingham—he said that all the nets in both orders had been sent to Germany—I saw the prisoner several times, and tried to get pay<lb></lb>ment, but could not, and I put it into Mr. Kent's hands—I tried to find Newnham and Co., but could only see the porter and some empty cases.</p>

I said "The price is 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., less 15 percent, and 2 1/2 for cash"—I communicated with my principals, and agreed to supply the engine, which was shipped at Grimsby on 16th or 17th February in pursuance of the defendant's instructions—I handed the prisoner the bill of lading, and received this receipt: "Received from R. Henderson one steam engine for Hamburg, for which I will hand him Mr. Sherenberg's acceptance at three months as soon as received"—he had told me that Mr. Sherenberg was his customer at Hamburg, and I believe he exists—I never received the acceptance—on or about 18th March this bill of exchange was left at my place; I received it myself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Pannell and Co., and the partner of the last witness—he is the trustee, but I acted more in the management of the estate than he did—I have taken the control and conduct of the estate—the prisoner did not bring me any books, nor has he given me any information except that contained in his statement of affairs—I have only received 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of the assets, and that was not from a debtor; it was the bank balance which was not disclosed in the statement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I went to the prisoner's office on 9th August and seized some books; he did not deliver them—it was his duty to deliver them up to me without my asking for them—I was not present at hit examination on 23rd July, and cannot tell you whether he had his books there—I never asked him for information as to the estate—I might have asked him if he had filed his statement—he saw my partner the same day—I did not look through the proofs; Mr. Kent, my solicitor, did, and I believe questions were asked him on 26th May—I cannot say whether Whitworth or Henderson had proved them—I expect the statement a bankrupt hands in to be the statement of affairs at the time the pro<lb></lb>ceedings are instituted—if he hat property he is bound to disclose it under the Act.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Samuel Page, of 16, Water Lane, Tower Street—on 26th January the prisoner deposited with us a delivery order for 20 half-barrels of lard, and on 28th January one for 60 half-barrels—they are 1 cwt. each, or nearly so—on 6th February we had a delivery order for 100 half-barrels, and on 12th February for 200 barrels—we advanced him altogether 430<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

               <p>the invoices of those dates—all the rest were obtained on credit, and have not been paid for—I endeavoured to recover some of my goods; I found them in the hands of Page—I only saw the prisoner once; that was, I think, on 10th or 17th February; it was when he brought the large parcel of goods—he did not state that a petition in bankruptcy had. been filed against him, or that proceedings were pending—the brokers who introduced him said that he was highly respectable, and had plenty of means.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I sold the goods partly through the brokers who introduced him, Gardner and Campbell, and partly myself—I had five transactions with him, the two first of which were paid for, but no others—I did not receive 117<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from him on 17th February, or anything—Mr. Scott is my cashier; he is not here—if he had received money on my behalf he would hand me the receipt—I have received about 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of 1,059<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but only 145<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Luscher; I got something under the attachment—I got no goods back—Mr. Scott has been with me 20 years.</p>

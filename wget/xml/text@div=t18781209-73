                  </hi>. I am coachman in the employment of Mr. Alexander, of 12, Devonshire Street, Portland Place—I know Page; he has a stall in Leadenhall market, and amongst other things deals in dogs—two or three months previous to June I visited his shop—I then had in my possession a valuable Mount St Bernard dog named <hi rend="italic">Avalanche</hi>, which I valued at 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had given 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it; I kept it for stud purposes—my charge was five guineas—I mentioned the fact to Page, and asked him if he could procure customers—I saw him again on 13th June, and then purchased from him a dog, a black poodle, for which I gave 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I then mentioned Avalanche again, and said if he should know anybody requiring its services I would pay him a commission for any he might send me—when I paid for the dog lie said if at any time I knew a dog that was lost in my neighbourhood which would do to go back, if I came to him and he had not got it, he should know where to find it—on July 10 about 8.30 I missed my dog Avalanche—I had seen him late the evening before—I had bills printed offering 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>: reward—this is one of them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I heard nothing, but on 15th July about 11 o'clock I went to Page, told him I had lost my big dog Avalanche, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187812090002"></xptr>
               <p>asked him if he knew anything about it, and then referred to Mr. Dresden's case—he said "I was b——annoyed about that affair; I. thought what I spoke to you I spoke in confidence" (that was a black poodle which I had bought for Mr. Dresden)—I said, "I have offered 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. reward for my dog; if you know anything about it, I shall be glad if you will tell me"—he said, "Oh, you don't mean paying any 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to get him back"—I said, "Yes I do, if I can get him back at once"—he said, "You come to me in two or three days' time; I will see if I can do anything for you"—I said that I should have to know at once, as I had a bitch coming from Long Sutton, and was going to give the gentleman an answer about it; that as I should get a fee of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., it would suit me then to pay 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Page said "Call again in two or three hours' time, and I will go round and see one or two of the lads and see whether they know anything"—I said, "I have not time to go home and back"—he told me not to go home, as he should not be more than 10 minutes or a quarter of an hour—he went away and came back in about seven minutes and picked up a head of mint at the greengrocer's next door, which he handed to me and said, "Here, smell this; is not this nice?"—I took it, and he said, "Put it in your coat;" but I held it in my ha id and made no remark—he said, "Put it in your coat"—I still held it in my hand and said, "Have you heard anything about it?"—he said "Have you got the <hi rend="italic">stuff</hi> to pay for him?"—I said, "No, but I can get it in a very few minutes"—there was some talk about getting the money—he said "You can either get it now, or come down any time by appointment to Moorgate Street or Liverpool Street, and wear that in your coat, and some one will pick you up, and take you where the dog is"—there was some more talk about the arrangements, and it ended in my going to his beershop in Slater Street—I said to him, "10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is a good lot; can't you get him back for me for less?"—he said, "No, you are very lucky to get him back for that, for he is in price for a Captain Taylor to go to New York on the Wednesday, and the hamper and everything was prepared for him to go away"—an arrangement was made for me to go to Slater Street—I had been there before to get the black poodle for Mr. Dresden—he said I should have to come down by myself, and this time to bring hard cash; it was no use for mo to come alone; if I brought anybody with me, sooner than I should have my dog back his throat would be cut, because the lads would not be done—I went to Slater Street about 8.30 that evening—I did not wear the mint as I was to go to his house—in the meantime I had communicated with Inspector King—when I got into Page's beershop I saw Mrs. Page, and asked if Mr. Page was in—she said he was lying down—I saw a number of people in there, and when I went in there was a general whisper all round, men getting up and putting their heads together, and all eyes were upon me—Page came out, and I asked if he had heard anything more about my dog—he said "No, don't know the least; I have put it into the hands of those who will arrange everything," or "into the hands of the lads," "and somebody has promised to come and pick you up"—I asked if they would be long—he said, "They may be here in a few minutes, or half an hour, or an hour, or an hour and a half; I cannot tell in the least"—he said I should have to go through a little ceremony, and if I paid my money civilly I should get my dog—I said, "Then you promise there will be nothing more," meaning that there would be no row—he said, "No, there will be nothing more"—soon after the man came in, but before that Page looked straight across at the men that were there and said, "There is a fine lot of you in here; I should think it was time some of you were</p>

               <p>getting out," and I noticed several go, one at a time—I noticed Cook there; he went out—a little man then came in, and came up to Page and said, "Mr. Page, is this the gentleman come about the dog?"—Page said "Yes"—the little man then turned to me and said, "If you come along with me I think I can show you where the dog is"—Page told me to go with him, and I went out with the little man—we went up Slater Street towards Shoreditch, and I looked at the corner where Inspector King had placed a detective, but could not see him—I went into a urinal there to give him a chance to look at him, and as I came out the little man and Cook were in conversation—as soon as they saw me they parted; the little man came on to join me, and Cook went down Slater Street towards Page's house—I went on with the little man through a number of narrow turnings that I don't know the names of—we ultimately reached Bunhill Row, and went up a narrow passage called Chequer Alley, and into a narrow passage, and up a dark yard—the little man there stopped, looked about, and said, "I think this is the place, somewhere here"—he was dodging about for a second or two, and up came Cook from somewhere out of the dark; he walked up to the little man and said, "What is it you want, what is it you want"—he said, "Oh, this gentleman has come about a dog"—Cook said, "What about a dog?"—lie said, "About a dog he has lost"—Cook said, "If you know anything about the dog, why don't you go and get it?"—I then said, "I have had enough of this humbug; if you are going to get my dog, get it; I am not going any further"—I then turned round and walked slowly up the narrow passage—Cook said, "Do you mean paying the money for the dog?"—I said, "Yes, I told Page I would"—he then said, "Will you wait here if we go and get the dog"—I said "Yes"—they went up some place in a line with Chequer Alley—they were gone some few minutes, and they came back with the dog—when I saw them coming I turned round to walk slowly towards Bunhill Row; they overtook me, and when they came up to the first lamp-post they stopped and said, "Is this the dog?"—I believe the little man said that—I said "Yes"—he said, "Now we want the money before we go any further"—I offered the 10 sovereigns to Cook—he said, "No, it is nothing to do with me; he will take the money"—I then gave the money to the little man, and they handed me over the dog—I then said, "After taking me all this long route you ought to give me something to drink"—Cook said, "No, we have got to go and take the money to the man that has had the dog"—there was some little haggling about it, and Cook said to the. little man, "You go," and we went into a public-house in Bunhill Row and had some drink—we then came outside and waited; I kept him in conversation as long as I could, but no constable came along, and we parted—a few seconds afterwards I heard a voice calling along the street, but I could not tell what the words were; a second afterwards I heard the same voice call out, "Where the b—h—have you got to?" and a second afterwards I recognised Cook running in the direction of the little man—I afterwards gave the dog in charge of Sergeant Cloak and William Downes—on 9th August I saw Cook in charge at Marlborough Street</p>

I lost my dog on 9th July—I saw Page about recovering it on 15th July; these proceedings were taken on 14th November—Page has a shop in Leadenhall Market; I believe he deals in rabbits and fowls and such things—I did not put the mint in my coat; there was no occasion for it afterwards the mint had nothing to do with the recovery of the dog;</p>

               <p>he told me to go to his own beershop in Slater Street—I knew that he had a beershop there—my dog was worth 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it was a valuable dog for lining bitches, and was always able to command a good price for that—I know a little about dogs—when dogs are lost I have found it of use to go to the police—I have never received anything for getting a dog back, save Mr. Dresden's; he gave me a sovereign for my expenses when I got his dog back—Page was in Court in that case; I don't know for what purpose—I had a St. Bernard bitch there was a little disturbance about; it took the second prize at the Crystal Palaee; it was owned at Margate as the property of a gentleman named Congreve—I gave 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10A for that dog; Mr. Congreve entered it for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the show; I also know it was not worth anything like 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I bought it without a pedigree; I afterwards got part of the pedigree; I bought it of a man named Riddesford, a carrier at Walton—on the-Hill; he is dead; I refused to give Mr. Congreve his name on account of Mr. Con<lb></lb>greve's behaviour—the dog was subsequently given up to Mr. Congreve—the matter was settled to the satisfaction of the committee, and I got my prize—people may innocently be possessed of stolen dogs—I knew where to find Page between July and November—the prisoners were tried for this offence last Sessions, and the jury being unable to agree were discharged without giving a verdict—when I left Page at his beer-house in Slater Street I did not see him afterwards—I left him about 9 o'clock, and I paid the money about 10.30.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Cook</hi>. I have no doubt it was you who said to me, "Do you mean paying the money if he goes and gets the dog?"—I don't think I would swear it—the other man had the dog—I offered the money to you because your hands were free, and the other man had the dog; I believe you were the nearest to me—I thought you were both concerned in it—I had no particular reason for offering you the money more than the other; it was not to get you into trouble—I addressed both of you when I asked for something to drink—it was you who said, "I have got to go and give the money to the man that got the dog."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I gave information to the police on 15th July, and left the matter in the hands of the police—it was in August that I was sent for and saw Cook at the police-court, and on 14th November both prisoners were charged at Worship Street, and the matter was then taken in hand by the Treasury authorities.</p>

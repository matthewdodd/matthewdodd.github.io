                  </hi>. I live at No. 36, Bloomsbury-square. The prisoner came into my service on the 5th of April—on Tuesday, the 25th of May, I missed three yards and three quarters of poplin—I had had it in my possession a week before—on the 26th of May, in consequence of missing something</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184706140111"></xptr>
               <p>more, I sent for a policeman—I asked the prisoner and another female servant if they had any objection to have their boxes searched—they said, "No"—the prisoner took the articles out of her boxes herself, folded as they were—on that search I did not discover anything—I went with the policeman to the prisoner's sister's, in Scotland-yard, to inquire whether the prisoner had left anything with her—we returned, and I thought it better to send the prisoner away at once—in consequence of what a lady told me, I told the prisoner to leave her boxes, and come the next morning at ten o'clock—on the following day I left my house—I was going to Mr. Thomas', the person from whom I had received the prisoner's character—as I was going, I met the prisoner in Hollis-street, Cavendish-square—she asked me when she was to have her boxes—I told her to come to my house and ask the question, and she would have a reply—I went on No. 9, George-street, where Mr. Thomas lived, who had given the prisoner a character—I inquired for Mr. Thomas—I did not see her, but when I was seated in the drawing-room, with a man who said he represented Mr. Thomas, the prisoner came in at a folding-door, not the door I had entered at—she said, "Now we will give it her"—the man then opened the door, and called another woman—the man then locked the door, and said to me, "Now, Madam, before you leave this room, you shall answer every question before these witnesses; what did you find in her boxes?"—I said nothing, but I rang the bell—a young girl had gone to the house with me, but she sat in the hall—I called, "Mary," twice—she came to the door, but could not get admittance—I went to the window, and said I would not be made a prisoner; if the man did not open the door, I would go on the balcony, and call, "Police!"—he said, "You are afraid"—I said I would go, and then he opened the door—I went down the stairs, and the man shouted after me, "Did you find anything?"—the prisoner said a great many things in the way of abuse, and the man threatened me with a lawyer, and all that—on the Friday night I went to Scotland-yard, where the prisoner lived, with her uncle—I saw the prisoner there—I addressed myself to her uncle—I told him I wished to give up her boxes, and pay her wages, but I would do it in his presence; that Mr. Braithwaite had seen her put things into her boxes after they had been examined, and they should not go from my house till they were searched again—the prisoner said she was determined that should not be done; if there was anything in her boxes belonging to me Mr. Braithwaite had put it there—I said they should not go till they were searched, and I left it to her uncle—he said he would come—the next day, between four and five o'clock, the prisoner came—a policeman was sent for—the boxes were opened again, and the prisoner took out the things—the first thing I saw was this poplin, in a flannel petticoat—I opened the petticoat, and shook it, and this came out of it on the ground—it is mine, and the same as I had missed.</p>

                  </hi>. I was staying at Mr. Stuckey's. I recollect the prisoner's boxes being searched the first time, and I heard Mr. Stuckey tell her to go—after that I saw the prisoner pack up her things, and I saw her put in one article which was folded up—she held it with her two hands—it appeared to be flannel—she took it from the kitchen drawer—she locked her three boxes, and she corded the large one—I was standing in the kitchen—I was talking to her—she put the things in openly before me—she appeared confused at the time—I did not see the box opened after she locked it—I looked at the box while it was open—I did not examine the lock—it was a square wooden box—I should say it had no hasp—it locked in the usual way.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Nathan Levy, a butcher. The prisoner was in our service for nearly a week—this cloth (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is mine; I know it by the colour—I missed it last Sunday week, having had it about a fortnight—the prisoner saw me put it in a box, in one of my lodger's bed rooms—there was no lock to the box—I put almost all my things in my lodger's room—I found the cloth on Friday, my daughter brought it to me—I did not authorize the prisoner, as I know of, to pledge any of my goods; I cannot be certain if I sent her to pledge things—she lived with me not quite a week—I did not authorize her to pawn any of my goods.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Gabriel Costa, and the daughter of Mrs. Levy. The prisoner lived with me; I discharged her, and she went to live with my mother two days afterwards—last Friday morning I was sleeping at my mother's, and went into the prisoner's room to awake her—her clothes were lying on the ground; I picked them up, and put them on her bed—as I did so, a handkerchief fell from them and these duplicates, one of which produced this Orleans cloth—it is my mother's—I have a piece of the same colour—I took the duplicate to the pawnbroker's to be satisfied about it, and took the cloth out of pawn with it—I have not authorized her to pawn things, nor has my mother, in my presence.</p>

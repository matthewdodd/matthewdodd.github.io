In April last he bought one hundred sheep, which were put into a field, in my charge - I counted them every night: they were all safe on the night of the 9th of May, except one, which had died - I went the next morning, about seven o'clock, and five of them were missing; I have seen the skins of them since, and they are in Court now; they were wether sheep - my master had not sold any of them; they were not fit for the butcher.</p>

On the 10th of May, between three and four o'clock in the morning, he called me up to dress a sheep, which I did - that sheep was dead; there were four others, alive - I killed and dressed one of the others afterwards, and on the Friday I killed another; they were not very fat - they were not fit to kill: I saw nothing on the floor but some blood, and there was some hay and muck.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How had the first sheep been killed? A. He had cut its throat with a penknife; it had not been killed as I should have done it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You only found one dead, with its throat cut? A. No - in some cases I should have cut the throat of a sheep; I knew the prisoner, and knew where he lived - there was no secresy on his part - the sheep were marked with ruddle, which could have been clipped off, but the marks were left on the skin - there were no letters on the skin, only a mark down the back of the neck; I left the skins at the prisoner's.</p>

            . I am an officer of Union-hall. I went to the prisoner's house between nine and ten o'clock at night on the 11th of May; I did not go to look for sheep, but I found some sheep there, one in the passage, one in the yard, and another in the shed; I then went to the back of the premises, and saw five sheep skins hanging on the pales at the bottom of the garden - I asked him if they were the skins of the sheep whose carcases I saw hanging up; he said they were - I asked where he got the sheep; he said he bought them opposite his own door on the Wednesday, about ten o'clock at night, of a person whom he did not know, but who had the appearance of a drover - he said the man had a drove of about fifty, but there were only five for sale, and said he gave a guinea a piece for them - I was not satisfied, and took him into custody; these are the skins of the sheep - I have been a butcher; they were what we call tags, not fit to kill.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At what time did you go? A. Near ten o'clock at night - a person passing by the premises could not see them; I saw them by the light of a candle; the skins have the marks on them - there is one house to the left on entering his premises, and one on the right - there are a number of houses about it; the rails on which the skins hung, might be seen from some of the houses in the day time - they hung with the flesh side outwards.</p>
               <p>GEORGE TRUMPER. I am a farmer, and live at Norwood. I purchased some one year old South-down wether tegs in April, and gave them to the care of my shepherd; they were not fit to kill - they were poor tegs; the prisoner's house is nearly seven miles from my farm - sheep can be driven two miles or two miles and a half in an hour - I saw the skins, and firmly believe they are the skins of my sheep; these are them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Did you ever deal with ticket butchers? A. No; I know there are such persons - I bought these sheep to fatten; they are not mutton till they are two years old - this mark might have been cut off, but it goes down to the skin.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. If I had thought it had been wrong I had no occasion to have let the officer see the skins, for my skinman called the day before, and I might have let him had them.</p>

            . I was examined on this case in the other Court - I live forty or fifty yards from the prisoner's. On the 10th of May, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, I was standing at my own door, and saw three persons standing in front of a flock of fifty or sixty sheep - I thought I knew the prisoner to be one of them by his jacket, and when he made a snatch at one of the sheep it ran towards me, and then I was confident it was him - there are not many houses about the place; I suppose about fifty - I then went into my house; I gave the same evidence on the last trial before the Judge.(See page 623).</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Did you not then say your house was opposite? A. No; it is between forty and fifty yards from it - I will swear it is not one hundred yards; I have had a surveyor to measure it - I was spoken to to come as a witness last Wednesday - I had not said any thing about it before; I heard of the prisoner's being taken on the 11th of May, but I did not mention this; I should have gone to Hicks'-hall, but I did not think it was so serious a charge - I did not hear that the prisoner was in gaol for stealing sheep till last week, when I saw it in the newspaper; I heard, in the course of a week after, that he was in gaol for buying stolen sheep, but I did not mention it till last week to Mr. McDuff - I went to him voluntarily; I had no communication from any one.</p>

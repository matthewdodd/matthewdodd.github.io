                  </hi>. I am clerk to Dakin and Company, No. 1, St. Paul's Churchyard. Mr. Dakin died last May—the business is carried on by his widow, and Mr. Alfred Waterhouse—the prisoner was in their service in Nov. last, as van<lb></lb>man—it was his duty to take out goods daily in the van, and bring back the money he received—this way-bill contains goods to Mrs. Connell, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., in my writing, in the first column—here is another column left blank, in which, if he received the money, he was to enter it—here is in that column opposite Mrs. Connell's name, "<hi rend="italic">a/c</hi>" in the pri<lb></lb>soner's writing, which signifies it was carried to account, and not paid—in this invoice, here is the name of Haley—here is first of all a small deduction of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. made in the account, which reduced it to 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there is a receipt for that in the prisoner's writing—here is the corresponding way-bill—here</p>

               <p>is opposite to that name, in the prisoner's writing, "Monday," which means that it was to be paid on the Monday following.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When did you make out this way-bill with Mrs. Connell's name on it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The night previous to his taking it out; I made it out from the day-book—the goods are delivered to him by the order-man—he has to account for all in this way-bill, either by returning the goods, or paying the money, or making marks signifying that it was not paid—there are about fifty orders on this way-bill—the prisoner had his own order-book, in which he takes orders that he receives from the customers—we have a large trade—I should say he would have about fifty orders in a day—he had a horse and cart, and a person to go with him to assist him, who would receive money and solicit orders, and who would have to account for money to the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the van-men to Messrs. Dakin and Com<lb></lb>pany's. I was with the prisoner when the goods were delivered to Mrs. Haley—they are marked 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoner delivered them—he came to me and asked me for some money, as Mrs. Haley bad no change—I gave him some, and he went in, and afterwards repaid me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What are your duties? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> to deliver goods, to receive money, and take orders—we now generally pay the money to the cashier, but at that time I had to help the prisoner—he might be at one house, and I at another—we separated at times—I paid the money to him—I was with him on 13th Nov., when he received the money from Mrs. Connell—there was an order-book in the van; I cannot say whether he took it out—he gave the receipt—if I delivered a parcel he would probably put a mark against it, and I used to pay him the money I received—he knew the goods were delivered—he was always with me—he made up his way-bill when he came home at night, from recollection—he had no other means of doing so; he was obliged to ask me to assist his recollection—he might have avoided all that—I have been promoted since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Waterhouse and Dakin.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When would the moneys be paid from the van-man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At night when he came in, or in the morning before he went out again—I do not think it ever went over till next day; it might have—we have four van-men; they all account to me—I recollect that 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was paid on this van bill—I do not recollect whether it was accounted for at night, or in the morning, I think most likely it was in the morning—there have occasionally been trifling errors in these way-bills—I do not recollect the prisoner having paid me more money than he was entitled to do, under the way-bill—if I had found an error, I should have returned it to him—errors occur perhaps twice a week—they may have overcharged themselves—they have credit given them for the money—receiving so many orders, and taking out so many goods, it cannot he helped.</p>

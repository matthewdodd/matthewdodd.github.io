                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Crown and Anchor public-house, in Charles-street, Bermondsey, and have been so nearly two years—my house was broken into on the morning of 11th March, to the best of my knowledge—I went to bed at 12 o'clock, or a few minutes after, the night before, leaving the house bolted up as usual—I saw to it myself before I went to bed—one window up-stairs was not fastened, the others were—I bolted the folding doors down-stairs myself—I was disturbed a little before 3—I jumped out of bed, and opened the window—it was not a very dark morning, not a foggy morning at all, much as usual—I looked out of the window—for a moment I did not see anything—I only heard screaming—I sung out "Police" directly—I was sure there was something the matter, and then I saw the prisoner and two more rush out of the house through the folding-doors, and they turned to the right, up towards Dockhead—I forget the name of the street—I afterwards looked at the window of the club-room, and found it partly open—it was not in the same state as I left it in when I went to bed at 12—the folding-doors bad not been forced—one bolt was pulled down, and the other pulled back—they were not opened from the outside—I missed my spectacles, my snuff-box, a kitchen poker, lots of tobacco, and various other things—I had seen the prisoner before, often—many a time, in my own house, as well as out of doors—I am positive he is the man I saw running away with others—I next saw him at the police-station the other night, last week, I think, I forget the day.</p>

               <p>not then—she has been married since—the man to whom she was married was lodging in the house at that time—I saw him run out after the other men, while I was looking out of the window—he did not run out first—he did not come back and call me—I was up, looking out of window, before he came out of the house—I sleep on the first floor front—there is no back to the house—it is a licensed house, of course—it is all front; it has quite an imposing appearance, I assure you—I had two gas lights, one on each side of me—I don't know where the Neckinger is—there is Neckinger-street—I have known Bermondsey ever since I have lived in it, two years—there is no place called the Neckinger, that I know of.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, M</hi> 259). On the morning of 11th March, about 3 o'clock, I saw the prisoner running in the direction from the prose<lb></lb>cutor's towards the "Sugar Loaf" in Dockhead—he was about two hundred and fifty or three hundred yards from the public-house when I first saw him I saw no one else running—I knew the prisoner before—I saw him next after that, a fortnight ago last Wednesday.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you quite sure about the date, when you saw a man running about 3 in the morning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it was on 11th March—the robbery did not happen in our division—it was not entered in our books—I fix the date because another constable who ran after him the same night told me so—I told the Magistrate I would not swear to any date; but Curren, the constable, came up to me that night—that was the only night he came up to me; because his was the opposite beat to me, and we are not allowed to cross the road to speak to one another—I only entered the force in December—I had never spoken to him before till that night—I will pledge myself that I did not speak to him on any other night, till the prisoner was appre<lb></lb>hended—I found this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in the prisoner's boot, on searching him at the station.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was a man taken into custody for being in the position in which you suppose the prisoner to have been, on that charge, and taken before the Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he was discharged—that man was not supposed to be the prisoner in the first instance—I saw the prisoner on the other man's shoulders, who was taken—he was not charged as being the man on the shoulders; I am quite clear about that—I was present at the police-court, and gave evidence—my brother constable had been on the look-out for the prisoner between that day and yesterday fortnight.</p>

               <p>out of bed, and went up a flight of stairs, opened the door, and saw the last one go out—I heard talking—I then went up into the young man's room, whom I afterwards married, and called him; he got up, got a poker, and ran after them; and while he was gone I went and called Mr. Price and Mr. Capelin, who was a lodger in the house, and they got up; and Mr. Price opened the window and called out "Police! Thieves!"—when I knocked at his door the first time he did not hear me, and I said, "Price, Price"—he said, "What?"—I said, "There are thieves all over the place"—I did not hear any screaming—I did not scream—I knocked at the bottom staircase door, and then I ran up-stairs—Young came back as soon as Mr. Price and Mr. Capelin got down stairs—Young is here to-day.</p>

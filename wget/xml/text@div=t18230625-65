Next day about two o'clock, I saw Savage with two or three more coming out of the field, and a little after three o'clock, I saw the fight - they threw their hats up, went into the ring and shook hands; the deceased had the advantage at first; it lasted nearly an hour. The deceased got weaker, and before the last round sat down on Foot's knee, apparently weak, but in as good spirits as ever. I do not think Marsh assisted as a second; he only gave him a drop of water out of a bottle. At the last round but one, Saunders went to Savage, and said that the deceased was done.

            . I live at Hornsey. I was passing, and saw them shake hands - Savage appeared strongest; there was a good deal of science displayed. At the last round but one the deceased appeared in such a state that he ought not to have been allowed to fight any longer; I wished them not to fight, telling the seconds that murder would ensue; the reply was, "He will stand another round;" I believe it was Saunders who said so, and cannot say whether all the parties heard it - the consequence of another round was that the deceased made an effort to strike Savage, but was too weak, and Savage struck him three times. When I interfered I did not observe that any of the parties attempted to stop them. The blow that knocked him down was on the jugular vein - he dropped immediately. Savage did not wish to fight any more, but the deceased with the assistance of his seconds did fight.</p>

               <p>- RUSSELL. I saw the three last rounds; the deceased was knocked down at the last round but one, the seconds said it was all over and threw up a handkerchief. Savage came round, and offered to shake hands with the deceased; he would not; he was very weak, and I thought not able to stand against it. I heard his seconds say he was done, and could not fight any more, and then George Savage threw up his handkerchief - he seemed to get up full of spirits, to the last round, but was very weak; he rose from his second's knee. I did not see them conduct him into the ring.</p>

            's Defence. I was passing, and saw a ring forming for a fight; when I came up I saw my brother and the deceased stripped; he had no seconds, and said, "George, come and pick me up, as I have nobody to take my part," so I went - Foot said the deceased should fight no more. I threw up my handkerchief to signify that it was over, ran for my brother's clothes, and when I returned they were fighting again.</p>
               <p>FOOT's Defence. I and three more were passing, and ran to see the fight - we stood arm in arm. Saunders was the only person I knew; he said, "Come Tom, strip, I want you," and thinking he was going to fight, I stripped. When I saw Cousins getting the worst of it, I told him not to fight any more; but he would not hear me, and always arose as the time was called; we persuaded him not to fight; but he said he would have another round.</p>
               <p>MARSH's Defence. I was unknown to the other prisoners, nor was I present at the commencement or conclusion; but was merely passing.</p>

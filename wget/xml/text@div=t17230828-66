Another Evidence depos'd to the same Purpose, saying, That it was Allen that pull'd the Prosecutor down, and Kirk that had taken his Cane and beat him with it. That thereupon Murder being cry'd out they ran away, and Kirk threw the Cane back. The Prosecutor's Son depos'd to the same Effect. The Surgeon depos'd, He found a triangular Confusion upon the Coronal Surure; that the Scull was bare for a Fortnight, before it was covered. The Prosecutor being ask'd by the Court, Whether he lost any Money, or whether the Prisoners demanded any of him? he answered, No; neither had he but very little, being a Brick-maker, and then going from his Day-Labour. The Prisoners pleaded, That the Prosecutor jostled them, call'd them King George's Bull-Dogs, and said he was gone to Hanover to sow Turnips, which was the Occasion of the Quarrel. There being no Appearance of their having any Design to rob the Prosecutor, the Jury <rs id="t17230828-66-verdict335" type="verdictDescription">

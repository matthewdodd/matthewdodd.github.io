I said, "Yes, at Knightsbridge, at the grocer's;" I did not name the grocer - his name is Lawrence; he is not here: after some little hesitation he said, "Yes, I did change one;" I said,"Then where is the change?" he would give me no answer- I then said, "If you will not tell me where the change is, tell me where the other notes are;" I told him a large sum of money was stolen at the time the 20l. note was, and he must know something about them - he said he had seen no other, and knew nothing about any others; at that moment I received information respecting a 10l. note, and asked him where the change of the 10l. note he had just got changed was; he then said he had given it to his wife - I again asked him to tell me where the other notes were; he said he knew nothing about them - I left him in the guard-room, in charge of the serjeant of the guard, and went immediately in search of his wife, in a room in the barracks, but found she was not there; I went down stairs, and saw her coming across the mess-room - a serjeant who was with me said we wanted to speak to her; we took her into her room - I said I had come to her respecting the money she had stolen from Miss Whitfield; she said she knew nothing about it, she had taken none of them, and asked"Where is Oddy?" I said, "He is in custody, and you must consider yourself in custody; where is the change of the 10l. note your husband gave you just now?" after some hesitation she said, "Here it is," and took this purse out of her bosom, containing nine sovereigns and 14s. - I asked where she got it she said it was no matter, it was her own; I then asked her "Where is the 20l. note you gave your husband, and which he got changed at Knights-bridge?" she said that was her own - she did not deny giving him a note, but said it was her own; I asked her to tell me where the other notes were - she said she knew nothing about them; I said the 20l. note had been traced to be Miss Whitfield's property, and she must know something about the other notes - I said, "At all events tell me where the 50l. note is;" she again said she knew nothing about them - I then began to search, and in her box found an old pocket-book, in which was a receipt of Cox and Greenwood's, the army-agents, for 18l. paid in there on the 23rd of September; it says "Received of <rs id="t18301028-14-deflabel91" type="occupation">Corporal</rs>

On the Monday, after she had been before the Magistrate, (the 4th) I asked her if she had any thing to say to me, for I was going to leave the office - I did not hold out either threat or promise to her - she said she would be glad if I would tell Miss Whitfield that she was very sorry for what she had done - that she had never been happy since she had done it; she did not know it was so much, and she hoped Miss Whitfield would not prosecute her this time.</p>

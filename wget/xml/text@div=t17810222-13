               <p>On the 17th of last month a young man came and asked me to buy some coach glasses and a hammer cloth; I went and saw Watts and Dulwich; they told me they should have ten glasses if I would buy them? I said I could not buy the glasses till they brought them; they came again in about an hour with Wilkins. Wilkins said they could not get them that night, but if I would come to his house the next morning I should see them, and he directed me to come to the Nag's-head in Hackney-road. I went the next morning accordingly and met them there. Wilkins said if you will come to our house to morrow morning I will have the glasses for you.</p>
               <p>Who did you meet at the Nag's-head? -</p>
               <p>Only Wilkins; I promised to come the next morning; then I went to the office in Litchfield-street and told the affair to Grub. Wilkins said I should have the glasses a bargain because he had stolen them. I desired the officer to be in the way in the morning on the morrow; I went and they had been disappointed getting them, and I did not go any more after them. On Monday morning Wilkins's wife came to my house before it was light to fetch me to their house; I went with her; the house stands in a garden beyond Shoreditch church. He went into the garden and opened the ground and took out four glasses, some of them were broken; they were wrapped up in the hammer cloth; there were six glasses in the house besides those upon the drawers or dresser; he asked me four guineas for them all together; I agreed with him for two guineas and an half; he said the other lads were to have part of the money; they were not there at the time. I gave him 10 s. and took the four glasses under my arm; he said I had better take all of them. I said I could not carry them all. I took four in the hammer cloth and one on the outside; I said I was going home for the remainder of the money and would leave my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178102220023"></xptr> wife till I came back; he asked which way I should go home? he bid me not go near Brick-lane, because they came from thence; nor near Moorfields.</p>
               <p>Did he say they came from thence? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he say what house? - No; he only mentioned the street.</p>
               <p>Brick-lane and Moorfields? - Near Moorfields. When I came as far as Aldgate I found them heavy, I took a Hackney coach and went up to the office in Litchfield-street; I then went in the coach to M'Donald's house; I got him and Grubb to assist me; we went back together in the coach to where Wilkins lives. When we came in my wife told me, in our language, if we went to the hog-sty we should find somebody there; I told him to go to the hog-sty, and there he found Watts and Dulwich. I did not go myself to the hog-sty at first.</p>

               <p>How many glasses have you got there? - I have no glasses; I had the misfortune to break them when I went in the coach.</p>
               <p>Wilkins. What he has said is not true; he has been many times at my house; he said I owed him eight shillings and wanted to have the glasses - I never was in his house before; he appointed me to meet him at the Nag's-head. I have seen him before but did not know where he lived.</p>
               <p>Wilkins. He told me he had paid for the glasses before and there were eight shillings owing; that he had been in trouble about these glasses before.</p>

               <p>I went on Monday morning with my husband to Wilkins's house. We went into a little room; my husband and Wilkins went into the garden and brought in some glasses, and he shewed me some more glasses on the drawers; my husband agreed to give him two guineas and a half for them; they asked how much he had about him? He said ten shillings, and he gave them that ten shillings and said he would go and fetch the rest. I sat there while my husband went away; he was telling me it was a very cold night; but he made a very good fire with the frames which he burnt.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you what night? - The night before the Sunday night. In the mean time his wife came in; he seemed to be very uneasy and went backwards and forwards two or three times. He came to his wife and said, my dear, the pigs want feed. She said, well, if the pigs want feed they must stay a little longer. Dulwich's wife came in and asked if her husband was there? Wilkins winked and said no, he was not there. She sat down by the fire. He said if the man came to pay the money for the goods, the woman and his wife must go out of the room while he received the money; he seemed very uneasy, and asked me if I knew which way my husband was coming? I said I could not tell. A little while after my husband came in with the officers. I told my husband in Hebrew, that I verily believed there were some folks backwards that Wilkins seemed to be very uneasy about. The officer went immediately to the pig-sty and took the other two men. While he was tying their hands, Wilkins broke all the glasses at one blow with his hand, that nobody should have them. There were about six whole glasses.</p>
               <p>Wilkins. The glasses were left at my house. She and her daughter have been twenty times at my house for them? - I never saw his house in my life before.</p>

               <p>I went to Wilkins's house on Monday the 22d of January; I took Wilkins first and left him in the custody of Grub; then I went and took the other two who were lying in the straw in the pig-sty; I secured them, and while I was tying them together, Grub halloo'd out to me. I brought them in. Grubb said Wilkins had broke all the glass. His hand was cut. I asked him what he broke the glass for? He said for fun. Simons brought the hammer-cloth to me when he came for me. It has been in my custody ever since.</p>

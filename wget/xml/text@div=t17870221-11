In one part of the barn a was hen roost: we got out as fast as we could, and ran to a neighbour's, Captain Webb's, the next door; as soon as we were a little settled, we returned to get as much of our property out as we could, expecting the dwelling house every moment to be burnt down, the whole of the barn, together with a hen roost, and a room adjoining, was destroyed that night; this was on the 10th; the next Sunday, which was the 17th, after having foddered our cattle as before, and fastened the hogstye door myself, we went into the house; I believe the prisoner went in before us; every thing was safe at that time.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Had you any light at the time? - Yes, I believe we had a bit of candle; the prisoner was absent about ten minutes; when she returned, Mrs. Taylor desired her to do some trifling thing; she sat down, and had her own tea, and Mrs. Taylor sitting with her face towards the window, and I with my back to it; she cried out, Lord, what a light there is on the green platt; I turned round and said, Lord have mercy upon us, we are all in flames; I saw flashes of light, and the sparks from the thatch of the barn coming towards the house; we got out as soon as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210032"></xptr>we could; I was so much alarmed myself, I could hardly find my way out; I turned my eyes around, and saw my barley barn on fire; it had caught the wheat barn, and the stable, and they were all on fire. It burnt down my wheat barn, my barley barn, all my ricks of hay, my stable, six horses, my harnesses, and all my implements of husbandry; we then went to Captain Webb's with great difficulty.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What was in the pigstye when you went in to fasten it? - There was a fat hog which I fastened in before the fire, and that had got out into the yard during the time of the fire; the prisoner several times that day said to several of the family, she hoped we should not meet with any accident again that day; she hoped it would not happen again as it had the Sunday before.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure she made use of that expression that day? - She said I hope it will not be to day as it was last Sunday with us.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. After this I believe you advertised a reward of twenty pounds? - My friends did; there was a person of the name of Hanking taken up in consequence of some expression; he was discharged. On the 12th of January, soon after the second fire, we found a handkerchief, which the prisoner had declared was taken from her by force by two men at the bottom of the stairs as she was moving some of my things; on its being found, she was carried before

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Before she made a confession on the second examination, were any promises made to induce her to confess? - None of any sort by me, or any other person in my presence.</p>
               <p>Was she threatened? - No, all that was desired was, that she would speak the truth; it was made voluntarily; she was cautioned by the Justice not to say any thing that was false, and to be particular; her confession was read to her before she put her mark; Justice Bond said to her, now, if there is any thing here that is not strictly true, let me know, and it shall be altered; or if there is any mistake, check me as I read it; he then read it over to her, and made a stop; - Is this true, said he? she said, it is; he then proceeded with several pauses, always asking her if it was true, to which she replied, yes: when he had compleated it, he said, now, my girl, is this all true? - She said, yes, it is indeed.</p>

               <p>"said barn, which was immediately, a part</p>
               <p>"of said straw was hanging over the flame</p>
               <p>"of said candle, but had not caught fire</p>
               <p>"when she left the barn; that as she was</p>
               <p>"coming away from said barn, she pulled</p>
               <p>"out the peg of the door of the hogsty</p>
               <p>"in which was a fat hog, and threw</p>
               <p>"away said peg, but that she had no particular</p>
               <p>"motive for so doing; that she</p>
               <p>"then went into her master's dwelling-house</p>
               <p>"at the back door, which she bolted</p>
               <p>"and shut after her; that she then went</p>
               <p>"to the candle-box, took out a piece of</p>
               <p>"a candle, which she lighted by the</p>
               <p>"kitchen fire, and put it into the iron</p>
               <p>"candlestick which she had before placed</p>
               <p>"on the brown table; then went up into</p>
               <p>"her mistress's room where she drank tea,</p>
               <p>"after which her mistress desired her to</p>
               <p>"light Mrs. Edwards, whilst she put the</p>
               <p>"child to bed, which she did; that whilst</p>
               <p>"said child was putting to bed, her mistress</p>
               <p>"made the alarm of fire; when this examinant</p>
               <p>"discovered that the barn was</p>
               <p>"on fire. That this examinant was not</p>
               <p>"induced to set fire to said barn, from any</p>
               <p>"resentment, malice, or ill will, towards</p>
               <p>"her master or his family, or any other</p>
               <p>"person whatever, but that it arose from</p>
               <p>"a sudden thought, which she conceived</p>
               <p>"when she was making the toast as</p>
               <p>"as aforesaid; and further this examinant</p>
               <p>"says, that she was not induced to set</p>

               <p>"or solicitation of any person whatever,</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was any thing said to her to induce her to confess? - Nothing, I desired her to say nothing but what was true.</p>
               <p>(The Confession produced to Mr. Taylor, who acknowledged the signing to be his.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did she appear to be in her senses at that time? - She said she did it to ease her own mind, and to acquit innocent people.</p>

               <p>I am the wife of Mr. Taylor the prosecutor; the prisoner had been our servant about three months; on Sunday the 10th, after her return from the Admiral's, she sat down behind her master; at half after four she suddenly started up and said, if I did not want her she would go up stairs and change her petticoat; she went up stairs and staid about ten minutes, and on her return, she said she saw a man with a candle and lanthorn; she and her master went to the window to see what it was; they immediately ran down stairs; my husband cried fire; I ran down and found the place was on fire and burnt down.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you observe at that time whether she was in liquor? - She was perfectly composed; we went to Captain Webb's; the prisoner after assisting at the fire, came to Captain Webb's to us; I desired her to go out no more; she appeared to be much confused and in liquor then; that was about one or two in the morning; I heard after that she had been drinking; I desired her to go and lay down; on the Sunday following after foddering we went up stairs as usual, somewhat after four, I desired her to make a toast and get the tea ready; I desired her to light a candle; it was too dark to drink tea without; she lighted the candle, and after putting water in the pot, she went out of the room; where she went I know not; she was gone ten minutes or better; she came back again into the room; I desired her to go with Mrs. Edwards to lay the child down; when she came back I saw a great light on the green platt, in the front of the house; my husband immediately got up and said, we are all in flames again; he saw the flames coming round and we all ran out.</p>

               <p>Did you observe the hog there? - Yes, I saw it loose in the yard; we always made it a rule to fasten him in at tea time; after the fire I missed an old japan candlestick, with a handle; I have two of them, one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210035"></xptr>with a handle and the other without; the one I missed had a handle; the prisoner used a large iron one in general. (The candlestick produced.) The one found in the fire had a handle; it is a fellow to the one without a handle; on the evening of the second fire, the prisoner told me that coming down stairs with a basket of clothes, a man met her at the bottom of the stairs and took a handkerchief off her neck; she said it was a striped handkerchief, and that she had borrowed one of the cook at Captain Webb's instead of it; she said she had lost a black cloak; it was on the Monday week after the fire that she told me so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you ever see that cloak afterwards? - Yes, about a week after when she came to town with me to go before the Grand Jury, with respect to Hanking; when I heard the handkerchief was found, I asked her for the fellow to that she had lost; she gave me this handkerchief; she asked me what I wanted with it; I told her it was no matter;

               <p>Mr. Garrow. What did you suppose she meant by that? - At the time of the first fire, the people took the meat, pudding, and bread, and every thing of provision in the house; she several times in the day said she hoped it would not be as it was the Sunday before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Had you ever seen any symptoms of insanity about her? - No, I never saw any thing like it; she always appeared very well satisfied, and laid with my children; if she had been any way disordered in her mind, I never should have suffered her to have slept with my children; I had no reason to suppose she had any ill will.</p>

               <p>I am the constable; the prisoner was committed the 14th of January, in the evening, by Mr. Taylor the Magistrate; I was particularly desired not to let any body speak to her, except her father and mother; and I was to keep her in a close room confined, without fire or candle; she was taken before Mr. Taylor, on the Monday at 11 o'clock; she declared all to be false that she had said on Sunday, about Winden and Goring; she said the same on Tuesday; she was committed till Thursday; on Wednesday afternoon she wished<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210036"></xptr>to speak to her mistress, I said, I could not grant it; I was ordered not to let any body speak to her except her father and mother; she said, she wished to go earlier on the Thursday morning than she had gone on the former mornings, for she was very uneasy and would discover the whole truth; accordingly on the Thursday morning before I went out with her, she said, she should have acquainted Mr. Taylor on the Tuesday with the whole matter, provided there had not been so many people in the room; I wrote a note to Mr. Taylor acquainting him of this; and the room was kept clear; and there she made the confession as voluntary as could be; there was only Mr. Bond and Mr. Taylor in the room when she made that confession.</p>
               <p>Jury. What was her general behaviour? - She did not seem much concerned, but rather less than I expected both before and after opening her mind.</p>
               <p>Court. During her confinement did she see her father and mother? - Yes, her mother frequently, every morning; her father only once.</p>
               <p>Did you ever observe how she appeared in her presence? - Her mother fretted very much; she desired her not to fret, for she did not mind it.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was there no motive assigned in your house for her behaviour? - No, she always spoke in the most respectful terms of her master and mistress.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you know of any dispute of any sort between the prisoner and Goring and Winden? - I do not.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Taylor. Do you? - I do not.</p>
               <p>To Mrs. Taylor. Do you? - I do not particularly know.</p>
               <p>You say you do not particularly know, be so good, Madam, as to explain how far you know it? - All that I know is, that the prisoner said, there had been some words between Winden and his wife and her, and that she had Winden's wife before 'squire Taylor two or three times for slapping her.</p>
               <p>Was there thing any said respecting malt? - That was before either of the fires, it was not long before.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it that she had bad words with Winden and his wife, or with Winden's wife? - With Winden's wife on account of some slaps; she said, Winden has been my ruin.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did she explain in what way? - No.</p>
               <p>You said this conversation was before the fires? - I believe she said she had been ten times before 'squire Taylor.</p>
               <p>How many days was this before the first fire? - I do not know; I believe it might be about a week.</p>
               <p>Was there any intercourse between Winden and his wife and the prisoner to your knowledge? - I do not know what intercourse there was between Winden and his wife and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Jury. When the prisoner was speaking of Winden being her ruin, did you understand it to be the wife or the husband? - I understood it to be the husband; the name Winden only was mentioned.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, to Justice Taylor. Had this girl ever been before you on any charge against Winden and his wife? - I have not a recollection of it; it does not come to my memory that she was; she might have been; but from the multiplicity of people that come to me upon business it is hardly possible that I should recollect it.</p>
               <p>Jury. I suppose if she had been before you several times it would hardly have escaped your memory? - It certainly would not.</p>

            . I am a broker, and live in Church-road, St. George's in the East. On the 6th of June, Mrs. Dempsey, who lives next door to me, and keeps a broker's shop, came to me, and said a man had brought some things which she thought had been stolen, and asked me to come into her shop, while she followed him, as he said he was going for another parcel. I went, and saw one of the boxes lying open on the floor, with a pair of pistols and some loose papers in it. She returned, and said she had watched him, and had lost him just by the Wheatsheaf. Just at that moment, the man returned with another mahogany box, in a canvas bag. I asked him what he brought them there for? he said,</p>
               <p>"your master knows." I told him he must have been wrong informed, and that I should detain him till I sent for an officer. He wanted to go out, and seemed very much agitated. I delivered him to Williams. It was not the prisoner; it was a man named Afflect.</p>

             DEMPSEY. I am a broker, and live in Church-road, St. George's in the East. I was standing at my door - A man ran in with the box into my back room. I asked him what he had got there? he said, "your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181707020039"></xptr>master knows." He said he had another to fetch, I let him leave it. it was open - I lifted up the cover, and saw some pistols in it; I got Williams to watch my door, and followed him, but lost sight of him; he returned with the other box, and was secured. It was Affleck.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM AFFLECK. I am a cordwainer. On the 5th of June I was sitting at work about seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came in with a box under his arm, and his wife with another box, they requested me to let them leave the things there while they went a little further; knowing them, I did not suspect any thing was wrong, and let them leave them, expecting they would return and take them away as they promised; no person came-but the next morning his wife came, and asked if her husband had been to fetch them - She went away, and I saw no more of them. At five o'clock the next day I went to his house, and saw his son, he lives at No. 2, Church-road; the boy said his father and mother were locked up for things they had left at my house. I went and told the patrol - He advised me to send for an officer, I thought I had better send them to the prisoner's house, but instead of going into No. 2, I went to No. 4 (which is Dempsey's), by mistake, and left them there-when I came with the second box, I was taken into custody. I put the box into a bag that the things might not fall out-it being open.</p>

            . I took Affleck in charge; both boxes were left open-the pagodas were all gone.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I could not find out the cottage; I met an old shipmate and got intoxicated, and meant to return to the tavern the next morning. I asked Affleck to keep them safe for me, and gave them to him as I received them; he must have taken the money himself, he should have been indicted instead of me.</p>

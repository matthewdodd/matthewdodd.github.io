She lives near Bexley, in Kent - on the 18th of April, I came to town, to see my sister, at Mr. Coventry's, in Grosvenor-place - I had worked hard the day before I came away; and early in the morning of the 19th I was going home with my brother - we went into a public-house in Whitechapel-road, to take some refreshment - the female prisoner was in the house, and she asked me to give her some gin - I gave her a glass - my brother then told me to come out, which I did - I had not at that time seen the male prisoner - we went out to another public-house, and the female prisoner came in there after us - she must have followed us - I had a glass of gin in my hand when she came in - she asked me to treat her again - I gave her the glass out of my hand, and said I did not like liquor - my brother and I then came out, with a good many more - I lost my brother, and as I was proceeding on, the female prisoner overtook me - I went up the road with her towards my brother's lodging, where I was then going - I then told her I would go back to the public-house, and see if I could find my brother - I got back nearly to the house, when she came back after me, and said my brother was at the place where she came from, and he was looking for me - I went back with her, to go to my brother's lodgings, but before we got there, she unlocked the street door of a house, and asked me to go in and sit down - I went in and sat down in a chair, on the ground floor directly I got in - I had the two half-crowns, and three shillings and sixpence in my waistcoat pocket, and two shillings and sixpence in my right hand trowsers pocket - I had not seen the male prisoner at that time, to know him - when I sat down, I dosed off to sleep - there was a light on the table - I was afterwards awoke by the male prisoner, who asked me how I came into his house - I told him I was asked in by a female to sit down - he said it was impossible, for no one could get into the house but himself - he then showed me a key, which he had in his hand, and which had been in my pocket when I went into the house - he said it would undo his door - I told him if it would undo his door it was not my key, though it was in my possession; it was the key of my mistress's garden; I slept in the garden - I then felt for my money, as I knew the key had been in the same pocket with my money when I entered the house - my key and money were gone - he then ordered me to go out of his house - I told him I would not, as I had been robbed in the house - he said if I did not go he would knock my b - y brains out with the poker - I said I would not go out, let him do what he would, till I had had redress, as I had been robbed in the house - he then called the policeman in to give me in charge, and the policeman took him, as I said I had been robbed - the officer asked me if I could recognise the female who had opened the door - I said I could, and we went up stairs, where I saw her in bed, undressed - I am sure she is the person - I swear positively to her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q. The male prisoner called the policeman? A. Yes, and he took both the prisoners, and said I had better go to the station-house and settle it - I went there willingly - the man made great resistance in the house - my brother lives in Plough-court, and this happened in Hope-street, Montague-street - I had one glass of gin in the first public-house, but none in the second - I gave it to the female prisoner - I had had one glass of gin before I went to either of the public-houses - I was a little fresh but quite sober, and knew what I was about perfectly well - there were a great many different persons in the first public-house - I went to the bar - my money was in my trousers and my waistcoat pockets - my coat was unbuttoned - there were a great many people in the second public-house, and a great many were coming out when I did - I heard my brother say, one of the men was Shrimpey - my brother has been in town two or three years - I cannot say whether he knew Shrimpey well, but he pointed him out to me, and said, "There is a man of the name of Shrimpey" - I did not know any one in the house - I felt my money safe just as I was at the prisoner's door - I took that precaution, as I had seen in the newspapers many curious accounts of countrymen being taken in - I took my money out to count it while the female prisoner was striking a light - I do not know that she saw it - she was about two yards from me - I had a sovereign when I came to town, and when I got back to the last public-house I had a half-sovereign and two sixpences - I changed the half-sovereign then, and received two half-crowns and 5s. - I had the two sixpences before - I put two half-crowns and 3s. 6d. in my waistcoat pocket, and 2s. 6d. in my trousers pocket - I did not lose the 2s. 6d. - I was not five minutes in the prisoner's house before I went to sleep - the key that I had did open the prisoner's door - this is the key, it opens the hot-house, the green-house, and the garden doors.</p>

            . I live at No. 10, Plough-court. I was with my brother - I went with him into the first public-house - I saw the female prisoner there - I knew her before, and am sure of her person - after treating her with a glass of gin there, we went to another public-house - she followed us, and asked my brother to treat her again - he gave her the glass of gin out of his own hand - I then took my brother up the road, as I wanted to get him away from her, but she followed and got him away from me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you been in London? A. Nearly three years - I think the first public-house we went into was Broadbelt's - I dare say I had been there twenty times - I cannot say what kind of people were round me - it was at the second public-house down by the Pavilion that I saw Shrimpey - I do not know the name of the public-house - I had been there two or three times - there was a large party there - I knew Shrimpey and the female prisoner and one or two other females - I did not see my brother after we got out.</p>

The prisoners were brought there, and confined in separate cells - I heard the male prisoner say, "Jemima" - as I knew the female prisoner's name was Jemima, I listened, and heard the man say, "Can you keep a secret?" - she said, "Yes" - he then said, "There is half-a-crown under the table cover in the kitchen - I want it to be brought here"- she said, "How are we to get it?" - he said, "Get your mother to come in, and I will give her the key" - the jailor then came down - the male prisoner gave the key out to him, and said, "Give this key to my mother" - the gaoler said, "I cannot" - he then said, "Throw it over to her;" but as I knew there was some of the money missing, I told the gaoler not to do it.</p>

               <p>ELZIA PARKINS I am single—I lived with the prisoner as his wife two years, up to July, at 13, Hendon Place, Pimlico—on 3rd August, about 5 o'clock, I went out for a walk by myself—we had had no words—he said, "I will go and seek for work"—he went out before me—I walked towards Battersea Bridge, and when I got over it he came up to me, and said that he was coming to go for a walk with me—I asked him what business he had following me—he said that he was not following me—I still kept walking on, and he kept following me—I went to his brother's house—he followed me there—I was there two or three minutes, and then went to a friend's house in Pimlico—he followed me down into the kitchen—I stayed there two or three minutes, and then went straight home, and he with me—as soon as I got home, I took off my bonnet, struck him in the face, and asked him what he meant by following me—he said that he did not follow me; he came with the intention of going for a walk—I kept hitting him all the time—he held my hands, and slapped me in the face—I said I would get a situation, and go away and leave him—I flipped him in the face with a towel—he said he would not stand it any longer, and struck me in the face—I called out, and the landlord came up—I ran towards him, and felt a knife being put into my back, just below the shoulder blade—the prisoner was then behind me—I had been putting the knives into the box previous to that—I had said, "I will knock your brains out with the tongs"—the tongs were there, but I had not got them—the prisoner followed me down stairs, and said he was very sorry, and wanted to come into the room, but I would not let him—I saw a doctor.</p>

Yes you did—you got one, and the others fell on the floor—when you slapped me in the face, I turned round and ran to the landlord—I used no gesture to him—I had flipped him with the towel—I had the towel in one hand, and the knives in the other—I fell into the landlord's arms—I ran against him, and fell backwards somewhat.</p>

I am the landlord of the house—these people lived there six weeks—on 3rd August, 1 had been up two or three times trying to pacify them—she always flew at him, it appears, and he always got her down, and held her by the hands, and she cried out, "Leave go of my hands," and he has said, "I will, if you will be quiet"—I heard the prisoner scream, "Mr. Nisbet! Mr. Nisbet!"—I rushed up stairs—the door was wide open; the table was standing near the bed, and he was holding her down with one hand on the bed, and getting a table knife out of the drawer with the other—he made three or four probes at her back, but only struck her once—she rushed down stairs—he looked very wild—I was afraid of the knife, and</p>

               <p>rushed down stairs, and he after me, into the room where my mistress and children were—they went into another room, and I collared him.</p>

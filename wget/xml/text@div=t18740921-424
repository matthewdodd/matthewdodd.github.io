I was in the prisoner's service on 27th August last at Church Street, Camberwell; it is a coffee and cook's shop—I had been in his service about five weeks—on the morning of the 27th I first saw my mistress a little before 10 o'clock—she came into the kitchen—she had on a light cotton dress and a bonnet and shawl, dressed to go out she did not remain in the kitchen many seconds, she went towards the shop to go out—I heard her cry out that she was stabbed; that was not many minutes after she had left the kitchen—the prisoner's sister was in the kitchen with me, she went in the direction the voice came from—I did not go—Mrs. Coppin ran out into the yard and I went out after her—the prisoner's sister was, with her before that—I did not see what she did—Mrs. Coppin had gone into the yard, and then I heard her cry that she was stabbed; the voice came from the yard—I and the sister were in the kitchen—the sister went into the shop to send some one for a doctor—I went to where Mrs. Coppin was—I found her in the yard—that was after I heard the scream—she told" me she was stabbed—I saw that she was bleeding—she went up stairs; she was able to walk up—I and the prisoner's sister went up with her—we put her on a sofa and partly undressed her—we could not undress her quite—I did not notice where the prisoner was at that time—he came up a few minutes afterwards—the deceased said she was sorry it was him, and that she had aggravated him to do it—the doctor was sent for and came.</p>

I am a carpenter, and lodge at the Walmer Castle public-house, Peckham Road—on the morning in question, about 10 o'clock, I went to the prisoner's shop to have some coffee—after I had been there about ten minutes, I heard screaming from the room at the back of the shop; previous to that I had heard no sounds at all—I saw the prisoner standing just inside the door of the back room in front of the door—he had a knife in his hand which he was using—he saw me when I entered; he looked towards me—I did not hear him say anything; he was using the knife cutting up some meat—I was asked to fetch a doctor; the prisoner said "I have done something now, and a doctor will be no use"—he was then in the same spot where I first saw him—it was two distinct sentences.—his words were "I have done something for you, Emma"—that was while I was being asked to fetch the doctor, because I hesitated at first; I wanted to know why I was to fetch a doctor, I did not see any reason for it—when he said "I have done something for you now," he called out in a voice as if he was addressing himself to somebody up stairs—the screaming was the first thing I heard—I rose from my seat and looked round, and then I saw the prisoner, and I was applied to by the sister to fetch a doctor—I did not hear the prisoner say anything before that—it was about the same time, while the sister was asking me to fetch the doctor, I heard him call out "I have done something for you, Emma," and "A doctor will be-of no use"—they were two sentences; there was a pause between—I went and fetched the doctor—where I came back, the prisoner was seated in the front shop at one of the tables, and he directed the doctor where to go; he said "Up stairs in the front room"—I then left.</p>

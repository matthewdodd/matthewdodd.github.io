On the 10th of May I was going to draw some beer, I thou heard something up stairs. I went up way, and meet the prisoner coming down I said, What are you at there? He said, No arm; he wanted a taylor. I took him by coat, and we came down. I said we have no tylors here. He opened his coat, and said I have not robbed you of any thing. I said I intend to see that, and he should not go till I was satisfied. He said I should not hinder him. I called assistance, and took him backwards. I then went up stairs, and missed seven guineas, and the other things mentioned in the indictment. I came down, and put my hand to his waistcoat pocket; then he took the spoons and ladle out of his coat pocket, and laid them on the table. I said I missed seven guineas. He took some money out and laid it on the table; some of the people counted it, and there were but six. I said there must be more; he then took out more, which when counted wanted 6 d. we found the 6 d. upon the stairs afterwards, which I suppose dropt out of the papers. They were in silver and small gold, ready for change.</p>
               <p>Joseph Lane. I was in at Mr. Free's house, I heard him cry out three or four times, officer; I went to him, he had the prisoner by his coat in the passage; he said the man had been up stairs, and he did not know whether he had robbed him or not. We took him into the back room; then Mr. Free went up stairs and came down again, and said he had been robbed of seven pounds, seven shillings, three spoons, and a silver ladle; then the prisoner took the spoons, ladle and money, out of his pocket.</p>

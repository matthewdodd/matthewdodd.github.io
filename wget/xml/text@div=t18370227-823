The prisoner came to our shop from ten to eleven o'clock on the 8th of February, and asked if I could tell him where to buy the best Olasso juice, that is Italian juice—I asked what quantity he wanted—he said, "A chest or two"—I then said Bedwell and Yates, or Williams would serve him as cheap any one—I did not write this order nor any order—it is not written by my master or any one in the shop—we have no one of the name of Smith in our employ—I did not see that the prisoner was drunk.</p>

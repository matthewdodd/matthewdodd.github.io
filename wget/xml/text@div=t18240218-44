            . I am apprentice to Mr. Nicholas. On the 23d of January, about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, I was in the kitchen, and saw the prisoner put his hand through the cutting room window, which I am<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182402180022"></xptr>certain was shut at seven o'clock; I did not see him lift it up. I saw him put his hand through the iron bars, and take hold of two pieces of chintz, and some blue calico. I called Stop thief! and he dropped the chintz, and took the calico. I ran out of the front shop door, and met him coming up the court, which the window looks into, with the calico under his arm; he dropped it directly - I called Stop thief; and some people coming along stopped him, without my losing sight of him. I picked it up.</p>

I met him by the Duke of Richmond's portico, and took him to the office. Another person had hold of him.</p>

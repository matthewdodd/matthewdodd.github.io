               <p>Q. Do you keep a lodging-house? - A. We had a spare bed to let for a gentleman, and he hired it of us.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know what business he followed? - A. I knew him before he lodged with us, he was in a respectable line of life, in the occupation of a <rs id="t18050220-56-deflabel337" type="occupation">linen-draper</rs>

               <p>Q. How many might there be? - A. There might be seven, eight, nine, or ten pair, I cannot tell; he told me he had bought them at a sale; 
I gave him seven shillings for the two pair, (produces one pair); the other pair has been washed and worn.</p>

             sworn. - I am a linen-
draper, No. 202, High-street, Shadwell.</p>


               <p>Q. Look at those stockings. - Do you know them? - A. I am sure I never sold them; I know they are mine, by my private mark; I missed these stockings and a few others at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes, I have known him some time; he came to my house frequently as a visitor, he called in as he was passing by; I have known him about a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what employ he was in at that time? - A. He was in a situation in Ratcliff-highway during some part of the time, but the latter part he has been out of a situation.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first discover these stockings at the house of Mrs. Watson, where the prisoner lodged? - A. On the Saturday night prior to the Monday morning he was apprehended: Mrs. Watson called upon me for me to tell her where to find the prisoner, and in the course of conversation I received the information.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. How the stockings got from your shop you do not know? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I understood you to say, you have known this person a twelvemonth? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you had a good opinion of him, else you would not have suffered him to have visited you? - A. About a month before he was taken up, I had a good opinion of him.</p>
               <p>Q. You have many cotton stockings in your shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had sold a great many before this time? - A. Not cotton stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. That had your private mark upon them? - A. I have not; I cannot swear for my wife, sometimes she serves; I dare say she will swear that she has not.</p>
               <p>Q. And sometimes somebody else? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It is no uncommon thing for you to sell them to your customers that deal with you, you deliver them over with your private mark? - A. These are different stockings, these have got a clock; I had but half a dozen pair of stockings of that make in the whole.</p>
               <p>Q. I see you have got the clock upon me now, but that will not do; will you swear that neither you nor your wife had not sold a pair of clock stockings prior to October? - A. I will not.</p>

On the 20th of April, between twelve and one o'clock, I looked into a chaise for a coat, which I had seen safe about eleven o'clock - I afterwards found it in a straw-loft over the stable, in which the prisoner works; I cut two notches in the bottom of it, and left it there. I went there again about half-past six o'clock in the evening, and the coat was removed; he was not in the loft then, but I had heard him there a short time before. I got an officer, and we took the prisoner as he left the yard; I asked him for the coat which he had taken out of the chaise - he denied all knowledge of it at first, but afterwards said he was very sorry - that he deserved any punishment, but hoped I would spare him, on account of his wife, and he would show me where it was - he then went to the loft, removed five or six trusses of straw, and gave the coat out; he had lived with me about seven months, and conducted himself with great propriety.</p>

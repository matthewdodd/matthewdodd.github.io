                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mark Polack, of Brydges-street, Covent-garden. On the 30th of Jan. I saw the prisoner in the shop—we had a broken window, and the prisoner applied to my mistress to mend it—she asked him how much it would be, and he said 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it was agreed he should do so, and he went away—came back with Mr. Jackson and the glass—my mistress paid Mr. Jackson, and he left the glass with the prisoner, to mend the window—I then left the shop—I returned in ten minutes, and the prisoner and the glass were gone—I did not see him again till the police<lb></lb>man brought him the next day—I am sure he is the same person.</p>

I live in Duke-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields, and am a glazier—the prisoner came to purchase a pane of glass at my shop, to put in a window in Brydges-street—I went with him there, and took the glass to Mr. Polack's shop—the lady paid me, and I left the glass with the prisoner.</p>

I received information on the 31st of Jan., and took the prisoner in Drury-lane—I asked if his name was Robert Parsons, he said it was—I spoke to him about the glass, he said it could not be him, he never was in the shop, nor asked for work there—Waring recognised him.</p>

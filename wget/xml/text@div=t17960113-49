I told him yes, they were; he pointed to Matthews, and said, that is the man that has been robbing you continually; I have ten pair more that have been offered me for sale; I examined all the other shoes, I found them all to be shoes of mine; I have been in the continual habit of missing shoes; he seemed very much flurried and confused. The prisoner and my wife both serve in the shop, as well as myself; for that reason I cannot positively take upon me to swear that these shoes were absolutely stole from my shop, I have every reason to believe it from the evidence given, but I cannot swear that they were taken from me by a thief.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Israel did not work in your shop? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Matthews did? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not the person offering them for sale? - A. No; the man said, he always had them of the handsome Jew.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not that handsome Jew absconded ever since? - A. He has.</p>
               <p>- FORD sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a shoe-maker; eight days before the prisoners were apprehended, a Jew came into my shop to sell me some goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the man called the handsome Jew? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the man? - A. No; he asked me if I had not bought a lot of new shoes? I told him I had; then, says he, I can give you some information.</p>
               <p>Q. The shoes that are the subject of this prosecution? - A. No; a lot before these; he told me those shoes were come dishonestly by. From his information, I waited a few days, and the prisoner at the bar, Israel, brought me this lot; when he had taken them out of the bag, I bid him go with me; I took him then to Mr. Wills's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no knowledge of Israel? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. There is certainly no evidence against Israel.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Mr. Ford.) Q. Did he tell you who he had them from? - A. He said he always had them from the handsome Jew.</p>
               <p>Court. There is no evidence to affect either of these prisoners; because Israel is charged as a receiver; and a receiver cannot be convicted till a principal is convicted; and, therefore, there is no evidence to affect either of them.</p>

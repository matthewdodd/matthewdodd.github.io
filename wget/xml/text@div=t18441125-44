                  </hi>. I lodge at No. 13, Bouverie-street, Fleet-street. I am not in a situation at present—I was brought up as a chemist—on Sunday evening, the 10th of Nov., I had been to Portland Chapel, in Little Portland-street—I left there at half-past eight o'clock—I went from there to the end of Portland-place, towards Regent's-park—I turned down Regent-street and met the prisoner—I had never seen him before—he said, "It is a fine evening," looking round at me—I caught his eye—I said, "I beg your pardon, I fancied I recognised your face "—I walked on towards the City, towards home, and noticed the prisoner several times—he was by the side of me—he addressed some remarks to me, which I replied to, and in that manner I arrived in Fleet-street—I went into the Johnson's Head—I did not see anything of the prisoner before going in—I did not expect him to follow me in—I went to the end of the room—as I walked up the room, I did not see him till he took his seat by the side of me—I did not know he had followed me—when he took his seat, he turned round, as if looking for the waiter, and then remarked that he should, have a glass of stout—I turned my head, and, seeing the waiter coming, I requested him to bring two glasses, or, rather, two half-pints of stout—the prisoner made some re<lb></lb>marks respecting the number of "Punch" which was on the table—he merely said, "This is the Lord Mayor"—I believe be mentioned the concerts that were had at Johnson's Tavern, and asked if I was fond of music—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Friend, do you play any instrument?"—I said, "Yes, the piano"—at this time, two glasses of stout were brought—I threw down a half-crown, the waiter gave me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, and 1 returned him a penny of it for himself—the prisoner had not said anything about his paying.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the reason you paid for the prisoner's stout? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was not my intention to do so—I threw down the half-crown, the waiter took it up, and delivered me the change, and as it was a very trifling sum, I took no notice of it—I did not mention it to the prisoner—I drank my stout, and so did he—after I bad drank it, I asked him to allow me to pass him, to go out—he got up, and I passed him—I had no con<lb></lb>versation whatever with him before I passed him—I did not invite him to follow me—when I got to the end of the passage leading into Fleet-street, I noticed that he was still with me—I said, "I am not far from my lodging, I shall therefore wish you good-night"—I then passed across to Bouverie-street—I did not notice which way the prisoner went—I walked straight to my lodging—it is very near the bottom of Bouverie-street, on the right-hand side—Bouverie-street is a very dark street at night, and not well lighted, particularly at that end of the street—there are two or three</p>

               <p>steps leading to our door—I had a pass key—there were two other lodgers, who had keys as well as myself—I did not notice anybody in the neigh<lb></lb>bourhood bourhood of the door when I opened it—I found some difficulty in open<lb></lb>ing the door, in consequence of the latch-key being very much out of order, of which I had complained to the landlord a few days previously—I ultim<lb></lb>ately opened the door—I cannot say what the time was—I walked in, and I heard some one on the steps, and he came in almost immediately be<lb></lb>hind me, but I did not take any notice of it, as there are other lodgers in the house, who come in at various times of the night, and I fancied it was one of those parties—it was quite dark—I walked to the bottom of the stair-case, and then took off my boots and coat, which I laid in a chair, just at the entrance to the parlour, as I usually do—I went up the stain, I suppose about twelve or thirteen stairs, towards the window where my light was usually placed—I took one of two candles, and a box of lucifer matches, struck a light, and lighted the candle—I was quite in the dark until then—the candles are left there for the purpose—when I had lighted my candle, I turned round, and saw the prisoner—on seeing him, I went on straight to my bed-room, for I was so suddenly alarmed, so much taken by surprise, that I was scarcely conscious of what I did—I went on to my bed-room as if from habit—my bed-room is the second floor back-room—as soon as I had got into the room, on turning round, I found the prisoner behind me—he came in immediately after me—he then turned, shut the door, and locked it, and said in a suppressed tone of voice, "I demand 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I immediately said "For what? I do not understand you"—"Oh," he said, "you know very well what for; you know what you have done"—he then went to the bed, threw himself at full length with his hat on, and said, "Here I shall remain for the night, and make myself comfortable unless you give me that money "—he then got off the bed, and, I believe, I was standing somewhere near the mantel-piece, but I cannot recollect now, for it produced so much fright—he then came up, and said, "Well, if you can't give me the money, I must have something equivalent to it," and he took the pin from my scarf, a diamond ring from my little finger, and a cambric handkerchief out of my coat pocket—there was a paper parcel on the floor, tied up—he cut the strings of that, to see the contents—he then went to the dressing table drawer, and turned over the things there—he then went to the washhand-stand drawer, and from that he took an old blue silk handkerchief—there were two or three things in that drawer, some rags that I had been accustomed to use in applying poultices to my hand in a case of erysipelas, and the blue silk handkerchief I had used to secure the poultices to my hand—he took that handkerchief out of the drawer, held it up, and said, "Oh, this will do for me"—he then said, "Now I am in a hurry; I want to be off" and he said, "If you give me a £10 note, I will give you 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in exchange"—I did not make him any reply—he asked me for my watch and chain—he then said, "Well, perhaps you will give me a promissory note for the money "—I looked round the room as if looking for writing materials—not seeing them, I requested him to follow me down stairs—I went into the back sitting-room—I saw ink on the table, but no writing paper—I said, "I have writing-paper up stairs," and under that plea I went to call Mr. Chadwick, who is an inspector of police, lodging in the same house—I informed him of it, and gave the pri<lb></lb>soner in charge.</p>

               <p>yourself the previous part of that day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Calling on my friends—there was a party in St. James's-street, named Ellis, who kept an hotel there; another party in Falcon-street, who kept an hotel; and after that I went down to Rupert-street—I went from the City in an omnibus to St. James's-street—I then went and lunched with my friends, sat with them about an hour, and then went to dine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You found your way into Regent-street after chapel? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—that was in my way home, as I had occasion to call in Regent-street at Savory and More's, the chemists—they have another establishment in Bond-street—I met the prisoner about half-past nine o'clock—I went to Savory and More's to inquire after a friend—I had resided there two years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What were you doing from half-past eight till half-past nine o'clock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Walking to the end of Portland-place for a walk, walking slowly—the prisoner did not stop—he was walking on in the same direction as me—I have not said he was standing still—he just turned his head round—I thought, on looking at his face, that I knew him—I took him for a gentle<lb></lb>man, now abroad, named Holton—I was going towards home—I did not go the nearest way, that I am aware of—I turned down John-street, through Golden-square—I did not take any notice—I believe 1 went a circuitous way—I cannot tell which way I went after leaving Golden-square till I got into Fleet-street—I cannot tell the names of the streets—I cannot say whether it was circuitous or straight, nor what time I got to Fleet-street, or to the Johnson's Head—he walked by my side—he ad<lb></lb>dressed his conversation to me, and I answered him—that continued all the way, occasionally—he was sometimes by my side and sometimes a tittle behind, in consequence of the narrowness of the pavement—I swear I never walked arm-in-arm with him for one moment—it had rained just before I got into Fleet-street, and I believe it had rained in the morning—I had my umbrella—I did not offer him part of it—my umbrella was up just before I got into Fleet-street, but he was not under it—he was following me when I went into the tavern, not by my side—I was in the tavern a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—we were not in conversation the whole of that time—I merely made the remark about the piano—he made the remark, and I replied—I have a piano in my house—he first mentioned the piano—he asked if I was fond of music—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Perhaps you play the piano<lb></lb>forte?"—I said, "Yes"—I cannot tell you the whole of our conversation on the road—he asked if I was in any profession—I told him I was educated in the medical profession—he said he was acquainted with a medical student in Manchester, and spoke about the theatres, and, I believe, said he had travelled abroad—I threw down half-a-crown for the waiter, and he took the money for both glasses—it was such a trifle I did not think it worth mentioning—I never walked with a stranger before, and was never in the slightest degree connected with such a case as this—I got up first to leave the tavern—he followed me out immediately—I wished him good night at the end of the passage, and did not see him after that—I did not expect him to follow me—I gave him no notion where I was going—I did not see him again till I lighted the candle by the stairs—I opened the door with some difficulty—I was some time about it—the nearest lamp is some distance from the house—I took it to be a lodger came in—I have said so before this—I believe I said so at the second examination, and I believe I said it to my landlord—I walked up stairs after taking my boots off—he shut the door.</p>

               <p>know what became of him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not give myself any concern about it, as I thought it was one of the inmates—he did not pass me—there are two sitting-rooms on the first floor—he might have gone up before I got to them</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you imagine he had gone into one of those rooms? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I left him to shut the door of the house—I never uttered a single syllable—I wore Wellington boots with straps—when I got up stairs I lighted my candle, and was astonished to see him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In the complete prostration of your faculties, you rushed up to your bed-room, as fast as you could? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I passed the drawing-room floor—Mr. Such, the gentleman who lodges there was not at home—I went on to my bed-room on the second floor—the police inspector lives in the room above me—Mr. and Mrs. Edgell sleep in the next room to me—I did not pass their room—the moment I got into my room I put my candle down, and when I turned round I saw the prisoner—I had seen him before at the bottom of the stairs—I can scarcely tell whether I heard him coming up stairs or not, I was so frightened</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it your fright that prevented your going up to Mr. Chad<lb></lb>wick's room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was—I was not self-possessed at the time—I scarcely knew what to do—I cannot tell what time it was—I have not got a watch</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you tell whether it was one, two, or three hours after you left Portland chapel? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot tell anything about the time—I think the prisoner was in my room, about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, I should think not longer—the handkerchief was in my drawer—that is not where I usually put dirty linen—I put the handkerchief there, as it was the most convenient place for the purpose I applied it-to—I will swear I did not resort to a most disgusting act in the prisoner's presence with that handkerchief—I do not exactly understand you—I imagine this was insinuated by the piisoner before—I will swear I did not resort to that course with that handkerchief in the prisoner's presence—I did not proceed to take the slightest indecent liberty with the prisoner, nor did I make any indecent overtures to him whatever—I had applied poultices to my hand in linen rags, which I fastened on with this blue silk handkerchief—the last time I had used it was on the Saturday night, the night before—it had been on my hand all night; I took it off on the Sun<lb></lb>day morning—the poultices were composed of bread and galard—I did not offer the prisoner any of these things</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> He took them forcibly from you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It required very little force, I was in a state of excessive nervous excitement—I was not standing quite still, I was trembling—I believe he put them into his pocket when he took them from me—he asked me for a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and said he would give me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he did not show me any 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I saw him searched—2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was found on him, no notes whatever—I believe my things were found close by the side of him, on the table—I left the room under pretence of getting paper</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What induced you to leave the room then to call Chadwick, rather than calling him before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was so nervous, and I lost so much self<lb></lb>possession, I scarcely knew what I was about</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you first saw him in the passage, what impression was on your mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That I was in the presence of a stranger, and could not account for his motive in being there—I had not the slightest idea of any attempt of this kind—I was in that state of trepidation from seeing the</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I should like to know more of your history; what have you been? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A chemist—I am not a chemist now, I am seeking for a situation—I have been out of one for about twelve months in consequence of ill-health—the last situation I had was in Paris, for about six weeks—I left that by the recommendation of my physician, who advised me to return home as soon as possible, being in a very bad state at that time—before that I was at Savory and More's, whom I left in consequence of extreme ill-nealth—that is two years ago this month—I will swear it is not longer—during the remaining portion of that first year I was at home recruiting my health—my home is at Portsmouth—I have been looking for a situation for the last twelve months—I can satisfy you with letters—I will swear it is not more than two years since I left Savory and More's—I am supported by my father; he gives me every thing that is requisite—he is a coach-proprietor, living at Portsmouth</p>

               <p>his ring, and attempting to extort money from him, under pretence of having committed an indecent assault—the prisoner said, "It is a lie;" and show<lb></lb>ing me a blue handkerchief which he had in his hand, said, "Look at this, sir, this is enough for me "—I made him no reply—this is the handker<lb></lb>chief—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw on the table a ring, a union pin, a purse, and a card—the prisoner was standing close to the table—the table was on his right hand—I directed Mr. Faulkner to call the constable—after he had gone for the constable, the prisoner said, "I don't want to make any fuss about it; if you like to let me go "—the prosecutor then came back with Dearlove, the officer, and in their presence I asked the prisoner his name and residence—he refused to give his name—he said his residence was in Soho—I asked him what part of Soho, and he said, "I am a respectable man, and shall not state what part of Soho"—by my direction, Dearlove searched him, and he took from his hand the blue handkerchief, and took possession of the purse, and other things—when I entered the room, the prisoner had his hands in his pockets, he was facing the door, and, from the sudden movement he made with his hands, I considered it my duty to secure him—I called the prosecutor, and asked him to repeat his charge—his hands were in his pockets, and he was drawing them out.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police constable</hi>.) On Sunday night, the 10th of Nov, I received charge of the prisoner from Chadwick—I searched him, and took this blue silk handkerchief from his hand—it was wet in several places—I found a cambric handkerchief, and a gold pin and purse on the table behind the prisoner</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The handkerchief was wet? A Yes, not very wet—I do not know whether it appeared to have been wet recently—it appeared to have been squeezed together, and one wet place would make the other wet</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 30, Bouverie-street—I am landlord of the house—Mr. Faulkner had lodged with me three weeks previous to this affair—in the course of that time I had noticed some<lb></lb>thing the matter with his hand, on which he wore poultices, and I have seen this blue handkerchief wrapped round these cloths in which the poul<lb></lb>tices tices were—I think that had been the case for a week or eight days be<lb></lb>fore this occurrence—after the transaction had taken place, Mr. Faulkner told me the circumstance which had happened to him.</p>

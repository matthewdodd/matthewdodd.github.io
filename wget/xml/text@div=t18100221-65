               <p>Mr. Gurney. It appears a mighty odd thing, you are a taylor, but you do not taylor - A. No, not sit to the work.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you stand to the work - A. Yes, when I have business to cut out.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that - A. Two years past.</p>
               <p>Q. You first of all said, you was in the silk mercery line, then a taylor, and you now are in the shop way; that is to say, you serve in the shop of Mr. Herbert - A. Yes; he is a shoemaker, in St. John's-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you served in Mr. Herbert's shop - A. About a month.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. Where did you live in February last year - A. At Mr. Williams's, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not wonder that you are puzzled in answering me - A. I do not know that I am exactly puzzled, I fancy I was living at Mr. Shakespeare's, Covent-garden, or at Portsmouth, I will not be sure. I lived with Mr. Shakespeare about a week.</p>
               <p>Q. You do improve upon it. I see you lived this year a month at a place and last year a week, where were you before that - A. In the Fleet.</p>
               <p>Q. What business did you carry on - A. A silk mercer, in Whitechapel; I cannot say the number. Mr. Herbert served me with shoes when I was in business.</p>
               <p>Q. You never accepted any bills for him - A. I accepted one when I was in business in Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that signature - A. That is not mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that, is not that the signature of your friend Herbert - A. I have not a doubt it is.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not accept any bills of Mr. Herbert payable at Mr. Pickett's, and when the bill became due you were not forthcoming - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Pickett was rather a troublesome visitor of Mr. Herbert's for money - A. I do not know; I never saw him before that day. I know now Mr. Herbert owes him money.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, that Mr. Pickett's umbrella was before you when the man took the leather, why did not you push him down stairs and go by - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Pickett was alone, was not he - A. Yes: as soon as I could I ran after the person, and I found nobody.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Pickett was taken before the magistrate this day fortnight - A. Yes, and his brother; the examination was adjourned till the Thursday, and then adjourned till the Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Thursday they were set at liberty, and came on the Monday - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Monday the magistrate examined all the witnesses you had, and you were managing the prosecution, and suggesting every thing to the counsel that attended, the magistrate told you, you might indict if you pleased; they were set at liberty - A. It is impossible for me to tell whether they were set at liberty, or on bail.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any recognizance either for you or any body else - A. I did not enter into any.</p>
               <p>Q. They were set at liberty, and then last Friday you indicted them for breaking and entering, and stealing all this leather - A. I attended according to his order.</p>

I was coming down St. John's-street, he was going towards Islington; I thought he seemed rather confused. I saw him turn up a court. When I came level with the court he came back again, passed me, and went towards Islington. I lost sight of him. I was going to Mingays, the bankers, in Smithfield. When I came level with Mr. Herbert's shop, I saw Mr. Newman and

I went with him soon afterwards; he said, he saw a man put his arm up and take leather.</p>

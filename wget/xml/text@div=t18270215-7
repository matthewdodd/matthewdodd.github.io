            . I am a constable of Oxford-street. On the 7th of February, at nine o'clock in the evening, I took the prisoner in charge - I told him it was for stealing a pair of overalls and a coat - he denied knowing any thing of them; I searched him, and among other duplicates I found one on him for the overalls, and as I took him to the watch-house he said, voluntarily, that it was the duplicate of the overalls which he had taken that morning, and it was of no use to deny it.</p>

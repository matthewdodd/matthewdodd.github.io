               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DUNN. Q. Where do you live? A. I occupy the room adjoining the prisoner's brother; I was at the door when I saw him going out - he opened the door for me to go in. I was at Bow-street, and said I had no doubt but that was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not say "I believe him to be the man, but I am not certain?" A. I have no doubt.</p>

               <p>MR. DUNN. Q. Did you not first say you did not think the prisoner was the man, but when it was found that you lived in the next room, did you not then add "I have no doubt?" A. I have no doubt - I heard nothing of this till next morning; I told my wife of it on the Sunday, and she related it: I appeared at the second examination- I did not know of the first one: I did not see what was in the basket.</p>

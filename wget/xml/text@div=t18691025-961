                  </hi>. I live with my aunt, Mrs. Hilton, at 12, Hawkins Street, Mile End Road—on 29th July last, I saw Berry at my aunt's house—he came up to the window and spoke to her—he said he could get her a nice gold chain, that it was in pawn for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and she could have it for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Eigley then came in, and Berry said he would send his man for it—I went with Eigley by omnibus for some distance—he went to a pawnbroker's, and left me outside the door—I don't know what street it was—when he came out he put a chain round my neck, and said "There is a nice thick chain"—we then went back to my aunt's house—Berry was not there then—Eigley and I went in, and Berry came in two or three minutes after—he took the chain off my neck and put it round his own, saying it was larger than the one he had sold before—aunt then gave him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in his hand, and I went out to get change for a sovereign, to give him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was to be 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the chain was to be bought forme—I paid for it with my own money—they went away then—I saw Berry a few days after, at my aunt's window again; he said "Don't get lumbering that chain, for it was nicked out of Hatton Garden"—my aunt said she did not want the chain owned directly she got it, and asked him to give me the money bock, and take the chain—he said we should not get any money out of him and he went away—the chain was put away—I saw him at the house</p>

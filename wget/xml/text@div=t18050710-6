               <p>Q. Did you lose any thing out of your pocket while you were there? - A. Yes, a handkerchief; I was in the crowd where they performed the pantomime, about seven o'clock in the evening; I had my son with-me, he is about fifteen years old; we went into the country about four or five miles, and spent an agreeable day; I was tapped on the shoulder, and asked if I had not lost an handkerchief; I felt in my pocket, and found it was gone; I do not know when it was taken from me; the handkerchief was shewn to me, and I perceived it to be mine; it is a broad check red cotton handkerchief.</p>

             sworn. - I am a patrol attached to Worship-street Office; I was at Bow fair on Friday, the 7th of June, and about seven o'clock in the evening I saw the prisoner at the bar in the crowd there; I saw him make several attempts on different gentlemen, I saw him draw a handkerchief out of Mr. Stennett's pocket, and after he had done it, I immediately took hold of him by the collar, and took the handkerchief out of his hand; I secured the handkerchief and the prisoner, and brought the prisoner to town with me. After I had took hold of the prisoner, I touched Mr. Stennett on the shoulder, and asked him if he had lost a handkerchief; he put his hand in his pocket, and replied he had; I produce the handkerchief. (The handkerchief identified by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going through Bow fair, and that handkerchief laid on the ground; that gentleman took me up, and said I had picked the gentleman's pocket.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

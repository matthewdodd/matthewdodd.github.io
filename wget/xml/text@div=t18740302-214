Please let bearer have a small cheque book and oblige, James Ryan"—I said "Do you come from Mr. Ryan?"—he said "Yes"—I said "Mr. Ryan of Long Acre?"—he said "Yes"—I looked at it twice, thinking it was not a proper document, but in the hurry of business I gave him a book of fifty cheques, and the cheque in question is one of them.</p>

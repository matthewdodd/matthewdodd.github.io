On the 23rd of October I sent the prisoner to Mr. Drake, a customer, for the money due the bill had been previously sent—it was his. duty to account to me for money received, when he returned—he said Mr. Drake was out he was to call again, and he had received no money—I sent him several times after—he never brought me the money—on the 21st of December I sent him to Mr. Curling for an account, and he called again the next day he re<lb></lb>turned, and said he was to call next week, and that he had not received the money—I gave him the account in each instance—the accounts prodiced were made out by me, and I find the prisoner's signature to them.</p>

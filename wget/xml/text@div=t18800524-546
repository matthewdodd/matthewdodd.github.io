Goddard says:</hi> "On Sunday, the 9th, I was drinking in Mr. Rogers's public-house at the corner of Steward Street along with my wife, my sister, and my mother-in-law and a nephew, John Anderson, from 8 till about 11. I came at once to see if I could borrow twopence off my brother. I went down Artillery Lane about a quarter to ten, and met Mr. Johnson's son, and he saw me at that time. At 11 o'clock I goes home with my wife, and at 10 past 11 her little brother comes home and tells me a robbery has been committed in Steward Street, and the name of Anderson was mentioned in the robbery. On Monday morning, about half-past 10, I goes up to Mr. Marter and I says to him 'I hear there's been a robbery here, and my name was mentioned in it' He says he does not know; he was not in, and he was about four miles away, but a man upstairs name of Brazier says it was you, and he knows you. I says 'I wish to see the man,' and he says 'He's not in; come up in an hour's time.' I comes up and he was not in, and he says 'Call up about 3.' I comes up about 3 and the detective was there, and I did not see Brazier till I got to the station, and he says it was me, and I says 'You have made a mistake.' Faley says: "I had a row with witness Collins the other day in Brushfield Street, and that is why he has come up against me. He is a false swearer, and he said to the people around, 'I'll have my own back again,' and he heard of this case and he went and gave my name in." Jennings says: "On Sunday, the 9th, at 7 o'clock, I went home and had a lay down, and at a quarter to 9 I came out again and I went in the Gun public-house in the middle bar and had a half-pint, and I sat by myself. In about a quarter of an hour's time I saw a lot over in the private box. There was James Collins and his wife, and his cousin's wife, and John Faley and William Neal, and a few more I did not properly know, and I went over with them and drank with them till 11, when Mr. Fisher ordered us out, and we went out, and I bid them all good-night and I went home. There has been a rare lot of thieving at Fisher's, and he has blamed it all on to us. It happens to be that James Collins, the witness, did it."</p>

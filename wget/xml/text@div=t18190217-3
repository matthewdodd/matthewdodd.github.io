I missed the articles stated in the indictment - I found Wilks in custody at the watch-house.</p>

             WALKER. I am servant to Mr. Wray; I sleep in the kitchen. I went to bed before my mistress, and am not certain whether the door was fastened; at two o'clock I was disturbed, and found two men in the kitchen - it was the prisoners; Barefoot was at the bureau, searched the papers over; he had a small piece of candle in his hand - Wilks stood about a yard and a half from him, between the bureau and the door; I saw them plainly, and am sure they are the persons. I asked them what they did there? they told me to hold my noise, and called me a great fool; I said I would not, and knocked against the wainscot to alarm a young man who slept in the next house - they then began to make their escape; before that Barefoot asked me where my master kept his money? I told him to go about his business, and made the alarm - they went out of the door, which leads into Hopkins's yard - both the doors were open; they were shut when I went to bed. I followed them, and made the alarm; the watchman took them - they ran towards Holborn.</p>

            . I went to bed last on the night of the 30th of January; I shut the door which leads into our yard - it shuts with a spring-lock. I always try the doors after me, but do not know that I did on this night.</p>
               <p>ROBERT APPLETON. I am a watchman in Holborn. About ten minutes after two o'clock, the prisoner, Wilks, came and lit his pipe at my box; while he was lighting it, Barefoot came out of Eagle-street - he turned round to see if Wilks had got a light, and both went down Red Lion-street together. In about ten minutes I went and cried the half hour in the direction they had taken; I went towards Hopkins's gate, and saw them both come out of the wicket-gate together - I seized Wilks, and he immediately dropped the boots and shoes. I sprung my rattle - Quar came to my assistance, and picked them up. Barefoot ran across the street, and through a court - I am positive he is the man - he was close to me - the street is lit with gas.</p>

            . I am an officer - the servant described Barefoot to me, and I apprehended him on the 10th of February, at Walker's-court, St. Giles's. I knocked at the door, and asked for Barefoot? he denied his name; I went in, and took him. Wilks sent me a letter, and I went to him in Newgate; he said it was the first time that he ever did any wrong, and that he was concerned with Barefoot in breaking the house open - he told me where to find Barefoot.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at 7, Elm-grove, Brixton-hill—I am Senior Lieutenant in the 3d Surrey Militia—I became acquainted with Mr. Steinmetz some months ago—I do not recollect the exact date—to the best of my recollection it was a few days before this agreement was entered into (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Memorandum of agreement made the 11th day of July, 1860, between Junius Eicke, Lieutenant 3d Surry Militia, and Andrew Steinmets of 16, Boundary-road, St. Johns Wood, Barrister-at-law,—In consideration of the said Junius Eicke having placed the said Andrew Steinmetz in nomina<lb></lb>tion as Captain Commandant of a Rifle Corps which he has raised in Surrey, and provided the said nomination shall ensue, the said Andrew Steinmets doth hereby consent and agree to clothe the first company of sixty men, at the rate of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for each man, and to allow the said Junius Eicke to appoint the drill sergeants, provided that they are efficient and up to their duties")—The agreement originated in this way, he said he had been an ensign in the Victoria Rifles, but that the Duke of Wellington had deceived him, and that he had been induced to spend 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and did not get his cap<lb></lb>taincy; he said he should very much like to be made a captain—I said, "As there is the rifle movement now, if you would clothe the men, there are many respectable men, clerks and others, with small salaries, who would then be happy to join the corps, but who cannot afford this expence"—he then agreed to do so, and he gave me this agreement, and I acted upon that agreement by sending to Lord Lovelace, and Lord Lovelace consented to nominate him as captain, and accept the services of the corps.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHARNOCK</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In whose handwriting is that agreement? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the handwriting of the prisoner—the whole of it is written in his handwriting and signed by him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know what the defendant is by profession? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He told me he had studied for the church, and then he had studied for the bar—I asked him why he left the bar—he said he did not think that any one but a rogue could succeed in it—I said it was a strange argument—he said he could not reconcile it with his conscience, therefore he would not practice—he then said he had been brought up for a surgeon, but he did not practice; but that he had been to Hythe and obtained a certificate there—that he was then made ensign of the Victoria rifles, but he did not get his captaincy—he said the Duke of Wellington had deceived him, that he had promised him the captaincy and given him an ensigncy—I said that when the first company of the proposed corps was started, in all probability it would increase, and we might get it up to the strength of a regiment, and that no doubt as the strength increased, according to the rules of the War office, he would perhaps get his majority, that he might do so, but it would depend upon the Lord Lieutenant, whether he would accept him—he had not said anything about wishing to be a major before that, but he then said he was very anxious to be a major—the other officers referred to in the agreement, are only staff officers, drill instructors, not commissioned officers—after the agreement was signed, he had some communication with the Lord Lieutenant—he told me so—he said the Lord Lieutenant refused to make him a major—I said I was astounded that he could make such an application, knowing, as he well did, and as I did, that unless there were four or five companies raised it was impossible he could be made a major, that even Lord Lovelace himself had not power to make him a major—he said "well" the matter rested between him and Lord Lovelace—I said I did not think he ought to trouble Lord Lovelace with such numerous applications, it must throw rather suspicion, upon me—he said I had nothing to do with it then, because the matter depended between him and Lord Lovelace—to the best of my recollection this conversation was a few days after the agreement had been signed—he did not tell me before, of his intention to go to Lord Lovelace—I wrote to the defendant, to the best of my recollection, the day before I received from him the letter upon which he is indicted—it was on or about the 26th—I have served a copy of a notice to produce that letter—I served it personally upon Mr. Booth's clerk yesterday about 1 o'clock—on the following day, the 27th, I received from the prisoner this letter (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "16, Boundary-road, St. John's-wood, 27th July, 1860. Sir; In reply to your note, threatening legal proceedings, I have to inform you that if within twenty-four hours you do not retract that letter, and return me the paper on which you found your claim, obtained from me, such as it is, by surprise and unfairly, I will lay the whole matter before the Lord Lieutenant; for the public benefit and the volunteer movement this very suspicious matter shall be sifted to the bottom—you admitted yesterday that your brother was the Eicke of the late commission sale affair, and now another member of the same family has tried his hand with the volunteer movement; in your excuse to me yesterday for the family connexion, you calumniated Lord Brougham and his brother, and last night, your father, in like manner, asperaed the Earl of Jersey—this intensifies my suspicion of you—I suspect, however, that the letter just received, was written before you saw me last night—I have further to inform you that I have not as yet refused the command of the corps through the Lord Lieutenant, with whom alone I have to do; your</p>

               <p>threat is therefore not only ridiculous, but premature—depend upon it, I will not flinch under your intimidation, or that of your father, whose appearance in the scene is, to say the least of it, indiscreet—your obedient servant, Andrew Steinmetz. P.S. Remember that you hold, or stated you held, a commission, and it was this that placed me into undue confidence in you—I admit my error, however, in trusting you")—In that letter he charges me with having calumniated Lord Brougham and his brother—there is not the slightest foundation for that—I never calumniated Lord Brougham—some short time after the defendant had signed, the agreement, he said he thought it might be arranged for the men to repay him back the amount of the clothing—I said that was contrary to the terms of the agreement, and it would be unfair to me, and they would not listen to me if I proposed it to the members, because it was an understood thing that they should be assist<lb></lb>ed with the clothing, and lay by to prepare for fresh clothing as they were worn out, but that they were to start free of debt—he said, "Well, then, the matte'r must rest," he would not go on with it—by the terms of the agreement it was to be done at once—I received these other two letters from the defendant, they are his hand-writing—they reached me by post—the date of the last is 30th July—he has never performed the agreement up to this time—he has called on me since—I am not sure whether it was before or after the 27th—I saw him—he said he wanted his likeness back that he had given me—it was a photograph that he had presented to me—he gave it me to show to the members of the corps—I had got upwards of sixty members promised—I did not exhibit the portrait to any of them—I put it in my sitting room—when he called, he said he wanted his likeness back, and he would have nothing more to do with the matter—I gave it him—he said he had only lent it to me, but he had really given it to me in the first instance as a present, and he said "If you put the wig in a certain position, it was like Our Saviour."</p>

               <p>day that I received the threatening letter, I received another letter in answer to one that I wrote—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">called for this letter, and it not being produced, read a copy of it as follows:</hi> "Sir, In further reply to your threatening letter of yesterday, I beg to say that I am quite prepared to carry out my original intention respecting the alleged corps of rifle volunteers, provided, the services of the same be accepted by government, and I be nominated Captain Commandant, after laying before the Lord Lieutenant a copy of the original memorandum, and all the letters that have passed between us. Your obedient Servant, Andrew Steinmetz. P.S. Clearly, if you have acted honestly in this transaction, you will not resist one moment to accede to this honest proposal, it will prove whether you can bear inspection or not in your present speculation; (my last proposal was merely a test of your respectability,) of the alleged corps—you refuse to propose it to them and why.") I received that letter—I don't know whether it was the same day—I don't recollect whether it was before or after the other—I learnt that Mr. Steinmetz was going abroad—I took proceedings against him, and issued a writ, and made an affidavit that I believed he was going abroad, upon which I had him arrested—my reason for suing him, and having him arrested was a claim of 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon this very agreement, as trustee in the matter—I was the only party who could sue of course, as trustee for the amount; the corps could not sue him—I also sued him for the amount of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due to myself, expended by me—the demand made was upon the same agreement as that referred to in the letter—I had him taken in custody on the writ, and he gave bail to appear—I am proceeding with it, it is going on—I do not know how far my solicitor has gone—my father is not my solicitor in this case; I don't know about this case—I do not recollect the date of my taking proceedings to arrest the defendant—to the best of my recollection it was about a month after this letter had been written—he gave bail, and went abroad.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you then go before the Grand Jury without giving him any notice, and without yourself going before a Magistrate, and prefer this bill against him for felony? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I gave him notice before he went abroad that I should prosecute him—I went before the Grand Jury—I really do not know whether or not he was then in England—I went to Marylebone police-office—they said they did not quite comprehend the matter, and that I had my remedy by indicting him before the Grand Jury, and I went and indicted him before the Grand Jury—I then got a certificate from this Court, and a warrant from a Magistrate, and arrested him—I believe that was last Wednesday week—I did not receive notice from him that he was coming up to put in bail—I did not appear next morning at the police-court, because they said they would give me notice, which they did not do.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> My friend has asked you about the mode in which you get your living; is it at all an uncommon thing with military men to teach at schools? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not at all—I teach as a drilling master at ladies' schools—I looked forward to being made adjutant if this went on—there is no pay in the rifle corps, except for the adjutant—he is paid—the pay is about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for a horse—the proceedings with regard to the arrest and the indictment were taken by my solicitor—the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I expended was for the expense of printing, and so on, which he told me to get done—the notice I gave him before he went abroad that I should proceed against him, was embodied in a pamphlet which was sent to him—I did not person<lb></lb>ally tell him that—the mode in which I contemplated forming this corps is the mode in which several corps have been formed—on the other side of the</p>

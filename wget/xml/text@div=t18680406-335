I keep the Quadrant Hotel, Air Street, Regent Street—on the night of 19th February, I served the prisoner with sixpennyworth of cold brandy, he gave me a crown—I gave him two shillings and a half<lb></lb>crown—I afterwards told him it was bad, and sent for a constable—he had been there about a month before that, for some stout and bitter, and gave me a florin, which I kept in my hand and gave him change; after he left I found it was bad, and gave it to a gentleman who was in the bar, he gave it back to me—I kept it a few days and then threw it in the fire; it melted immediately.</p>

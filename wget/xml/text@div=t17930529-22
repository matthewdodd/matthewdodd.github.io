               <p>I am brother-in-law to the last witness. There were seven cotton handkerchiefs with plain blue borders, they cost 10 s. I see the prisoner steal them; they were within the shop, hanging across a line.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of goods do you deal in? - Haberdashery, millinery and lace. I saw the prisoner take them away; I pursued him and never lost sight of him till he was taken; the patrole has them now in his possession.</p>

               <p>Court to Murrell. Did you deliver these handkerchiefs to the hands of the patrole? - I did not, I saw them delivered.</p>
               <p>(The handkerchiefs produced and deposed to by Murrell, as the same he lost, and the property of his sister-in-law, marked by himself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was tried for this affair last sessions, and set at liberty for it.</p>
               <p>Murrell. It was a mistake of the justice's, he bound us over to prosecute at the general sessions at Westminster? and when I attended I found the prisoner had been discharged before I came.</p>
               <p>Court. You was not tried by a jury, you was discharged for want of prosecution.</p>

               <p>Mrs. KNOTT sworn. - I was in the shop when the prisoner and another boy came in, and asked for some worsted stockings, and I shewed them some; I went to the door to call the shopman, in so doing, I partly turned my back to the prisoner, then my husband came into the shop, and I know no more of the transaction; I am sure the prisoner was one of the two boys.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. When I went into the shop, I was in the kitchen; I went to the side of the counter where the boys were, they wanted to look at some different from what they had seen; I cast my eye upon the window, and perceived some stockings missing; I then suspected the boys had taken some, the other boy immediately slipped out of the shop; I placed myself in the door-way, that the other should not pass me; I asked my wife if she had not; I then turned round to the prisoner, and told him, I was afraid he had taken some stockings; I then perceived that he had thrown a pair of stockings on the ground, they laid about three yards from him; I did not see him throw them down, but he immediately gave me another pair into my hand; I think he took them from his pocket, I am not certain; I then told him I must take him into custody; I know them to be my stockings, they have my private mark upon them, they were missing from the window.</p>

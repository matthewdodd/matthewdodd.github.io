                  </hi>. I live in Tottenham-court-road, and am a shopman in the employ of John Samuel Crispin. The prisoner was an apprentice, and lodged in the same house—on the 15th of February, a boy I had in the shop with me, discovered this pair of boots wrapped in a piece of calico, in a back kitchen they were brought to me—I knew them to be my employer's—I put them back in the kitchen, at very near nine o'clock, and in about half an hour after, I saw the prisoner go down stairs—he went past the place into the front area—he then came back into the kitchen—I went in, and he had got the boots in his hand—he had no business there—I said, "You have stolen these boots from the shop?"—he denied all knowledge of them—he said he was there to look for his master's coat—I saw no coat there—I sent for a policeman—these are the boots, and this is the calico—they are the property of my employer.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge in the house, and work for Mr. Crispin. About a quarter past eight o'clock on the 15th the prisoner and I returned from Hoxton, and then I sent him out—while he was gone, the witness came up, and asked if I knew this calico, I believe it is part of this piece which I had, and to which the prisoner had access.</p>

               <p>Q.From what part of the body did the blood seem to issue? - A. From her head, it flowed out of her mouth, her nostrils and her ears.</p>

             sworn. - I live over the prisoner's head; I was not at home when the prisoner and the deceased came home; when I had been in my apartment a little while, I heard them quarrelling about some money that the deceased had to receive, a yearly income her father had left her upon his decease; a year's money became due that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you at all hear what was said about money? - A. I heard Bond say that it was his money as much as her's, and she said it was not his, her father had left it her, and she should see about that; presently after I heard Mrs. Bond cry murder, and then I heard five or six-blows, they followed one another as fast as they could; I then took the candle and went down stairs, and met Bond coming out of his own door, and drawing the door after him; I said to him, you villain, you have killed your wife; he said, he had done nothing to her, and was going to get a pennyworth of beer; he went to go down stairs, I told him he should come up, I would see what he had done, and he said, no, he should go for the beer; Mrs. Huddlestone then laid hold of him, and told him he should go up and see what he had done; she did go up, but I cannot say what situation she was in, for I was so terrified, that I did not know what I did.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see any thing that caused your fright? - A. I saw Mrs. Bond lying in a heap, and a vast deal of blood about, I was very much frightened before that, for I thought he had done<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179810240007"></xptr>so, though I did not know; I then went to fetch Mr. Franks, the surgeon.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when any thing was found in the room? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mrs. Bond when Mr. Franks came in? - A. The house was so full, I could not get in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. How long had you lived in that house? - A. I had lived there about eighteen or twenty months; the prisoner and his wife lived there before I came.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you intimate at all? - A. Only how do you do.</p>
               <p>Q. I perceive Bond is very far advanced in life? - A. He is better than seventy years old, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. He seems very infirm? - A. When he meets with any thing to take any particular effect upon him, he may.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you observed that before? - A. Yes, he is an old man.</p>

             sworn. - I lodge in the same house with the prisoner, in the two pair of stairs, with Mrs. Shaw; I came home between six and seven on Saturday night, and when I went up, I heard the prisoner and his wife having words about the money that her father had left her, which came due that day, and as soon as I had got into my own room, I heard Mrs. Bond cry murder, and then I heard repeated blows, I could hear it distinctly, the doors were both; what happened afterwards I do not know, for I was so frightened I was not able to stir off my chair till after the surgeon came, she was then lying in an immense quantity of blood.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Have you lived in that house any length of time? - A. About eighteen or twenty months.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any opportunity of knowing whether he was deranged in his mind? - A.According to my judgement there was nothing of that sort.</p>
               <p>Mr. FRANKS sworn. - I am a surgeon in Great Smith-street, Westminster; I was called in about seven o'clock in the evening to the assistance of Mrs. Bond; when I came into the room, she had expired; the body was lying upon the floor, in the middle of the room; finding the woman irrecoverably dead, I endeavoured to discover the cause; I removed the cap of the deceased, and with my finger I soon traced a fracture of the cranium, with a wound on the left side of the head.</p>

               <p>Q. Did that appear to have been given by a blow with the fist, or an instrument? - A. With an instrument. The next morning, about eleven o'clock, I again attended, ordered the head to be shaved, and found another fracture of the skull, on the same side of the head, about two inches from the other wound, there was a depression of the cranium, the bone had been forced inwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it your opinion that those blows were the cause of the death of the deceased? - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt? - A. Not the least in the world.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you either on Saturday or Sunday discover any instrument? - A. On the Sunday morning I discovered a bill-book lying within the sender, and I give it as my opinion, that that instrument was adequate to the mischief that had been produced.</p>
               <p>Q.Did it appear to you that the wound had been given by such an instrument? - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you observe the hands of the deceased? - A. The woman had a stocking on. - On the Wednesday after the Coroner had seen the body at Mr. Chippendale's, an undertaker's, I discovered a confused wound on the left hand of the same kind with that on the head, and appeared to have been given by the same instrument.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Do you conceive that it might have been possible for this woman, by any fall against the bedstead, or sharp corner of any furniture in the room, to have received these wounds? - A. Impossible; she might have had a mere simple fracture, these things are common; but something else must be superadded to cause instantaneous death.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel.</p>

             sworn. - I am a coachmaker, No. 38, Tuston-street, Westminster: I have known the prisoner twelve years, till within about a fortnight before this happened, he had frequently been at my house; he is sixty-nine years of age.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you intimately acquainted with him? - A. I have frequently sharpened his saws for him, and he has communicated his mind frequently to me.</p>
               <p>Q. From the opportunities you had of observing his mind, tell the Court and Jury what your ideas were with respect to the sanity of it? - A. I have frequently known him so disturbed in his mind, and so perplexed, that he was like a madman at times; a little more than a twelvemonth ago he came to my house in a disturbed unhappy state, and was communicating how disturbed he was in his mind, and that he should make away with himself; he said, he was going up Millbank-row, and supposing I was to throw myself in the water, says he what will the consequence be; my wife said to him, suppose you were to put your finger in the fire, and you were to feel the smart, how would you bear that for a whole eternity; he then said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179810240008"></xptr>I thank you, God bless you, and bounced out of the room in a mad freak.</p>
               <p>Q. At any other time can you recollect any thing particular taking place? - A. Yes, at various times similar to this; I followed him out of the house at that time, and he went up Orchard-street; I persuaded him to compose his mind, and go in and have a drop of purl, being early in the morning; I reasoned with him upon his disturbed state of mind. and not to go near his wife till he was more satisfied; but, when I left him, I could not get any kind of answer from him, in any measure, like a man.</p>
               <p>Q.How came you to speak of his wife? - A. He frequently used to say, his mind was so disturbed he could have no peace at home; and he and his wife used to quarrel a great deal.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever explain to you what they quarrelled about? - A. No, not particularly.</p>
               <p>Q.Can you tell us of any other particular occurrence that led you to notice the state of his mind? - A. Rather less than a fornight before this affair happened, I think it was about Monday or Tuesday was a week before it happened, he came to me to sharpen a saw for him, and he communicated his unhappy mind to me, that his shirt was in a pail soaking, it was not washed for him, and he was very bad with a cold, he could hardly crawl about; I said, don't mind that, Mr. Bond, get somebody else to wash it for you; he went away, and said, God bless you, I shall not see you any more.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that he uttered that expression, did it strike your mind, at the time, that it was the observation of a person frantic with melancholy and despair? - A. Yes, as it had been at various times before.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know him at all in Berkshire, at a place called Bracknell? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing particular happening to him there? - A. I left that country before it happened.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Perhaps you know who this man works for? - A. He worked for the same master that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not continue working for that master so long as he did? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in that master's employment at the time this melancholy affair took place? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him at all that day, or the week before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore how his mind was on those days, you do not know? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of his being absent any day from work for the last fortnight? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that his wife had a little money of her own, independent of him? - A. It is a little cottage that was left by her father.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you heard him converse at all upon the subject? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever heard him express any discontent about her having that money? - A.There was always a controversy about it.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a carpenter and builder, in Jermyn-street, St. James's; I have known the prisoner many years; in the year 1792 and 1793, he was in the habit of working for me the greatest part of the time.</p>
               <p>Q. During that time, was there any thing led you to take notice of the state of his mind? - A. At different periods he would be away from his work, and walk about the streets like a man deranged in his senses, without any known cause; I have set him to work in a morning, and he has left it before night without any known cause.</p>
               <p>Q. Did his conduct evince to your mind that of a disordered mind? - A. At those times that I have now mentioned it did.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he worked for you since? - A. In 1794. and 1796 he worked for me, and his fits grew worse upon him, and more frequent; I employed him but a very short time, at that period, in consequence of that; since that time I have known nothing of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You don't mean to say he was constantly deranged in his mind, but had occasional fits of derangement? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you observe any thing particular that brought on those fits upon him? - A. Many times his wife has come and sent for him, but at other times, without any known cause to me, he has gone away and left his work.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you ever observe any other symptoms about him than that of a gloomy melancholy disturbed man, that could induce you to suppose he did not know what he was doing? - A. I cannot say that I ever did.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a smith, at Battle-bridge: I have known the prisoner at the bar all my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him intimately? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course then, you had an opportunity of observing the state of his mind? - A. Yes, at times it was like the mind of a man who was not in his proper senses; he was not capable of his business at different times; there was one instance about nine years past, he attempted to make away with himself, by hanging himself in his work-shop; he was saved by being cut down in time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him on the 29th of September last? - A. Yes, he came a little after two o'clock in the day; he stopped with me till just the turn of four o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179810240009"></xptr>Q. Did you observe particularly the state of his mind at that time? - A. I saw that he was enraged about something, and was not at all like the person that he was before, from the particular motion of his hands, and of his eyes, that I took particular notice of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did his mind, at that time, appear to have been the mind of a person deranged? - A. He said to me, I am very careless about any thing, for I am not for this world, as if he had meant to make away with himself; he mentioned these words several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing else particular in his conduct, so as to induce you to conceive his mind was disordered? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Something had made him angry? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that his wife had some little property of her own? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that that was the cause of his anger that day? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him what he was angry about? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know he expressed himself angry that he could not get at this money? - A. He has told me of the money, that he was expecting of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he tell you that his wife would not let him have it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never hear him express himself angry that his wife should have this money at her own command? - A. No, never in my life; he told me, the Thursday before this happened, that he was going with his wife to take that money.</p>
               <p>Q.When you saw him on the Saturday, did not you ask him what had put him in a passion? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he with you? - A.About two hours.</p>
               <p>Q. And you never asked him what had made him angry? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And did he leave you in the same degree of anger in which he came to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Were you in the room with him all the time of those two hours? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a good deal of conversation with him about different things? - A. Yes; I spoke several joking things with him, and asked him to drink.</p>
               <p>Q. However, you had a good deal of discourse? - A. No great deal.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you rational answers? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he seem to understand you? - A. He gave me some times quite contrary answers.</p>

               Death
            </rs>. (Aged 69.)</p>
               <p>Tried by the first Middlesex Jury, before Mr. Baron HOTHAM.</p>
               <p>SENTENCE.</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder. Prisoner at the bar, After a very patient and a very humane discussion of your case, by the learned Judge who tried it, you have been convicted of the most horrid crime of murder, a crime so malignant in its nature, that it is difficult to find words to express its atrocity. All civilized nations are agreed in punishing this great offence with death: by the law of this country, the murderer is condemned to die; a law which has the very high sanction and authority of the sacred scriptures. Even in the atrocious crime of murder, there are very different shades of malignity; your's is a case of the very deepest die, you have, in savage brutality, most wantonly dared to spill the blood of an unarmed, innocent, and helpless woman, to lift up your blood thirsty hands against the partner of your bed, the partaker of your forrows and your happiness, when she was in the act of sober honest industry; a person to whom, under the most solemn vow, you had engaged to afford shelter and protection from every harm; what could excuse such an offence? nothing short of the deprivation of reason. Most unfortunately for you, the Jury, in the discharge of the duty they owed to themselves and to their country, have found that this most horrid deed was done in found mind, and in most wicked malice. Inasmuch as your offence is of the greatest enormity in the sight of God and man, so ought your contrition and your repentance to be most sincere and most unfeigned; I most earnestly request you, therefore, to make the very best use of the very short space of time that will be permitted you to remain among us; and I pray Almighty God in the attributes of his great mercy, that the very ignominious death you are about to suffer, and the public exposition of your body after death, will expiate your high offence here, and restore you to happiness and peace hereafter.</p>

               <p>As the Law commands me, I now proceed to pass this dreadful sentence, that you,

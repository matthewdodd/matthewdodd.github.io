               <p>DANIEL WEBB sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am a <rs id="t17971025-31-viclabel158" type="occupation">corporal</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17971025-31-victim265 t17971025-31-viclabel158"></join> in the first regiment of Tower-Hamlets Militia: On the 1st of September I went after a deserter from our regiment, who enlisted by the name of Cooper, we could not find him; but going along, we met with another deserter of the name of Staggers, and took him to a public-house; serjeant Pearce was with me, and was going to hand-cuff him, but he said, I know him very well, and he would go with me; after we had got out, he got away, and I jumped towards him, and caught him by the hat, but he got away, and left the hat in my hand; I ran after him, and when I got to the corner of Sharp's-alley, Cow-cross, a man knocked me down, that was neither of the prisoners, this was between five and six o'clock in the evening, it was as much day-light as it is now; I then went on after serjeant Pearce, and corporal Pearce, towards Chick-lane, and when I got to the bottom of Chick-lane, I went into a public-house to get the dirt scraped off my clothes, and we had a pot of porter; at that time I had a pistol, I knocked the prime out, and gave it to serjeant Pearce, and he put it in his pocket; while we were there, I saw the prisoner Coleman, and others, come in at the public-house door, and they waited till we came out; when we came out, Coleman said, you have not got the man, and d-n your eyes you shall not have the man's hat; he struck the hat out of my hand, with a stick, to the other side of the street; I turned round to serjeant Pearce, and said, we will take him to Hatton-Garden-Office;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179710250017"></xptr>with that, he out with a pistol, and fired it at me, the ball entered at my wrist, and broke the small bone; the ball was cut out by Mr. Ramsden, in St. Bartholomew's hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you from him at that time? - A. As near as I am to you; the prisoner, Osland, then passed between me and Coleman with a pistol in his hand, and directly after that I heard the report of a pistol, but do not know who fired it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen Osland before he came between you and Coleman? - A. I cannot say, to my knowledge, that I did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.When you apprehended Staggers, was any body along with him? - A. Yes, several.</p>
               <p>Q. But neither of the prisoners? - A. Yes, I believe Coleman was one.</p>
               <p>Q. After the deserter had escaped, you went into a public-house to get some drink, and clean your clothes, and it was neither of the prisoners that knocked you down? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came out, you had a bayonet in your hand? - A. No, I had not; corporal Pearce had.</p>
               <p>Q. A naked bayonet? - A. No, in a sheath; it was not unsheathed before I was wounded; I never knew he had one at all till after I got to the hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. A scuffle ensued? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Was no person struck by either you or any of your company? - A. Not that I know of, I struck nobody; I am sure there was nobody struck before the shot was fired.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your oath, were you not attacking a stranger who had been passing by, before these persons came up at all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not one of the prisoners cry out to you not to hurt the man? - A. No, I did not hear any thing of the sort; nor I did not see an attempt to strike a blow.</p>
               <p>Q. You were present? - A. Yes; I am sorry I was.</p>
               <p>Q. I am sorry for your accident; but if there had been a blow struck before that, you must have seen it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.How came Pearce by the bayonet? - A. I do not know, I took none; I had a pistol, and so had he.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Pearce never produce a pistol? - A.Serjeant Pearce, as I understand, fired one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did serjeant Pearce, or the prisoner at the bar, fire first? - A. The prisoner; serjeant Pearce did not fire his pistol till a considerable time after I was wounded.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you any warrant that day? - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you ever before a Magistrate to see Staggers attested? - A. I saw him examined by the doctor, and saw him go into the committee-room to be attested.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him take any bounty-money? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to arrest him for the sake of the reward, or merely in consequence of his being a soldier? - A. I entered, myself, as a volunteer; and I expect every man to do his duty, as I do and will, as long as I have breath.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Are you sure there was no scuffle at the public-house door before Coleman struck the hat out of your hand? - A. No, there was not.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Had you ever seen Coleman before? - A. Yes; I knew him three years ago.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Was there ever any quarrel subsisting between you? - A. Never; I never had a word with the man in my life.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH PEARCE sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. I went, in company with corporal Webb, after a deserter of the name of Cooper, we could not find him; going along, we met Staggers; Webb said, he was very much like a deferter from our regiment; we laid hold of him, he went to the public-house with us to have some gin; we were going to hand-cuff him, and he said he would go quietly with Webb; when he had got out, he sprung from Webb, and got away; going down Chick-lane, Webb was knocked down, and we went into a public-house to get some porter, and get him cleaned; I had a brace of pistols, Webb had a pistol which he knocked the prime out of, and delivered to me; my brother was with us, he had a bayonet, in a sheath, under his great coat; when we came out of the public-house, we had got about five or six yards distance, when the two prisoner's came down, and said, you have not got the man, and d-n your eyes you shall not have his hat; upon that, the prisoner Coleman, with a stick, knocked it out of his hand; Webb said, do not use us ill, if you do we will take you to Hatton-Garden; they immediately said, d-n you, we are armed as well as you; they had seen my pistol when I had Staggers in the public-house; I think Coleman was one of the persons that drank with us; Coleman drew out a pistol and fired, I cannot say at whom; the other prisoner fired a second pistol; I was at the distance of about as far as from here to that window when the first pistol was fired, which wounded Webb; when Osland fired his pistol, he was on the other side of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Who fired the third pistol? - A. I cannot be positive which it was; I then said, my lads, take care of yourselves, for it is now fire to fire; I might be six, seven, eight, or ten yards off; I saw my brother wounded, I saw the blood running<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179710250018"></xptr>down, I saw Webb fainting, and then there were two or three pistols fired at us, after I had gone to their assistance; and then they went away. I took Webb to Bartholomew's-hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. When were they apprehended? - A. I cannot say; the Police-officers apprehended them.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at the men; have you any doubt they are the men? - A. I have not the least doubt in the world.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever had an opportunity of taking Staggers since? - A. Yes, he is now in the Savoy prison, as a deserter. I saw the ball extracted from Webb's arm.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.You won't undertake to swear that Coleman was in your company at the public-house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you ever seen him before that day? - A. No, I had not seen either of the prisoners before that day.</p>
               <p>Q. All the opportunity you had of seeing the men, was during the time of the scuffle? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A great many people were present? - A. There was not a person in the street but the three people that fired, and us three.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no outcry? - A. None at all; I did not observe any other person in the street, till after we were wounded.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever attempt to offer any violence till Webb said he would take him to Hatton-garden? - A. No, only knocking the hat out of his hand.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he not endeavour to take him into custody? - A. Not that I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not endeavour to take him into custody before he fired? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact you did intend to take him to Hatton-garden, for striking the hat? - A. Webb talked of taking him there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Webb make this observation-don't use us ill, or we will take you to Hatton-garden, before the pistol was fired? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that that was his expression? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I think he said himself, that at the moment the hat was struck out of his hand, he said, we will take you to Hatton-garden? - A. He said, don't use us ill, or we will take you to Hatton-garden.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you mean to swear that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.There were several pistols fired after, you say; Webb did not say a word about that? - A. I say it, and swear it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say the bayonet was not unsheathed, for the purpose of taking these men into custody? - A. Not till after the pistols were fired.</p>

             sworn. - I am a corporal in the first regiment of Tower Hamlets; I was with my brother and Webb.</p>
               <p>Q.After Webb was knocked down, did you go to a public-house to clean him? - A. Yes; when he came out, he went across the right hand side of the road; the prisoner Colman said to Webb, d-n your eyes, you have not got the man, nor you shall not have his hat; he then with a stick knocked the hat out of Webb's hand; then Webb made answer, and said, do not molest us, if you use us ill we will have you to Hatton-garden: he took his pistol out directly, and shot Webb through the arm; after that the other prisoner went past on the left side of the road, and fired, but I cannot say at whom; after that I went to Webb's assistance, who was fainting with loss of blood; I heard three or four pistols more fired afterwards; but I cannot tell who fired them, I had a bayonet which I unsheathed after the second pistol was fired off.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure of that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that none of your party had meddled with Colman, before he fired the pistol? - A. I am certain of that.</p>
               <p>Q. After this, your attention was taken up by Webb? - A. Yes; my brother laid hold of one arm and I of the other, and took him to the hospital.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you ever seen either of the prisoners before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you never said that the man who fired the first pistol was a tall man in a blue coat, six feet high? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you know a person of the name of Brown, a publican? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you sure you never said the man that fired the first shot was a tall man in a blue coat, six feet high? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the scuffle last? - A.Three or four minutes.</p>
               <p>Q.What time in the evening? - A. Between five and six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that these are the persons? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe it was five or six weeks before they were apprehended? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you undertake to say they were the men before Webb told you so? - A. Yes, I remembered Colman immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that if these men had not been in custody, you would have known them if you had met them in the street? - A. Yes, I should; if I was to see you again I should know you.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no attempt to take this man into custody? - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. And you mean to say that without any provocation they fired these pistols? - A. Yes.</p>

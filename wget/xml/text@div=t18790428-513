               <p>the Great Eastern Rail way—on the 17th March there was a consignment of 496 bags of onions for Daniels, of Spitalfields—I produce the invoice duplicates—on the 25th there was another consignment of 504 bags, making 1,000—I checked 100 bags from the first consignment into the warehouse from truck 5800, and 109 from truck 6184—that was all I checked—on the 26th two Tans of Mr. Levy's at 5 o'clock—Short had been with vans I think twice before on that day—the carman produces an order from the con<lb></lb>signed, brings it to our clerk, and gets an order from him for the number of bags he wants and brings it to me, and I turn it over to the checkers with four porters to load them—the checker goes to the lot which the carman has applied for, tells the four men to bring, them to the loophole in the ware-house, to the tail of the van, which is backed up to the loophole—a checker stands there and counts them into the van and when they have brought a sufficient number he tells them to stop—they are packed in the van some<lb></lb>times three in front; they can pack them four all through the van—I have seen them pack three across and then four till they come to the tail of the Van, and then three across the tail as in front—they are packed according to the quantity they load—if they pack 40 there would be three rows of eight down the van by putting three across—unless watched a van loaded for three could be loaded for four without its being seen from the outside—I have often checked—I have had occasion to leave the loophole when I have noticed men bringing up the wrong marks—when the loophole is thus left they might bring up a bag not checked, but it would be a great risk—I saw Stevens on the 27th, and on going over the warehouse I missed 13 bags—I told him so—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are similar bags—no one else has the same mark—they are Mr. Daniels's.</p>

The 1,000 bags were aft marked with the green triangle, and all came to Goodman's Yard, about half of them on the 17th and the rest later on—I have not the order-hook, and cannot tell when we first began delivering—we may have been delivering them on the 18th and every day to different people—several different carmen were taking onions, &amp;c, on the 26th—nobody is allowed in Goodman's Yard but carmen and people coming for samples—if I found people there who had no business there I should ask them what they wanted—a man coming in with the carman has no right there except to bring me the order—the vans do not come into the yard, but to the loophole in the street—the loopholes are numbered 7, 8, and 9—No. 3 is in the yard—I think Short came three times on the 26th—one man checks the onions as they are taken out of the truck into the warehouse, and they may stand there for weeks—when a lot is wanted the cart is brought close to the loophole and the order is brought to me and I give directions to the men to bring the number required—there would be a checker and four men for a delivery of 50 sacks—the checker checks them in a book as they are brought across the warehouse into the van, and he signs for the load before the loading is completed to avoid going back to the office—in case of doubt the checker would count them again in the van after the loading—it might be possible for a carman to get a bag of onions out of the warehouse during the checker's absence, but it would he very unlikely—he would have to get into the loophole, and chuck the bag down, and would run a great risk—the carmen come into the warehouse with orders—other people's onions are loaded at the same time, but not at the same loophole—when an order comes in the onions</p>

I checked from different trucks 515 bags—I did not say 446 at the police-court—I went by my duplicates—my de<lb></lb>position was read over and I signed it—446 might have been the number—I did not see Berry, only Short and another man—Collins and Berry are alike—I would not swear Berry was not there—I left before the second van was loaded-ten men, two or three gangs, were helping altogether—we did not load two or three vans together—I knew I had to load 50 bags into Short's van—I did not check 50 bags across the warehouse—I did not keep count, as I knew Short by sight—the bags were brought from another floor 25 yards from the loophole—I did not see that 50 bags, the proper number, was brought, because when they began to load they were bringing up wrong marks, and they got mixed on the trucks, and it put me out of my calcula<lb></lb>tion—I went to the other warehouse on the same floor, 25 yards away, to examine the marks, and men were left at the loophole to deliver them on the vans, but not to count them—the van was not quite loaded when I returned, two more bags were put in—there was time for it to have been loaded and driven away—I counted 50 bags before I went upstairs—I jumped down and counted them, and before I left the van was loaded—the loopholes are shout 30 yards from each other—two or three gangs were working at this loophole; we had done working upstairs—I never heard that the carmen have to give the men beer—we have had beer from the masters, but not from the men—it is not usual—I have not heard that he charged the beer to, his master—I have been a checker three months, and on the railway about eleven months—I have not had much exepience—I did not see Berry—when we saw Collins by the police-court the observation was made so that he could hear—I gave my evidence about a fortnight ago, the 26th.</p>

I am a porter at Goodman's Yard—I do not check, but was employed to do so on the 26th March, and this is a paper I marked upon—I checked 30 bags as they were put into Levy's van in charge of Short, at 2.30—Short was alone—I had occasion to go from the loophole, and on my return I counted them and found 31 bags—no one was left in my absence—I spoke about it and Short said "There's the bag, take it off"—I did so.</p>

On 27th March, about 9 p.m., from information received, I went to 8, Falstaff Road, Tabard Street—I watched till nearly 1 a.m, and saw Yates go to bed—I went again about 5 a.m. with another officer (No. 154), and a girl let us through No. 9, and we got to the back of No. 8, where I left the other officer while I went to the front—I knocked, and Yates looked from the bedroom window, and came down and opened the door, and I saw inside the door three bags of onions marked with a green triangle—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of them—Yates then took them on a barrow to the station, and from what he told me I made inquiries, and found they had been stolen from the Great Eastern Railway—Pollyn apprehended Collins the same evening—Yates was brought up at the police-court on the 28th, and Collins on the 29th—Yates was bailed, and Collins was allowed to be out on his own recognisances—on 4th April they appeared together—on the 5th Yates's mother had been to the police-court and applied for her son to be bailed—the inspector sent to ask me if there was any objection—I said "No," and he was bailed out on the Monday—I saw Yates on the Wednesday after that, and again on the 12th, and he gave me similar information to that which he gave when arrested—I heard him give his evidence at the police-court on the 12th, and it is the same almost word for word—Collins is called "<hi rend="italic">Teddy Ruck</hi>"—I have known a man called "Boss" about 10 years; his name is Samuel Trentham—I have frequently seen him with all three of the prisoners—I have searched for him daily since the 26th March, but cannot find him.</p>

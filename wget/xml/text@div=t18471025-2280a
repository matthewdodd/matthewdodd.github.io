                  </hi> I am drayman to Messrs. Truman, Hanbury, and Co., and live in Pelham-street, Mile-end. On Saturday, the 11th of Sept., about half-past four o'clock, I helped Press to load one of my masters' drays—he did not tell me what I was to put on it—I put on four puncheons of porter, a barrel of single ale, a kilderkin of treble ale, and a kilderkin of stout—I did not know who it was for—Press had received the orders—it requires more than two per<lb></lb>sons to put the casks on—we also put on a barrel of treble old ale, and a barrel of double old ale in addition—the dray was then drawn out to make room for an<lb></lb>other to come, and Press went over to the office for his delivery-note—I stop<lb></lb>ped out, loading another dray—Press afterwards told me they wanted another kilderkin of double ale on the dray—he had the delivery-notes in his hand—it was rolled out of the brew-house, and laid in the road—Press helped me to put it on the same dray—we then went into Quaker-street and Brick-lane—we went to Howe's, in Union-street, Kingsland-road, and there delivered four puncheons of porter, a barrel of single ale, a kilderkin of double ale, and a kilderkin of stout—I accompanied Press to get the note signed—Mrs. Howe signed it in my presence, Press then said he had got to go to Cockett's, in Great Cambridge-street, Hackney-road, with two barrels, and when he had delivered them I might go home, or stop there which I liked, as he could do without me—he said he had got a kilderkin of ale to deliver somewhere, but did not say where—there was a kinderkin of treble ale on the dray—that was all that was left, except the two barrels for Cockett—we delivered those at Cockett's—I did not see the delivery-ticket for Cockett—I saw the notes signed at Cockett's—there was then only the kilderkin of treble ale on the dray—we turned down into the Hackney-road, and went down Elizabeth-street, to Pratt's house—we there took the kilderkin off the dray, and Press rolled it in—I went after him, close to him—I knew Pratt, and saw him in the bar—Press said, "I have brought you a kilderkin of treble ale"—Pratt said, "That is right"—Press gave him the note—it was doubled up—Pratt went into the parlour</p>

               <p>with it—Press said, "Put 'Shepherd' on the back of the note"—it was put on—I did not say anything—Pratt brought the ticket back from the parlour, doubled up in the same from—I did not see "Shepherd" on the back—Pratt gave it to Press—Press said, "Where will you have the kilderkin?"—it then laid before the bar—Pratt said, "Take it and put it in the passage"—Press told me to pitch it into the passage, and I did so—we came back again, and stood by the bar—Press said, "Go out and see to the horses"—I went out—Press followed me soon after—I had left him in the bar—we got back to the brewhouse after ten o'clock—I told my masters of it on the Monday night.</p>

Truman, in my ordinary employment—I cannot recollect the streets I went up on the Monday, I can those I went up on the Saturday—I knew them when before the Magistrate—I did not know the names of all of them—I have been over them since—I have learned them since—I knew them then, except one—I went the road a day or two after, and saw it—I do not know what I went for—I went alone—I went round the same road that we went with the dray, to see the name of the street—I think Mr. Marr told me to go—Press told Pratt to put "Shepherd" on the back of the note, because that was the regular course of proceeding—of I had been assistant drayman, and had been deli<lb></lb>vering beer, it would have been proper for me to have my name on the back of the note—I had not delivered at Pratt's before—I knew that he was a customer of my employers—I saw the kilderkin loaded into the cart—I al<lb></lb>ways remembered that—I do not remember putting it on—there were five or six of us helped to load the dray—I know it was on the dray, but nothing more—I saw it put on, but cannot recollect who rolled it, or who put it on—the quantities that were loaded on the dray were not called out by any one—Lucy, the foreman, gave Press the notes—he had not given him them when Press told me what to put on—I did not hear Press call out, "A kil<lb></lb>derkin of XXX ale"—the loading takes place seventy or eighty yards form the office—the kilderkins are rolled from the office—there are a great many persons employed, and a great many drays loading in the place sometimes, but sometimes there is not—the men help one another to load—there are not four or five employed on each dray—Conquest and Bright would superintend the other drays—I did not hear what took place at Cockett's—Press and he were down in the cellar together—he did not say anything to me about the kilderkin till after we left Howe's.</p>

Truman's yard—I have been in the employ ten months—the foreman, Thomas Lucy, authorizes the quantity to be removed, and put on the dray—he did not give me direction—he told Press what to take, I suppose—I did not hear him, but it was him that in general did—Lucy gave orders for those drays that he wanted loaded with town beer—there are generally a lot of hands at home—there were three draymen there, and a lot besides—I was one—I</p>

               <p>helped to roll some of the ale over—I did not know I was with Press till after the dray was loaded—before we went to Howe's the dray stopped in Brick-lane, at the corner of Eyre-street—Press went away for about ten minutes there, and left me with the dray—when he returned we went on together.</p>

                  </hi> I one of three storehouse-clerks to Robert Hanbury and other. Pres was in their service as drayman more than eight years, and Shepherd a few months—Pratt has been a customer several years—the porter and ale stores are separate—the drays are mostly loaded where the porter is kept, and the ale is brought there—it is necessary to roll it there from the store, about forty yards—we had at this time two customers, named Howes and Cockett—the two tickets produced would be issued for their beer—they are my writing, taken from our order-book—when orders are to be executed I fill up the tickets and give them to the loading-out foreman, to get loaded ac<lb></lb>coding to the written notices—these tickets had been filled up that afternoon—we take them to the loading-out foreman, who would direct the quantity of ale necessary to be rolled out of the storehouse to the place where it is to be loaded—they should give directions for a quantity to be put out, conformable to the ticket—a good many drays are loaded one after another—we load from 1000 to upwards of 2000 barrels of beer in the day—I remember filling up these tickets—there was a duplicate to them which the customer signs, and returns by the carman—they are delivered to the carman in one piece—them pieces are what would be signed by the customer and returned to us; the other part is left with the customer—by this order three barrels of ale, and one kil<lb></lb>derkin of XX ale should have been sent out, no XXX ale at all—I remem<lb></lb>ber these order being given to Press that day—he brought them to me in the usual way to get marked off, and said "Here are my notes"—that was after he had loaded—I read the orders to him, and marked them off at the same time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In consequence of a communication made by Shepherd, on Monday, did you arrange to go over to Pratt's on the Tuesday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I went on the Tuesday, in consequence of communication made to Mr. Murray—before I went there I was present at a conversation that took place with Press on Tuesday morning—Press was called into the room; one of the Messrs. Hanbury's was present, I said, "This is an awkward matter; what road did you take?"—he said, "By Shoreditch and Kingsland-road"—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a plan</hi>)—I believe this to be a correct plan—he said he came by Great Cam<lb></lb>bridge-street—this is Hawes's house, and this is Cockett's—the direct way for him to return would be by Great Cambridge-street, Hackney-road—he at first hesitated a little, and I said, "Which way?"—he said he turned to the left in the Hackney-road—I said, "What way did you take then?"—he said Elizabeth-street—I said that was right away from home, half a mile—he said, no it was only a little way, not a mile altogether—I said, "What could induce you to go out of your way, that way?"—he said it was a more convenient road for riding—I said, "That story will not do for me; there were two of you, one to ride and one to drive"—he said it was but a little way, and more convenient—Elizabeth-street would lead to Pratt's house—he denied having been to Pratt's with anybody—he was told my some one that he had taken a kilderkin of ale to Pratt's—I heard him distinctly say he had not been there—Mr. Darnell, Mr. Hanbury, and Mr. Westcott were present—about twelve o'clock on Tuesday I went to Pratt's house, I found him at home, and said there was something awkward with out men, which I was anxious to get at—he said, "What?"—I said, "They have left a cask of ale here"—he said, "There is a cask here; but where it came from, or how it came, I know not"—I said, "It came on Saturday night"—he repeated that he nei<lb></lb>ther knew how or when it came—I found it in the passage—Mr. Cook, who was with me, said, "Perhaps Mrs. Pratt may remember if you don't"—Mrs. Pratt was called, and asked if she knew how the cask came there—she said, "No," she knew nothing; she left all to her husband—that was in his hearing—I said, "But Mr. Pratt, one of our men gave you a note"—he said, "A note?"—I said, "Yes; a note, which you took into the bar, returned and gave it to him again"—he said, "Oh, but there were two of them;" but he did not know whether it was Saturday, or what day—I have not examined the cask, to see whether it has been tapped—he had plenty of cellar-room to have re<lb></lb>ceived the cask—it was not with his other casks—I said to him, it was somewhere about half-past eight o'clock on Saturday that they left it—he said he did not know—I said, "Should you know them if you saw them"—he said, "Perhaps I might"—Shepherd was then called in, and Pratt was asked if that was one of them—he said, "Yes; to be sure it is"—he said he told him (meaning Shepherd) to put it there, pointing to the passage where the cask was; but that it being in the way of the barrow, he had turned it</p>

               <p>lying there—it is rather a wide passage—it leads from the front door—the stairs are wider than the length of a kilderkin—I believe this kilderkin had not been tapped or touched—the chalk marks remained on the cask—Pratt might have let it through the trap-door into the cellar if he had been disposed to conceal it—I did not, on the 3rd of Sept., sent stout instead of ale to Pratt—when I questioned him on this subject, and called the circumstance to his recollection, he said, "On yes, to be sure, there were two of them," mean<lb></lb>ing two men—he did not tell me he was drunk at the time—he did not say, "I have no recollection, because I was drunk at the time"—as we were leav<lb></lb>ing, he said that he had been drinking on the Saturday.</p>

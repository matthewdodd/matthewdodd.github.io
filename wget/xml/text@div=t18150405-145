            . I am an officer. I went to the Lord Wellington public house, at nine o'clock, and took Sarroo into custody. Dooser charged him with robbing him of four one-pound notes, four three-shilling bank tokens, his cap, and handkerchief. This is the cap, it has been claimed by Dooser, but not that evening; I searched Surroo; I found on him five three shilling bank tokens, and two-pence halfpenny, no notes; this is the handkerchief I found on him.</p>
               <p>Q. To Dooser. Is that your cap - A. It is mine, and this is my handkerchief.</p>

As I was going along Cheapside, that gentleman laid hold of me, and said that I picked his pocked of an handkerchief, which I replied to him immediately and told him I had no such thing about me but three handkerchiefs; he insisted on searching me and took me into a pastry cook's shop, and he found these three handkerchiefs, and he told me that neither a one of these handkerchiefs were his; which at the same time the pastry cook was afraid of his things being broke from outside of the door; some of the people brought an handkerchief in which that gentleman owned to be his handkerchief; I never had his in my possession.</p>

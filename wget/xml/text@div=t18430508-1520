I was on duty in Fleet-street—in consequence of a signal from Blunded, I walked towards Temple-bar—when we got near there, he gave another signal—I then went across to him, and he had got hold of Levi by the collar—I ran, and got hold of him by my left hand—he put his right hand into his trowsers pocket, took out this purse, and threw it on the grating of the sewer, and then attempted to kick it down with his foot—I pushed him a little on one side, snatched it up, and have had it ever since.</p>

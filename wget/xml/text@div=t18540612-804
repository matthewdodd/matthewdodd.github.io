On Thursday afternoon, 25th May, I went to No. 17, Brother's-row, Lambeth, and found the prisoner's wife in an upstairs room, lying on a bed, bleeding from wounds on the head, the left wrist, and the back of the right hand—both her clothes and the bed clothes were soaked with blood—the prisoner was in the room, and in his presence I asked her who did it; she said her husband—I asked her what he did it with; she said he had struck her—I asked her if she would give him into custody; she said, "Yes "—he said that when he came home he found a man in the room, and he took up a screwdriver and struck her—I took him to the station, and afterwards went back and found this screw-driver <hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) lying on a bench in the front kitchen—here are marks of blood on the handle.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife; we lived at No. 17, Brother's-row, Lambeth. On 25th May I went out alone, between 10 and 11 o'clock in the morning—I came home between 1 and 2 o'clock—I went out again about 2 o'clock, and found my husband at the Windmill public house with two gentlemen, one of whom was Mr. Beldon—I had something to drink, and remained till about 3 o'clock, when I went home and went to bed—I was very tipsy (I left my husband at the public house)—I did not undress; I laid down on the bed, and while I was lying there Mr. Beldon opened my bedroom door, and said something, but I cannot say what he did say—I ordered him out, and he left the room; he had not been a second in the room; he kept the door in his hand—as soon as he went out, I looked the door, and before he was off the stairs my husband came in, and forced the door open with a screwdriver—he entered the room, and I flew to him—I believe he spoke first, and I answered him—I cannot remember the words he said—I sustained my injury from clinging to him; he never hurt me in the least—I cannot say how I sustained it—he had something in his hand—I have no recollection of what he did with his hand, only of my clinging to him on the stairs—I think I cut my head against the door, but am not certain—I have a wound on my head, but it is all healed—(<hi rend="italic">The wit<lb></lb>ness was cautioned by the Court that unless she spoke the truth she would be committed</hi>)—I cannot speak the truth no farther than I stated before, that, I have no recollection at all of how it came, nor yet what my husband had in his hand—I felt a wound on my head—my husband was then on the stairs—I had hold of him at the time I felt the wound—I cannot say that he had anything in his hand, nor can I say that he had not—I did not see a screwdriver in his hand when he broke open the door, and came into the room—he broke the door open with something—he told me that he broke it open with something; I do not know what it was—I saw nothing in his</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Was it in consequence of being very tipsy that you went up stairs, and laid on the bed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was—the reason of my not distinctly recollecting what passed is that I was so much in liquor—I and my husband have been together fourteen years on the 17th of next March, and during that long time he has treated me with the greatest kindness—he was in liquor—at the time my husband came, Beldon was on the stairs—I do not think he was just coming out of the room—there is only one pair of stairs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fisherman, and live at No. 51, Lower Fore-street, Lambeth. On 25th May, I was at the Windmill public house, drinking with the prisoner; his wife came in soon after him, and we had several quarterns of rum, and a glass or two of ale—the prisoner was very bad in liquor, and his wife was very bad, and I was very bad; we were all very bad—I do not remember his wife going away; I do not know which of them went away first; the prisoner was smoking a peculiar sort of pipe; I asked him where he got it from, and he told me he had got several at home, and he would give me one if I required it—I thanked him, and he went out; I thought he had gone home after one—he was gone rather longer than I thought it would take him, and I went after him—I had known him before, and had visited at his house before at his desire—I went to the house and saw Wilkes, I then went up stairs into the bedroom on the first floor—the door was shut; I opened it, and saw Mrs. Copeland there—I asked for her husband; she said he was not at home—I do not think I was a minute in the room—on my leaving I could not swear whether the door was shut after me, for I had my back to it—I reeled against the other stairs, the second flight, and at the same time the pri<lb></lb>soner rushed up—he said nothing to me—I went down stairs directly and went out, and went back to two of my Mends that I had left at the public house.</p>

I was sent for to the station house, in Ken-nington-lane, on 25th May—I got there about half past 4 o'clock—I found Mrs. Copeland there—she had an injury to the scalp, and one on the back of the right hand—the wound on the scalp was an incised wound; it reached the bone; it was about an inch in length; it was not bleeding then—the wound on the right hand was an incised wound, and there was also an incised wound above the left wrist; a screwdriver might inflict such wounds—they were not dangerous—she appeared sober—she had lost a considerable quantity of blood—I do not think that would have sobered her.</p>

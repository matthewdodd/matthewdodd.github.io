               <p>One Captain Mansell brought me this ring on that evening: I was complaining that I wanted money; Captain Mansell said he had no way of supplying me but letting me have that, upon which I might raise money; I took it and pawned it in the manner the pawnbroker has said: Captain Mansell belongs to the fifteenth regiment; he is I believe now out of the kingdom; I had a witness to prove this, but the witness is ill of the small pox.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. James, Westminster. On the 19th March, about eleven o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner in Piccadilly, with an apron on his left shoulder - I stopped him, and asked what he had there; he said his own property - I took him to the watch-house, and found it contained 36 lbs. of lead; he said he found it in Kensington-road; he was coming in a direction from Knightsbridge. I went to Elford, and we compared the lead with the gutter, it fitted exactly with part of it - the prisoner said he lodged at the house over the shop. I examined his room, and found 65 lbs. more rolled up in his bed, in a sheep's-skin - this also fitted the gutter; a great deal more was taken away. When he saw Mr. Elford,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182204170011"></xptr>he said he did take it, but hoped he would not hurt him.</p>

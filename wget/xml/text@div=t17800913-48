I was taking a walk in Stepney-fields on the 30th of July, at about four o'clock in the afternoon; I was a little in liquor, I met the prisoner; she asked me what countryman I was; I said north; she said she was the same; I said you may as well go with me for company; we went together, and had two or three pints of beer; then she took me to an house in <placeName id="t17800913-48-crimeloc289">Elbow-lane</placeName>

               <p>Had you your money when you went in there? - Yes, for I paid for a pot of beer, and a shilling for a bed after I got into the house; the money was in my pocket when I put my clothes off; I lay there till between eleven and twelve at night; she was gone away; the people waked me, and said I had lost my money, and called in the street five or six times, Sailor, you have lost your money! I looked at my pockets, and missed my money; I told them I had lost my money; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130049"></xptr> was locked in; the people of the house opened the door, and let me out; I found the prisoner in custody in a neighbour's house; they asked me if I should know the woman? I said I believed I should; they shewed me the prisoner, and asked me if that was her? I said yes; so they took us both to the watch-house; I did not get any of my money again.</p>
               <p>You say you was in liquor that afternoon, was you so much in liquor as to make it doubtful whether that might be the same person or not? - I am certain she is the same person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He declared before the justice of peace and this man, that he knew nothing of the purse; he does not know the nature of an oath; he does not know good from evil; he came to me in the prison to make it up with me; I would not make it up with him, as we were all before the presence of the Lord, as he is omnipresent in every place, as I was not guilty of the crime. I have not had time to send to my landlady in Virginia-street; if he was to advertise me for a whole year in the news-paper, nobody could prove any thing against me.</p>

I asked her how she came there? She said she had got into a bawdy-house and was obliged to make her escape; she must have come over two pallisades. I took her to the watch-house; I found a purse in my back yard the next morning.</p>

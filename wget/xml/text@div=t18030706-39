               <p>Q.Had you any number of sheep, on Sunday the 24th of April? - A. Yes, at Mile end; some at one place, and some at another.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the sheep before they went to market? - A. I saw them on Sunday forenoon.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the sheep on Monday morning in the market? - A. I saw all the drove, except five, on the Monday morning.</p>

               <p>Q. Were they all of one lot, or of different lots? - A.They belonged to three different employers.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of any information you received, did you go to the house of Wells, in Turnmill-street, on the Monday morning? - A. I did, about noon.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you there find the carcases of any sheep? - A. I found five sheep hanging by the heels, and the sat and feet of two in a pail.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find the heads? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.Where did they lay? - A. On the ground, by the pail; they were all locked up in a dark place, separated from the shop.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there a butcher's shop at this place? - A. Yes, one side was open, the other was shut, and on the side that was shut, the sheep were.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it parted off, so that they were concealed from view? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it light or dark? - A.Dark, so that you could not discover what there was without a candle.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you enabled to form any belief, whether they were the carcases of the five sheep you lost? - A. Yes, they certainly were the carcases of the five sheep I had lost.</p>

               <p>Q. Where they five sheep of three different lots? - A. Yes, one and one and three.</p>

               <p>Q. Did that correspond with what you lost? - A. Yes, they did, and the teeth corresponded with the teeth of those I had, and in age, size and weight; I have no doubt they were my sheep, I am as certain as any man can be, without seeing the skins on their backs, they were the sheep I lost.</p>

               <p>JOHN SMITH sworn. - Q.Are you master drover to Mr. Field? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. On the night of Sunday, the 24th of April, had you a number of sheep to bring to Smithfield market? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.How many? - A. I cannot rightly say now.</p>

               <p>Q. Were there several hundreds? - A. Yes, near upon six hundred.</p>

               <p>Q. What time did you come from Mile-end to Smithfield? - A.About nine o'clock, and got to Smithfield a little after ten at night; the general lot we take at once, is about two hundred, I took two hundred and thirty-seven with John Durant.</p>

               <p>Q. In whose care did you leave the remainder? - A. I sent the prisoner back to Mile-end for them.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180307060026"></xptr>Q.With any body else? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Court. Q.Was he to have no assistance? - A. He had been a drover before; they were divided into three droves; the first he brought safe, the second he brought between twelve and one, and I found five wanting.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ask him how it happened? - A. I said there were five wanting, and told him to go round the market, he went one way, and I another to look for them.</p>



               <p>Q.What did he say at the time you missed them? - A. He said, he did not know any thing of them.</p>

               <p>Q. What time was it you sent him to Mile-end? - A. It might be about seven o'clock in the morning.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he come back again to you from Mileend? - A. Yes, it might be about nine or ten o'clock; when he came back, he said, he could not find them, that he had been all round the place, but could not find them.</p>

               <p>Q. Did any thing more pass between you and him? - A. No more than I told him to mind the penns, and I would look after them myself.</p>

               <p>Q.How soon did you see him again? - A. About two hours and a half; when I had got some information, I went back and saw the prisoner standing by the penns, I and my master went to the butcher's-shop.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon did you apprehend Wells? - A. It might be about three quarters of an hour after, between twelve and one.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see Webster after you had taken Wells up? - A. No, I went back to the penns, and he was gone.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he left your service, or was he about it? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. When was he to have left it? - A.When the sheep were all gone.</p>

               <p>Q. You don't mean that you intended to dismiss him? - A.No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see him after you had taken up Wells? - A.No.</p>

               <p>Q. You went to Wells and saw the carcases? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you believe them to be the carcases you had lost? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about it? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know Turnmill-street? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that the way from Mile-end to Smithfield? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q.Where is it? - A. Just down Cow-cross.</p>

               <p>Q. If they came direct from Mile-end, they should come down Long-lane? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Do you know whether the other drove you sent him for, and which he brought came down Long-lane? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe the last drove come in by Turnmill-street? - A. Yes; I said, Chubby, this is not the way from Mile-end; he said, the sheep had broke out at the top of Long-lane, and had run that way.</p>

               <p>Q.Had he a dog to assist in driving? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. What age is he? - A. I don't know, he may be fourteen or fifteen.</p>

               <p>Q. How long would it require for such a lad to go and fetch them? - A.About a couple of hours, if the sheep are not very lame.</p>

               <p>JOHN BOYLE sworn. - Q. What are you? - A. A patrol.</p>

               <p>Q. On Sunday night the 24th of April, did you see any sheep in Turnmill-street? - A. Yes, a considerable quantity.</p>

               <p>Q. In whose care were they? - A. The prisoner's.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any other person? - A. I did not.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Are you sure it was the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q.Did you know him before? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.Whose house were they opposite? - A. The sheep were between Mr. Booth's, the distiller's, and the street, called Benjamin-street, opposite the house of Harvey, otherwise Wells, a butcher.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did they stop there? - A. Near half an hour.</p>

               <p>Q. Did that circumstance induce you to make any particular observation? - A. After I had information by the watchman, and seeing a light in a certain house, I went and put my foot on a window shutter of Wells's house, and looked in, and saw him begin killing the sheep.</p>

               <p>Q. How many did you see him kill? - A. I could not say, because he wavered about with the light in his hat, which is deceiving.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him kill more than one or two? - A. Yes, and saw him put them in a concealed place, on the right-hand side of the shop, because I knew where to find them when I obtained the warrant.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Butler watch as well as you? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see Wells go out in the morning? - A. Yes, about five o'clock.</p>

               <p>Court. Q.Did you see the prisoner converse with Wells? - A. I saw him with no person.</p>

               <p>Q.What was he doing? - A.Standing to and fro with the drove very near the house.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he stand close to the house? - A. Not far from it, within a door or two; he might have been to the house and walked away, as I approached it.</p>

               <p>Q. How were the sheep? - A.Both on the pavement, and on the road, in every direction round the house.</p>

               <p>Q. The prisoner was not attempting to drive them on? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not see Wells take any sheep into his house? - A. No, the house was in darkness, and the camps were out.</p>

               <p>Q.You did not see Wells drive any sheep in? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see who had the care of them? - A. Yes, the prisoner at the bar.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know him before? - A. I had often seen him go by with sheep.</p>

               <p>Court. Q.Had you seen him drive any sheep that way the same evening before? - A. No, only that time; there were no sheep on that spot at twelve o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. You say, you saw him go by driving sheep, often before? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you seen the sheep standing before Wells's door? - A. No, mostly going on; I never took particular notice.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. There were no sheep in Wells's shop, at twelve o'clock? - A. No, it is close to my box; because I heard nothing at all; the moment I came round, and the slock was gone, I heard them bleating.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did they stand there? - A.About half an hour.</p>

               <p>Q. You told Boyle this? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM CHALLICE sworn. - I am a Police-Officer, and apprehended the prisoner on the 2d of June, in Smithfield, at the Golden-Lion, between twelve and one at night; the landlord was pushing him out of the house.</p>

               <p>Court. Q.(To Smith.) When you missed the sheep, you say, you talked to the boy about it, that he had brought them the wrong way? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any thing said about being done out of the sheep? - A. No, I said that to the drover.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I know nothing of the sheep, I brought them along from Mile-end road, down Barbican, when a dog ran in among them, and they ran away from me down Goswell-street; I followed them, and when they stopped, I turned them down the first street I came to into St. John's-street, and then went into Smithfield.</p>

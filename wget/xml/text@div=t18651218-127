                  </hi>. I live at 7, Everard-street, St. George's, Whitechapel, and am an unfortunate girl—on Saturday night, 2d December, I met the prisoner in a public house, the Mahogany Bar—I had some words with her—I was afterwards going home, and saw her on before me, with her bonnet and shawl off—I do not know whether she left before me—we had the words between 10 and 11, and I saw her again about 12——she said, "Now, English Annie, are you ready for me?"—I went into my house, and took my clothes off, and came out again—the prisoner lives at No. 11, and I live at No. 7—it was just as I was going into my house that she said, "Now, English Annie, are you ready for me?"—I said, "Now, Martha Smith, what do you want with me?"—she said, "Take that,"and she cut me with a table-knife on the forehead—I put this plaister on, myself—some one went and fetched a constable, and I was taken to the station, and then to the hospital—the prisoner ran away into her house, and looked out at her bed-room window—I was bleeding—I do not know where she got the knife.</p>

Q.</hi> What time did the assault take place. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe it was past 12; the public-houses were being closed—the prisoner was home before me—going from the Mahogany Bar to her own house, she would have to pass my door—I did not go to her house—I was going in at my own door when this happened—I had not gone beyond it—she is an unfortunate girl like myself—I did not go knocking at her door—I had had a glass, but I was sober; I knew what I was about—I cannot say whether she went home with a sailor—I did not see her leave the Mahogany Bar—she was quite close to me when she said, "Are you ready for me now, English Annie"——it was in the middle of the street: I should say there are about three dozen houses on each side in Everard-street—she was not at the top of the street when</p>

               <p>she spoke to me—she came out at her own door, and she was coming towards me when she said it—I do not know a man named Philip Baker, a bootmaker, at 12, Everard-street, Commercial-road—I was not screaming, or making use of bad language before the prisoner touched me—I did not go and knock at her door, and she did not come to the window before she stabbed me—I know a Mrs. Dawson, of 14, Everard-street, I believe she works for the prisoner—I cannot say what became of the table-knife—she shut the door, and went up stairs into her bed-room after she had done it—it was a dinner knife—when she said, "Take that;"I saw the knife—I was once charged with committing an assault on a woman.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 14, Everard-street—I know the prisoner and the prosecutrix—they both live in the same street as I do—the prisoner is quiet and inoffensive—and the prosecutrix, when she gets drunk, is very noisy and will insult anybody—on this Saturday night, about 5 minutes past 12, I was standing by my door and saw the prisoner go in-doors and shut her door—a few minutes afterwards I and my husband went up stairs to bed, and I heard some one screaming and screeching at the top of the street—I looked out at my bed-room window and saw the prosecutrix coming down the street—she seemed as if she was very intoxicated—she came to the prisoner's door and kicked at it and said, "Come out, Martha Smith, if you want anything of me", and called her beastly names—the prisoner then opened her window, looked out, and said, "Annie, go away, I don't want anything of you,"—she then threw herself down on the pave<lb></lb>ment and then the policeman came up, but the prisoner never came down stairs till the policeman fetched her out—the prosecutrix was always on to the prisoner, always kicking up a disturbance; every night she kicks up a disturbance when she is in drink.</p>

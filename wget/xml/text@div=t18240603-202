            . I am an officer of the Thames Police. On the 26th of April I had occasion to go to see a quantity of lead on the premises of Messrs. Walker and Maltby, in the Commercial-road, Westminster - there was about 800 lbs. weight. On the 27th I obtained a search-warrant, and took it away. I went to the prisoner - he lives in Strutton-ground, Westminster, at the bottom of Orchard-street. I asked him if he had sold any lead to Messrs. Walker and Co. - he said he had - he could not be particular as to the weight, but it was about 8 cwt. I asked where he got it; he said from his houses in Shoe-lane, which were repairing. I ordered him to attend the Magistrate, which he did on the 27th, and again on the 4th of May. I afterwards met him at Shoe-lane on the 30th of April - I had examined the house in Shoe-lane on the 27th of April; it was a tiled roof, and part of this lead came from a slated roof; I did not compare it with that roof, being satisfied that it could not come from there. I told him so, and he then said he had more houses in Strutton-ground, Westminster, and wished one of us to attend there with him, which my brother officer did. I went to Mr. Copeland's house, in Regent-street, on the 29th, and examined that roof with Green, and one Mason, who had the key of it. I took about 1 cwt. of the lead with me - I took part of it up, and compared it with the parts of lead, which remained on the roof, and it fitted as near as old lead could fit; it had been knocked about a good deal, and would not fit entirely without beating out, but it fitted the nail holes and the marks on the tiles as near as could be; it fitted in three places particularly - the thickness exactly corresponded; it had been torn off from the roof; most of the roof had been stripped, and the hips also. Some portion of it had been left on the roof; my belief is that it had come from there; I should suppose about 2 cwt. had been stolen from that house. I found some lead in the watch-house at Westminster, and got the watchman to bring it to Mr. Copeland's house, but that was different. The prisoner attended at the office on the 4th of May, voluntarily, and a person of the name of Coney with him, who he said was his plumber.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You have looked at a book, have you put down there what Mr. Gamble said - A. No; I have put down dates, but not the conversation - I have put down that Gamble said he had sold the lead, and that it came from his house in Shoe-lane - I wrote this as near the time as possible. I did not warn him to be cautious what he said. I could trust to my memory, because there was so little passed except his appointing to go to Strutton-ground. I have a complete recollection of what passed; he said he had had it at Strutton-ground for some time.</p>

            . I accompanied Mitchell to the prisoner's house at Strutton-ground. Mitchell asked him if he had sold any lead over the water to Walker and Co? he said he had - Mitchell then said he had seized it - that he was an officer, and suspected it was stolen - he asked, where he had got it from; - he replied, from his houses in Shoe-lane; that he had been repairing them, and this was the old lead from them - he told him he was ordered to attend the Magistrate's on the day following, which he did - he said he had had it in his cellar for some time - his house is about a quarter of a mile from the house which had been robbed - he attended the Magistrate's the next day, and we went to Shoe-lane and examined the roof; but the lead had not the least appearance of being taken from there - there was no appearance of any new lead; it appeared to have been there for two years - we examined the house in Regent-street - the lead had every appearance of having been taken from there - there might be about one hundred weight of the lead which we had with us taken from that house - it fixed itself on the roof in two or three places-particularly - it fitted as to the nail holes in the sides - we compared it very attentively, and the result is upon a fair examination - that I believe it was the identical lead stolen from that house - Gamble was not with us. I told him I considered that I knew where the lead came from, and that it was impossible it could come from his premises in Shoe-lane - he attended again on the 4th of May, and was then committed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. He attended after you told him you considered you knew where the lead had come from - was Mitchel with you when you went on this business - A. Yes; most times - he was there when this conversation passed - we did not take any lead to the house in Shoe-lane - the lead there seemed to have been on two years more or less - I don't swear positively; but I think so - it had an old appearance - it is only a mere vague guess. Gamble said it had come from his houses in Shoe-lane - he did not say that he took it from there; but it had come from there - he said afterwards that he had other houses in Strutton-ground - I saw Coney at Shoe-lane - he lives next door to Gamble.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How much of the lead you had with you fitted the roof of the house in Regent-street - A. About 1 cwt.; the whole quantity gone seemed to be 2 cwt.; it appeared to have come from a slated roof - and from the colour it appeared to have been there about the same time.</p>

            . I am a carpenter, and live in the yard of Messrs. Bennet and Co. Horse-ferry-road, Westminster - the key of the prosecutor's house was in our office - it was then unoccupied, and had been so for some time - the witnesses came to our office for the key. I accompanied them to search the house - we found the ridge, the hips, and the dormer door had been stripped of their lead - the officers produced some and compared it with the ridge of three pieces; one on the ridge of one on each hip fitted the nail holes - where it went down on the slates it corresponded<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182406030070"></xptr>with the pieces left as near as old lead possibly could do; it fitted exactly; it was of the same thickness - flatted lead is sold at so many pounds to the square.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Do you mean that it fitted exactly - A. I mean it fitted as near as old lead could, because it had been rolled up; we flatted it out a little at the end.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a single piece that you will swear came from that dwelling - A. Yes; it fitted the nail holes exactly, and the places too. I compared one small piece on the bottom of the hip which was left on, and it fitted to this piece exactly - it was about eighteen inches long.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Walker and Co., they are lead-merchants, and live in Southwark. We received some lead from the prisoner, which was taken afterwards by the officers; there was 8 cwt., 13 lb., it came in butter baskets, on the 26th of April, in a cart.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. What is the value of old lead - A. Twenty shilling per cwt.; it was paid for in the counting-house, in Thames-street; I gave a receipt for the quantity, but do not know what money was paid for it; it was brought about eleven o'clock in the morning; in open day. I do not know who drove the cart, but Mr. Gamble accompanied it - there was nothing suspicious about it; I should have had no objection to take it - we do not often buy lead of butter merchants, but I understood he was in the building way, and did not ask where it came from.</p>

Mr. Coney came to ask the young man one Sunday evening to take some lead for him on the next morning; my master was not at home; he came again next morning, and asked my master to take it; my master refused, and said he did not like taking it, but at last he did, and the cart came about nine or ten o'clock. My master came back soon after the cart went away; I did not see him give Coney any money or paper. There were some butter baskets in the cart; Coney has some, because his son deals in eggs. I believe the same sort of baskets are used for both. I never saw any lead in my master's cellar in my life. There is no communication from Mr. Coney's cellar to ours that I know of.</p>

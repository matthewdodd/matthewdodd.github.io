               <p>Q. Did he express what he meant at all? - A. No; I told Mr. Fraser of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Vaillant. Q. How came you by the hat that was taken from you by Perry? - A. Bentham gave it me down the stairs; it was about five days after the conversation: I was in the steerage, and he came out of the cabin, and asked me for my old hat, I gave him a hat with an oil-skin on it, and in about fourteen or fifteen minutes, he returned me the hat that was taken from me by Mr. Perry, with the oil-skin upon it; and said, here is the hat I promised you; he had promised me a hat: while I was hoisting some trunks forward, my old hat fell off, and he said never mind your hat, I will give you a better one than that: that was the same day that we had had the conversation.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Have you been in custody since the hat was taken from you? - A. No; I was taken in custody with the hat on my head.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been at large since? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were taken, upon the information of the man at the bar, for stealing the hat yourself? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You turned evidence before the Magistrate? - A. No, I did not; I did not know where the property came from.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a new hat, was it not? - A. No, it was greased in the fore part and in the hind part.</p>
               <p>Q. How many hats do custom-house officers bring on board in general; not two, I suppose? - A. Sometimes one, and sometimes two.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you now a custom-house officer? - A. No, I am suspended till this trial is over.</p>
               <p>Q. And if you swear yourself innocent, and convict the man at the bar, you will be restored? - A. Yes; I am as innocent as the child that is unborn.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Smith.) These hats have the general manufacturing mark of Mr. Borrodaile? - A. Yes, two L's; they are plated hats.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these the kind of hats that are sent to the West India market? - A. Yes; we send all sorts.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. All the hats that you make have the same mark? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What are they worth? - A. About nineteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Shropshire was the man who gave the hat to me; he was also employed as a lumper on board the ship. I was absent from the ship several days, and during that time there was no officer on board; the captain was always on shore: and what might be done in my absence I cannot say. Shropshire gave me this hat in <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300006"></xptr>consequence of my signing his weekly note for payment of his wages.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

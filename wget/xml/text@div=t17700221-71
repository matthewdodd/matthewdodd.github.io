The prisoner was there before I was. He came for a guide to show me the way to Lad-lane in a coach. There were two men with us; one was the boatswain of a brig that I came home in; the other a labouring man. I had bid farewel at my lodging, and was going to Liverpool. We went to <placeName id="t17700221-71-crimeloc399">the Swan and-two-necks in Lad-lane</placeName>

I put my hand in my pocket to pay the coach. I paid it; the prisoner was present when I took my money out: there was nine guineas and a half in a piece of cloth. The boatswain had cut his finger, and a doctor was trying to stop the blood. While the prisoner and I were standing at the coach door, he having seen where I put my money, he catched it suddenly out of my pocket, and ran away with it. I pursued him, but could not catch him. He was taken the next morning by the boatswain. I was sent for before the bench of justices: the man that took him found four guineas and a half upon him, and some silver.</p>
               <p>Jos. Levi. On that Sunday night, about eight o'clock, I went into the Bee-hive in Nightingale-lane. This sailor was there with two others. There were a parcel of girls of the town, I dare say twenty. The next morning I was at the Rotation (I attend there.) I there heard this man had been robbed by a man that was with him the night before, of nine guineas and a half. I saw the prisoner in Red-Lion-street. I took him up, seeing him with the sailor the night before. I went to search him: he said, You need not search me; and gave me his money out of his pocket, four guineas and a half, and three shillings and six-pence in silver. He said, he received it two days before for wages on board a ship. The prosecutor came. When before, the Justices, he was asked if he knew the man that took his money? He said, he was much in liquor; he did not know him.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177002210044"></xptr> He was bid to look about; he did, and said he did not see him. After one of the sailors said, the prisoner was the man; then the prosecutor said, he believed he was the man.</p>

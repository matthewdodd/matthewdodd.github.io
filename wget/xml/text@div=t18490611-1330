                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Nathaniel Tan, of the George and Guy public-house, Spitalfields. On 5th May, about a quarter before seven o'clock in the morning, the prisoners came to the bar—there was no one elm op—one of them, I think Crammond, called for a pint of beer, I had teen him before—I have no doubt about either of them—they then asked for half a pint of gin and peppermint—I turned round to get the peppermint, and when I turned back, Watson was leaning over the counter, with his hand on the till, which was partly open—it was shut before—he must have pulled it out—it is under the counter on the opposite side to where they were—I asked him what he was doing there—he made me no answer—Crammond was standing just behind him, and must have seen where Watson's hand was—I then took 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which was all the silver in the till, from it, and put it on a desk in the bar-parlour, where there was 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. before—the parlour is a little way behind the bar, which is a place of itself—I came into the bar again, and Watson jumped over the bar, went into the parlour, took the 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. off the desk, and put it into his pocket—Crammond was holding the street-door at the time, which is three or four yards from the counter, with his face to the street, to prevent any one coming in—Watson came out at the bar gate—I called to my master two or three times—they laughed at me, and went down Fashion-street—I saw Watson at the station on the Monday week after, and recognised him at once; he was alone—Crammond was taken into custody that same night—Watson had a cap on, and he had a cap when he was in cuatody.</p>

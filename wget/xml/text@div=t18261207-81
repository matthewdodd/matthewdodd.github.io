               <p>WILLIAM HODGSON. I am a labourer, and live in High-street, Newington, about three quarters of a mile from Stamford-hill. I bought these two rabbits of the prisoner on the Wednesday morning, at near nine o'clock - I knew him before; he was a labourer - I gave him 5s. for the two; they are does - I did not think I had any particular bargain: he has occasionally worked for me on some ground which I rent - he said he had bought them of a man, who appeared to be a countryman, near the Rochester Castle public-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you buy any turkies of him? A. No, he had nothing but the rabbits - I attended before the Magistrate, and stated that I bought them of him - I saw him the same day they were taken from me; I told him they were said to be stolen, and he said he would come voluntarily - I told him to meet me at the office the next day, and he did so.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and have lived with the prisoner as his wife for four years and a half; we lodged in April, at No. 3, Edward-place, Wal<lb></lb>worth-common—we had a room there—he is a shoemaker—on the Friday night before, 2nd April, he came home between 7 and 8 o'clock; he was not quite so tipsy as he was on the Thursday—on the Saturday he did not go out, and we both went to bed between 11 and 12 o'clock; on the follow<lb></lb>ing morning, Sunday, I got up between 8 and 9 o'clock—he did not break-fast with me that morning—he appeared to be very stupid after breakfast—he took up his shoemaker's hammer, and kept on saying that there was somebody in the room going to injure him—there was nobody but me in the room—he stood in the doorway with the hammer and a knife in his hand, for two hours—in the evening he asked me to take him to a doctor, and I took him to Mr. Simmons, of Hourglass-lane—on our return, I put a mustard poultice on the back of his head, as I was ordered by Mr. Simmons, but he would not let it stop on—we went to bed between 11 and 12 o'clock, he still appeared just the same, and in about half an hour I went to sleep—I was</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cabman—the prisoner, and Mary Davis lodged at my house, No. 3, Edward-place, Walworth common—on Sunday morning, 2nd April, about 9 o'clock, the prisoner came into my bedroom, and said, "My head is very bad," and I said "I am very sorry for it"—he went back to his room in a minute or so—between 12 and 1 o'clock I saw him on the landing with a hammer and a knife in his hand; he said nothing to me, nor did I to him—between 5 and 6 o'clock in the evening I saw him again—mine is the next room, and during the night I heard my name men<lb></lb>tioned, "William Martin, he will murder me; for God's sake, he will murder me!"—I went to the door, and said, "If you will open the door, I can render you assistance, while you keep it shut I cannot; if you do not, I will break it open,"—after that it was opened, and Mary Davis ran past me in a wretched state, covered with blood—the prisoner followed her about half a minute afterwards, with a knife in his hand—he came into our bed-room—I and my wife got hold of him, got him into his own room, and my, wife went for a constable—I had never seen him ill treat her before.</p>

I was fetched to No. 3, Edward-place, and found the prisoner in Martin's charge, in the first floor front room—I asked him what made him assault his wife in that way; he said, "I have done it"—this hammer (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was on the floor with a deal of blood on it—I asked him if he had done it with this, and he said "Yes"—I took him to the station—he was very calm when I got into the room, and seemed to understand what I said perfectly well—at the station he said, "I knew perfectly well what I was about; she did not give me the least pro<lb></lb>vocation; she is a very nice woman."</p>

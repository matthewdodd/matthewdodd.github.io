Birnie showed me the skeleton of the pin, the diamond had been removed from it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Had you a party there? A. Yes, There were some ladies, and one gentleman, none of them are here; it was a diamond pin, the prisoner was a stranger; it rained very fast, but it was very light - the rest of the party were in the theatre; I saw the handkerchief put towards me and felt the pin go; I do not know who found the pin, of my own knowledge; I did not see the prisoner searched.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was leaving the Theatre at the same time as the prosecutor; he was applying for a coach - I happened accidently to run against him: he then charged me with having taken his pin; I asked how he dared to charge me with such a thing: he stood struggling with me some time, and then gave charge of me.</p>

            . On the 1st of January, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner in Newgate-street; I was returning home with a friend, and was rather in liquor; she asked me to give her something to drink, as it was New Year's night; I agreed, and we all three went into a wine-vaults, and had a glass of rum each; I pulled out my money which was tied in a handkerchief - I paid for the liquor, put the money in the handkerchief, and put it into my pocket; we came out, she said she wanted to speak to me - I went up a court with her, and stopped about three minutes; my friend stopped at the end of the court, she came out of the court before me - some girls at the end of the court asked if I had lost my money, I felt and missed it; I had a sovereign, and 5 s. or 6 s. tied in the handkerchief; I had not opened the handkerchief in the court - it was in my right hand breeches pocket; I returned to the wine-vaults; she came in in about three minutes after, I charged her with taking my money, she denied it; I gave her in charge; the handkerchief was found on her. I did not give her any thing.</p>

            . I am a porter, in Newgate-market. I had been drinking with Adams; I was sober, we met the prisoner in Newgate-street, she caught hold of him, and asked for something to drink; we went to the wine-vaults and had a glass of rum each; he pulled some money out in a handkerchief, a sovereign, and 4 s. or 5 s., paid for the liquor, took his change, and tied his money up in the handkerchief, and came out; she wanted to get him into the court, he went up with her - I stood at the end, and in a minute or two the watchman turned them out of the court; she went into Newgate-street as fast as she could walk; two women said they thought he had lost his money, he searched, and missed his handkerchief; I pursued but could not see her - we returned to the wine-vaults; she came in for her pattens, he gave her in charge.</p>

            . On the 1st of January, near twelve o'clock, the prisoner was brought to the watch-house, I found the handkerchief in her pocket, loose, and one sovereign, four shillings, and two-pence on her; the prosecutor claimed the handkerchief, and said before he saw it, it was torn at the corner - he gave the same story. He was very little in liquor.</p>

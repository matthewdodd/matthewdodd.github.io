               <p>Court. Do you know the prisoner? - My Lord, yes.</p>
               <p>How long? - From the time she was at school, I can say nothing against her; she came from Drury-lane, and called upon me, and begged I would lend her a guinea to go down to Manchester, and I did.</p>
               <p>When was that? - I cannot tell the day, I know very little of the prosecutor, I never heard her say any thing against the girl.</p>
               <p>- LEVY sworn.</p>
               <p>I have been here yesterday, the prosecutor said to me that she would wish to have the girl cast, that she might get 40 l. by the prisoner; that is all that I know of it.</p>
               <p>Court. How came she to say this to you? - She knows me, and I know her, so she came up to me and said, you are intending here? I said, yes, I am obliged to intend here; says she, I wish to God that my prisoner would weigh forty; says I, what does she mean? to another woman; says the woman, she means to hang her: I know the prosecutor very well, I did not know the girl.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never spoke to her; she set some bad women upon me, and I was obliged to give charge to the constable of her, I never spoke to her, never mentioned a word to her, I never knew her, only she passed by my house several times; she has been at my house, I keep a shop, she has bought garden-stuff of me; the constable is at the gate in a kind of claret coloured coat, but I do not know his name.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Levy. Every body knows that she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178806250074"></xptr>keeps a bawdy house, I am sure of it, but I have not been in it, she hired this girl as a maid; this girl that is a witness was in her house as a girl herself.</p>
               <p>Mrs. DOWDELL sworn.</p>
               <p>The prisoner is my daughter, this woman was over at the King's-Head, at Stratford, in Essex, and sent for my child and told her there was a place for her; she went and came home and said, mother, I have a place, I will go to it to-morrow; I lost her for twelve days, I happened to go down Church-street, and saw her there, I said, Sally, Sally, have you got to Mrs. Breeds? because she had a child by a man of that name who lived at Stratford, our parish allowed her 2 s. a week; a young woman that is on the outside now, went on the Monday, and she told her as soon as ever she could get an opportunity she would run away, she took half her things and half she left behind her, and her boxes; and this woman that swears against her, has keys that unlocks her box and her little trunks; she lent me her keys to unlock them; when my daughter run away she went to her sister at the other end of the town, and borrowed a guinea to go down to Manchester, then she came up to me, and they came and took her into custody; they turned and tossed all my things about, I lost a silver tea-spoon, a pair of white cotton stockings, a silver three-pence, the things all lay about the room when I came in.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the prosecutor come to your house to enquire after your daughter? - Yes, she came and asked me if my daughter was come home, I said no; oh! says she, she has robbed me; says I, she has not been here, nor has she got half her things as I am informed; says she, here is my bunch of keys, and you may unlock the box and see, which I did.</p>
               <p>Had your daughter been in her service before? - When she was big with child with this last, a chance child that she had by young

               <p>Jury. Is this your own daughter? - Yes, and she served seven years in the charity-school, I have but two alive; I have another whose husband belongs to the India-house, and rents a house of 50 l. a year, she did not tell me the second time where she was going to live, for I knew her to be a bad woman; the first time she enticed her away from one Mr. Jourdan's in Spital-fields, I did not know where she was.</p>
               <p>Your daughter did not behave very well, I doubt? - Why my Lord, she is but young, very young, and she was brought up in the school.</p>

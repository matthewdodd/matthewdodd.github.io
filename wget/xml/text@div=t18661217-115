                  </hi>. I am potman at the Blue Anchor, Chancery Lane—on Saturday evening, 10th November, I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner there—I noticed them a few minutes before nine, and about ten, or soon after, they were grumbling at one another, but I do not know what it was, as I went out to give a light—a blow was struck, and then the landlord removed them—I stood on the threshold, and saw that the prisoner had hold of Connell with one hand, and was punching him with the other, and kicking him—I saw two or three persons carry Connell away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Bream's Buildings, Chancery Lane—on Saturday night, 10th November, I was at the Blue Anchor, in Chancery Lane—I there met the prisoner—I had a quarrel with him—the cause of it was taking my beer—I had been drinking, but I recollect being turned out of the house with the prisoner—after we were turned out he laid hold of me by the left arm, and when I had got about a yard or two yards outside I felt a knife going into my groin, but I did not see it—I said, “ Fulvey, you have killed me “—I went off in a faint, and don't remember anything more—when I recovered sensibility I found my<lb></lb>self in the hospital—the prisoner was brought there, I believe, by Inspector Brennan, and I identified him—that was the same night—I went into the hospital on the Saturday, and came out on the 22nd—it is in consequence of the wound I use a stick now—it still discharges.</p>

Q.</hi> When you were turned out, most properly, by the publican, Mr. Lodge, were you not very much the worse for drink? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—two or three of my <hi rend="italic">pals</hi> were among the nine or ten men in the public-house—a man named Murphy was there, and one named Conner—I cannot recollect any more—I went to a house called Martin's, opposite, in the same lane, before I went to the Blue Anchor—Kelly and a man named Lynch was in my company there, and a <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> they call Gray—I don't know whether I went with either of them to the Blue Anchor—I will not swear that they were not with me—I never saw any of them with me there—I have been told since that a man named Kelly took me home—I swear that I never said that I never felt I was stabbed on this night—I have never said anything to that effect—I have never said I was stabbed somewhere near the other side of Blackfriars Bridge to my remembrance—I remember something of what occurred in the public-house—I remember the prisoner taking my pot and emptying it—I threw the beer in his face: that was enough to make me—I was on good terms with him previous to this—I knew him—we were much the same as <hi rend="italic">old pals</hi>, but I did not keep company with him—I did not quarrel with any other person, nor any other person with me, in the Blue Anchor that I am aware of at ten o'clock.</p>

               <p>myself, and another constable, and I think two nurses—Connell had been treated by the surgeon, and was in bed and asleep—after some difficulty we awoke him, and told him to look round to see if there was any one there he knew—he pointed to the prisoner and said, "Yes, I know that man; that is the man that stabbed me"—the prisoner said, "You know I know nothing about it"—Connell then appeared to be exhausted, fell back in the bed, and went to sleep—I took the prisoner to the station and charged him—this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was handed to me there by 53 F—I opened it and said, "Oh! there's blood in it"—I showed it to the inspector, who was taking the charge—the prisoner's son at once said, "Oh! it's his tobacco knife; it's the knife he cuts his tobacco with"—the prisoner was shown the knife, and said it was not his—he afterwards said, "Yes, it is my knife that I cut tobacco with"—he said nothing when the charge was read over to him previous to that before the inspector—I went next morning to the hospital and obtained Connell's trousers—they have been covered with blood—the size of the knife exactly corresponds with the hole found in the trousers, I have fitted it—the hole is over the left groin—the blood ap<lb></lb>peared to be damp when I saw it: not wet.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the house surgeons at King's College Hospital—on Saturday night, 10th November, Connell was brought there about half-past ten—on removing his trousers I found he had lost a good deal of blood, and discovered a triangular wound in the left groin—I introduced my finger, but I could not feel the bottom of it—I did not use my forceps; it would have been dangerous—he was drunk—I then took him into the hospital and had him put to bed at once—the wound was dressed, and I kept him in some twelve days and then dis<lb></lb>charged him—in my judgment the wound was formed by the knife being pressed into the wound, and in drawing it out, while still in the wound, it had been twisted—it was such a wound as might have been inflicted by this knife—it was a very severe wound—I compared the knife the next day with the wound and with the hole of the trousers, and found that they exactly corresponded.</p>

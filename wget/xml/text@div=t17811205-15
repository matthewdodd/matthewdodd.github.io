I lost a brown mare on the 27th of October last, in the night or very early in the morning, my stable was broke open with a plough coulter. I live in the town of Colchester, there was only one mare in the stable, she was taken away.</p>
               <p>It was your own mare? - It was my mare, she was worth about 12 or 15 l. I had had her about four years. Immediately after the robbery I had some hand-bills printed, and sent them round the country upon the Saturday and Sunday after the robbery, which was on Saturday the 27th. Upon the Monday I came up myself to the public office in Bow-street. I first heard of my mare upon the 7th of November. I received a letter from the office, dated the 6th, that the mare was stopped at the Bull and Gate, Holborn. I came to town but not directly, they wrote me word in the letter, he was to be examined on the Monday morning. I came to town upon the Sunday the 11th of November, between ten and eleven. I went up to the Bull and Gate, and found the mare there.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>You could not be mistaken as to your mare? - No.</p>

               <p>You have had her four years you say? - Yes; upon the Monday Townsend and another man were examined concerning the mare. I swore to my property.</p>

               <p>You are servant at the Bull and Gate Inn? - Yes; I am the upper hostler, the other man is the under hostler. I was not at home when the mare was brought in. I saw her about eight o'clock at night upon the 27th of October.</p>
               <p>A bay mare? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see the prisoner come after the mare? - Yes; I saw him upon the Monday and Tuesday. The mare was brought in on Saturday night. I saw him both Monday and Tuesday at our stable.</p>
               <p>Both Monday and Tuesday? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did he say, or come to your stable for? - He came to put the mare up for sale.</p>
               <p>How soon was the mare put up for sale? - Much about two o'clock on Tuesday.</p>
               <p>He gave orders to put the mare up for sale? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You are sure the prisoner was the man? - That was the man.</p>
               <p>He gave you the order? - No; not to sell the mare, he went into the counting-house to the clerk.</p>
               <p>Then you did not hear him give the order? - No.</p>
               <p>Then you did not hear him say any thing about the mare? - Not then.</p>
               <p>When then? - When he came again after the mare was put up on Tuesday, he said he should wish to sell her, or he must put her up to grass.</p>
               <p>How soon did he come after the Tuesday? - He came between that and the Saturday, he examined the swelled heel, he desired her to be worked about, he would have it put up again upon Saturday, and if not sold upon the Saturday, he would send it into the country.</p>
               <p>Had you asked him about the price? - Yes; I asked him if he chose to fix any price upon the mare, because sometimes a customer comes and buys them before the owner comes.</p>
               <p>What did he say to that? - He told me no; he had an acquaintance of his would come and bid for the mare on Saturday.</p>
               <p>This he said to you? - Yes; if the mare could not fetch the money he proposed having for it, his acquaintance would buy it in.</p>

               <p>The mare was sold upon the Saturday? - I believe not a person bought it in for him. I believe to one Smith, I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Was the mare taken away or put up to sale again? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see the man again after this? - He came the Saturday night and ordered a bill to take the mare away, the prisoner came himself.</p>
               <p>Did he go by his own name? - No; he went by the name of Harris.</p>
               <p>Was the bill made out? - No.</p>
               <p>Did he pay? - No; he took the bill but not the mare, he did not pay the money. I believe upon Sunday, the next day, the mare was claimed, upon Sunday the 4th.</p>
               <p>You did not see him after the Saturday? - No; not till I saw him in Bow-street.</p>
               <p>That is the man that came three times to your house? - Yes; he gave me orders to have the bill made out.</p>
               <p>When was it Hedge came to town? - I am not certain; I believe the Sunday following as near as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>It was in the morning I believe upon the Sunday he came to town? - Yes; I saw him the day he came to town to the best of my knowledge. I believe it was Sunday he asked me to look at the mare.</p>
               <p>Did you shew him the mare? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was that the mare which the prisoner used to come and look after, and which he examined the heel of; was that the mare that was desired to be put up to sale, by the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>To Hedge. That is the man that shewed you the mare? - This is the man that shewed me the mare.</p>
               <p>That mare he shewed you was your own mare? - Yes.</p>
               <p>To the hostler. And that is the mare he looked at the heel of? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And that is the mare he ordered to be sold? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I belong to the office in Bow-street. Upon the 4th of November last, about nine o'clock at night, one Smith came to give information a mare was stolen from Colchester.</p>
               <p>Court. Smith was the man the mare was knocked down to, it is material he should be here; is he here? - No.</p>
               <p>That conversation with Smith occasioned your going to the Bull and Gate? - I went to see if there was such advertisement, I found it, and then went I to apprehend Townsend that night. It was on Sunday night about nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>You took Townsend directly, where did you take him? - In Vine-street Covent-garden.</p>
               <p>How came you to go there? - Smith told us.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him what he was charged with when he was taken? - He was told but I was not present. I went that night and stopped the mare. I saw

             this young man, I did not see the mare that night. The next morning I saw her. I took the advertisement out of the book and looked at the mare, she proved to be the same mare by the marks. Then Mr. Hedge was sent to at Colchester.</p>
               <p>To Johnson. I think you saw the mare<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050036"></xptr> at eight o'clock the night she was brought in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had she been rubbed down then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did she appear to come off a journey? - Yes; she was rode hard.</p>
               <p>Jury. Smith came to inform him where the mare was that was stole, and the man that stole her. I want to know from what circumstance he knew the man that stole her.</p>
               <p>Court. As Smith was not here I could not allow his evidence, that was the reason I stopped that evidence.</p>

               <p>My lord, I expected to have had my witnesses here, but my attorney being engaged in the morning with a trial, he had not time. My bill was found only yesterday. I had only notice to come up last night about four o'clock.</p>
               <p>You have no witnesses here? - I had them here in the sore part of the day.</p>
               <p>Are they witnesses to the character or fact? - To the fact, to the delivery of the mare to me.</p>
               <p>What is his name? - His name is Wilson, the person that was with me when the mare was delivered.</p>
               <p>Court. You may read the letter yourself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Wilson was in the house at the time.</p>
               <p>Court. You had the bill made out to one Harris, that is a letter to induce the jury to think, it was sent by Harris in order to sell. Harris lives but at Rumford, can you give any account of yourself in what way of life you are, does any body know you here?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I don't know that any body knows me in court. I am a cabinet-maker, I did work at Barnet sometime with Mr. Betty, and I have worked at your Lordship's house.</p>

               <p>Court. So far he says is true, there is an upholsterer of that name at Barnet, whom I have employed.</p>

Soon after 1 o'clock, on the morning of 22d December, I was standing against Christy's timber yard, Lower Marsh—I saw a man walking along there on the opposite side—I saw Weston, and a man not in custody, following him—Welsh was not with Weston, but he was called across the road by a female, and he joined Weston and the other man against the lamp-post at the corner of William-street—Welsh then seized the gentleman—he put his arm round his throat, and dashed him against the shutters of the shop at the corner—Weston and the other man went to the front, and appeared to be rifling his pockets—I was about thirty yards off then—it was right under a lamp-post where they attacked him—I saw all this distinctly—I ran across the road—some one called out, "The <hi rend="italic">slop's</hi> coming;" meaning a policeman—Welsh dashed the gentleman to the ground—I ran round William-street, and the prisoners had gone out of my sight—I returned to where the gentleman was—I found him there—he seemed very much hurt from the usage he had had—he had got his watch in his hand, and his chain was hanging down—it was not broken—he said, "All right, policeman; they have only got my key"—I found the key there—I went after the prisoners, and not being able to find them, I came back to the spot, and the gentle<lb></lb>man was then gone—about twenty-five minutes afterwards I saw Welsh, and took him into custody—I told him I wanted him for being concerned, with two others, in garroting a gentleman in the Lower-marsh—whilst I was taking him to the station, he said, "I have not been in the Lower—marsh to-night"—I said, "You can't deny this Maurice, that a woman called</p>

               <p>you across from James-street"—he then said, "That was my wife"—I did not see anything else of Weston till I saw him in custody at Southwark police-court, on the morning of the 28th—I identified him as the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the London Fire Brigade—on 5th August I was called by the police from my station in Shepherd's Lane, Brixton, at 10.25—I went with an engine to 2, Mitford Place, Vassal Road, and on arriving there I found smoke coming from the house, which was in charge of a constable—I went into the front kitchen in the basement, and found a sofa partly consumed—the bottom of it, and part of the back, was consumed—standing behind that was part of a French bedstead, which was also partly consumed; the paint on a door was scorched, and the gas pipe across the ceiling was melted—in the back kitchen I found a clothes-horse scorched, and a table close to it, and the ashes of something which had been bunt, were partly on the table and partly on the horse—in the front parlour the window curtains were burnt, and the shutters scorched—one fire could not have burnt those three different rooms—a chimney ornament, and a window curtain in the back parlour were also burnt, and the carpet was turned up against the fender—one fire could not have ignited the other—I inquired for Miss Gent, and was told she was next door—I went there, and saw her—I asked her if she could account for the fires in different places—she said no, she saw a blue light, and heard a report—I asked her if she was insured—she said "Yes, in the West of England Fire Office, for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and that she held the house on a lease—she was very excited—this was about twenty minutes after I went there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were there any traces of fire on the carpets and flooring? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—the fire had burnt itself out through the door being shut—they were very light articles—I should not think they had been on fire above a minute or two minutes—the sofa bedstead and the curtains must, I think, have been on fire a quarter of an hour, more or less.</p>

I was called, and found Gerrard at the house—I went over it with him; I agree with his statement—we found traces of seven distinct fires, quite separate and independent of each other—one could not have originated the other—I went to the next hosue and found the prisoner—I asked her if she could account for the origin of the fire—she replied that she could not, except it had been done by a former lodger, who she had to expel for arrears of rent, and who might have done it from motives of malice or revenge—I asked her if anyone else was in the house—she said "No"—I asked her how ir oc<lb></lb>curred—she said "I heard what I thought to be a knock at the front door, I went there to see what it was, and heard a kind of explosion; I went to<lb></lb>wards the kitchen to see what it was, and on looking down the steps or stairs, saw a blue light; I attempted to get out of the back door to pre an alarm, but stumbled over something soft in the passage, and became sense<lb></lb>less for some time.

               <p>insensible; and the first thing I remember afterwards was being held in somebody's arms, and brandy being administered to me"—she also said that the errand boy left about ten minutes before she heard the explosion or saw the fire—I asked her if anyone could have got into the house unknown to her—she said that the back door was bolted, and the chain was on the front door, and she did not see how they could have come in after the boy went oat, as she put the chain on the front door.</p>

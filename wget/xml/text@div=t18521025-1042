                  </hi>. I had a daughter in the defendant's service—she left on a Monday, about five weeks ago, between 9 and 10 o'clock at night—I do not know the day of the month—on the Wednesday afterwards I went to the defend<lb></lb>ant's house at Stoke Newington with Margaret Ann Jones—we got there about half past 8, as near as I can guess—we had taken some spirits at Mrs. Jones's house—we were sober; we were not tipsy—Mrs. Jones was sober—we were both alike—there are eight or nine steps up to the door—when we got to the top I knocked at the door, and Mrs. Jones stood at the side—the defendant opened the door, with a parcel in her hand containing a pair of clogs and two coarse aprons, belonging to my daughter—I said to her, "I have come con<lb></lb>cerning a servant girl you had living with you; I am her mother"—she made me no reply, but <hi rend="italic">heaved</hi> this bundle in my face, pushed Mrs. Jones with the other hand, and then shut the door—she said nothing as she did that—Mrs. Jones had no time to say anything—she was down in the area in a minute—she had not said anything; she only stood at the side, with her back towards the area—there were no rails to protect her from the area—it was a violent push sideways, and the door was shut very violently indeed—I knocked at the door, and said, "For goodness sake come out and see what you have done to my friend; I think you have killed her"—there was no answer; no one came to the door—I ran down two or three steps, jumped into the area, and saw Mrs. Jones there in a pool of blood; about that time help came, and Mrs. Jones was taken to a doctor's—Mr. Keale came out of the next house, and gave me and my daughter in charge, as he said, for breaking windows—I afterwards saw Mrs. Jones in the Hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Newmarket-place, Southgate-road, Kingsland. Between 8 and 9 o'clock on this evening, I was passing Mr. Keale's house, and saw two females on the steps; the door was open, and the first thing I saw was a hand pushing one of the females, who fell over into the area—I was just by the gate, which is, perhaps, three or four yards from the steps—there is a little garden—the push was as though it was done in a hurry—the door was then shut violently, slammed to, and then the other person com<lb></lb>menced knocking at the door, calling for a light, and saying they had knocked her friend into the area—I borrowed a light from next door, rendered what assistance I could, and went for a doctor.</p>

Q.</hi> You were passing casually? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the females did not appear to me to have been drinking at all—the door was about halfway open, and the hand came from within; I could see the hand, but nothing else—I do not remember the police coming up and asking who was the master of the house—I asked who was master of the house; Mr. Keale did not come forward while I was there, and say, "I am master of the house"—I did not say, "You are the person whose hand pushed the woman out"—I did not tell Mrs. Richards so.</p>

                  </hi>. On Wednesday, 22nd Sept., I was house surgeon at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. The deceased was brought there that evening; she was cold, had got a very small pulse, and looked very pale in the face—she had a wound on the right side of the forehead, a slight injury to the right arm, loss of motion in the lower and upper extremities, and complained of great pain at the back of her neck—the injuries might have been caused by a fall down an area; she died about noon on 26'th—in my judgment the injuries I found on her were the cause of her death—death was caused by rupture of the elastic substance which preserves the bones of the neck, and pressure on the spinal marrow—she was brought in about 11 o'clock at night, her breath smelled of liquor.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>I am shopman to Mr. Gibson; on Tuesday the 30th of June, between seven and eight, the two prisoners came in and addressed me, they wanted to see some fine muslins; I ordered the boy to ring for Mr. Gibson, he came directly, I gave him our private signal as suspecting them; he shewed them some, and sold Samuel a square of muslin, and she paid for it; Mr Gibson said there was a piece of muslin gone; they looked at some stockings, but could not agree for the price; we both looked round to see if any had dropped on the ground, but could not see any; he said, follow them; I did, and brought them back; we took them up stairs; but as I was going up stairs I saw Bertram shoved Mr. Gibson on one side; at that instant we supposed the muslin was dropped.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner Bertram's Counsel. Did you see it dropped? - I did not; a constable was sent for; there was other people in the shop, Mrs. Loate was one of them, and she called up stairs and said, here is the muslin.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How long had Loate been in the shop? - About twenty minutes; she came in after the prisoners were brought back; Miss Parnell served her, she was in the shop about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes; she sold her a half shawl.</p>

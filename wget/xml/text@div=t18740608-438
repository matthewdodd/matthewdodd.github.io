                  </hi>. I am the clerk of this Court—I produce the recognizances of Emily Easterby, taken on 8th April, 1873,. at Highgate, to prosecute Courtney Thomas Diprose, Courtney John. Diprose, Peter Jermyn, and Henry William Hammond for conspiracy, and another recognizance of the same date to prosecute Courtney John Diprose for larceny, and another to prosecute the same four Defendants for endeavouring by false pretences to induce her to place her signature on a paper, in order that it might be. Dealt with as a bill of sale—I also produce the recognizances of those four defendants to appear at the May Sessions of this Court, Monday, May 5—I have before me a book containing the proceedings of the Court, and at that Session bills of indictment were preferred against those four Defendants, and five true bills were found—one was against. Courtney Thomas Diprose for inducing Mrs. Easterby to put her name to a paper that it could be dealt with as a valuable security—her name and Mr. Harris's appear on the back of the bill, and bear against them the initials of the foreman of the Grand Jury, the Act, 19 and 20 Victoria, c. 24, requiring that the witnesses ex<lb></lb>amined by the Grand Jury shall be initialled by the foreman—I produce another indictment against Courtney John Diprose and Jermyn for a similar offence, and Mrs. Easterby's name and Harris's both appear on the back of it in the same way—I also produce a third indictment against Courtney John Diprose and Peter Jermyn for larceny of the goods of Emily Easterby—Harris's name is on the back of that bill both as attorney and witness, and is initialled, and so is Mrs. Easterby's—I produce another indictment against the same four Defendants, the name of Mrs. Easterby is on it, not initialled, and the name of Mr. Harris is on it, but the foreman's initials are placed in such a way that I cannot say whether they apply to that name or that of the next witness—I have another against Courtney John Diprose and Jermyn, for forcible entry into Mrs. Easterby's house; Harris's name appears upon that with <hi rend="italic">"Atty</hi>." after it—true bills were found in all those indict<lb></lb>ments at the May Sessions, and on Thursday, 8th May, Serjeant Ballantine' applied for the postponement of the trial, and it was ordered to be postponed till the first day of the next session, and the recognizances were enlarged upon all the indictments and the Defendants admitted to bail on the same bail as before on renewed recognizances—the next Session began on Monday June 9, and the case appeared on the paper on the first day of that Session—I know that it was postponed to the following Thursday, but it being only a postponement from one day of the same Session to another there is no entry in the book—on Thursday, 12th June, on the application of Counsel for the prosecution, the trial was put off till the next Session, and the recognizances of all parties respited till then—at the next Session, 7th July, there was another postponement and the recognizances of all parties were enlarged, except Mrs. Easterby's, which were ordered to be estreated, but the process suspended till further order—bail was renewed for the Defendants—on Monday, 18th August, on the application of Counsel for the prosecution and on reading affidavits, the trial was further postponed and the recognizances enlarged, till Wednesday, 20th August, to afford opportunity to Mr. Harris, the attorney, to answer the matters in an affidavit, and on 20th August this affidavit (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) of Mr. Harris was filed—the trial was further postponed till the next Session, and the recog<lb></lb>nizances</p>

               <p>of all parties, except Mrs. Easterby, renewed, and the bail was renewed—on Monday, 22nd September, on the application of the Counsel for the prosecution, the trial was postponed to the next Session, the recog<lb></lb>nizances being enlarged and the defendants admitted to fresh bail—at the Session which begun on Monday, 27th October, the Defendants all appeared and surrendered; Mrs. Easterby did not appear, no evidence was offered, and the Defendants were acquitted—I recollect that there was on that occasion an application for a further postponement by the Counsel for the prosecution—here is an information of Robert Stanley Harris attached to the depositions against, the then four Defendants, it is dated 31st March, 1873—I also produce another information of the same date sworn to by Harris.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an attorney, carrying on business at 3, Cloak Lane, City—we act as agents to the solicitor to the Treasury on occasions—on or about 20th May, 1873, I received instructions to take charge of the prosecution which was pending against the two Diproses, Hammond, and Jermyn—I produce a letter dated 15th May, signed by the defendant Harris, but the letter is not in his writing—I have the original (<hi rend="italic">This was an application addressed to the Secretary of State, by Harris, stating the whole circumstances of the case and praying far funds, as strenuous efforts were being made to arrange the matter and defeat: the ends of justice by tiring the prosecution out.</hi>) Mr. Harris afterwards called, and saw my brother, who is my partner; and on 2nd June, he called and saw me—I had a long conversation with him about the case—he told me he had been put to very great expense in the matter, and had had a very great deal of trouble, and he thought it very hard that the prosecution should be taken away from him at that time—I explained to him that the Treasury had only taken the usual course.; that we always acted for them as their agents in cases which they did not do themselves; that they never left private solicitors to do a case; they always sent to us—he then asked me if there was no chance of the Treasury paying his costs—I said that, as far as my experience went, they did not pay costs incurred before they took a case; but that as he had been put to considerable trouble, if he liked, When the case was over, to make an appeal to the Treasury, if my recommendation was of any service to him, I should be very happy to recommend the Treasury to pay him—he had not got the papers with him, and said that he would call next day and bring them, which he did; and as he handed them over to me he said, "Well, I rely upon you that you will assist me ail in your power to get my costs"—I said "Yes," and he gave me some further information—I went through the papers, and prepared the case for trial—Mr. Harris, the Counsel, had a brief, and the usual Counsel for the Treasury—I saw Mrs. Easterby I had nothing to do with finding the bills—I was present at the Sessions on Monday, 9th June—I. had seen Mrs. Easterby, I think, on—the previous</p>

               <p>Tuesday, and I directed her to attend here at 9.45—Harris, besides being the attorney, was a witness in the case—I also wrote to Mrs. Easterby and the other witnesses, telling them to be there—I knew that the case would stand first in the list—she did not appear, and the matter stood over till 12th June—in the meantime I received a letter from Mr. Harris and wrote to him—this is it; it is in his writing. (<hi rend="italic">This was addressed to Messrs. Wontner and Sons, and signed R. S. Harris, stating that it would be impossible for him to call on them, they having already trespassed upon his time to a great extent. Dated</hi> 11<hi rend="italic">th June.</hi>) On Thursday, the 12th, the case was postponed again, and in the meantime I endeavoured to find Mrs. Easterby—in the August Session I received some information from Mrs. Harper, Mrs. Easterby's sister and the mother of the little boy who is a witness—she handed me these letters and envelopes—to the best of my belief, the signature to this affi<lb></lb>davit of Harris is her writing, and I think the whole document is; I speak to the signature particularly. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he had read the affidavit of Rachael Harper, and also two letters, and that he did not persuade Mrs. Easterby to leave her home, or tell her that her sister Rachael had received</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">The letters were dated </hi>25<hi rend="italic">th and </hi>28<hi rend="italic">th July</hi>, 1873, <hi rend="italic">from Mrs. Easterby to her sister Rachael, stating that it was her solicitor's fault that she was taken away, and mentioning "Wentworth V</hi>.")—"Wentworth V" is Wentworth Villa—the trial was then postponed to September and then to October, but we were not able to find Mrs. Easterby, and in her absence, at the October Session, the case came to an end; the Common Serjeant would not postpone it any longer—I heard nothing more of the matter till the little boy made a statement to me, early in February, and two days after that, Mrs. Easterby came to my office—I reported the matter to head quarters, and was requested to prosecute the persons who had got her out of the way—these informations attached to the depositions are signed by Mr. Harris—I produce some letters signed by. Harris, relating to Mr. Martin. (<hi rend="italic">These were dated </hi>21<hi rend="italic">th February, </hi>25<hi rend="italic">th March, </hi>27<hi rend="italic">th March, and</hi> 23<hi rend="italic">rd April</hi>, 1873, <hi rend="italic">one of which acknowledged the receipt of a cheque for 51., and another requested the witness to put an eye on Mrs. Easterby, lest she should be tampered with.</hi>) Mr. Martin lives at Finchley, and is a witness in the case—I also produce two applications for post-office orders in Harris's writing. (<hi rend="italic">Each of these was for</hi> 51., <hi rend="italic">made payable at the Poste Restante, Paris, to Cecil Fortescue, from Charles Kidman of Barnet, and dated July</hi> 8<hi rend="italic">th and July</hi> 11<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1873.)—I also produce two post-office orders corresponding with those applications; they appear to have been cashed—they purport to be signed by Cecil Fortescue—I know Holman's writing, and believe them to be signed by him; one is dated 8th July and the other the 11th.</p>

Diprose, senior, was one and Jermyn was another—there was a van outside, and they proceeded to clear away my furniture—they put everything into the van, even the stores in the cupboards, wearing apparel, books, coals, and the keys of my desk—I had no bed or mattress left—it was about 9.40 when the things were finally taken away—I was alone and had to go out into the snow which was on the ground—on the Tuesday morning I consulted the defendant Harris, an attorney of White House, Hadley, Barnet—.1 paid him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—his fee was 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. but he had no change—I instructed him to get back-the worth of the furniture, and he undertook my case—I know Mr. Martin, a gentleman living at Finchley—I know that subscriptions were made for the purpose of paying of my law expenses, as I <hi rend="italic">had.</hi> no money—a charge was afterwards made at the Police Court, Highgate, and a warrant was obtained against C. J. Diprose, senior—I went with Baweu, the officer, and Mr. Fortescue (who I also know as Holman), and Mr. Harris went with us—I identified the person who was arrested—after wards at tie Highgate Police Court, Peter Jermyn and Hammond were charged—there were several examinations, Harris acting for me as my attorney, and he instructed Mr. Richard Harris as my Counsel—the defendants were represented by Sergeant Ballantine, and were held to bail to answer the charge at the May Sessions, and I was bound over to give evidence—at the May Sessions I was in Court ready to give evidence, but the matter went over to the June Sessions—between the two Sessions Mr. Blanchard Wontner wrote to me—I saw him, and he took charge of the case—I knew that the trial was to come on on Monday, 9th June, and twice in the week before that the defendant Harris came to my house, and he came again on the Monday evening after I had seen Mr. Wontner—that was before 9th June—he had some conversations with me on those occasions—I cannot be certain, whether he said "Square it up" or "Make it up"—I forget what the first word was, but I have told you before, if you will give Meahint of it—I said "I shall have nothing to do with it, don't bring these men here, for they will do me more harm' than they did at first, do as</p>

               <p>you please"—this was in the week before 9th June—he said that he would call and see me again in a few evenings—one evening after that I was standing at my window and saw two gentlemen talking, I recognised Harris—a knock came, and Harris said "Mrs. Easterby this is a friend of mine—this was on a day in the week before 9th June—I asked them in and we had a long conversation—I asked the gentleman his name, he said "Fell"—I asked him if he lived there, he said "Not exactly"—I said what are you, Sir—he said I am a solicitor, and I am a great friend of Mr. Harris—Fell is the first gentleman there (<hi rend="italic">In the dock</hi>) looking towards me—Harris said "Mrs. Easterby, it will pay me better for you to go away, for you are in ill health and in a nervous state, and it will do you good"—Fell then said that he should like to go to Paris if he had a chance, and he said "Go away Mrs. Easterby, go to Paris for six months"—I said that I should not go away, and Fell said "Look here Mrs. Easterby, will 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. pay you for your losses"—I said "Yes"—he said "Suppose' you have 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for your pocket-money"—we had a long argument about it, and he said that he and Mr. Harris would call again in a day or so, or the next afternoon—Harris said that I must not proceed in the matter, and he said "What would it profit you to punish these men, will the public keep you it will pay you better to go away"—I should have mentioned that before, it was when he came in and said "Good evening"—Fell said that he would call again tomorrow which was Saturday—Barnett had called on me a week before that at my house, I did not know him then, he said "Will you open the door Ma'am and speak to me"—I said "No, I can't open the door," and I opened the window, and he said "Oh, have mercy upon these men"—I said "You must go to the Judge, and everything that is proper to do will come"—he said "Put a price upon what you have lost, and if it is a 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I will bring it in less than two hours"—I said "Don't come here again I don't live here," and shut the window—I did not know who he was then, I had never seen him, and he gave me no name—Fell called again on the Saturday afternoon, that was the Saturday before the Sessions—I had written a letter that morning and gave it to my little nephew at 7.30 to take to him—he took it out and came back without it. (<hi rend="italic">Robert Helton, clerk to Messrs. Wontner proved serving a notice on the prisoners and on their solicitors, to produce the letter, but it was not produced.</hi>) I said in the letter, that I was surprised and astonished, and asked him to give me a call that afternoon Saturday, if he was walking out—Mr. Fell called, and said that he had not brought his cheque-book, but he hoped I should be ready, and he would come on Sunday morning before church time—I said that I had written to Mr. Harris, to decline going; he said "But it is the Session, and you must not be out of the way"—I said "Why can I not have 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and go to my friends?"—he said "No, they would fetch you, and make you speak"—he mentioned his cheque book, because I asked him how I was to have the money—I meant the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he said that he would bring his cheque book and give me some of the money—I declined going, and said "Where am I going?" he said "Go for six months and you will have everything fit for a lady," I said "I am not going," he said that he would come at church time, and wished me good evening, that was all that passed—next day, June 8th, I was standing at my door, and the little boy who was upstairs at the window, said something, and I came in and shut the door—I had not seen anybody—there was then a ring, I opened the door, I saw Mr. Fell and Mr. Barnett—Fell spoke first, he said "Good evening," and came</p>

               <p>in, and we had a long conversation, I asked where I was going to, and, he said "We will go to-an hotel in London to-night, and go into the country in the morning"—I said "Well, if I go for this Session I shall be home for the next"—I asked Barnett who he was and what he wanted, he said "Well, I am the same as Bowell"—I said "What, a detective" he said "Something of the sort"—I don't think they said anything about the money they had previously mentioned—I agreed to go, and left the house that night without the money—I beg pardon, I understood that Harris held the money, Fell said that he had not brought his cheque book, and could not get the money, but Mr. Harris would see to that—I put my bonnet on, and put my things together, Barnett got a Hansom's cab, and carried my box to it at the top of the road—it was then past 9 o'clock, I and the little boy who is turned ten, and Barnett got into the cab—Fell said "It is no use quarrelling here any more, I will come back again," but he did not—we stopped and had some refreshment somewhere in the Holloway Road, and then changed into a four-wheeled cab, and got to Islington about 9.30 o'clock—my box was taken off the cab and put on the pavement, and Barnett asked me if I would mind waiting a little, while he went to a friend—he went away and returned with Hammond, who I knew as the defendant against whom I had given evidence—he said "How do you do, Mrs. Easterby?" and put his hand out to shake hands, saying "I don't owe you any ill feeling"—Barnett and Hammond carried the luggage, and the little boy and I followed behind—we went to 14, Chadwell Street, Myddelton Square'—we went inside and I saw a lady there, he said "That is my sister," we went into a sitting-room up stairs and had some tea—Barnett brought me some paper in the course of the evening, and I wrote two letters and gave them to him, because I did not know the addresses; they were open, I did not see whether he read them—I gave them to him to put the stamps on—one was to the post-master at Finchley, for all letters to be left till called for, and the other was to my sister, Mrs. Harper—I did not put any address on the letters, because I did not know it—Barnett brought 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that evening, and I signed a receipt for it—I saw Hammond there that night—I do not know what, became of Barnett—they wished me good night, and Miss Hammond showed us to our bedroom—Barnett said that we were going to the country the next day, and we were to be ready by 7.30 in the morning—we breakfasted with Miss Hammond the next morning, and after breakfast I saw Barnett—I saw Hammond as I went out—he wished me good morning, and said he was going to the Sessions—a cab was a little way off, not at the door—the little boy and I and Barnett and Miss Hammond got into it and went to Gower Street Station (I had left my box at Chadwell Street)—we went to Victoria Station by the Underground Railway, and on the way Barnett said that I must not travel in the name of. Mrs. Easterby—I said that I would take the name of McKenzie—that is my maiden name, but I did not tell Barnett so—when we got to the station we changed from the Metropolitan part to the Brighton part—Miss Hammond gave me two tickets and a half, and we got into the train—Barnett then said "Good morning, Mrs. McKenzie, my name is not Barnett, it is Baldwin, give my love to my wife, and she will treat you very kindly"—Miss Hammond and the little boy travelled down to Southsea with me—we went to Brighton first and then changed—when we got to Portsmouth we went to Pelham Cottage, where I was introduced to Mrs. Baldwin—we stayed there until the following Sunday, 15th June—Baldwin came down in the middle of the week, and so did Hammond, but they did not tell me</p>

I said, "Yes"—Fell wished me good-night and left, and my nephew and I went to the same bedroom—I saw the same Miss Hammond there, and stayed there till Wednesday, 18th—Fell did not bring me the key—Hammond came about 6 o'clock on the Wednesday afternoon, and said that Mr. Harris was at Ludgate Hill, and wanted to see me—he had a gentleman with him to whom he said, "Here, Harry, will you go with Mrs. Easterby?"—I went with him to a cab at the corner of the street, leaving my nephew behind—we went to Ludgate Hill station—I did not pay the cab—I saw five men there, Mr. Fortescue, Mr. Harris, Mr. Fell, Mr. Hammond, and Mr. Hammond's friend—I knew Mr. Fortesoue again quite well, as being at the Court at Highgate—he came up, and I said, "Who are you, what are you, and what is your name?"—he said, "It is all nonsense about your going away; it will do you good"—I said, "I have nothing; I have not even a pocket handkerchief," and he went and got me a handkerchief and some eau de cologne—he said, "Where is the boy? Would not you like the boy?"—I said, "Yes;" and then they all left me—after that Hammond said, "I never had such a lecture in my life; I will bo off"—I had given him the lecture—I asked him to come away from them, and said, "If you don't give me the keys I shall walk to King's Cross; you first send me to Chadwell Street, and the second time you take me yourself—he said, "Why, woman, you went by yourself"—he snatched off-my shawl, and in a moment I was in the train—I had sat half-an-hour by myself before the train started—Hammond took me to the train; my shawl was on his arm, and the boy was in the carriage with Mr. Fortescue—we went away in the train, and my shawl was left with Hammond—we went to Dover, and on the way Fortescue told me that he was a doctor, and an intimate friend of Harris's—he said, "You must not travel in the name of Easterby; you must take Jones"—I said, "I will take McKenzie"—that is my maiden name—we went to Adamson's Hotel, Dover, and stayed there till 2nd July—Fortescue stayed the whole of the time, and Hammond came down and brought me some things which I had made a list of when I left Wentworth Villa, but he did not bring the key—I received 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Fortescue at Dover, and bought some things with it—I did not write to Harris, but I sent messages to Fortescue and saw him write—a lady and gentleman, friends of Fortescue's, were staying at the same hotel; they crossed with us to Calais—Hammond had dined with us that day—he knew I was going to Calais—I proposed going home but I had no key, and Fortescue said that it was for my own safety—we went to Calais by the night boat, to the Hotel Meurice, and after staying one night Fortescue went to Paris with his friends—he did not return—the bill was owing—I wrote to Harris about it to his office, and I believe I enclosed the bill—I did not write for my shawl because Fortescue wrote and said, get another—I said "Send the means then"—this is his letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he afterwards came with Hammond, and I think Fortescue said that they had both come from London—Hammond only stayed a day—their letters came in the middle of the week, and they came on Sunday about 1 o'clock, and then we moved to Boulogne with the boy to the Hotel de Londres—while I was</p>

I was examined at the Mansion House—I remember going with Inspector Clarke to Wells' office—my mother was with me—after Mr. Clarke had been with Wells some little time my mother and I were fetched up to see Wells—I then looked at him and Clarke said "Do you know who that gentleman is?"—I said "I do not, I don't know him at all"—I was present when Wells was before the Lord Mayor, but Mr. Poland never asked me whether Fell was the man I knew—to-day is the first time I have been asked that question—my mother did not point out Wells to me as Fell, but my aunt did once—she said "There is Mr. Fell, look at him"—I did not think it was Fell even then—I did not have a good look at him, because it was in a dark corner of the room—that was not at the Mansion House, it was when he came to my aunt's—that is not a reason for knowing him—I am not quite certain now that that gentleman is the person I saw at my aunt's.</p>

               <p>of the case, and said that he wanted the Christian name of Diprose—I had a paper in my possession with his signature, which I showed him—that paper had been lent to me to arrange, by somebody else—Harris asked me if I would bring it to Highgate, and show it to his Counsel—I went to Highgate Police Court, and saw one of the warrants executed; that was the arrest of the elder Diprose—Mrs. Easterby and Harris were with me—Harris said that I might as well see the fun out, and we all went together—I made Mrs. Easterby's acquaintance on that occasion—I chatted with her going along, and in the Court, Harris asked me to bring my papers a second time to show Mr. Harris—I had heard Harris conduct cases at the County Court frequently; in fact, he lived with me some time at my house—Hammond was one of the defendants at Highgate—I remember the fact that they were committed for trial—I was present here in May when the case was postponed; I heard Serjeant Ballantirie apply for a postponement, and it went over to the June Session—I did not know Baldwin until this case; I just saw him when he came to Bow Lane station—on Wednesday, 18th June, I was at the Ludgate Hill railway-station—Hammond, Harris, Wells, and Mrs. Easterby were there—after the adjournment of the Diprose case, Harris and I had different conversations about it—he told me it was necessary that Mrs. Easterby should be sent away—he told me so on the second occasion, and he said he thought it was advisable to send her abroad—I think that was on the Saturday previous to the 18th June, and he asked me, as I knew the Continent, if I would, undertake to take her—I said of course I could not leave my business without some consideration; but if there was no danger likely to emanate from it, I was willing to—he said "There will be no trouble accrue to you from it, because there is no charge of felony against them, as my Counsel, Mr. Harris, says that the charge of felony must be abandoned when they come to trial, and it would only be compounding a misdemeanour, which there is no harm in"—I said I would talk it over with my wife, and think about it, and let him know—I don't think I saw him again till the following Wednesday, when he said that he would see me righted, that it would be liberal pay, and my expenses would be paid—he also said that his costs were to be paid by the other side, as he had got nothing out of Mrs. Easterby—I think he said that his claim was 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that they had agreed to give him 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; half was to be paid down, and the remainder if Mrs. Easterby did not appear, so that they were acquitted—he did not tell me whether he was to have all the money, or whether anybody else was to have a part, but I understood him that he had to pay some portion of that to Counsel—he and Hammond came together on Wednesday, 18th June, after Barnet County Court, and saw me in my private office—the same thing was proposed about my going away with Mrs. Easterby—I said I was quite willing, but I did not want to burn my fingers over it—Wells said "You can't do that; for we are dealing only with Hammond, and he is not charged with felony. Mr. Harris says that the charge of felony cannot be sustained, and therefore no harm can come of it," or some remark of that kind—I then consented to go, and he told me to put a lew things together—it was first arranged that I was to go to Paris, to take Mrs. Easterby to some address that was to be furnished to me afterwards, and first of all they wanted me to stay away six months—I said if I went to Paris I should certainly extend my tour a little, and see the Con<lb></lb>tinent again, as it was some years since I had seen it—I declined to go for six months, but said I would not mind being away a fortnight or three</p>

               <p>weeks, and I was to have 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think it was, for that, and my expense paid—they told me to get a few things packed together in a bag, and they would call for me at a certain time—I was not told at that interview where Mrs. Easterby was; I had it previously that she was in London, at Hammond's house, from Harris or Wells; they were the only two that I had any conversation with—Harris had previously told me that he had got Wells to attend to the matter for him, as he must not be seen in it more than he could help—he told me that the defendants had offered <hi rend="italic">him</hi> terms to compromise the matter—they promised to see me righted—they were to have made terms for me with Hammond, and in talking about it at Ludgate Hill, I think Wells said "Mind, Mr. Hammond, this is to be quite distinct from the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that I am to receive"—I don't remember anything else said on the subject of money so far as Wells was concerned—he had received the money on account of Harris—I am almost certain it was Harris who told me that: that Wells received half of the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for <hi rend="italic">him</hi>—I think this conversation on the 18th, at Barnet, took place when they adjourned from the County Court for refreshment early in the afternoon—I put my things together, and I and Wells and Harris met at the Barnet Station, or at my house, and went from Barnet together—when we got to King's Cross, Harris left us to make a call somewhere, and arranged to meet us at Ludgate, which he did—Wells and I went to Ludgate in a cab—I did not know Wells then by any other name—I first heard of that, I think, when I was at Dover, from Mrs. Easterby—I then heard the name of Fell—she spoke a great many times about Mr. Fell—from what she said, I recognised the person as Wells—I did not speak to Mrs. Easterby at first when I got to Ludgate; after some time I did—she hesitated a good deal at first about going away, saying that she had no change of apparel, not even a pocket handkerchief—I said "Oh, I will soon procure you that," and I went out and bought her three, I think, and a bottle of lavender water—I had some conversation with her for some time—I suggested her going to Dover, as she objected to going abroad—she said she should like it very much; she had been there on her wedding tour, or on some occasion with her husband, and she should like her little boy with her, he went every where with her—I went and told the others; I can't say who I told, but Wells and Hammond called a cab, and went, off to fetch the little boy—I waited, talking to Mrs. Easterby—Hammond was gone a very little time, I was surprised at his going so quickly; he brought the little boy back—I can't say whether I saw the cab arrive—Wells was there—I can't say who got the tickets; they were given to me when I came back from getting the handkerchiefs—it was just on the time of starting—they were second-class tickets for Dover—Mrs. Easterby and her nephew got into the train; I got in last—Harris and Wells were on the platform—Mrs. Easterby had a red pattern shawl, I think, while she was sitting down waiting, and by some means, I can't say how, that disappeared—I heard her complain at Dover that she had lost it—I was introduced to her as Mr. Fortescue—Harris suggested that name—I did not tell her who I was, or what my profession was—she had an accident at Dover, and said she should like to have a doctor; and I said "I don't think there is any occasion for that, I am half a doctor, I will see to it"—we stayed at Adamson's Hotel at Dover—she went by the name of Mrs. McKenzie—Wells told me that as we went to Ludgate—he was talking of her being at Hammond's house, and having coming back after being away some where,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187406080113"></xptr>
               <p>and they did not like her being here in town for fear of her being discovered—I said I thought she was very likely to be in the name of Easterby, and he said, "She is not going by that name; she is going by the name of McKenzie"—while we were at Dover Hammond came down—on one occasion he brought a number of parcels of Mrs. Easterby's things—he did not say where he got them—we reproved him very much for bringing so many useless things, and he had to take them nearly all back again—no doubt we had some conversation about the case at Dover—he brought some money down and gave it to me; he did not say where he got it—I furnished Mrs. Easterby with some money at Dover; when she wanted pocket money she applied to me for it, and had it—she bought some things at Dover, and Hammond bought a box for her—a Mr. and Mrs. Harding, friends of mine, came and joined us—it was afterwards arranged that we should go to Calais; that was about the end of June or the beginning of July—I proposed to her going on to Calais as she was tired of Dover; she objected, but when Hammond came down he talked to her, and she consented, and we were to take the earliest opportunity of going—before we started, Hammond brought me some money; he never told me where he received money—nothing was said by Hammond about any of the other persons; probably in talking about the trial a name might have been mentioned, but I had no interest in the names, so I asked nothing about them—before we left for Calais a letter was dictated to Mrs. Easterby by Hammond; at least, after dinner they went into a private sitting room and. had writing materials, and a letter was submitted—it was written to Messrs. Wontner—I can't say whether it was dictated or not—Hammond showed it to me—I am not certain that I saw the letter; I think I saw a copy of it—I could not swear that this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was it; I should know the subject of it—Hammond went away soon after that; he stayed a night—we went by the night boat to Calais the first calm day, and went to the Hotel Meurice—I and my friends started off to Paris, and left Mrs. Easterby and the little boy at the hotel at Calais—she had money when we went over by the boat; I can't tell how much—I had given her different sums, altogether 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I should think—she bought things for herself and, I believe, for the boy, and she had a dressmaker's bill to pay, and one or two little matters—I remember her coming to me for money for it—I think it was on 2nd July that we crossed to Calais—before leaving Dover I paid the hotel bills, altogether about 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—while I was in Paris I received two post-office orders addressed to the Hotel de Londres de Milan; they were on the Paris chief office I signed the name of Cecil Fortescue for them—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the orders, and this is my signature—when I went to cash the last one they had not received the advice, so, as I was coming away, I left it with the hotel proprietor in part payment of the bill—one was sent to me in the name of Robert S. Harris, and the other in the name of Charles or Charlie Kidman—I received a letter from Harris at the same time, informing me that he had remitted it to me in that manner—the orders were each for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had not known him by the name of Kidman; that was the first time I heard that name—I stayed at Paris a fortnight—I received these post-office orders there while Mrs. Easterby was at Calais—I had written to Harris for money—I went direct from Paris to London; we got into London at 5 o'clock on Sunday morning, and I went to my friend's house—I received 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a letter from Wells before I came away—I don't know that I could swear to Wells writing; I don't think I could—I have destroyed the letter</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187406080114"></xptr>
               <p>—I kept none of the papers—except by the letter, I don't know from whom that money came—Borne few days after I got to London I saw Wells and Harris—I was seeing Harris constantly at his office or my house, and I used to call on Wells, at his office in Paternoster Row—I can't tell you the subject of our conversation; it was merely to render an account of my stewardship, what I had been doing, and where I had left Mrs. Easterby—I speak French slightly—when I was in London I wrote this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and posted it to Mrs. Easterby at Calais, at the Hotel Meurice—I had seen Hammond, and he had shown me some letters which she had written, rather scolding him because no one had been near her while I had been in Paris—I had left her with the understanding, that some one would come and stay with her, and I wrote this letter as a means of pacifying her. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi>" Mr. Cecil Fortescue has been unexpectedly called back to town, but will be in Calais in the course of a few days, probably on Saturday or Sunday next, accompanied by H., and will then make all arrangements at the hotel for Mrs. McKenzie's comfort, so that for the next day or two she may make her mind quite easy.") I then went to Calais accompanied by H, that is Hammond—I had not made arrangements with any of the defendants about my future movements—I don't know whether I received any money from Hammond on that occasion—we arrived at Calais on Saturday night, and did not see Mrs. Easterby till Sunday—I paid the bill on the Monday and we started for Boulogne, because she wished to leave Calais—we went to the Hotel de Londres—Hammond went away for two or three days—I believe he returned at times—I believe he and I came away together to London—I made arrangements to board Mrs. Easterby at so much per week at the Hotel de Londres—I can't say how long I stayed in London—I went back to Boulogne, I think with Hammond—we left Boulogne towards the end of July, in consequence of a letter which we found at the hotel, addressed to Mrs. Easterby from Messrs. Wontner—I gave it to her, she opened and read it, and was somewhat alarmed—I said I had better go to town, but I did not—she suggested that she had better leave the hotel and we left and went to Neufchatel—we stayed at a small country inn there, I forget the name of it, it is next door to the English boarding house, opposite the Church—I stayed there till the following Wednesday, that was in August—I then came to town—I paid the bill at Boulogne and at Neufchatel up to the time I left, and when I got to London I had only a few shillings left—I went to Hammond's house, he was not at home, but the servants came running after me—I went back again and then went to Mr. Wells' office in Paternoster Row—I saw him there and told him what had occurred, and that I had left because I had only made arrangements to be away a week—I considered that 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was due to me and it was paid me, it was sent to me in the name of Thomas Ward—I afterwards saw Hammond—I told him what had occurred, and that Mrs. Easterby was very anxious and uncomfortable—I gave him the address at Neufchatel, and as far as I know he left—I saw Harris and Wells from time to time after that, and had conversation with them continually about Mrs. Easterby—Harris talked a good deal about one of the trials, where he had to make an affidavit—he merely mentioned the annoyance it was to him, that he had been charged with certain things and had to make an affidavit to clear himself—Wells and I met sometimes at my house and sometimes at his—I heard about the acquittal of Hammond and the Diproses—I was not told for a long time afterwards by either of the Defendants what had become of Mrs. Easterby, but afterwards Harris</p>

I am a widow, and formerly lived at 164, Regent Street—Sidney Harper is my son, and Mrs. Easterby is my sister—I heard from her of the Diprose prosecution and of its adjournment from the May to the June Session—during that interval Baldwin called on me several times—he came up to me between 11 and 12 o'clock one night as I was getting out of an omnibus in Regent Street—I had never seen him before—he said "I believe you are Mrs. Harper?"—I said I had not the pleasure of knowing him"—he said "I come to speak to you about the Diprose case to ask you to use your influence with your sister"—ho said that I could have a sum of money for doing so, and my sister could have several hundred pounds and a house at the sea-side for six months—no particular sum was mentioned—I told him I had nothing to with the matter, nor did I wish to have—he asked me if my name would have any influence with my sister if he went down to her—I said "Certainly not"—he called again next morning and asked me the same question—I told him he must not come there to me again as it was very inconvenient for me to receive visitors in a house of business—he said that he was then going to my sister at Finchley—he called again twice or three times after the' business was closed and</p>

Wontner—I did not know that my sister had been out of England—I had not the least idea where she was—I attended here in August, September, and October—I saw Harris once when I gave the letters into Court—Hammond was there—I saw Holman at the October Sessions—he asked me if I had recovered my little boy—some boxes of mine had been left at my sister's house at the time of the seizure, and after applying to a Magistrate to know how to get them I received them from a Mr. Garrard, of Hackney Road—some of them were hers as well as mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief inspector of the Metropolitan Police—on 12th April, I went to Harris's house, at Finchley, I did not find him there, but I met him, and told him I had a warrant, which I gave him to read, and brought him to town in custody—I took Wells on 12th May, on two war<lb></lb>rants—I found him at the Police Office, Old Jewry—one warrant was for not appearing as a witness in this case—Mrs. Easterby was re-called, and he was sent with the other defendants to answer the charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. TURNER</hi>. I understand that Wells went to the Mansion House first, and then to Bow Lane—he came there voluntarily—I had been to his office on two occasions previously, once with the lad Harper at the end of April, or early in May—I had a warrant for the arrest of a person named Fell—I went with Mrs. Easterby a few days afterwards, to still with the warrant, and had a conversation with him in her presence—I did not say to her "That is Mr. Fell"; I asked her whether she knew him—we were then in the lobby of his office, he then went into his office with Wells—I said "Mr. Wells, the lad does not recognize you, and Mrs. Easterby does not recognize you, and there is an end of the case"—I most probably shook hands with him—before Wells surrendered, I received a communication from Holman, and it was after that that Mrs. Easterby was examined for the first time, at the Mansion House, as to Wells.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> She was examined for the first time, as soon as Wells was there—he came out on the landing at his house, and I said to Mrs. Easterby "Do you know this gentleman" she said "No, I don't think I do, put on your glasses," or "take off your glasses," as the case might be, and then she said "No, I don't think I know you"—I am not sure whether he spoke—I had not told her that she was to go there and see Fell, I merely took her there to see somebody—she made a statement to me going down stairs.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">considered that this statement would not be evidence</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Hackney. On the 16th of March I had some washing clothes in a cart, opposite a door in Caroline-place, Guildford-street—I went into the house, leaving the cart for not above three minutes, I received information, went with a policeman, and saw the two prisoners in Gray's Inn-lane—the policeman took them, and at the station-house these pinafores, which had been taken from my cart, were produced.</p>

I met the prosecutor, and went down Gray's Inn-road with him, we met the prisoners, seven or eight minutes' walk from Guildford-street—I asked Harrington what she had in her apron, she said, a loaf of bread, which I found there, with four pinafores—she ran away—I fetched her back, and took them both to the station-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Caroline-place. I was at my window on the 16th of March, and saw the cart at No. 4, and Harrington behind the cart, taking something out of a box in the cart, which she put into her apron—Heaney was standing still on the pavement, six or seven yards off, near enough to see what she did—Harrington went to her when she had got the things—they went round the corner, into Mecklenburgh-square—it was six or seven o'clock—they were stopped about twenty minutes' walk from the cart.</p>

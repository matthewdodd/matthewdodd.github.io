               <p>the night Edwards was brought home by the prisoner—on tie following morning the prisoner told me that Edwards was his son—he said, "He is a nice youth, is not he?" putting his hand on his head;" do you think he is like me?"—I said, "Yes"—on the Monday before Christmas the prisoner said to me, "Mrs. Mitchell, are you so stupid as to think he was my son?"—I said, "Yes"—he said "No; his father is a friend of my brother, and he is a <hi rend="italic">nointed</hi> young rascal; after keeping him two days and two nights, he got up in the morning and robbed me of 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; his father wishes me to get him to sea, but I am afraid his father will have a handful of him."</p>

                  </hi>. I am the mother of Alfred Edwards—my hus<lb></lb>band is dead—my son is sixteen years old—he left home on 6th Dec, about 1 o'clock, he returned on Sunday night—he was more like a mad boy than anything else—he seemed to have been drinking very much—he was in an excited state, and had no shoes on his feet—I do not know a person named Nunner, I have heard my husband mention him—my son had boots on when he left home—he was never out all night, except on that occasion but when he was at work at Sydenham—he was never out without our knowledge.</p>

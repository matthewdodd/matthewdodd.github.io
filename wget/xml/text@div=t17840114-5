               <p>On the 18th of December, I believe you went to several public houses, and had not money enough to pay your reckoning, and Selfage paid your reckoning for you? - I was short in a penny, but I had four shillings that I would not let him know I had, because he spunged upon me.</p>
               <p>That Selfage was an old acquintance of yours? - I have known him four or five years.</p>

               <p>What time did he come home? - I cannot rightly tell, it was past eleven.</p>

               <p>I know the prosecutor, I lodge at one Mr. Grainger's, the Crooked Billet, I was with him on the 18th of December at different places, we had three shillings worth, and about three gallons of beer, and he was drunk before we had that, he was going to fight with a sailor, he was very drunk and very quarrelsome, I parted with him about ten, he would have three pots of beer at Mr. Martin's, he bid me good night, he and one Long that is a witness, and I thought he was going home, I went away, and I came back again, and he was drinking again, where the people's name is Charlton, there he had been tossing up for half a gallon of beer, this was between six and seven, we then agreed among us to toss up,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140012"></xptr> for six pennyworth, and we did so, and he beat three of us, and three of us beat him again, he had not quite money enough to make out the last six pennyworth in his pocket, I held the shilling, and an acquaintance of ours, one Long that will be a witness, lent him the remainder, I think he lent him three farthings, he said he only wanted a halfpenny, then Long called for a gallon of beer out of his own pocket to treat us with, as I sometimes deal with him; after that we had another pot, Mr. Dillon had no money, and he borrowed a penny of Long, to pay for this pot, he wanted to borrow some money of me, but I knew him to be a very bad principled man, he borrowed sixpence of me some time before, and I knew he would not pay me; we then got over to Mrs. M'Clough's, to have a parting pot, he then offered to wrestle with this Long for a crown, he pulled his handkerchief off and opened his bosom, he came to me again, and said, lend me a shilling, I said no, I will buy an article at prime cost, but I will not lend you any thing, he then said he thought he could lick me, and another that was there, I said I did not think he could; words arose and we had some blows, he then said he had enough, he got up and took his box, and staggered out; I saw him no more that night, I waited and had something to drink with my friends, and was talking how likely it was he should lose his box; we said to one another, if he does lose it, he cannot blame us, for we persuaded him to leave it at Mr. Charlton's and Mrs. M'Clough's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. When he staggered out he was very drunk and very quarrelsome? - He was, I was pretty sure he never would be able to carry his box home, the next morning he came to enquire for me, he stood up against the table, he looked very muddy and dirty, I asked him how he did, he said very middling, says he, do you know any thing about my box or watch, he did not mention any money, I told him I knew nothing of it, that he had it safe when he left me, I directly asked him if he was robbed of it, no says he; I asked him two or three times, and he positively declared he was not robbed; if you was not robbed of it says I, Mr. Dillon, I will take the trouble of going to the houses that we use in Wapping and enquire for it, he said he had left it somewhere, or lost it in the street by tumbling about, but he was so drunk he could not tell where, I am positive sure of what I say upon my oath; we went out of my landlord's house with intention to look for this box, we first went to the chandler's shop in St. Catherine's-lane, she said he had not left his box there for three or four months, we then went to St. Catherine's-stairs, sometimes he went with me into the houses, and sometimes not, I dare say we went into one hundred and fifty different houses to enquire for his box, in several of these houses the people asked him how he lost it, he always declared he was not robbed of it, but he was so drunk he could not recollect what was become of it, but he always positively said he was not robbed; I went with him to King James's stairs into this house where we had quarrelled the night before, I treated him there to a pint of beer, the woman asked us whether we had come to wrangle again; I told her no, but Mr. Dillon had lost his box, says I, I should have thought he was robbed of it, but he says not, he put his hands up and declared he was not robbed of it, we went to two or three houses further, and he declared the same thing; we went to Mr. Long's there he said the same, then we were going home and had given it up, I said to him, now I do not know what to say in this matter, I will tell you what I would have you do, get a parcel of bills printed, about a thousand, and offer a small reward of about five shillings, and if any honest person has it, they will return it to you; as we were going home, says he, is there no ditch here, I believe I must have fallen into a ditch.</p>
               <p>Did he talk of being thrown into a ditch? - I am confident he said just as I say, that he did not know but he had fell into the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140013"></xptr> ditch by lying so muddy; I took him to the New Cut that leads from Wapping Church to Ratcliffe-highway, one walked on one side, and one on the other, by and by I went to a place where I thought the ice was disturbed, says I, perhaps your box is here, now lend me your stick and I will pok all about, and feel, but I could not find his box in the ditch; after that he was going homewards, and the next day I went to the Justices, and there he said he had been robbed, I asked him why he did not tell me so the day before, he said he did not recollect himself, and could not tell me so because he did not recollect himself; he told me if I did appear to say he had a licence, but he had not taken any out this year, for he had not sold any goods this year; and then he said do not appear at all, but if you do, you may say you heard me say that I was way-laid by three sea-saring men; I told him I did not know I should appear at all in the matter, though it intention was to attend.</p>

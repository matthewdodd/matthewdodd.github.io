On the 10th of July I met the prisoner—I did not know him before, but he asked me for a cup of tea, and I took him home to give him one—he sat down on one chair, and I on the other—he then said, "I shall kill you"—he was <hi rend="italic">fresh</hi> with liquor—I said, "If you talk like that you had better go out"—he then jumped up, pulled a pair of scissors out of his waistcoat pocket, and ran them into my tide, but not very deep—the blood came—the doctor attended me ten days—the police<lb></lb>man took the prisoner in my house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Benjamin Palmer. I was there when the prosecutor brought the prisoner in to have tea—Leary began the quarrel, and Eldridge told him he had better go out—I turned towards a cupboard, and I heard Eldridge say, "If you mean that, I will give you something"—I then turned, and they were fighting—that was after the blow was struck—I saw some blood come from Eldridge, but not a great deal.</p>

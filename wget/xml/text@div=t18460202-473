                  </hi>. I am constable of the London Docks. On the morning of the 9th of Jan. I opened the gate at Wapping at seven o'clock, and found the prisoner inside, waiting to be let out—this coffee-pot stood by his side—he took it up, and was going out with it—I asked him for the pass—he said it did not require a pass, he had brought it from his own ship, the <hi rend="italic">Caroline</hi>—that the ship and pot were his own property—I said I did not believe it, and if he brought a regular pass I would allow it to go—he said, "Why are you so particular as to stop me with it?"—I said, "I will allow you to go out, but when you return you cannot come in again"—he said, "What authority have you to stop me?"—I said, "The order of my superintendent"—I said, "I think your name is Bridge?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "You have been convicted before"—he said, "Oh I will soon set the matter right; I will take the vessel out of the dock in the course of the day"—I allowed him to depart—he came back and said, "I want the coffee-pot, I have a bill and receipt"—I said if he would satisfy me it was his I would allow him to go—he then said I was mistaken, his name was not Bridge—I en<lb></lb>quired of the agent, and found he was ship-keeper of the <hi rend="italic">Caroline</hi>—I went on board, and the prisoner came on board while I was rummaging the vessel—I took him into custody.</p>

               <p>am master of the brig Caroline, which laid in the London Docks some weeks ago. I put the prisoner in charge of the brig as ship-keeper, at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a day—a coffee-pot is missing from the pantry of the ship—this is very much like it—it is the same size and shape exactly—it does not leak, and does not want repairing.</p>

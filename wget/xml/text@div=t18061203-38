               <p>Q. The cooperage is about the distance of twenty paces from the soap house, and it was the prisoner's business to be in the cooperage. - A. It was; and without he was called to the soap house, he had no business there.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 4th of November, had you made any observations with respect to the soap, in the soap house. - A. Yes, he used to lay his clothes sometimes in empty hogsheads, and sometimes in an orange chest.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any soap in the orange chest. - A. I did; between two and three o'clock, I found two pieces of soap about four inches long; about five minutes afterwards I found two whole cakes added.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Shelton your clerk go with you the second time. - A. Yes, I handed them over to him, he marked the smaller pieces with his nail across; and the two whole cakes he drove two pegs in, and then we left them exactly as we found them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner apply in the course of that afternoon for leave to go out. - A. Yes, he wanted to go an hour before his time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him permission to do so. - A. We did; when he went out my father stopped him, I saw him brought back.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go back to where the soap was put. - A. I did, I found one piece marked with the cross gone.</p>

            ; examined by Mr. Gurney. When the prisoner went out in the afternoon you stopped him. - A. Yes, I watched for him at the window. Instead of going out the usual way he struck through the private house, I directly went out into the street, laid hold of him and brought him into the accompting house; I asked him what he had got, he said I was very welcome to search, I found that he had a slit in his coat, it could not be called a pocket, it would hold only half a cake of soap, I asked him if that was all, he said he had got no more, there was half a cake of soap on the other side of his coat, I felt down his breeches, there was another piece of soap; then he begged me to forgive him.</p>

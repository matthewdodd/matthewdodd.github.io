             (pointing to Clarke) - he was one of them; three men and three women came - the same young man paid me for the lodging; I never saw either of them before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you recollect being before the Magistrate on the 19th of January? A. Yes - I pointed out the same man who gave me the watch as I have to-day; I did not call him by any name - I did not know their names; he was in a flannel dress before the Magistrate, as he is now - their dresses are different now to what they were then, but he had the flannel dress on; what I stated before the Magistrate was read over to me - I made my mark to it; they paid 1s. 6d. for their lodging.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, at Kingston upon Thames. On the 12th of January, a silver watch was pawned with me, in the name of Thompson; the Allens are so much alike I cannot swear to them, but I believe it is the one in the black coat (Joseph) - he was alone; to the best of my belief he was the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is yours an extensive business? A. Pretty good; I was asked about the watch about a week after - there was nothing particular in the transaction; I am almost certain it was Joseph, but the brothers are so much alike I cannot swear it.</p>

            . I am a watchmaker, and live at Ripley. The two prisoners Allens came into my shop, and of the shortest one I bought a watch, which I produce, and is a tortoiseshell watch; I gave him 8s. for it - they were both together; I cannot be certain of the day of the week, but it was the 16th of January I am positive.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When were you asked about it? A. On Thursday, the 31st, Mr. Berry and a Policeman came to my shop - Allens were not more than five minutes with me; I never saw them before to my knowledge - I swear to their persons; I now recollect it was on the 9th instead of the 16th; I am quite certain of that.</p>

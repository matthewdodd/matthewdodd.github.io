No, the following morning; I saw the prisoner on the 11th of April, just as I was leaving the shop at night - these things were all taken between nine and twelve o'clock- we lost twenty-five pairs of shoes at least; they all laid in one corner of the window - the bar was taken down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were not the shoes separate? A. Yes; they might have been taken at different times, or a person might have swept them off altogether - I saw her come into the shop after eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>CHARLES MAYO. I saw the prisoner's husband last night, and told him the trial would come on, and very likely he would be wanted; I believe they had a little quarrel - he is much given to drinking, and had been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110100"></xptr>drinking that night: the prisoner has one child at the breast, and has two more.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a drover, and live at 16, Norfolk-terrace, Cubitt's-town, Poplar—on 26th May, I had 193 sheep at the New Metropolitan Market, all marked with my own mark—I saw them into the market—I counted them through—they were penned at 5 o'clock, and I missed three about thirty minutes past 5—I received information, and went to a butcher, named Sayers, in East-lane, Walworth, where I saw the two carcases of mutton; the right bind leg of each sheep had been broken—I afterwards went into the back premises, where I found the skins of two oat of the three sheep—I know them by the marks—they were worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had to pay for them—they were intrusted to me to keep—they belonged to Mr. Charles Christian, of Oldham, Hants—they could not by any means have got their legs broken in the pen—there are slaughter-houses at the market called casualty sheds—I have known the prisoner three or four years—he has had no dealings with me—there were several other carcases at Sayers' shop, but of an inferior description—I gave Sayers in custody on the Tuesday—the prisoner is a drover—he had no authority from me to dispose</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employment of Mr. Fairey, a master slaughterman—he has a slaughter-house in Old Smithfield, and one at the New Cattle-market—on 26th May, I saw the carcases of two sheep that had been dressed, hanging up in the slaughter-house—the prisoner came in there about half-past 9—I was having my breakfast, and he looked at the carcases—one of them had the appearance of having been dead eight or nine hours, I should say—one was a very nice sheep—they did not seem fellow sheep, but quite odd—the leg of one was broken, and the fellow leg on the other was very much bruised, as if it had been crushed under the cart—the leg of each sheep was broken; I think it was the right leg; but I know the left leg of one was very much bruised—I said to the prisoner, "Are those your two sheep?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "What do you ask for them?"—he said, "I have just sold them to Mr. Sayers"—he is a man about the market that purchases a great quantity of sheep—I did not see them taken away—I have seen the prisoner about the market as a drover—I have not seen him there since that—to the best of my belief; these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the skins of those sheep—they were the only two sheep at our slaughter-house that day—the prisoner has not brought sheep there before to my knowledge; but I am not always there—I have never seen him bring sheep when I have been there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

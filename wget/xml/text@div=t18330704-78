               <p>THOMAS WHITE DAVIES. I live in Albany-street, Regent's-park. On the 29th of June I was at the <placeName id="t18330704-78-crimeloc393">Court of Common Council</placeName>

            . I am an officer. I went into the Court, and my attention was called to a particular place, where I saw the prisoner; I watched him for twenty minutes - the prosecutor was standing there, and part of his handkerchief was out of his pocket - the prisoner closed upon him, then drew back, and I seized him; I took him out of Court, and found two handkerchiefs in his left coat pocket - the prosecutor claimed this one.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Lee, of Wal worth-road—on the Saturday night previous to 29th October, between 12 and 1, I went into a pie-shop in the Walworth-road with my husband—there were a great many people there, and Jones came up and asked my husband to pay for a pie for him—he did so, and Jones gave it to Ricketts—I then went out, and returned to get three pies to take home—Jones and Ricketts were then in the shop with other people—I changed a shilling to pay for the pies, and put the change into my purse and into a bag which I had—I had then 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my purse, and eight duplicates—I left the shop, and was going home round by St. Peter's church—I had passed the church when Jones came up to me and said, "Did I ask your husband to pay for a pie for me?"—I said, "What did you say?" and I had no sooner spoken than he took me by the waist and the forehead and threw me on the ground—it was done so suddenly that I could not discern who the others were all round me, but I saw four of them run—I cannot say who they were exactly—I am sure Jones was the man who threw me on the ground—I lost my purse and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and eight duplicates—my bag was gone—I met a constable, and went with him back to the pie-shop.</p>

I keep a pie-shop, at 23, Beckford-row, Walworth-road—on the Sunday morning in question, about half-past 12 or a quarter to 1, I saw the prosecutrix and her husband in my shop, and all the prisoners—the prisoners appeared to be friendly, and they were in company together—I knew them as customers—I had seentogetherbefore—Ricketts and Amos came in together first, and Jones came in afterwards—we were very busy at the time—there was an altercation about paying for a pie—the prosecutrix and her husband went out first, and soon afterwards the prose<lb></lb>cutrix</p>

On the morning of Sunday, 29th October, the prosecutrix made a complaint to me, and I went to the pie-shop with her—I got some information there, in consequence of which I went to No. 6, Richmond-street, at about 1/4 past 2, and apprehended Jones—a description had been given to me—he came to the door to me—I told him he was charged with being concerned with three others in knocking a woman down and robbing her, in Liverpool-street, Walworth—he said, "All right, I will go with you. I did not do it, but I know all about it; I saw it done"—I then took him to the station—he said, "I did not do it, Frank Amos and Ricketts <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it"—on Monday morning, about 2 o'clock, I went to Foster's-buildings and took Ricketts and Amos—they were together in bed.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman P</hi> 194.) On Sunday morning, 29th October, I saw Ricketts and Amos in the Westmoreland-road, about 5 minutes before I—I knew them—I had seen them going home together before that—they were on their way home then—on Sunday night I received a description of the prisoners—I went with the last witness to take Ricketts and Amos—I told Ricketts, in Amos's presence, that he was charged with assaulting and robbing the prosecutrix of a bag and 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I told him the time of night—he said, "I don't know anything about it, but we were there about that time"—I afterwards said to him, "I suppose you are aware that Evan Jones is in custody for it"—he said, "Oh <hi rend="italic">Evey</hi> is in custody, is he, and he is <hi rend="italic">rounding</hi> on us."</p>

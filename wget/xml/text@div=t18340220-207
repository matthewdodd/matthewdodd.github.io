            . I am a ward-officer - on the afternoon of the 19th of February, I saw the prisoner in <placeName id="t18340220-207-crimeloc1182">Star-alley, Fenchurch-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q. In what part of the street was it? A. Star-alley - I took the handkerchief out of the prisoner's pocket - I was within a yard of him - the prisoner and his companions were walking together - one of them had his arm on the prisoner's shoulder - I cannot say which it was, they walked so close together.(George Coad, shoemaker, No. 28, Phoenix-street, Somers Town, gave the prisoner a good character.)</p>

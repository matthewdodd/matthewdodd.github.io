             KING. I was on duty. I saw the prisoners about three o'clock, in Smithfield, following the prosecutor about, and talking to him - I knew them well, and after going off duty in the evening, the prosecutor came to the Compter, and said he had been robbed; I and another officer went into several public-houses, and found the prisoners at the Crown, drinking gin - we took them to the Compter, and the prosecutor pointed them out to us; he was quite sober - I found nothing on them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner SHAW. Q. Did he not say he was robbed in a public-house in Smithfield? A. No; I did not say I thought I had not got the right girls.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CADMAN. Between four and five o'clock the prosecutor came to the Compter, and said he had been robbed - he was perfectly sober.</p>

            . I never said I was robbed in a public-house, or in Smithfield; I stated what I have here.</p>
               <p>SMITH'S Defence. I went into the Cooper's Arms public-house to have a pint of beer; the man was there having gin-hot - he asked me to drink, which I did; he had a glass of rum and water, two quarterns of gin, and a pint of porter - he came out of the door, and went away with two girls.</p>
               <p>SHAW'S Defence. I was going along, when he asked me to have something to drink; he treated us with liquor - I took this young woman to have some; he wished us good bye, and went off with two young women; we went into a house to have a pint of beer - the officer came in and took us; he said he was robbed there - the landlady can prove he was not.</p>
               <p>MARY WILLIAMS. My husband keeps the Cooper's Arms public-house. The prosecutor and some girls were drinking there on the evening of the 19th - that is all I know; I do not know how long he was in the house - my niece served them; they had a pint of hot beer with a quartern of gin in it, and a glass of gin and water between them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a scrivener, at 57, Bishopsgate Street—on 24th January the prisoner, who is a farmer, and who had previously applied" to me for a loan of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I refused, came to me and said that the past winter had been very bad, and he required money to buy extra stock—I asked him the amount of his debts and liabilities—he said that hey did not exceed 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him he would have to make a declaration before a Commissioner, as he had done before, he agreed, and the form was filled up in my office—I then sent him with a clerk to a Commissioner—this is it—it was brought back to me signed—the body of it is my clerk's writing, and the signature is in the prisoner's. <hi rend="italic">The defendant's promissory note was here put in, dated 29th January</hi>, 1877, for 133<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., <hi rend="italic">payable by ten consecutive monthly instalments, the whole mount to become due immediately in default of any one payment.

I then gave him this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) for 80?. and a receipt for 20?. more, which he owed me, making together 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I afterwards received notice. of the prisoner's petition for liquidation. (<hi rend="italic">This was in the Oxford County court, dated May</hi>, 1877, <hi rend="italic">and stating that his debts amounted to</hi> 1,100?.) I heard the defendant examined—he said that his debt to his sister, who sided with him, was out of date by the Statute of Limitations, being ore than six years old, but that he was not aware whether he had paid interest on it—a certificate that she was too old to attend was produced the police-court—he acknowledged that the bulk of his other debts had accrued before the end of last year—a bill of sale was given as collateral purity if the promissory note was not paid—that bill of sale has proved</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been a scrivener two years—I succeeded Mr. Muir—the prisoner lives at Stow-in-the-Wold; he is an innkeeper and farmer—the first amount was obtained from Mr. Muir and myself jointly there was an agreement between us, I do not know whether you call i' a partnership—the prisoner did not say that he was unable to pay me—I charged him 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the transaction—I gave him the statutory declaration to read as I had done on previous occasions—it was my invariable rule—the matter did not require a solicitor, but I had a solicitor before I took out the summons for fraud at Oxford, Mr. Newton, of Moorgate Street—I swear that I believed Oxford was the proper place to take it out—I did not tell the prisoner I would have him up at the Old Bailey, or anything of the kind—I never saw him after the summons was taken out at Oxford—I do not know Mr. Higgins, the receiver under the bankruptcy—I remember the gentleman who was in possession—that is him—I did not say in his presence to the defendant "Unless you come to some arrangement I shall have you arrested and tried at the Old Bailey and make an example of you"—the defendant's sister has never been examined—I first, became acquainted with the defendant in March, 1876, when I took a transfer of Mr. Muir's portion of the business, and then I had the whole of the business—I said before the Magistrate "In March, 1876, I and Mr. Muir made an advance of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid"—the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the consideration given for the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I also said "A bill of sale was given for the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; a statutory declaration was then made; 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid off, leaving a balance of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that was the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for which the receipt was given"—the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not an old affair, it was just due at the time—the prisoner asked me not to register the bill of sale and I said that I would not—before I went to see him in May he wrote to me, when he was in difficulties—I have not got the letter—he had paid me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before that, but that was upon another note—I went to see him on 3rd May, and he said that the Sheriff had seized his horses—I did not suggest that his brother should become security for him—I was the only dissenting creditor as far as I know—the declaration and the whole of the expenses were included in the 133<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and my two journeys to Oxford to see him, and everything else—the summons at Oxford was dismissed for want of jurisdiction; a person was sent to Oxford twice—Mr. Muir has no interest in it now.</p>

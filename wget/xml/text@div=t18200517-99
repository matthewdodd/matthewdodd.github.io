I sleep on the second floor, and the prisoner used to call me in the morning. I was determined to mark my money, which I did, on the edge. On the 14th, I went to an officer, and shewed him the money I had marked; and, on the 15th, on going to bed, I had fourteen shillings and four sixpences, all marked, in my breeches-pocket. Next morning he called me, as usual, about half-past three o'clock. I did not examine my pocket then, but went up to clean myself about eight o'clock, and three shillings were gone. The officer came about half-past nine. When the prisoner came in, I told him to go into the parlour, which he did. I said I suspected he had taken money out of my pocket. He said directly, that I must be mistaken. I had paid none of the money away. The officer said he must search him. He said,</p>
               <p>"I will show you all the money I have." He pulled 4 s. 6 d. from his pocket, and three of my marked shillings were among them. I can swear it was safe when I went to bed.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 14th, Mr. Jack showed me the money he had marked, and on Tuesday morning I went to his house. He brought the prisoner into the parlour. I said I must search him - he threw three shillings and three sixpences on the table. The three shillings had the mark on them which Mr. Jack had shown me. The prisoner insisted on their being his own.</p>

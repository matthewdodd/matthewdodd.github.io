                  </hi>. I lived at 7, George Street, Hanover Square, when these proceedings were taken—I am the widow of Colonel Borradaile—we resided in India six years—I have been married twenty-two years—I first became acquainted with the prisoner in 1864, through an advertisement, and knowing that she was perfumer to the Queen, I saw her twice in 1864, at her shop in New Bond Street—in 1864 she merely gave me some powders and two or three boxes of soap, for which I paid her—I saw her twice in 1865—in May, 1866, I remember going to her shop, and having a conversation with her—she asked how much money I had to spend—I said I should not spend 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but as I had then paid her about 170<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I hoped she would do something with my skin—I paid that in 1864 and 1865—she told me to call again, and in two or three days I called—the second time I called, she told me that a gentleman loved me; Lord Ranelagh—I was very much surprised, and asked where he had seen me—she</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186808170071"></xptr>
               <p>said before my marriage and after; that he had seen me very lately, and she would introduce me to him in a few days, next time I called—she said he was a very good man, and a rich man—nothing, at that time, was said about marriage—I saw her in two or three days afterwards, in the small sitting-room, and she said, "I will now introduce you to the man who loves you"—she opened the door, and said, "Lord Ranelagh"—her daughter was there, as was also Madame Valeria, a Russian woman—I said to him, "Are you Lord Ranelagh?"—he replied, "Yes, and here is my card"—he handed me the card; I looked at it and returned it to him—the gentleman I then saw was the same I recognize in Court as Lord Ranelagh—after he had given me his card, Madame Rachel closed the door again—on my returning to her room, she said he would make me a good husband—on several occasions I saw him there, and once to speak to—at the second interview Madame Rachel told me to go and take a bath, and return to her—I went to Mrs. Hicks's, Davies Street, took a bath, returned to the shop, and found Lord Ranelagh was there—she said, "I must again introduce you to Lord Ranelagh"—he made a bow to me—I forget the conversation; it was not much—she again said he would make me a good husband, and asked me if I would like to have him for a husband—I thought, as he was a good man and a rich man, and being in a good posi<lb></lb>tion, it would be a good thing for my daughter—she will be eighteen in October—the prisoner said he fancied me; she very often told me that—about the end of May, or the beginning of June, she said it was necessary that I should be made beautiful for ever, before I married Lord Ranelagh; for if I was not, it would only be money thrown away, and I should be sent into the country, where I should never be seen—I think she said he also wished it, but I cannot be sure about that—I was to pay 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for being made beautiful for ever—at that time I had money in the Funds—I have since known Mr. Haynes, a solicitor—the prisoner introduced me to him in June, after the conversation about being made beautiful for ever—Mr. Haynes and Madame Rachel accompanied me to the City in a carriage—she said he was a solicitor, but did not say at that time he was her solicitor—I went to the City to sell out the money I had in the Funds, amounting to 1300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I sold for 963<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—money was very scarce, and many banks had failed at that time, and I lost by selling out—when I came from the City I went to Madame Rachel's sitting-room with Mr. Haynes—I told him I was sorry I had sold out the money—the 963<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was net handed over to me; I never had any of it—I gave this order to him—it is not my handwriting, but it is signed by me—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "June, 1866. Mr. Haynes, I request you to pay Madame Rachel 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on account of 963<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received this day. M. T. Borradaile.")—That was given to Mr. Haynes at her shop, in her presence—the receipt produced is in my writing—it was written in Mr. Haynes's office, but I don't know when—Madame Rachel was there, too, and made the mark at the bottom—he was sitting in such a position as to see it written—Madame Rachel told me how to word it, because I did not know what was to be done—I think Mr. Haynes supplied the stamp—(<hi rend="italic">This was a receipt for</hi> 800<hi rend="italic">l., a balance of</hi> 1000<hi rend="italic">l. received from witness, for bath preparations, soaps, powders, sponges, perfumes, and attendance, to be continued till Mrs. Borradaile was finished by the process</hi>.)—I had received no considera<lb></lb>tion whatever for that 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., beyond what I had previously paid for in 1864 and 1865—Madame Rachel said we were to be married by proxy—she said it was to be done by letter writing; that she had married two parties before</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186808170072"></xptr>
               <p>by proxy, and that I should be the third—about a month after that receipt was signed I began to receive letters—I received some of them before the jewellery was ordered, which was to cost 1400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Madame Rachel said the letters would only be signed "William," in case they should be left about—I knew at that time what Lord Ranelagh's Christian name was; it is Thomas—I received this letter from Madame Rachel, who said it had come from Lord Ranelagh, and she gave me a vinaigrette and a pencil-case, stating they had belonged to Lord Ranelagh's mother: "Mount-street. My only dearly beloved Mary, The little perfume-box and pencil-case belonged to my sainted mother, she died with them in her hand. When she was a school-girl it was my father's first gift to her. Granny has given the watch and locket to me again. Your coronet is finished, my love. Granny said you had answered my last letter, but you had forgotten to send it. I forgot yesterday was Ash Wednesday. Let old Granny arrange the time, as we have too little to spare. My adored one, what is the matter with the old woman; she seems out of sorts? We must keep her in good temper for our own lakes. She has to manage all for us, and I should not have had the joy of your love had it not been for her, darling love. Mary, my sweet one, all will be well in a few hours. The despatches have arrived. I will let you know all when I hear from my heart's life. Bear up, my fond one, and I shall be at your feet, those pretty feet that I love, and you may kick your old donkey. Two letters, naughty little pet, and you have not an<lb></lb>swered one. You are in sorrow about your brother. With fond and devoted love, yours till death, William."—Madame Rachel was "Granny"—I also received this letter from Madame Rachel's grand-daughter in her pre<lb></lb>sence—<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "My own dear Mary. Granny tells me that you were to be with me at the Scotch Stores this afternoon. I waited outside 7, George Street for two hours. I give you one warning; if you listen to your family, I will leave England for ever. Mary, my love, I have to play a double game to save your honour and my own. It is now 6 o'clock, and I am wet through, walking up and down George Street I have been asked all manner of questions. You must write and tell Lewis &amp; Lewis you do not want them to interfere further in your affairs, as we are betrayed; and think of your position and name, and think of your daughter. Cope is at the bottom of all this. Mary, for the last time, choose between your family and me. If you value your own life or mine do not admit Smith; he is the paramour of your greatest enemy. My heart's life, I will be at All Souls' to<lb></lb>morrow. I was at Randall's on Saturday last—a dirty corncutter's. If ever you go there again I shall sense to love you if I can. If I call on you with a gentleman be sure to deny all knowledge of me, as otherwise we are lost. It is your name I study. With fond undying love, your devoted, William" I received one letter after that—my family had been communicated with, and I had consulted Messers. Lewis &amp; Lewis—that letter was received after I had parted with all my money and securities—Mr. Randall is mentioned in it; he is a chiropodist, I had called on him one day—he advised me to go to Lewis &amp; Lewis—almost all the letters were in a different hand writing—every letter I received I supposed came from Lord Ranelagh—Madame Rachel told me he had hurt his arm and could not write very well, and that Stephens, his servant, wrote some of them—I also received this letter from Madame Rachel—"My own Mary, I will be with you to-morrow as soon as possible. Yours until death. Edward. In haste. My dearest beloved, write me a line (kisses)."—I remarked to her that one of the letters</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186808170073"></xptr>
               <p>was signed "Edward," and she replied that was necessary, lest I should lose or leave them about—this letter I received in August, before parting with the 1400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—"Mount Street. My darling Mary, my own pet, do what I ask. I wish you to burn the letters; and all you do is I dare say for the best. My darling pet love, many thanks. I know you will keep your promise. My sweet love, I will devote my love and all my life to you. I cannot express my love to you. I cannot find words to do so. My devotion in years shall tell my heart's fond love for you. Darling sweet one, I will tell you all at your feet. My own loved Mary, with fond devotion, ever yours, with lots of kisses. William." On the envelope "With love and kisses"—I wrote answers to the letters, which answers Madame Rachel always dictated in her sitting-room—she always kept the letters, saying she would give them to Lord Ranelagh—this is another letter: "My dearly beloved Mary, I was in hopes I should have had the pleasure of seeing you this day, but I am doomed to disappointment. I hear you are grieving, my own darling pet. Am I the cause? I would rather be shot than cause you one minute's pain. Do you regret the confidence you have placed in me! You say you have no desire to reside at Cheltenham again, my love. You make what arrangements you think proper, and I am satisfied. I thank you, my love, for going to Covent Garden, Let me know by return, my pet, when you have finished with Mr. Haynes, as I find it impossible to wait any longer. Hope deferred makes the heart sick. I hear all is arranged for the country, my own darling love. Do not let me have to chide you. Only say what you require, and your slightest wish shall be obeyed. With fond devoting love, you affectionate and loving William.—I re<lb></lb>marked that the spelling of the letters was bad, and she said that his servant used to write them—it must have been in July, August, and Sep<lb></lb>tember that those letters were written—Madame Rachel had told, me on one occasion that Lord Ranelagh was going to Belgium with the Volunteers—I received this letter from Madame Rachel: "Mount Street My darling Mary, what made you suppose that I would go to Belgium without you? It is cruel of you to think so. But after our disappointment of yesterday I was in hopes that you would have complied with my wishes. I have left the message with Rachel. She told me last night that she ex<lb></lb>pected you there for true to-day. I have called there twice and I find you have not been. You said you would come after church. My own darling I did not go to church this morning, as you know what prevented me from doing so. You must see Rachel to-night, as I may be ordered off by five in the morning. Pray, sweet love, call on her at once. I had rather be shot like a dog than leave England without you. I am half distracted at not finding you. There is no time to lose. Your devoted and loving friend for ever, William"—I also received this from the same source: "My own beloved Mary, Do not upbraid me. Any sacrifice you have made on my account I will not give you cause to regret I am, dunned to death at the thought of 'the bills,' and it all lies under a nutshell. I will show my love for you in such a way that you shall not regret all you have done for me, and I will repay it with love and devotion. See that fellow in Oxford-street, and tell him you will pay him in a day or two, and so you will. I am not angry with you, my own dear love. I will be with you sooner than you think. Your slightest wish shall be obeyed, but I cannot understand why you prefer Mr. H. but I leave all to you. My love, do not get into any mob. I heard you were insulted by a cabman in Oxford Street. I wish I</p>

               <p>had been there. With my fondest love, your devoted and loving William"—That letter was not so early in the correspondence as the others—Madame Rachel told me that a cabman had been rude to me in Oxford Street, but I do not recollect it—Lord Ranelagh's name was mentioned about the cab<lb></lb>man—I also received this letter: "Birdcage Walk. My own dear love. My sweet darling Mary, I called at Rachel's to-day, and she looks as black as thunder. What is it, my sweet love? My own dear one. What you said last night I thought was in joke; is it the bill that has annoyed you? What am I to do? I tell you again and again that you are the only woman I love. You have never been the same to me since you listened to all the slander. What is it you want? Write at once and freely. There should be no disguise, my sweet pet. I love you madly—fondly. Why do you trifle with my feelings, cruel one? Yours ever loving, and most devoted and ever affectionate, William. What have you done to offend Rachel I—That was written about the same time the Volunteers were in Belgium—I think it was a few days before they returned—she would never give me any explanation about the bill—I have seen a man named Bower at her shop; she ordered 380<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of lace of him—she said I should require lace, as all ladies had lace—I have since paid Bower's bill for the lace, but I never saw it—Madame Rachel had it; it was sent to her house—she never told me how much it was—I thought it was about 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have since been sued for it, and was arrested and went to prison—I have paid for it, but I never had a yard of it—this letter also came from Madame Rachel: "Mary, my heart's life, is it your wish to drive me mad? Granny has my instruc<lb></lb>tions; do as she tells you. Four letters, and not one reply; what is the meaning of the delay at the eleventh hour? Granny lent me the money. You shall pay her, my own sweet one. Get the lace to-day. I fear nothing. It will be 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I will explain all to your satisfaction, my own sweet one. I have the acknowledgments for every farthing. Granny is our best friend, go you will find. We cannot do without her until we go away. I have some pretty little things for Florence. Light of my heart, your sister and her husband have behaved very badly towards you, if you knew all. I tell you, love, if you are not careful they will divide us for ever. Go to the Strand to-day. Leave all to me, my own love, and fear nothing. If you have lost all love and confidence in your ugly old donkey, tell me; but this suspense is terrible. I receive letters every day telling me that you only laugh at and show my letters. Mary, beloved one of my heart, do not trifle with me. I love once—I love for ever. Leave all to me. I guard your honour with my life. With fond and devoted love, I am your devoted, William. No. 109, Mount Street"—My daughter's Christian name is Florence—I did not go to the Strand; Madame Rachel asked me to go to many places, but I never went and I did not see Lord Ranelagh there—I think that letter was written about July—I received this letter, having the coronet and Lord Ranelagh's cypher, at the end of January or the beginning of February last year—there was another with a coronet or coat of arms, Madame Rachel took that from me one day, and would not return it—<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "My own dar<lb></lb>ling Mary, Why do you not do as Granny tells you? Why do you put obstacles in the way of your own happiness? Sign the paper; I will pay everything, my own darling love. If you marry, your pension will be stop<lb></lb>ped; therefore it will not matter if you sign the paper, my own heart's life. I will pay everything. Not the value of a coin shall be touched belonging to you or yours. You have ever been loving and confiding. Why do you</p>

               <p>doubt my honour and sincerity? What motive can you have, my love, for retaining those miserable scrawls of mine? I requested you to return them, and for the first time you refused to do so. Mary, love, if you have sent them to your family, say so. If you wanted my life I would lay it down at your own beautiful little feet Mary, you are my joy. I place your letters with your likeness in my bosom every night Granny told me she would arrange everything to our satisfaction. Why need you fear, my own sweet love? I will not believe that you expose my letters. Darling, say you do not, with your own pretty mouth. This week will settle all. Yours de<lb></lb>votedly, William"—I also received this: "My darling Mary, I was ordered off at eleven o'clock last night, but I would not, nor could not, go without you, my love. I would rather resign than leave without you, my love. Granny promised me the trial trip last week; can you possibly arrange it for one night this week, my own sweet love t Mary, darling, my health is giving way under this dreadful suspense. I have offered the money three times over, and they refuse to take it. Granny will see to this, and we can pay her when all is settled. What you have done for me I will double with love and devotion. Get the lace from the Strand; you cannot possibly do without it Granny has behaved very well with regard to money affairs, and she loves you as though you were her own child. The old fox is very clever, and will laugh at the Welshman. If you do not be careful and be guided by me, love's labour is lost. The expenses will be 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I am working day and night to save every shilling for you, my heart's life. Be sure to get the lace. Stephens has got the P.O.O. Have you done with my three letters? With fond and devoted love, I am your devoted, William."—I received that at the beginning of 1807—that means to get the lace out of pawn—Madame Rachel told me that it was pawned—I do not remember whether she said that she had pawned it—I always understood that it was pawned for Lord Ranelagh; Madame Rachel told me so, and she asked me to go to the Strand, and take it out for 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she told me that he had 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of mine, and the expenses would make up the remainder—I asked her what "the expenses" meant, but I never could get anything out of her, or any explanation—this letter is one of the early ones: "Mount Street. My darling Mary, One would suppose that all the people in your house were dead. I was at your door at 4.45, and we could not make anyone hear. My darling, my sweet love, I was more grieved than you were. Will you keep up your spirits? I have been very much fagged, but I leave every<lb></lb>thing to you till to-morrow evening, or Wednesday morning. Did Rachel tell you of the scene to-day? She is an old fox; but you quite understand each other. My own sweet love, I am worried to death about money mat<lb></lb>ters; but it will be all settled before we leave town. With my fondest love, and many kisses. Not one line from you to-day. You must quiet Rachel a little. I think the little lady has been talking to her to-day. I have no wish to offend her, sweet love. I am ever yours, William."—Madame Rachel told me that the little lady was the Duchess of Manchester. I do not like to tell you what she said—these are the envelopes—they all came by hand, and the only one which was dated is not here—I never received any letter by post purporting to come from Lord Ranelagh—Ma<lb></lb>dame Rachel gave me the rest, and once her granddaughter gave me one—I received many more, but Madame Rachel always took them away from me—at the end of July, or beginning of August, she said it was necessary I should have diamonds, as I was to marry Lord Ranelagh—she said the</p>

Borradaile."—After the property was sold Madame Rachel said I should have Lord Ranelagh's mother's diamonds, and she showed me an old-fashioned coronet, which she said should be altered—she said Lord Ranelagh would not allow me to have those ordered from Mr. Pike, but did not say why—I paid 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. forfeit to Mr. Pike for not taking them—I asked what had become of the money I had given for the diamonds, but received no satisfactory answer—some time after that Madame Rachel asked me if I would authorise her to give it to Captain William Edwards, whom I understood to be Lord Ranelagh—that was the name he always went by between us—she said he wanted it for the Volun<lb></lb>teers—she told me that the man adored me, and worshipped the very ground I stood upon, and I authorised her to let him have it—I had given her 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at a time, which she always said was for Lord Ranelagh, for the Volunteers—on one occasion she sent a servant to me, and I gave her 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Madame Rachel having said on the evening before that it was for Lord Ranelagh—in the course of the day I told Madame Rachel that the servant had had the money—she wanted more, but I could not afford to give it her. (<hi rend="italic">Two receipts were here put in for</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">l. each from the witness, signed with Madame Rachel's mark, and dated July</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">st</hi>, 1866, <hi rend="italic">and Oct</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1867)—She always said, "Will you give your dear William some money, say 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or so? I told her I could not afford to give him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was induced to do it from the belief that it was for Lord Ranelagh—Madame Rachel told me she would get the trousseau for my marriage with him—I ordered clothes and lace and jewellery, and the linendraper (Proctor) sent all the articles to Madame Rachel's shop—I have never had one of them, though I paid 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them—she told me some of them would be sent to Folkstone, and some to London, and his servant would call for them—I have often asked for the goods, but have never been able to get them—I have also frequently asked her to return my money—she always replied that I must ask my dear William for it—I had some plate—I took it to Madame Rachel's in a cab, but I walked—it was for the Volunteers; at least, Madame Rachel said so—she had asked me what plate I had, and where it was—I said that a greater part of it was at Cheltenham, where I had been staying for a year—she said I must send for it, and when it arrived she said I had better send it to her—I was induced to send it for one reason, which was, as she said, that we had better have everything together, as we were going to be married—she had some rings of mine—</p>

               <p>they were given to her to pack with the trousseau—the said she would pack everything for the wedding, and I gave them to her—I have often asked her for the plate and rings, but could not get them back—the always said I was to ask the man who loved me for them—I received an account from Mr. Haynes—I think the clerk brought it to Madame Rachel's when I was there one day—I remember✗ Madame Rachel on one occasion bringing me a lighted cigar, and saying Lord Ranelagh's love for me was as warm as that cigar—she said Lord Ranelagh had sent it—I was in the sitting-room, and the said, "Here comes Lord Ranelagh"—I did not see him—I think that was in February, 1867—I remember calling on Mr. Randall, a corn-cutter in Regent Street, and in consequence of a conversation with him I went to Messrs. Lewis &amp; Lewis—I afterwards executed a bond, and gave it to Madame Rachel in December—(<hi rend="italic">A written authority, signed by witness, and addressed to the prisoner, to pay the sum of</hi> 1400<hi rend="italic">l. to Lord Ranelagh or Cap<lb></lb>tain William Edwardes was enquired for.

               <p>merely to get something for an eruption on the face—I only stayed a short time in London in 1864—I never ran up a bill with her, I paid her always at the time for what I had, and I had her receipts, but she took them from me—I received a letter from a person named Richards, in 1864, when I was in Pembrokeshire—I was not residing there under the name of Borradaile Goderich, but he directed so; I was residing at a place called Goderich—I have never gone by any name but Borradaile since I married—I was not a penny in her debt when I heard of the solicitor in the ease—I took two or three baths in 1864—I was introduced to Lord Ranelagh about 18th or 20th May, 1866; I cannot be sure—I never took a bath at Madame's own house, but she had baths in her house; I heard her say so—I never saw a bath there, because I never was anywhere except in the shop and the small sitting room, where there is no room for a bath; but I heard her say that she was giving baths to ladies in her house; she told me so—I heard her say that she had been giving a bath to a lady, and I thought she was in the house—she sometimes said to me, "You shall have a bath here," and after<lb></lb>wards she said, "No, you shall go to the public bath"—I have heard her say that she has been bathing ladies, and I always understood her in her house; I thought she said in her house, but I will not swear it—when, I took baths I took them at the public baths in Davies Street—I was attended there by a matron or superintendent; everything was conducted with pro<lb></lb>priety—but what have baths to do with these swindling transactions?—I was before Mr. Knox as a witness—something was said about baths there—I heard something said about gentlemen being allowed to peep at ladies when they were taking their baths—I think Mr. Cridland had am anonymous letter, telling him so; more than one letter—something was said at Marl<lb></lb>borough Street by my Counsel, about gentlemen being allowed to peep at ladies in baths—I only know what Madame said—I noticed no impropriety when I was in my bath at Davies Street; nothing ever occurred while I was having my bath there to lead me to think that any gentleman was allowed to look at me—I know of no facts for such an assertion only from Madame Rachel herself—I do not know that I am obliged to tell what she said—she never mentioned other ladies; she only mentioned about myself, and I had rather not say what that was—I forget what she said—I will swear she said something about gentlemen seeing me in a bath; she said it about six months ago, or it may be seven—I have not seen her for five months, except at the Police Court—it may have been in February or March—I will not tell you what she said; I really forget; but I recollect she did say something to me about the bath, and she mentioned a person in connection with it—I did not take a bath after that, only at the Argyle, not at Davies Street—I have not been there for a year and a half—I was never told that they would not supply me with a bath there—the last time I saw Mrs. Hicks was at Madame Rachel's shop—she did not say the last time I went that she would not allow me to have a bath after what I had said about peeping at me—I know Mrs. Hicks very well—I saw her here, and spoke to her—she did not refuse to let me have a bath in the house—I am speaking the truth, and I never speak anything but the truth—she did not tell roe that she was instructed by the superintendent not to let me have a bath; nothing of the kind—she may swear it, if she likes—I do not recollect that I ever told anybody that anyone had been peeping at me in my bath—I had rather not swear that I did not; I may have forgotten it—I may have said that some<lb></lb>body</p>

               <p>told me so; I forget all about it—I forget whether I mentioned it to Mrs. Hicks; it is a long time since—I met Lord Ranelagh in 1866, and was a few minutes in the shop in his company—he gave me his card—I swear that; and I looked at it, and gave it back to him—he was talking to two ladies in the shop—I asked him if he was Lord Ranelagh—he said, "Yes, I am; here is my card"—he said nothing more—I regarded him as my in<lb></lb>tended husband after that interview; but she introduced him again to me a few days afterwards—I had a conversation with him, but I forget what it was; there was very little said, and what was said was said by Madame Rachel; it was not about perfumes, or the old china there—Madame Rachel said that there were some theatricals going on at Beaufort House, but they were not good enough for me to go to—he had no particular conversation with me—those are the only occasions when I have been with Lord Ranelagh when any conversation took place—he came up from Aldershot one day to dine at Kuhn's, in Regent Street, and she said, "Lord Ranelagh, go round to the shop door"—I saw him, but did not speak to him—I did not see him go away—I went out at one door, and she was talking to him in the shop—I thought she was coming, too, and I did not want it—I believed then that he was going to marry me; I believed it all along—she told me that he knew me before I was married—I cannot say that I ever saw him in my husband's lifetime—I saw a great number of men—I do not think so—I do not see what my late husband has to do with these swindling transactions—the memory of my husband is sacred; let the dead rest—I resided in Brompton during my married life—my husband may have mentioned Lord Ranelagh's name there; I cannot say—he was ill for some time there—he may have done so, but I forget; it is a long time ago—I had about that time become a mother.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Let that refresh your memory? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have been a very virtuous and prudent woman all my lifetime—a copy of a letter was sent at that time—I know nothing about any unpleasantness with which Lord Ranelagh's name was mentioned; I forget—I cannot swear that I knew Lord Ranelagh by sight at that time—I did not know him when I was in Brompton, or see him at my house—my husband introduced me to no gentlemen at all at Brompton—I cannot tell you whether Lord Ranelagh's name was men<lb></lb>tioned there in connection with a private matter—it was nothing about my child.</p>

               <p>it is all my own hair, and the native colour; there is no improving tint—I have used a little of the <hi rend="italic">Auricanus</hi>—that is hair wash—the letters of William which have been read were, I thought, all from Lord Ranelagh—the first letters were badly spelt, but Madame Rachel told me his servant wrote them for him—I did not believe that an English nobleman would make love through his footman, but she said that he had hurt his arm, and I did not think she would tell me stories—I knew that he was living in London—I look at the Peerage sometimes—Lord Kensington and I are of the same family—I know that Lord Ranelagh's name is the Hon. Thomas Heron Jones, and not William or Edward—I do not remember him at all in my husband's lifetime—I do not know where Birdcage Walk is where this letter is dated from—I do not know whether I have ever walked there; I believe it is somewhere by Buckingham Palace—these letters from William were in 1866 and 1867—I never borrowed a shilling of Madame Rachel—in 1866, when I first had to do with her, I did not know what an I 0 U was—she asked me to put my initials to something, as it was of no conse<lb></lb>quence, and I did it, but I never had a shilling—she got me to sign things—this bill is in my writing.

               <p>Rachel's shop, and he knew I was in bad hands, and that made him come—Madame Rachel told me that I must trust her, and I wrote the letters entirely in consequence of that—I believed her because I did not believe she was such a woman—I mean to tell the Jury that when I wrote that letter I thought I was writing to Lord Ranelagh—this other letter I suppose is my writing: "36, Davies Street, Berkeley Square, Sept. 6th. My dear William, I have just received a letter from my sister, Mrs. Cope, with a postscript from her husband. He says that he will be in town shortly after I receive this. He comes up in consequence of Madame Rachel having sent him the copy of the letter I wrote to you just after they left for North Wales, last Monday. She has exposed the whole affair about the lace, the very thing I did not wish him to know. It was most foolish of her exposing my affairs to my family. She said she did it to prevent my being arrested. This affair has nearly broken my heart. With fondest love, believe me, your affectionate and loving Mary T. Borradaile. P.S. I did not know until this minute that you were ill, or I would not have upbraided you for coldness and unkindness, as I thought that you were neglecting me."—Madame Rachel wrote two or three letters to my family, which they were very much disgusted with—you must ask Mr. Copt about them—I have never seen the lace she ordered for me—this letter looks like my writing—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated September</hi> 12<hi rend="italic">th, and commenced</hi>, "My own dear William, I shall be able to leave town with you to-morrow at any hour you may think proper to appoint;"—<hi rend="italic">it alluded to some neck-ties and socks which she had bought for him, and said</hi>, "Thank goodness they are paid for.")</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Neck-ties and socks for Lord Ranelagh? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I wrote that at her dic<lb></lb>tation; every word—I did not order any shirt fronts of Rogers; Madame Rachel had them brought to the shop—some shirts were brought to Madame's shop—I cannot swear whether I called and ordered them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Going for gentlemen's shirts is a thing a woman does not do every day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think I did—I think I was there and saw some shirt fronts—they were for Lord Ranelagh, to Madame Rachel said—she told me he wanted ties, and shirts, and socks—I really believed that he wanted them, because I had found out that he was not so very rich about that time, and Madame Rachel said that he would like me to select them—I recollect going to the shop—I forgot it when you first asked me—I do not know whether I had this bill to Mrs. Colonel Alfred Borradaile—I do not recollect having seen it—I know nothing of these shirts being taken to my lodgings in Davies Street—I was at 28, George Street when they were ordered—I gave Rogers an address at my lodgings, and Madame Rachel was present when I did it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now I will call your attention to this letter: "Sept 13. My own dear William, I shall see Mrs. Lilley as you desire. She will no doubt be of service to us. I am sorry that her son is ill. I am told that it was in consequence of your putting yourself into such a passion this morning. You know there are such things as talking birds. My darling, I was very sad this morning. I feel better now, since you tell me we shall leave Charing Cross early to-morrow. Will that morrow ever come? To me it seems an age. There are a few things of consequence that Rachel has to get for me this evening that I should like to have before I leave London. I send you what you ask for, though I frankly tell you that I did not intend giving you any more until we went away, but it seems that you know the over<lb></lb>land route to my heart It is of no use to regret. I find it hard to deny you anything. You wish me to write a line to Mr. Moon. I will do it; it shall</p>

With fondest love, believe me, your affectionate and loving Mary Tucker Borradaile." <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never remember writing that—I have been the overland route to India—I may have thrown in a word now and then in the composition—Mr. Moon is a solicitor—he is not solicitor to Mr. Cope—I was at Mr. Moon's with Mr. Cope, and was asked to tell who dear William was—at first I said that I would not tell—Mr. Cope knew about the marriage with Lord Ranelagh—I only refused to take any proceedings against Madame Rachel because I thought I should get my clothes; I thought I would wait—I did not know what to do at that time—I forget whether I said that I would not sanction any proceedings against Madame Rachel; my brother-in-law will tell you. (<hi rend="italic">Another letter was here read, from the witness to Dear William, dated September, stating that she was very miserable, but that his letter had made her much happier, and allud<lb></lb>ing to having travelled with him</hi>)—I never travelled with Lord Ranelagh, or any man except my husband—Madame Rachel introduced a lady to me as Lord Ranelagh's sister—(<hi rend="italic">Another letter, dated October</hi> 6, 1866, <hi rend="italic">was put in, addressed</hi> "My own dear William," <hi rend="italic">and contained the following</hi>:—"I am sorry that you are ill." "I am informed that you are now, and have been, keeping a woman with my money." "It is well known in Portsmouth that I have been living with you for some months; you cannot wonder at that when you consider the life we have been leading?" "Am I to believe that the woman you travelled with, and whom you introduced me to as your sister, was your mistress?" "It is well known in Pembrokeshire that I have been living with you some months")—When I wrote that letter, I thought I was writing to Lord Ranelagh—I cannot remember that letter at all—I remember Madame Rachel introducing me to a woman in her shop, who she said was Lord Ranelagh's sister—I can swear that every word of that was written by Madame Rachel's dictation; she told me to trust her, and I should never repent it—(<hi rend="italic">Letter continued</hi>: "I am not surprised at you for<lb></lb>getting me, as I have forgotten myself")—I have never done anything improper; I have been a virtuous woman all my life—I wrote to the Plough, at Cheltenham, to engage a bed for Lord Ranelagh and myself, when we were married—(<hi rend="italic">Letter continued</hi>: "You may remember that I am the widow of a Colonel, and though I have disgraced myself and my family, by having anything to do with you, I am still far more humiliated by being introduced to such people as you associate with. I have not one person in London to speak to, and dare not return to Wales, but can live in Paris on my pension")—When I wrote that, I thought, on my oath, that I was writing to Lord Rane<lb></lb>lagh—Mr. Cope was never at Rachel's but once—she did not, in his presence, upbraid me with spending money on a lover, paramour, nor on anyone—no one's name was mentioned but Lord Ranelagh's—she did not charge me with squandering my money—she did not, in my brother-in-law's presence, say that I was spending my money on a man who I ought not to be associated with, not Lord Ranelagh at all; my brother-in-law will contradict it—nothing was ever said about my wasting my money—we went first to Madame Rachel's, and afterwards to Mr. Moon's—I was never in company with Lord Ranelagh at Cheltenham, or at all—a man at the corner of High Street, Cheltenham, cut my hair once or twice—Madame Rachel told me that Lord Ranelagh used to be shaved by that barber—this is one of my unfortunate letters: "Oct 18, 1867. My own dear William, It was very kind of you to take care of my comb and <hi rend="italic">frizzette</hi>, which is my own hair"—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186808170085"></xptr>
               <p>Madame Rachel dictated that—I volunteered to-day that it was my own hair, and I will take my bonnet off and show you.—(<hi rend="italic">Continued</hi>: "The man who keeps the hairdresser's shop at the corner of High Street, Cheltenham, made it for me, the man who used to share you when we were there")—I meant that he shaved Lord Ranelagh—Madame Rachel told me that he was at the Plough Hotel when I was there, when my daughter was at school.—(<hi rend="italic">Letter continued</hi>: "I had more hair on my head than I wanted, my love, therefore I had it cut off.")—This letter is also mine. (<hi rend="italic">This was without date, and was commenced</hi>: "My own dear William, You will see by the enclosed letters that I managed to screen your name; you are quite put aside. Mr. Cridland intends bringing an action against Madame Rachel, not Lord Ranelagh, as poor <hi rend="italic">Tommy</hi> wishes to get into Parliament, and my family are led to believe he has had my money and clothes. Mr. Cridland thinks it would not be kind to expose him. The result will be ruin to me and my daughter. Madame Rachel has a great motive in keeping them, and I am sure she will send them to Mr. Cridland")—Madame Rachel dictated that—I brought an action against her in the Queen's Bench—I do not think she appeared to it. (<hi rend="italic">Letter continued</hi>: "I am very sorry I did not go with you to Hull; I had rather stay in Kentish Town")—I was not going with Lord Ranelagh to Hull, and was never in Kentish Town with him—("I am pretty sure that Madame Rachel gives her money to tell her everything")—she dictated that—this letter was written to Lord Ranelagh—poor Tommy was Lord Ranelagh—I thought I was writing to him when I called him poor <hi rend="italic">Tommy</hi>—I always thought he had my money—I suppose this letter to be mine (<hi rend="italic">This was addressed to dear William, dated</hi> 12<hi rend="italic">th December, and stated</hi>: "Had you married me, as you declared you would do more than a year ago, in the presence of your three sisters and Frank, I should not have written to Cheltenham to prepare the rooms. Remember, I could not be in the same room with you without being married. I wish I had been a little cut-away monkey.")—When I wrote that letter I thought I was writing to Lord Ranelagh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> "I could not be in the same room with you without being married;" did your daughter say that to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have seen very little of her—I think she may have written to me; I think she did write it, and say some<lb></lb>thing of that sort—she was not sixteen then—I wrote all this by Madame Rachel's dictation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> She could not tell you what your daughter had written to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Do you suppose I did not know that without my daughter telling me—how many more things have I put down which are silly and ridiculous?—it requires a very clever person to do with Madame Rachel—this letter if also mine—"Dear Madame Rachel,—I went to Mr. Cridland's yesterday, and to my horror found Lord Ranelagh there. He certainly was intoxioated, and made use of very bad language, &amp;c. I really thought he would have struck me. If he had, Mr. Cridland would have given him in charge. Lord Ranelagh told me that there was a dear William as well as a dear Tommy, which was very cowardly of him; but when he mentioned William's name, I told him he was a liar and a thief. If he forgot he was talking to a lady, I treated him as an unmanly vagabond. M. T. Borradaile."—The greater part of that letter was dictated by Madame Rachel—she not only dictated the letters I wrote to Lord Ranelagh, but letters I wrote to herself—I did call Lord Ranelagh a thief at Mr. Cridland's office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then Madame Rachel did not suggest that letter to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She</p>

               <p>said he had had my money—Lord Ranelagh said that there was a dear William as well as a dear Tommy; but I called him a liar and a thief before that—it was not when he mentioned William's name; I will swear that—Lord Ranelagh was not very complimentary to me, for he called me a liar—I said that dear William and dear Tommy were the same person, and that I knew no one of that name—the first time I heard that Lord Rauelagh denied that he had allowed his name to be mentioned as intending to marry me, was when Mr. Smith, the solicitor, wrote to my mother this year—I did not know, in 1867, that Madame Rachel had told my family that I was in communication with some other person, and that there was no foundation for Lord Ranelagh's attentions to me—she always led me to suppose that he was my affianced husband—that was after Mr. Cope bad been to town in 1867, and much later—besides the letters to Dear William, I wrote others to Dear Tommy, and directed them to Lord Ranelagh, in New Burlington Street—there were a good many letters written to him this year—I wrote three, I think, after I had seen him at Mr. Cridland's office, and told him I did not want to have anything more to say to him, and to give me my clothes and my money—I was at Mr. Cridland's office last about February, I think—he has been very ill, but I think you will see him at this trial—I dare say I wrote a dozen letters to Lord Ranelagh, as my Dear Tommy, up to the end of February—in the beginning of December, a summons was taken out at Marlborough Street Police Court, for some clothes of mine—(<hi rend="italic">The summons was dated</hi>, 3<hi rend="italic">rd December</hi>, 1866, <hi rend="italic">taken out against Sarah Rachel Leverson, for unlawfully detaining certain goods of Mrs. Borradaile's</hi>.)—That was after Mr. Cope had gone back to Wales—Madame Rachel after<lb></lb>wards told me she would arrange it amicably, and the summons was with<lb></lb>drawn—we afterwards had a meeting at Mr. Haynes', with a view to an amicable arrangement—I had not a great deal of correspondence with Mr. Haynes—I wished him to arrange things amicably if he could.</p>

Fortunately I had my veil down, or they would have seen I could not help laughing." "He abused poor old Tommy. I saw him at Rachel's yesterday. I told him, on Satur<lb></lb>day night, that he wanted a wife to look after him, My darling, if you were not so jealous you might trust me with Randall." "I have puzzled the lawyers with my clever little head." "Your sister will send George and little Harriet")—You must ask Madame Rachel who George and little</p>

               <p>Harriet are; I know nothing about them, and never enquired—it was Madame Rachel's suggestion that I had puzzled the lawyers—I believed I was writing all those foolish letters to Lord Ranelagh.</p>

I went there to satisfy my family and to screen you, my love. I did not think Madame Rachel would return to England, as I thought she was going to reside in France, and if Lewis and Lewis write to her she is sure to tell them the truth. With my fondest and dearest love, ever your loving and affectionate, Mary Tucker Borradaile. P.S. I just came out because I did not wish to see Mr. Smith, Lord Ranelagh's solicitor."—"My dear William. My sister and her husband, Mr. and Mrs. Cope, have but just left me. To my great surprise, they called upon me to-night. They came from North Wales, on their way to Scotland. They are staying at Nelson's Hotel, Portland Place; but I would rather be with you. They were very anxious to know what detained me in London, and the name of my lover, and how I had become acquainted with you. I said that you were a friend of my husband's, and that you used to visit us in India, and that you were in the army. They wanted very much to know your name; but I declined to tell them, my love. I wish you had been there, and seen the face I put upon the whole affair. I do not think you would be so angry with me as your unkindness to me leads me to suppose, for refusing to comply with your demand when it was not in my power to do so; and I have never refused you anything that you have wanted. I must see you to-morrow, or you will not see me before I go to Cheltenham, which will be on Monday without fail. We ought to have been there to-day. With fondest love, believe me, your loving Mary Tucker Borradaile. Saturday Morning, September 1."—"7, George Street, Hanover Square, September 26. Dear Rachel, I arrived here between six and seven o'clock yesterday</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186808170094"></xptr>
               <p>evening. I called upon you to-day, but you were engaged. I left a pretty little album with some photographs for your dear little Elsie, and a nice little cross for Leonti. I cannot tell you how grieved I was to hear of your sad accident, and so was my friend William. He will call upon you to-morrow; pray be kind to him for my sake: you know how much I love him, dear Rachel, and I never thanked anyone who would wish to separate me from the only man I love. With kind regards, your sincere friend, Mary T. Borrodaile.")—These two letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are my writing—I did not post them myself—I only wrote one letter, which I posted—I did not post these: "December 3rd, Tuesday evening (<hi rend="italic">addressed to Lord Ranelagh</hi>) My own dear Tom. I feel assured that no one but Mr. Harrison will advise you for your good. I know you love me, but you must remember that you are not the only man who loves me. You may think the Duchess of——very charming; you ought to have found her out by this time. I could have told Mr. Smith a great deal more about money matters. I thought the less I said the better. I have told you over and over again that I would never deny you a favour. Why did you show my letter to Mr. Smith? And you know the letter was never intended to be posted. It was very unkind of you to tell Mr. Smith that you did not know me. You have forgotten that you saw me in my bath in Davies Street. If I had taken Mr. Smith to Mrs. Hicks, she would have told him a different story. If you allow a man like Mr. Smith to speak about me in a lawyer's office, that does not show much friendship on your part. If you had not shown my letter to Mr. Smith, no one would have been at all the wiser. Your friendship, indeed! I should be very sorry to serve you as you have served me. You say you are a woman's friend. It makes me believe what they say—you are a general lover. Not that I ever sought your love—far from it. It really is unkind of you, to say the least of it. I think you were more frightened than hurt; and I will only say you are a naughty old Tommy. So I conclude with, Mary Tucker Borradaile. My sister sent me some fowls! Would you like one?" "13 December 1867. My dear Tom, I cannot find words to express my as<lb></lb>tonishment when I saw the letter which I wrote to you in confidence, in Mr. Smith's hands, which you told me you gave him to make use of as he thought proper. If you did not give it him, pray tell me who did. I did write to William last night, and I told him that it was dishonourable and unmanly on your part to give my letters to your solicitor, and to tell him to write to my family, to make use of vulgar words—a parcel of lies—merely to screen yourself. So mean of yon to put it upon other people. Thank goodness, William does not require your pity any more than I do myself. How can you deny that you have not exposed my let<lb></lb>ters? The consequence is that Messrs. Lewis and Lewis will write a sharp letter to you to-morrow, which letter must be answered by yourself. They told me they would not take an answer from anyone but yourself I have one favour to ask you, Tom, and I may never ask you another. It is, I im<lb></lb>plore you not to compromise William, as I have never mentioned his name to any solicitor. If you go to Lewis and Lewis's office, and I should be there before you, leave me to manage: you are aware I can do that, as you have often told me I had a clever little head. Should you be there before me, Tommy, be sure say as little as possible, and all can be arranged quiet<lb></lb>ly. "Blessed are the peacemakers." The less said about our affairs the better, for you know I love William dearly, and you know Tommy, I have</p>

               <p>not been unkind to you, you donkey. But you are like all the men—always exacting, and never satisfied. I found my umbrella. I told Mr. Smith I had not been to Duke Street. He told me I asked for a very ugly gentle<lb></lb>man. I said I thought he was a very good-looking man, which I think put him on good terms with himself, for, indeed, I do not wish him to write any more letters to my family. I did not tell him William was waiting for me at the corner of the street. It was only a wonder he did not walk up stairs, to see what kept me so long amongst the Land Conservatives, as he calls them. One thing I am sure you will be glad to hear, that William says he is sure of winning all my money back again next season, if the horses run which he has backed. Any man may have a run of ill-luck. The Marquis of Hastings lost more in one day than my poor William ever had to lose; but we must not be too hard upon him. I have one, and it is a great consolation, that he loves me dearly and fondly, and that his friends and advisers and my family have not the power to separate us. So do as I tell you—be manly and generous, and you will always have the friendship of one who has always endeavoured to keep her promise. Did you get home safely? If you have not taken the cough mixture, take it and put a little flannel on your chest. You are always angry when I tell you you are not getting younger. I never say anything to you to insult you. You have not a wife to take care of you: it is time you had. Where is the Duchess of——? I suppose Mr. Smith knows what a good wife she-will make. She will take such care of you. I hope you will invite me to your wedding. I hope the Duchess will make a good mother to your children. My sister, Mrs. J. Edwards, told me she saw you and your daughter in the park. Dear Tommy, will you say as little as possible? I most remind you once more, for you know you are so nervous. You remember <hi rend="italic">The Telegraph</hi> paper, in which it mentioned I took you from the prison to the church. Be kind, for indeed my fingers ache so: with kind love to the Duchess and your children, believe me, yours sincerely, poor little Mary Tucker Borradaile.—That is her dictation too, every word, both "Dear Tom" and "Dear William"—the letter of 13th December, was written the day after that of 12th December—I knew no William, the only person I knew was Lord Ranelagh.</p>

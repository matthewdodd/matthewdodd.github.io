On 10th July I was travelling about Rotherhithe, and saw Mrs. Darby—she said, "Have you got any jewellery?"—I said, "Yes," and went to her house—I had an accordion, and she was dancing to it—she took me into a back-room, and said, "I want to buy a pair of earrings"—I had none, but I said I would bring a pair next week—I went away, and afterwards missed the accordion from my bundle—it belonged to Sergeant Thomas, of the Rotherhithe station—it was in my custody—I went back and said, "Mrs. Darby, give me my accordion; it belongs to</p>

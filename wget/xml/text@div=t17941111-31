On Saturday, the 26th of September, between the hours of two and three in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner in my shop; I asked him what he wanted? the answer was, he wanted a pennyworth of honey; I went about the shop to serve him, and in going round, I observed the till had been opened; and he made an excuse, I must give him something to put the honey in; I told him I should do no such thing; he said, I can go out and borrow a cup of a boy in the street; he immediately went out of the shop, and as he was going out, I looked in my till, and missed some silver; I went after him, about a hundred yards, to the corner of a gate way; he then made a full stop, to see if I was after him, he saw me a following of him, he then run up the gate way.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a thoroughfare? - Yes. About the middle of the yard I over took him; he threw down the silver, and run out and another person ran after him, and took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what you lost from your till? - I do not know whether I lost two shillings, or five or six.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear to those shillings? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. There is too much room for suspicion, but Mr. Goddard did not see him take the money, neither can he swear to them.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Goddard. Do you know this boy? - No, his parents live at Brentford, his father and mother are both in town, and in court.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a plumber and glazier, of Bristol, lodging at 34, Castle-place, Whitechapel—on Saturday night, 17th February, I was walking with my wife at the corner of Tenter-street, Little Moorfields, and with two friends, one of whom was named Cohen—I had a silver watch in my waist<lb></lb>coat</p>

               <p>pocket, attached to a gold Albert chain, and locket fastened to the button of my waistcoat—Bond came in front of me, and caught hold of my watch and ran away, while Horrigan tried to knock me down, and then ran away—I ran after him, but he turned upon me a second time, and knocked me down—when I got up the two were gone away, and I could not find them—I then went to the police-station, and gave information of the robbery, and a description of the men—about 1 o'clock, on the 20th, I was in Milton-street, and saw Horrigan go into a coffee-house: about 5 o'clock the same day, I was with Cohen, and saw Horrigan again go into the coffee-shop—I got a policeman and went into the place, but we could not find him there—the constable told me to go home, and he would find him—on the 21st I was sent for to Moor-lane Station—seven or eight men were shown to me, and I was told to pick out the two who had robbed me—I picked out the prisoners—I am quite sure Bond is the man who took my watch, and Horrigan is the man who stopped me, and knocked me down—there was a good deal of light where the robbery took place, as we were very near the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a commission-agent, of Goodman's-fields, and was with Myers in Tenter-street, and saw Bond catch hold of his chain, and run away—Myers ran after him, and I saw the big man try to knock him down—I am quite sure the prisoners are the men—I was with Myers on the 21st, and saw the prisoners together in a public house—Horrigan came out, and went into a coffee-shop in Milton-street, and then we went to the station for a policeman—we could not find one for half an hour, and when he did come we could not find Horrigan, though we went into both the public house and the coffee shop and searched—after that I went to a place where the prisoners were shown me with other men, and picked them out at once—I am quite sure they are the men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Horrigan. Q.</hi> Did I knock your friend down? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You did—there was another man with me, but he could not run after you, because he had a very heavy carpet-bag with him—it was about ten minutes past 12—when I saw you on Tuesday at the public house, it was about 5 o'clock—you were with a lot more, and Bond was drinking in a room there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Bond. Q.</hi> When as you say, I took the watch, did you run after me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I did not say I was walking five yards ahead of the prosecutor when I saw the watch taken, I was standing still at the moment—I only saw you three times altogether, once when you took the watch, next when you were in the public house, and the third time in the police-station.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-detective</hi>). About half-past 9, on Wednesday morning, 21st, from the description I received from Myers, I went with another constable, to 91, Milton-street, which was kept then as a coffee-shop—I saw Horrigan on the second floor, in bed with another young man—I told him I should take him in custody for being concerned, with others, in stealing a watch from a gentleman in Little Moorfields, on the previous Saturday night—he made no reply—I then went into an adjoining room,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186602260071"></xptr>
               <p>and found Bond—I told him I should take him into custody for stealing a watch—I searched him, and found upon him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and four duplicates.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Horrigan. Q.</hi> Did you not see me on the Saturday and Monday; no lies, now, Mr. Fork; you <hi rend="italic">squared</hi> me away wrongfully? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can positively say I did not see you—I was on the look out for you—I did not tell your brother I would get you away the first opportunity possible—I never made use of any such remarks to any person—I do not know a man named Tacker.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Bond. Q.</hi> What description did the man give of me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You were described as a <hi rend="italic">carrotty chap</hi>, with a full face, and no hair on it—I do not know any person answering to that description so well as you.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 150). I was with Fork, and assisted him in taking the prisoners into custody, and conveying them to the station-house—I searched Horrigan, and found on him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on the following morning the prisoners were placed in the yard, with seven other men, and Myers and Cohen were called in—they picked out the prisoners at once.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Horrigan. Q.</hi> Did not you see me on the Saturday night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, but I do not think I did on the Monday; oh, yes, on the Monday I did see you, but I had not received information of the robbery—or, at all events, I had not the description of the man who had committed it—I brought in more than five men to the yard when the prosecutor came to pick out the men who had robbed him—there were nine altogether—I went out in the street and got them, because you should not be along with our men—I do not know Edward Tacker by name—I do not know a <hi rend="italic">carrotty</hi> man by that name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Bond's Defence</hi>. The prosecutor described our clothing as black; there was not one of the men called into the yard with black on, but us; they were costermongers; so that we had not a fair chance at all; I have been taken for another man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Horrigan's Defence</hi>. I was in a public house at the time the prosecutor told the Magistrate he lost his watch; from 10 o'clock to a quarter to 12, and he says he saw Bond in my company at the public house on the Tuesday, which is false; I had to go into the coffee-shop, for I had been looking after it six or eight weeks.</p>

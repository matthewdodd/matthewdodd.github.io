               <p>Q. When did you miss them?</p>
               <p>E. Gardner. I miss'd them as near as I can guess on the 23d of April last.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen them before?</p>
               <p>Gardner. I had seen them about 3 weeks before.</p>
               <p>Q. Where?</p>

               <p>E. Gardner. In the dining-room, I was sick at the time I lost them, is the reason I did not miss them sooner. I miss'd them as soon as I got up again; I had been ill about 3 weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they lock'd up?</p>
               <p>E. Gardner. No, I believe they were on the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of the prisoners live servant with you?</p>

When I miss'd the things, I ask'd Elizabeth Hall for them; she made me for answer they were not at home: I ask'd where they were? she told me, she would go and see to get them. I ask'd her if she had pawn'd them; as I was informed she owed some money, and if she had I would go and get them out again. She said she had not, but had given them to the other prisoner for her use, with this intention, that she should bring them back again, she being to receive 10 l. in about a fortnight. When Grant came again to my house, I ask'd her what she had done with the things. She said, she had pawn'd them, and would soon bring them again, to one Mr. Hull, where I went and found the sack, petticoat, a napkin, a shirt, and handkerchief (produced in court, and depos'd too) I found also another napkin, my property, at one Mr. Hudson's. ( produc'd) I believe my servant was drawn in by Grant to do this thing; till she was acquainted with her she behaved exceeding well.</p>

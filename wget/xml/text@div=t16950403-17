            </rs>. He was taken on the 14th of October last in Old Fishstreet, and several Shillings and Half Crowns, which were newly Clipt, were found in his Pocket when he was apprehended; he was taken by a Press-Warrant, by several Persons who were Evidences for the King: One of whom swore, That he had known him for three Years, and had seen him clip Money several times. The Prisoner called several Witnesses for his Reputation, who declared, That he was wont to write for his Living, and had Money allowed him by an Uncle to supply his Occasions. Others said, He was a Man of a Civil Behaviour in the general; so he might, and yet be a Clipper. The Prisoner said, he took the Money up in a House, at the White Rose in Shoreditch, in the Chimney-Corner, but did not prove it. And being ask'd where he lodg'd when taken, shifted the matter, and said, That he lodged sometimes in one place, and sometimes in another; but the King's Evidence declared, That he belong'd to Castle's Gang, and had used Clipping for a considerable time. So he was found <rs id="t16950403-17-verdict71" type="verdictDescription">

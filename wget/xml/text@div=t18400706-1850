                  </hi>. I am a surgeon and one of the medical officers of the Strand Union—I saw the child on the 10th of June, in the work-house—it was in an extremely emaciated state, and in a state of perfect exhaustion—I attended it till it died, which was on Sunday morning the 28th—my opinion is that it was in that state from want of food—it rallied slightly, under the treatment, and afterwards sank—I gave very strict directions that it should not be overfed, and I have very great confidence in the person that administered the food—it would have been dangerous to overfeed it—it was fed cautiously with a little milk and arrow-root in small quantities—I did not see every spoonful administered, but I have no doubt my instructions were attended to—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examin<lb></lb>ation—I found the internal structure of the child perfectly healthy—I should refer its death to want of proper nourishment and care, previous to the time I saw it—I opened the head, there was no appearance of dis<lb></lb>ease there—the child was a little convulsed on the Friday and Saturday previous to its death, not before—in cases of death from exhaustion they frequently have slight convulsions—children are very subject to it.</p>

                  </hi>.—I am a surgeon, and live in Brydges-street, Covent-garden. The child was brought to me by Sinnock and a woman on the morning of the 9th of June, from a quarter to half-past twelve o'clock—it was in a state of extreme debility and exhaustion, so much so, that I told the man I could do it no good, he had better take it away and give it nourishment, for I thought in all probability it would not be long before it died—I could not form any judgment from what that debility proceeded, because I made no inquiry into the circumstances—the face was very little larger than a China orange, and very much shrivelled up—it was quite an old emaciated countenance—I assisted Mr. Jones in part of the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I have heard his evidence, and fully concur in the opinion he has expressed as to the cause of the child's death.</p>

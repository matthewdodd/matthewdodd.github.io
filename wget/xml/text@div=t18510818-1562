                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and live at Enfield-highway. On 31st July, I missed a cart bed, fourteen felloes, a piece of ash, and a pair of iron cart arms from my wheeler's shop at the back of my premises—I know the prisoner—he lives in the next street, but his premises come very near to mine—I went to the station in consequence of my loss, and two policemen went with me to the prisoner's premises in about half an hour—I saw the prisoner there—I saw the fourteen felloes there—I asked the prisoner how he came in possession of them—he made no reply at first, but after some short time he said he did not know—the policeman searched, and found this piece of ash, which I know from the piece that was in the shed joining to it—we went down-stairs, and in a room that was locked up (the prisoner opened the door of it) we found my cart arms and bed—the prisoner said he found them at his door about ten days before—I could not swear when I had seen them on my premises, as I do not go into the shed very often.</p>

On 31st July, I went with Mr. Knight to the prisoner's house—I asked him if he had bought any felloes—he said "No"—I told him Mr. Knight had lost some and some other pro<lb></lb>perty, and I asked to search his premises—he said, "Very well"—I went into a loft and found these felloes concealed under some pea haum—I asked how he came by them—he said, "Oh! I have bad them by me a long while"—Mr. Knight identified them as his—I found this piece of ash which Mr. Knight identified—this was on the cross beams in the loft—I went down to a small room—the prisoner opened the door—I found in it this bed and arms of a cart—I asked him how he came by them—he said, "I don't know"—Cadwell was with me on another part of the premises—another prisoner was taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am employed as a wheelwright by Mr. Knight. I know this piece of ash—it is Mr. Knight's property—I recollect its being lost—I had not seen it for about ten days before, as I was in the fields doing some fencing—I know this cart bed—we were making a new cart to fit to it—I had seen this about ten days before—there is a field at the back of the shop planted with potatoes belonging to Mr. Wilson—that is between the shop and the prisoner's premises—when I missed these articles I saw a track in the potatoes, and a thoroughfare, and a fresh gap had been made in the hedge.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Hall, a lamb butcher; upon the 10th of March, about half after four in the morning, coming up the Ram-yard with a candle in my hand; I saw two men lurking about the top of the yard. I thought they wanted to steal some lambs, as we had lost some before. I went back down the yard, and told my master there were two men in the yard whom I suspected wanted to steal a lamb; we went back from the farther end of the yard through the gate-way, with candles in our hands, and went into the next inn; the prisoner was then standing under the gate-way pretending to make water; when we came into the Rose-Inn I said to my master, that is one of the men, the other is at the top of the yard. He said, don't you know him? I said no; he said, don't you know the iron shop in Peter-street? I said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178004050014"></xptr>yes; is it Pentycross? He said yes. I said, I thought he was transported. My master then bid me blow my candle out and watch him, which I did; and in two or three minutes I saw the prisoner come out of the warehouse with a box, and a parcel on the top of the box; he went out of the yard into the street; I took him by the arm, and said, what have you got there? He said, what business had I with that? that they were his own goods. He said did you ever see such a rascal to stop a man with his own property? I laid hold of him, and took him into the Rose-inn with the things under his arm; he laid them down on the dresser; and I went and called Mr. Wildman's people up at the Ram, and told them the warehouse was broke open. Mr. Wildman's son came to the publick-house; and the things were delivered to the constable by the watchman. I saw him deliver them. When we had him in the kitchen, and Mr. Wildman's son came and brought the book, he said, I know the things very well; I booked them myself over night. Mr. Nourse came, and they searched him and found three pick-lock keys in his pocket, which, upon trial, unlocked the door.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>The man in the yard might see you go backwards and forwards very well? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see any body else? - Yes; there was another man with him, when I took hold of the prisoner; he ran away.</p>
               <p>What distance was you from the prisoner when he came out of the warehouse? - About eight or ten yards.</p>
               <p>Is the door of the warehouse in the yard or in the passage? - It is in the gate-way going into the yard, there is a door comes out in the gate-way.</p>

I passed him, and went into the Rose, the next inn. I said to my man, that is Penty-cross, watch him; he went out, and soon after I went down the yard, I did not see any man. I had not been in the yard above five minutes before a butcher came and told me my man had taken a person on suspicion as a thief. I went into the publick-house and saw the prisoner in custody, and the things on the dresser.</p>

            , my nephew, and Canton were tried, and Walker was found guilty. Mailling used me very ill; I could never get my patterns from him; he was tried afterwards; the first time there was a flaw in the indictment, and he was acquitted; the second time he was indicted and found guilty; and after he was found guilty he put a knife into his throat; he recovered; and when Beldom took me, he said he had me in his power to hang me. I said my partner Mr. Cox was with me, and could tell where I got the things; they said they had got him pressed, and that now he could be of no service to me. On the Monday Cox was discharged, and was before the alderman, and told the affair: will your lordship be pleased to hear what he has to say. The clock struck five before I got out of bed to go to Deptford that morning. I hope you will look into this affair; it is Mailling and Beldom's doing. I saw Mailling as soon as I was taken to Guildhall; the moment I got in he set upon me, and said now he had me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Steers—we live at Eltham. On the 16th of Feb. I left the house about half-past six o'clock—I then had a half-crown and eight shillings in my pocket—I went across the yard, and in going home again I dropped my pocket, with the money in it—I missed it immediately I got in—my pocket was nankeen—I saw the prisoner at the bottom of the yard, but did not know that he was coming to the place—I never knew him before.</p>

                  </hi>. I live next door to Mrs. Steer—I saw the prisoner come up the yard, and pick up a nankeen pocket—he felt it, rolled it up, put it into his left hand trowsers pocket, and went away—I went after him, and told him he had picked it up—he said he had not—I am quite sure he is the man.</p>

I said "No, I have not;" she said, "There was half-a-guinea in it, my husband's club-money;" I then went home; a man came and said, "I think some of them are accusing you;" I went out; this woman said she saw me stoop, but I never did.</p>

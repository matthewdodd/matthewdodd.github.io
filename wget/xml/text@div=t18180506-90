            . I am a watchman. On the 6th of April, about twelve o'clock at night, I was in Charles-street. I heard the alarm, ran out, and was told the man had ran up another street; I found the prisoner behind a privy at the bottom of Eastwood's stable-yard - He said he had not got the watch? I had said nothing about it. I took him into a public-house, Mr. Rue came in, and said if he could have his watch again he should go about his business. The prisoner said he would go and get it. I asked him to tell me where he had dropped it; he said,"Just down by where I ran." I went to the yard, and brought it in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I heard the alarm, and pursued some person, whom I did not see. The man who said he had ran down the yard, was shorter and stouter than the prisoner.</p>

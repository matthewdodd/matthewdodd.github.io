On 30th September, from a quarter to half-past 7 in the morning, in consequence of information from Stokes, I went to a cottage in Trafalgar-mews, Walworth-road—I knocked at the door, and a woman looked out at the window, and then came down and let me in—I went in, and found the prisoner in the workshop at the back, in his shirt, lying on some bass on a carpenter's bench—I told him to get up and put his clothes on—I took him into the front room and said, "You are not the man I came for; I suppose you know the purpose of my visit here"—he said, "I suppose I do"—I told him to sit down, and put No. 55 to take care of him—I said, "I believe you have got some moulds here; a party was up here last night, and I believe you gave him a half-crown"—he said, "Well, it was one I lent him; the young man had been at work for me"—I said, "From the appearance of the house, here is a lot of plaster of Paris about, and I believe this is a manufacturing place of counterfeit coin; I shall search the house"—he said, "I have nothing here"—in the right hand corner of the carpenter's shop, I saw that some bricks had been secretly removed from the floor, and earth scattered over them—I removed the</p>

I have to leave the workmen there while I am out: they knew that I should not be home at night, and it may be a trap which they have laid for me, to have an opportunity to take what few tools I have—a young man, a polisher, was the last workman I had, and the policeman found him polishing at my place—he passed a bad half-crown, and afterward came into my room, closed the door, and said, "Will you oblige me by lending me a half-crown?" I said, "What for?" He said, "I had occasion to borrow one of a man I met, and he insists on my paying it. "I lent him one, and said that he might come and work it out. There is a trap laid to get me into the snare. As to the plaster of Paris, I had only that week contracted for some painting and whitewashing, and repairing some ceilings. I have to stop the holes with plaster of Paris. The workmen can do what they like when I am out, and I was at work at Peck ham. If I had known that this was being carried on, I would not have allowed it. I do not know the polisher's address.</p>

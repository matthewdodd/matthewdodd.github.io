                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Nugent, of 151/2, Peerless Row, City Road—on 14th March, about 12.30 at night, I was with him in Bath Street—there were a good many persons there, they pushed against us and knocked my husband down—then the prisoner rushed at me, struck me on the head, knocked me down, and stabbed me on the forehead—the stab was the first blow, it knocked me down—she then knelt on me and stabbed me several times—I screamed, my husband rushed over and dragged her off—she said nothing—I got up and made my way to my own door—a cab was called—I was taken to the station, and a surgeon was sent for—I have been very ill from those wounds—I am quite certain it was the prisoner who stabbed me.</p>

I am the husband of the last witness—I was with her—I have heard her evidence, it is quite true—I had no quarrel till I was hit by one of the parties—no one spoke to me, but someone shoved against me, and a young chap stepped up to me, and said, "If you do not go on I will give you a punch in the eye," using bad language—he pushed me against the wall—I scrambled on my feet again, and that was the time I had the <hi rend="italic">wrangle</hi> with him—that did not lead to a quarrel—I did not see him any more till I gave the prisoner in charge—three or four other men stood with their hands before me, sparring up to me, and I heard my wife scream—she was lying on the pavement, between three or four yards off—I made my way from the mob to her, and I had these lads hanging on my coat, punching my head—I saw the prisoner on top of my wife, and dragged her off—I am sure it was the prisoner—she rushed at me—I cannot say whether she had anything in her hand—I pushed her—I had hold of one or two men, they came round me, and then two constables came up and dispersed the mob—I went to the door and saw my wife outside bleeding—I sent for a cab, and as we went along (I was outside and one of the policemen inside)</p>

I am a surgeon, of 86, Central Street, St Luke's,—on Sunday morning, 15th March, I was fetched to the Old Street Station, and saw the prosecutrix there with nine incised wounds—the first was on her forehead, the upper right-hand side, about an inch long—another on the right side of her nose, about an inch and a half long—one on her cheek, two and a half inches long—her right ear was cut through; and on her right arm, above the elbow, was a wound about three inches long—another on the left side of her neck, about an inch long—incised and puncher, and about an inch deep—another behind her left shoulder, about an inch long—a superficial wound behind her neck, on the right side, about three inches long; and a superficial wound on her left hand and thumb—they were in dangerous situations, and she had lost a great deal of blood—her husband had a wound on his leg, about an inch long—there were corre<lb></lb>sponding marks on the clothes—the wounds were inflicted by some one-edged cutting instrument.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in the New-road, Camberwell, in the parish of St. Mary, Lambeth. I was at home eon Sunday evening, the 16th of April—after staking tea about seven o'clock I felt ill, and went to bed about nine o'clock—I had a servant of the name of Ann May—I desired her to put the fires out, and bolted my door—when I got up in the morning I found a trunk that was under the bed drawn out, my table dragged dragged out of the room, and the drawers one over another open—the bedroom door forced open—I went down stairs, and found the table standing in the passage—I missed a watch, six rings, two pairs of ear-rings, a brooch, a ladle, a fish-slice, ten spoons, a cream-pot, a fork, two shawls, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, and two £5 notes—before I took my tea I was as well as usual—after I had taken it I felt a throbbing and beating in my stomach, and I slept as if I should never awake again—I had no other servant but Ann May—there was nobody else in the house—I have lost to the value of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and upwards—I recollect on the 19th of February, (Sunday morning,) about nine o'clock, when I was at breakfast, the bell rang, and my late servant opened the door, and I saw the prisoner go up stairs—I went up stairs, and found him under the bed—he came down, and I saw him, sown all the flight of stairs—he ran out into the garden, and went over the wall down Bowyer-lane.</p>

I inspected the pro<lb></lb>secutrix's house—it appeared as if some one had been let in—I saw no breaking at all, the locks were all securer, there was a fracture in the back parlour window, but not enough to have been a breaking—I did not know the prisoner before; I looked for him after the robbery, and found him in about a fortnight—I gave him into custody of one of our con<lb></lb>stables while I went up stairs, and he made his escape—on Saturday last I took him again—I found the things tossed about inside the house.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable E</hi> 111.) I went down to Portsmouth, and found the prisoner there—I found two boxes at the Globe inn there, with cards and directions on them—Leach, the prosecutor's foreman, was with me—I took the prisoner into the Globe, to Leach—the boxes were not shown to the prisoner till we arrived at the station in London—they were then opened in his presence, and he said there was a brown coat of his in them, which we gave him—nothing was said about the other appren<lb></lb>tice, Jones, by me, or in my presence, that I recollect.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been in the prosecutor's service about nine years and a half. I accompanied the policeman to Portsmouth, and saw the prisoner at the Globe inn—I saw the boxes, with directions on them, in his handwriting—I asked him where Jones was—he said he did not know—I asked him again about an hour after, and he then said he did not know—I said, "Why, you must know"—he said he would see me d—before he would answer me any more questions, and I did not ask him any more about it—a printed bill was shown him, and he said Mr. Salmon was 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out—I took from his pocket a pistol and a pair of whiskers.</p>

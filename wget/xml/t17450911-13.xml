I desired to look into his trunk, he refused it at first, but I told him if he would not open it, I would have it opened; then he, with reluctancy, opened it, and this piece of Scotch cloth was in it; he asked pardon, and said it was mine. I said, how can it be mine when it is in your trunk? I looked on it and saw it was mine; it was marked with characters.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This piece of cloth lay some time in the cellar, and as I was brushing my clothes I was called up, and when I went down again I found this piece of cloth in my trunk, it might fall down into it by accident. And I did not know what to do with it, but had a design to keep it there, to give it to my master the first opportunity.</p>
               <p>Q. Excepting this, what is his general character?</p>
               <p>Cartwright. I had a good character of him. They said he was a little given to drinking; but if I had a strict hand over him, he might do very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make the defence he does now, when you first found it out?</p>
               <p>Cartwright. No, it is quite new. <rs id="t17450911-13-verdict66" type="verdictDescription">

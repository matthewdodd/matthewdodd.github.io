                  </hi> am an ironmonger, of Judd-street. The prisoner came to my shop about the 16th of January; I cannot say exactly, I did sot know him before, but am sure of him—he selected a coffee-biggin and a quantity of goods, and said he would accompany me with them to his house in Tonbridge-street, No. 24, I think—I and a lad went with him—we each took part of the goods—the prisoner carried the coffee-biggin—he went up a court in Tonbridge-street, to make water, and said, "You go on; I will over<lb></lb>take you;"—he did not do so—I went up the court, but never found him or the coffee-biggin.</p>

               <p>Mr. Bruin. On the 4th of February the prisoner came to my shop with this table-spoon (producing one.) I looked at it and said, if I did not know you, I would stop you; go and fetch the owner; she went and brought a woman, who said, it was not her own property; then I sent her about her business; after that, I went to the prosecutrix's house, and shewed her the spoon; the prisoner came in at the same time, and upon being charged with it, owned she did take it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Bruin. I believe I can account for what the prisoner means in her defence; Mr. Stanton was not for prosecuting her if he could have helped it; I said, you must go before a magistrate, and if the prisoner is discharged, then she must have the spoon; if that is the case, then they said they were not willing to that; when they came before Justice Girdler, Mrs. Stanton would not swear to the spoon; then the Justice said to her, she was liable to a prosecution for a false imprisonment; then she said she would swear to the spoon; then the brother-in-law said he would pay for the spoon, in case she does not return it, but there was no money passed.</p>

               <p>How do you know that? - His own friends have been with me, and told me his name was Ludlam; his cousin has.</p>
               <p>Did you know what situation of life he was in at the time he came to your house first? - He was an officer, I know.</p>

               <p>What did you do with the bill? - I offered it for payment to Mr. Stone, and they refused me payment, then I went to the office, and shewed it to the Justice; they made me write my name on it, and it was delivered to this gentleman. (Jealous.)</p>

               <p>Have you had any connection or transaction in which he has used the name of Washington, either by leaving a card at your house, or by calling himself by that name, or any other way? - I never knew, till after this transaction, that my wife told me he left a card in the name of Washington.</p>

               <p>Do you know any thing of that bill; was it ever presented to you? - Yes, I believe this is the same bill that Mr. Treyer brought one evening to our house, and enquired<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090024"></xptr>after the goodness of it; the answer given him was, that the bill was not a good one; that it was a forged one, and in addition to that, we mentioned another circumstance that had lately come to our knowledge.</p>
               <p>That you need not enter into; look at the acceptance of that bill? - This is not the acceptance of Mr. Stone, the partner in that house; his name is Richard; the initial of the Christian name here is E. D. I know nothing more of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I understand there is another banking-house in London of that firm? - No Sir, there is a banking-house, with a Martin in the firm, but that Martin stands last instead of first; that is not in Lombard-street.</p>
               <p>Is there ever a Mr. Stone in that house, Not that I know.</p>

Now, Mr. Ludlam, this is the time to make your defence; and the fact of your having offered this bill to Mr. Treyer, is certainly proved beyond all question, if the Jury believe him; that it is not a true bill is also proved; now you gave him a paper of directions where he was to carry a second parcel of goods, which appears not to be true, and you carried off the first parcel of goods, so that in truth, you wronged him of the first parcel, and deceived him in the second instance; that is a very strong circumstance against you; now Sir, what do you say for yourself?

               <p>Prisoner. I believe, my Lord, I could have brought witnesses to have proved the delivery of the identical bills.</p>
               <p>Court. What answer do you give, Mr. Ludlam, as to the fact of your giving that direction to carry a second parcel of goods to a place where you did not live? - I had lodged in Mortimer-street, for two months, very nigh, in a room, with a gentleman of the Navy, named Worrel.</p>
               <p>Where did you lodge at that time? can you give the Jury any satisfaction on that point, and why you ordered these goods to be sent to the other place? - I had lodged there so long, I did not, in the least, doubt but they would have taken them in; and I dare not have them sent to my own lodging, being very much in debt in name of Ludlam.</p>
               <p>Have you any thing more to say, Mr. Ludlam? - Nothing more.</p>

               <p>Court. I understood by your examination, that he had so gone.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have gone by the name of Washington ever since the year 1785; Mr. Riley attends; he is subpoened.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. State to my Lord the fact that Mr. Riley can prove? - I was admitted at the Free Masons Tavern, by the name of Washington, and I refer to Mr. Riley to prove that.</p>

            , or order, thirty days after date, for value received, and it is drawn on Messrs. Martin and Co. Bankers, London; it imports to have been accepted on the 5th of November, 1787, by a person described on the acceptance, E. D. Stone; and it purports to have been indorsed by Wright; the person to whom it was paid; and by W. Washington; it is the acceptance that is charged to be forged of Mr. Stone, and it is that indorsement by Washington that is charged to be forged; the prisoner is not charged with having forged either of these, but with having uttered the bill with the false acceptance and indorsement, knowing that they were so; by uttering is meant that he passed it in payment, and used it like a true bill, when he knew it was false; upon the facts of the case on the evidence, it stands thus: this prisoner had used the house of one Goslib Agustus Treyer, who lives somewhere in the Hay-market, and deals, among other articles, in snuff. (Here the learned Judge summed up the evidence and then added as follows:) On the paper which he left with Mr. Treyer, which looks like the cover of a letter, are written these words,</p>
               <p>"

               <p>"Mortimer-street, Cavendish-square,</p>
               <p>"London." Now, if in indorsing the name of Washington there was no particular fraud meditated, that would not be considered a forged indorsement; signing by the false name, will not alone, unless there is a fraudulent use made of it, make it a forgery, so as to expose him to the charge of making a forged indorsement; upon this evidence, I think it must be taken to be a bill on Martin, Stone and Co. who are bankers in Lombard-street; and to have upon it a forged acceptance: but the material point for your consideration is, whether this man, who offered it in payment, appears to you to have uttered it, under circumstances that prove he had some concern in the forging of the bill, or that he knew it was forged; I directed the attention of the prisoner in his defence, to that point which seemed to me to press him most, with respect to the knowledge; because, if you find a man uttering a bill, which turns out to be forged, with all the circumstances on his part that are open and fair, and no disguise whatever; you will not conclude, merely from the circumstance of his having the misfortune of uttering a forged bill, that he knew it was forged; on the other hand, if you find him playing any tricks, or using any disguise, or any management that demonstrates any fraud in the passing that bill, you will conclude he had such knowledge; the circumstance that presses this man, is certainly, that he came there, and gave two different orders for different parcels of goods; with respect to the largest parcel of 7 l. 3 s. he takes this away with him in a hackney coach, therefore he actually got the possession of these goods, and carried them off, and where he carried them to no body knows; with respect to the other parcel of goods, he gave a direction, which turned out to be a direction that was not a true one; it was not a place where they were likely to be received, and in fact the people would not receive the goods, so that the question is, whether that is not an artifice to prevail on the man to part with the first parcel of goods, on a false security, and that is the way in which it applies: now, he says first, as to the bill, he received it from Mr. Allamby; his trial was put off last sessions, to give him an opportunity of establishing that fact, Mr. Allamby is dead, and he cannot now establish it by calling Mr. Allamby; and to be sure it would not be a very likely thing that he would come here to prove that he put a forged bill into his hands; he says to that, if his trial was put off longer, he might have been able to establish that by other testimony; but he was not able to state any circumstance that could induce the Court to suppose, that if any time was given to him, it would be possible for him to shew the fact that he received it from Allamby;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090026"></xptr>therefore, that the Court cannot take any notice of; but with respect to the more material point as it strikes me, which is the transaction itself with Treyer; what he says, is this; he wanted such goods, and took away such as was convenient to him; he took it to his own lodgings, which he was obliged to keep private on account of his distressed situation; and he says, it occurred to him that he might order the other part of the goods to this other place where he had lodged before, as he supposed that they would take them in; and he says, that that circumstance therefore ought not to operate upon you, that he meditated any fraud on the prosecutor; it is on that subject principally upon which your discretion is to be exercised; here unquestionably is a bill with a forged acceptance upon it, passed by the man at the bar; the question is, whether he must have known this was not a true bill at the time he passed it; to be sure originally, a man who has the misfortune to pass a forged bill, is bound to prove how he came by it, and there might be a great deal of indulgence on that point for a man who might have the misfortune to pass a forged bill; because a man may receive a forged bill and lose his evidence, as the prisoner says he has; therefore, jurors in all those cases, look more narrowly into the manner of the circumstances, under which the man acts the moment he passes the bill, and form their judgment, rather from these circumstances, more than from the passing the bill merely; for though his saying he received it from another person would not be a direct answer; yet if a man passes a bill with every circumstance of fairness and openness without the least disguise, there is great reason to suppose that he did not know it was a forged bill, unless there is proof that he knows of the forgery; now, you will consider the manner in which this man conducted himself at the time he passed this bill; if you believe he was conscious this was a forged bill, and he knew it, then he is answerable to the extent of this indictment which charges him with the uttering the false acceptance; with respect to the indorsement, if you can satisfy yourselves about the acceptance, I think you may satisfy yourselves about the indorsement, having put that name publicly on it, which there is some evidence he did go by at that time; but upon the other point particularly you will consider seriously, and do justice to him and the public credit by your verdict.</p>
               <p>Jury. My Lord, we wish to know when he received the bill of Mr. Allamby.</p>
               <p>Court. We cannot ask the prisoner questions now.</p>
               <p>Jury. Because I think he said he received them in October, and the date of the acceptance is the 5th of November.</p>
               <p>Court. It would not be fair to press the prisoner with very sharp observations, on what he says here in his defence; as to what he says now, if it does not make for him, it should not make against him, because we do not ask him to accuse himself, but to defend himself; as to what he said at the time he gave the bill to Treyer you do well to consider that.</p>

            . I am a fisherman. On the 3d of last month about nine in the morning, I was fishing just below Barnes; Ellis and Mr Goodchild, with I believe seven more; they took away my nets, my nets were not fair nets; I mean they were unlawful, the mashes were too small; those people belonged to the water-bailiff, Goodchild is his deputy; as soon as I lost my nets, I went home, then I went down to Strand-bridge with others,

             was one of them; we manned two boats, and had some stones in one of them, and went up the river to board them to get my nets again; a battle ensued; Ellis was in the water-bailiff's boat; I believe it was he struck Thorne, as he was in our boat-stern; we attacked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176801140012"></xptr> them first; I own we did wrong; I will never fish with foul nets no more as long as I live.</p>

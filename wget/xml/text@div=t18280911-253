            . I am housekeeper to Jacob Woolf. On the 3d of July I was outside the window, and the prisoner was just by the window, a man on the other side was talking to him; the prisoner broke the glass, and I told Mr. Woolf of it; I called him - he came out; I shewed him that was the man - he went away with him; when he came back his face was all bloody and scratched - he came back in an hour's time; I heard the prisoner say, "Come with me, I have not got the money in my pocket" - I am certain he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it this man who broke the glass? A. Yes - it was not a friend of his who said he would pay for the glass, it was this man himself.</p>

            . I am a coal-whipper. I was going along the highway, and saw a crowd round the window: the prosecutor had hold of the prisoner by the collar, and said he broke the window - the prisoner did not say Yes, nor No; I spoke to Woolf, and said, "You had better go with the man to his house, and perhaps you will get paid"- I followed them, and they went on; I went into my own house and came out again, and saw the prisoner and prosecutor on the ground; Woolf was on the prisoner, and had hold of his handkerchief, and a crowd of women were about them - a number of them separated them, and the minute Woolf got up he pointed to a man to whose shoulder the prisoner does not reach, and ran into houses and houses after him; the prisoner went away without his hat; he did not run - he was not able to run.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110141"></xptr>- BRIAN. I am mother of the last witness. My son came in and told me Leary had broken a window; I went into the street, which was King-street, Old Gravel-lane - I saw Leary and the prosecutor down - the prosecutor was uppermost and had no hat on; there was a crowd of women round - the prosecutor got up, and looked after a tall young man, named Timothy McCartlty; he ran through four or five houses, and the prosecutor after him; Leary did not run - he was not able to run; he was helped away by the women to his own house, which was not five yards from the place; the prisoner did not attempt to run, but the prosecutor ran after the other man to different yards.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see any pocket-book? A. Yes, in the hand of the prosecutor - he had it open, and I thought he was an officer until my son came and told me a window was broken - I saw it at the place where I saw them on the ground.</p>

            . I was at my own door as the prosecutor and prisoner came down the street; they turned down an archway, and there was a great mob - I went towards the part; I saw the prisoner under the prosecutor, and his fist was fastened in the prisoner's handkerchief - I went and loosened his hand from his handkerchief, and said."Don't choke the man, he will pay you;" he said, "I will have him," and he expressed words not fit to be mentioned - Woolf then got up, and there was a tall man, with a working dress on, stood at the corner, and he said, "You are the man that did me damage" - he ran off, and the prosecutor after him; the prisoner would not reach his shoulder - there were two other men helping Woolf to follow him.</p>
               <p>JACOB WOOLF re-examined. Q. Have you heard and understood what these witnesses have said? A. No, not all - they were laughing at me; I had not my pocketbook in my hand - two men were helping me to pursue the person who had ill-used me: they offered to go to the Police-office, but I could not go, I was so much murdered - the prisoner ran away, and two Englishmen went after him; I was afraid to go into any house - Brian went into one: Brian was in company with the prisoner by the house - they were by the side of each other; I went after Brian - I thought they were partners; I wanted him to tell me where the prisoner lived.</p>

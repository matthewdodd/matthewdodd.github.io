I sent for Mrs. Steele, a midwife, and on Tuesday 21st, about half-past two o'clock in the morning, the prisoner was delivered of a female child, in my presence—I saw her in her own room on the following day, Wednesday, about half-past two in the afternoon—she was then up—when I came in 1 said, "My gracious, what, up and dressed! you will get your death of cold"—she said, "I know as much about my death as you do; it is no more than I have done before"—she dressed the baby, and laid it on a blanket on a chair, and I said what a beautiful, healthy<lb></lb>looking creature it looked—I saw her go out of the house, about half-past three, with the child, wrapped up in a shawl—this was the day after her confine<lb></lb>ment—I left the house, and did not return till about ten at night—I then saw the prisoner going from my mother's room to her own, and I said, "What, returned, and not a-bed yet!"—she said, "I have been to bed, but I have been annoyed by a policeman"—I said, "A policeman! what brought a policeman to my house?<hi rend="italic">"</hi>—she said, "On suspicion of my doing away with my baby"—I asked where the baby was—she said she had left it at the nurse's that nursed her other—I afterwards asked her again where it was, and</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Browning, of 3, Plummer's-row, whore the prisoner lived. On Wednesday, 22nd Nov., about half-past three o'clock a.m. the afternoon, I saw h-r going out with a bundle under her shawl—I had not then seen her baby—I knew she had been confined—I saw her again about seven in the evening, sitting by the fire—she went into Mrs. O'Lrary's room, and I heard the old lady say that her daughter had left a good fire, and to go in and go to bed, for she must feel very ill—she asked her what she had done with her baby, whether she had put it to wet-nurse or dry-nurse—she said she had put it to dry-nurse—I went out, and spoke to a policeman, and afterwards went to the station and fetched a police-sergeant—I returned with him, and he and my husband went upstairs—I do not exactly recollect the time, it might have been between eight and nine in the evening—I believe the sergeant left about ten—I went to bed about half-past eleven, and passed the prisoner's door—I went into the prisoner's room, and found the prisoner's box corded, and the prisoner up and dressed—I asked her what she had done with her baby—she said she had taken it to 4, Dock—head, to Mrs. Bell—I asked what sort of person she was—she said she was an Irishwoman, and her husband English—I asked her what she was to give to the person for nursing her baby—she said 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and she afterwards said that her Ellen's nurse would try to get it into the Foundling Hospital for her, and, if not, she would take it to its father—she began to cry, and said she had milk, and would suckle her baby if she had but got it—I told her I would call my husband down stairs, and he should go and fetch it—I called him, and she told him to go to 4, Dock—head—before he came back, she said she did not see why me and Mrs. Burns should sit up to watch her—she wished Mrs. Burns to go to bed, for she had said she would tear her to pieces—she cried, and said she wished she had a friend—I told her I would befriend her in anything that I could—she said she wished she could get out of the house that night—she said she had gone out of the house, and walked as far as the Three Nuns, in Whitechapel; while waning for a <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>, she sent a little boy with a white pinafore for a pennyworth of syrup of poppies, and two drops of laudanum; she gave part to the baby, and the other part she put into her own mouth; and she then went to Dock—head, to see if she could find Mrs. Bell, who had taken her Ellen to nurse; that she could not, and asked two or three women to take her baby, but none would take it without money—she said she then went to Hyde-park, and sat down; (she did not say how she got there); that she went to the first turning past St. George's Hospital, up a mews, and sat down, and put the baby on her lap, and got up, and walked away with the baby; that the devil tempted her, and she went back again, took the shawl off the baby, and laid it on its side down on the (dunghall, and put her handkerchief over its face, and spread its little bedgown out in hopes of some of the ostlers picking it up, and taking it to</p>

I particularly observed him, he came by me with the others and hustled me, which made me suspect them, I stopped and told them to pass on, and I would wait, I immediately put my hand to my fob and missed my watch, I called the watch and gave the prisoner in charge; I will not swear that he took the watch, he was in company with those who took it. He dared me to give him in charge, and said he was an apprentice to a gentleman on Snowhill.</p>

            . I am an officer; I was at the watch-house between eleven and twelve at night, the prosecutor and watchman brought the prisoner in, charging him with hustling the prosecutor, and stated, that he had lost his watch; I searched him but found nothing on him.</p>

             Re-examined. I said, he would oblige me by telling me who the party were that he was with, and asked him to give me my watch again; the prisoner ran off, and got into the recess of a door, which is No. 7 or 8, Fleet-market; I saw him come out of that place, and he walked up to me very leisurely.</p>

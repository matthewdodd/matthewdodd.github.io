               <p>LLEWELLIN HUGHES. On the day in the indictment, the male prisoner came to my house, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon; he had something to drink and paid sixpence for it; I immediately put it into the till, but did not observe it at the time; and as soon as the prisoner turned his back the officer came in. I then took particular notice of the stamp on the sixpence; I put it in a piece of paper and have kept it ever since; I had no other sixpence.</p>

            . I look at the male prisoner; he came into my house on the day in the indictment and had a pint of porter; he gave me a sixpence, and I gave him the change; I did not part with the sixpence until the officer came in. The officer brought the woman in; she had some colouring in her hand, which she squeezed all to pieces in opening her hand.</p>

            . I was in Chancery-lane with Wainright on the day in the indictment a little after two; I saw the two prisoners coming from the corner of Cursitor-street; I then saw the man prisoner go into the Five Bells, the woman went about fifteen yards from it and stopped. He came out again, and when he came out, they spoke together. They went together lower down, to the chandler's shop, and several other places; they had half an ounce of tobacco there. I used to see some halfpence pass from him to her, when ever he came out. I saw the sixpences produced by the two last witnesses as uttered to them by the male prisoner, and they are both bad. When I apprehended the female prisoner I saw her grapple her hand together and I was obliged to use force to take her into Mr. Dennis's house; Wainright and Sullivan was then together. I forced the female prisoner's hand open, and found a bit of paper containing some colouring, and a bad sixpence in it; she tore the paper all to pieces, and it fell, but I picked up a little or the colouring, and it produced the colour of silver on base metal; I tried that,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180071"></xptr>I then searched her, and found on her these boxes, one contains twenty-eight sixpences, and the other four, shey are all bad ones; she had likewise four shillings in copper, and a large pair of clippers, which I think had the appearance of having been used. On the male prisoner I found threepence three farthings, which would be the change out of sixpence, after paying for the pint of beer; the pint of beer being two pence farthing.</p>

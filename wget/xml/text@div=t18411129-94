                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Seaward. The pri<lb></lb>soner was employed in the house as servant, to go on errands and to pay bills, when there was not work for him as a labourer in the factory—I deal with Mr. Driver, a fishmonger—I have occasionally sent the prisoner with orders to Driver, and to pay accounts, which were kept in a book—I sent the book every time I sent orders—the orders were written at the fish<lb></lb>monger's—my orders were to send fish, without specifying what sort—he sent what was convenient for the day—about the 15th of October twelve-month I tore the last leaf out of the book, and gave the prisoner the money to pay it—I received this receipt from him, but I am not sure whether it was by his own hand or not, because I had removed to the west end of the town; and in one instance, when he paid a bill for me, he was not to re<lb></lb>turn</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184111290074"></xptr>
               <p>to the house that night—I said, "Send me the receipt by post"—whether it was in this instance, or not, I cannot say—I think I received this from his own hand, hut I cannot say positively—the one which I had by post I received in the course of the following morning—it was merely enclosed in an envelope—there was no writing except the direction—I have not got it—I suppose I burnt it—I never keep any thing of the sort—the envelope was in his handwriting, I am sure of that—I filed the re<lb></lb>ceipt after I received it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Have you not had other persons call to pay Mr. Driver? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I have not sent other persons to pay bills within the two years the prisoner was with us—I did not at the time I was leaving the factory—I did not give some money to Sarah Little to pay Mr. Driver, nor to Charles Witham—I came to the factory, and left a small bill to be paid to Mr. Avendry for Mr. Seaward's lunch—I paid Mr. Hill myself—I remem<lb></lb>ber your coming with a load of turf from Epping Forest—it was shortly after we came to the new house, which was in September—I do not think the turf came till October, but am not sure—I do not think I ever caused Mr. Driver to be paid at the door—I should not do that when I had an account with him—I have had receipts put into the book, and also a stamp receipt for the last amount before this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who did you send the money by for this former receipt, which was in January, 1840? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think you paid this bill yourself—here is the leaf, and the stamp receipt with it—I cannot tell the exact day I came down to Limehouse—I should think it was in October—I remember going out to a dinner party, and calling at Mr. Seaward's, in Church-row, on my way there—it is very likely you brought a parcel to me at Church-row, but I do not recollect it—I think I told you to put a parcel in the portmanteau, or said that it was for me to take home that evening—I do not know the time I went to the dinner party—I do not recollect your bringing the parcel, and having it put into my portmanteau—I remember something about the parcel, and I reprimanded you for not bringing all I asked—I think I gave you some gold to pay Miss Brown—I think you paid it—I may have taken away the gold, and given you a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I re<lb></lb>member losing a note, and finding it on the floor of the store-room—I did not accuse you of stealing it, to my knowledge—I did not desire you to feel in your pocket and see if you had it, to my knowledge—I may have done it—I never sent any one to pay money to Mr. Driver but you—if you have been out, I may have sent my house servant with orders—I have no reason to doubt your honesty previous to this—before Mrs. Douglas's going to the house she did washing for me—I told you never to give money to her son—I do not know when I paid you, it was very likely in November.</p>

                  </hi>. This receipt is not in my handwriting—I did not receive any money corresponding to that amount at the time of the date of it, or any sum of that amount—when the fish was had, the book was sent to the shop, and the fish was entered in it at the time, or the next day—this account is unsettled at the present time—I did not send for my money for some time—Mr. Seaward had left the factory, and taken a house westward—I thought it strange, and wrote about a month ago—I keep a cash<lb></lb>book, so as to know the account has never been paid—I have no entry at all of this payment.</p>

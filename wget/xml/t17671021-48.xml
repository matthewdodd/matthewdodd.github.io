               <p>Mrs. Bethel confirmed the account given by her husband.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ward. I am a pawnbroker, I live facing St. Andrew's church, Holbourn; last Saturday the prisoner brought a child's slip, and a pair of small gold wires, and pledged them with me (produced and deposed to;) and on Wednesday she came and offered me a pair of silver buckles, and I having had an account these were stole, stopt her; I cannot find an owner to the buckles; there has been a child stripped and robbed of a pair of buckles in Chancery-lane; that child described the prisoner, but the parents say the buckles are not the size of the buckles they lost.</p>

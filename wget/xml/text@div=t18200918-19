            . On the 2d of September I came up from Chelmsford - I had walked twenty-five miles that day, and arrived in town between one and two o'clock in the morning - I then took a coach, and told the man to drive me to the end of <placeName id="t18200918-19-crimeloc106">Bow-street</placeName>

I do not know where he took me to, but he took me to a public-house; I went in, and gave him a glass of liquor; I took my purse out, which had 1 s. 1 1/2 d., rolled in a 2 l. bank note in it. The coachman said I was a poor woman, and he would pay. I put my money into my bosom - the prisoners were in the house, and could see me put my purse there. I went out, intending to go to Islington to see a friend. Battley took me by the arms and held me while Andrews took my money. Battley whistled, and down came twelve or fourteen men - they used very improper expressions, and if I had been a girl of the town they could not have used me worse. I should know three or four of the others if I saw them - they all appeared to be hackney coachmen - they all ran away. I told the watchman, he said there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180012"></xptr>were too many, he was afraid to go near them, and I had better make the best of my way to Bow-street, which I did; an officer came down with me, and found them at a watering-house. I pointed Andrews out, he refused to go, and Battley ran out of the place - Avery ran after him and secured him; he had then the marks of blood on his face where I had scratched him. They had used me terribly, and turned my clothes over my head.</p>

I got to the beginning of London about one or two o'clock - I believe it was at Whitechapel church; I had been to Sudbury for a week - this happened on Saturday; I had left town on Thursday, the day before the robbery. Before that I lived in St. Martin's work-house. I had four or five lodgings in the course of the month before.</p>
               <p>Q. You got to town at two o'clock, and reached the public-house at five, what were you doing for three hours - A. The coachman kept driving me about, and these men were with him part of the way; the coachman got into the coach with me, and one of them drove. I took the coach in Blue-cross-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields, as they tell me. I had been there on business.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you tell the man to drive to Bow-street - A. I intended to go to Islington.</p>

On the 10th of Jan., about five o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner and another lad opposite Mr. Greenley's shop—they were together a great while—one of them crossed the road several times to the shop—I went out and told the constable, and he told me to go and watch them—I then saw the two together—the other one had a bag—the prisoner went to the stall, and took something like a coat, which he gave to his mate and they both went away—I went and told the constable—I came down one side of the road, and the officer on the other, and just as I came down the prisoner was taken with something on his arm which he had just taken from the shop.</p>

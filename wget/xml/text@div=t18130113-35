             That was his and his wife's sleeping-room. It was on the same floor, but a back-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Who lived in the next house, on that side near Giltspur-street - A. Mr. Plummer; and in the house next to Cheapside, Mr. Wool.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you acquainted with the names of the prisoner's servants that used to sleep in the house. Do you know a man of the name of Praston and a man of the name of Whitehead - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a man of the name of Bennett ever living in the house - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a son that slept in the house - A. There was a boy about eight years old that used to sleep there.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to tell me whether that little boy and the men slept in the house - A. They might occasionally. I cannot say whether they did that night. Whitehead, and a man, whose name I do not know, they used to sleep in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me whether they slept in it any part of the week preceding the fire - A. No; I cannot. On the 11th of November, the day the fire happened, I went to bed about half after eleven o'clock. I had not left any fire in any of my apartments. We generally have a fire in my front room two pair of stairs, and that was out before I went to bed. My children were in bed before me; my wife and I went to bed together. About a quarter before three in the morning, the first thing that called my attention was the cry of fire, and the rattles. On my being disturbed, I opened the front window and looked out, and saw the sparks came over the house. The sparks seemed to come from the back of the house into <placeName id="t18130113-35-crimeloc195">Newgate-street</placeName>

After I had opened the window and saw the sparks come over the house, I then went and opened my sitting-room door which leads to the staff-case. There is a window there that you can see the back part of the house. I could see the fire from the landing-place, from Mr. Smiths accompting-house. It came right through the sky-light of the accompting-house. It broke through the glass. Then I went into my bedroom, and told Mrs. Finch the house was on fire. She took two children and I took one. I went to get out at the top of house; that was fastened. I did not succeed. Then I went to the front garret door, where Miss. Rose lodged. I found I could not get out there; then I came down stairs. On my coming down stairs I saw Mrs. Smith, she opened her bedroom door; she had a lamp in her hand. She was dressed with a bonnet and gown on. She appeared dressed in her usual way.</p>

               <p>Q. Could you judge from her appearance whether her clothes had been hurried on in haste - A. They had not appearanes of that. She appeared in her usual dress as in the day. I then proceeded down stairs, and opened the front door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it - A. Not at all, it was shut to with a common spring lock; no bolts were shot. As soon as I opened the street door, the people came in and took the children. I then went back, up stairs, and the men followed me up stairs, but who they were I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the prisoner's wife - A. She came down stairs nearly the same time with my wife.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181301130017"></xptr>The fire was very rapid at the time that we came down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you got down stairs did the stairs tumble in - A. It might be ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after I was down.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might it be from the time you discovered your danger and made your escape - A. Not more than twenty minutes when the stairs fell in.</p>
               <p>COURT. Between your being alarmed and the stairs falling in - A. Yes; I think, about twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. When first you came down stairs did you discover where the fire came from - A. I think through the window. I could see the flames coming right through the sky-light, in Mr. Smith accompting-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see the shop on fire - A. Yes. I was on the spot. I saw the whole of it consumed.</p>
               <p>Q. I asked you before, I believe, since you know who was in the house - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the prisoner's child in the course of the day - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any opportunity of knowing whether the child slept in the house that night - A. No, I had not. I had not seen the child in the course of that day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. The first alarm that you had of fire was somewhere about three o'clock in the morning - A. A quarter before three.</p>
               <p>Q. Now the fire you observed was a very rapid fire - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore the probability would be that the fire would been it down in half an hour - A. Not so soon at that; about an hour and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you lived in the house - A. About thirteen months.</p>
               <p>Q. You know that Mr. Smith had another house in Hounsditch - A. I understood that he has.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he slept at that house sometimes, and sometimes at home - A. I cannot say. I do not know whether he slept out, nor do I know whether he was at home that night.</p>
               <p>Q. You know Mrs. Smith - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She we understand is since dead - A. Yes, she is. I saw her come out of her bed-room with a lamp in her hand, alight. I knew very little of Mrs. Smith; she was sometimes sober and sometimes intoxicated.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. In what state was Mrs. Smith that night - A. I think she was in liquor that night. The fire was backwards, in Mr. Smith's accompting-house.</p>

               <p>Q. At what time in the night were you awoke - A. Half past two, or thereabouts. I cannot exactly say. I was awoke by the alarm of fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, ma'am, when you came out of your chamber, did you see Mrs. Smith - A. Mrs. Smith came out of her chamber nearly at the time we opened our bed-room door. She was dressed completely. I was in a great fright. She did not appear alarmed as I saw. We went up stairs first; we could not make our escape up stairs; we came down stairs and escaped, and as I came down stairs I saw the fire in Mr. Smith's accompting-house. That room projects beyond the upper part of the house. It is behind the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. As you came down in the passage did you find the shop on fire - A. I did not. I made my escape.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any fire in your room, or on your story, when you were alarmed - A. None in the least. I saw no fire, but as I passed down stairs there was no fire higher than the ground flour, as I could judge of from the stairs. I saw no appearance of fire in Mrs. Smith's chamber.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the persons in the house that night was Miss Rose, in the room over you; yourself, your husband, and three children, in your own room - A.

I have a yard at the back of my house; it is separated from the prisoner's yard by a wooden fence. On the night on the fire I went to bed about twelve o'clock, and between two and three I was alarmed by the noise in the street. I slept in the front of the house, in the three pair. On my being alarmed, I looked out of my window, and saw the fire flying over the top of the house. I afterwards went to the back part of the house; I observed the fire come from the back part of Mr. Smith's house, from the place where he used to keep the coals; the cellar underneath the parlour, or accompting-house, he had; immediately underneath the sky-light parlour. I alarmed my family.</p>

               <p>Q. On the morning after the the fire did you see the prisoner any where - A. I did, in my own house. He came there betwixt eight and nine; a man came in with him.

               <p>Mr. Knapp. You lived next door to Mr. Smith. Did you know Mr. Smith and his wife - A. Yes, very well. Mrs. Smith would drink a little. I have seen her a little intoxicated five or six times, and I have seen a lamp burning in her passage, and I have put it out. I did not think any danger in the lamp burning, but I always put it out.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the fire was about half after two - A. Yes, somewhere about that time. The fire was not very rapid when I first saw it. I suppose it had not long broke out.

               <p>Q. In the night of the 11th of November, or rather the morning of the 12th, were you in Newgate-street - A. About a quarter before three in the morning I was in Newgate-street; I saw the appearance of fire behind Mr. Smith's house. I knocked at Mr. Plummer's door first, Mr. Smith's door next, and then at Mr. Bull's. I got first into Mr. Bull's house. I went backwards. I found the fire coming out of a kind of an area in Mr. Smith's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it set fire to any thing of Mr. Bull's - A. Yes, the wooden partition that was between Mr. Bull's premises and Mr. Smith's was on fire. I throwed about two pails and a half of water on it; then I asked for more. I took a poker, and went to Mr. Smith's house. I broke one of the pannels of the shop door. I got the door open. At first, the shop was full of smoke; the smoke dispersed on my opening the door. I found four patent lamps on the counter, which I took away. They were not alight. There was a great fire at the back of the house. The fire was burning very rapidly. I got my fellow-servant to get me a ladder, and as I was going up to the one pair of stairs window the ladder fell. I fell down and broke the bone of my arm. That is all I know about it.</p>
               <p>MRS. LONDON. I was employed as a char-woman by the prisoner. I was employed by him some time before the fire. I used to light the fires. I usually fit two fires; one in the shew room, and the other in the kitchen. I sometimes lighted the fires with turpentine wood, and sometimes plain wood.

               <p>Q. Within a few days before the fire happened, had you sold any shavings to Mr. Smith - A. I sold him one sack in the fore part of that week. I put them in the cellar, in the back part of the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. The fire happened on the Wednesday, then that must be on the Monday or Tuesday - A. Yes. I sold him one other sack the night before the fire happened. I took the second sack into the cellar where I took the first. I did not see any of the shavings that I had taken before. The last sack I took was between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, before dark. Mr. Smith ordered the shavings, and he paid me. He asked me the first time for two. I had but one, and therefore I took the second afterwards. I was at work at Dr. Ford's house. I never sold any shavings to Mr. Smith before. I used to sell them to the pastry-cook. Mr. Smith asked me to let him have some shavings to light his fire with, as soon as I had made them. I told him I would let him have them.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect the fire that happened in Newgate-street - A. I do. On the evening of the 10th of November, the prisoner called at my shop, between eight and nine, after dark. He desired to have a gallon of turpentine. He brought with him a stone bottle. I told him the price was fifteen shillings per gallon. He said, he knew it was high, but he had given more. The turpentine I measured myself, and put it in the bottle. He told me to tie a leather over the cork, and then he enquired if we sold pitch. I told him, we did. He then enquired if we had any in seven pounds bags. I told him, we had not; I would put it in seven pound bags; if he wished to have it put up in that manner I would do it for him. He then ordered three seven-pound bags, and while the pitch was cutting up he took the bottle of turpentine, and went away with it. He said, he would return for the pitch. I asked him, if he would allow me to send the turpentine home. He said, no, there was no occasion for that; he was tolerably strong; he would carry it himself He then went away. He was gone about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour. When he returned for the pitch I was not quite ready. He was waiting in the shop; he saw some links in the shop; he then said, do you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181301130019"></xptr>sell links. I said, we did. He said, he would take two of them. He took two, and desired to have them cut in half, which was done. He had three bags of pitch; and four half links tied up together in a coarse cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you would have made no charge if one of your servants carried them home - A. Oh, dear, no.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the fact, whether he was acquainted that you knew him - A. I recollected him, from frequently seeing him standing at his own shop door. He might know me. I have no reason to suppose that he knew me. He had never dealt with me before, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. You know Mr. Newman perhaps, that keeps a shop in Newgate-street - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. I should think that oil, and such sort of things might be purchased thdre - A. There is no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Do you know whether he deals in pitch and links - A. I do not know, but it is customary; most oil and colourmen do sell them.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the length of one of them links - A. About eighteen inches.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not extraordinary to have them cut in half - A. I think not, sometimes; for the little boys, who cannot raise money enough for a whole one, we cut them in half.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you belong to the same lodge of Masons that he did - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that lodge occasionally meet at the Horns, Doctors' Commons - A. Some of the members, not the lodge. It is called the Royal Arch-chapel. It is a branch of the lodge.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you made an appointment before the 11th of November to meet the prisoner on the night of the 11th - A. I had seen Mr. Smith on the night of the 11th. I believe I told him that the chapel would assemble on the 11th. I told him if it would be convenient for him to attend he would receive that part of masonry that he had not received before. Mr. Smith replied, he did not know that it would be convenient to attend; he would, if possible.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, yourself, go to the Horns that night - A. I did. The prisoner did not attend. I left the Horns a little after one o'clock in the morning. The prisoner was at my house that night. I found him there when I returned, about nine o'clock. I learned from one of his men that he would be at my house. When I went home I found the prisoner at my house and two men, Gardner and Pratton. The prisoner had a small dog with him, a white curly French dog.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did they stay at your house - A. I believe until four in the morning. They had taken rump steaks and oyster sauce. Mr. Smith drank a good deal. He was rather tipsey. He wanted to sleep in the house. I told him, I had not a bed empty; I would send the patrol to see him home. I called the patrol, and told him I would give him half-a-crown to see him home. Mr. Smith was so drunk. I sent the patrol home with him. I have known Mr. Smith two years. I have heard him spoken of as a man of character and good repute.</p>

I told him, the reports in the neighbourhood were, that he had been buying pitch and turpentine of Mr. Bull in Fleet-market. He hesitated for some time.

He was pressed very closely whether there was any thing of a combustible nature on the premises. He said, he would now mention what he had never done to any soul before, that he had bought a night or two before the fire a gallon of turpentine, and twenty-one pounds of pitch; that was all. A little after that I was left alone with him; pressed him further about the fire. He said, he had bought two links; after that, he said, he bought them of Mr. Bull, in Fleet-market. I asked him for what purpose he could have bought these things, and having them in the house. He said, they were on the premises at the time of the fire, and the turpentine was to mix up with paint, to paint his back parlour and back bed-room of Newgate-street, and his houses at Bow. The pitch was to pitch a trough, and some spouts at Bow, and that they were put in the coal-hole the pitch, turpentine, and the links. The links were to give a light while the work was done in the cellar at Bow. They were for some work which he intended to do at Bow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him whether there were any other combustibles - A. I told him these things would not do it of themselves, without there were something else applied to them. He said, there were a few shavings in the coal-hole, and in the pantry.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention how the shavings were placed with respect to the trupentine - A. He said they could not communicate together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him whether there was any fire in the kitchen, below, that afternoon - A. He said there was not any in the kitchen the whole afternoon. That was as Mrs. Smith told him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say at what time he had left his home that night - A. About half after nine at night. He said, when he went out there was not sufficient fire to warm a little milk or beer for his wife. He said, that Mrs. Smith was the only person belonging to him that was at home at the time of the fire. He put the lamps out before he left home. He also said, that his policy and all his papers were burnt.</p>
               <p>Q. You said, the prisoner said that he would mention one thing that he had not mentioned to any soul before; what was the day that he mentioned that - A. The 20th of November; nine days after the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him where he supped that night before the fire - A. He said, he supped at Mr. Thorn's, Butcher-row, East Smithfield; and that he usually spent his evening out. He went to Mr. Thorn's to treat two of his men with a supper. He frequently treated his men with a supper; he had done it twenty times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say why he went to that house - A. He said he went there to serve his friend. He had never spent three evenings before at Mr. Thorn's. I asked him the name of his tenant at Bow. He said, Nelson.</p>
               <p>COURT. Are you quite correct in his saying, I will now tell you what I never told any soul before - A. I am. Them were his very words, as if he was conveying information that was not known before.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. That is the evidence on the part of the prosecution.</p>
               <p>COURT. Does the prisoner choose to say any thing for himself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There are a few remarks I have here, if your lordship will permit the officer of the Court to read it.</p>
               <p>(Read.)</p>
               <p>My lord, and gentleman of the jury, I stand here accused of a crime of the greatest magnitude and enormity, and of which, if I am guilty, it must be under circumstances of the greatest atrocity; for, if I am guilty of setting my house on fire, I must at the same time have contemplated the murder of my wife, a woman to whem I had been married nearly twenty years, and who was the mother of my child. That I am not this monster, I trust I shall be able to satisfy you of, by the most convincing evidence.</p>
               <p>In cases of this nature, one naturally looks to the inducement of the commission of the crime. In my case there could not be any inducement for my committing it. My circumstances and situation were flourishing, no one ever clamoured at my house for money, and I was always prepared to meet every demand on me, long before the day of payment arrived; and it is a fact, that the whole of the demand I had to meet, from the time this unfortunate accident happened, until the Christmas following, (a space of upwards of six weeks), did not exceed three hundred pounds; and the probable receipts of my shop, during the same space of time, upon a comparison with the receipts of the preceding year, during the same period, would have amounted to three times that sum. The fire happened on the 11th of November. On the 4th, I made a payment of one hundred pounds; on the 5th, I paid my rent to Michaelmas, amounting to thirty-five pounds. At the time I made this latter payment, I was in possession of several hundred pounds, in money; which my landlord's clerk noticed, and is here ready to prove, but I am sorry to add, that this fell a prey to the flames. The time of year at which the fire happened was most particularly unfortunate, for the two months previous to Christmas may be considered as the harvest of our business, you may judge then, whether I would have chosen such a time of the year to effect my purpose, had I intended to set fire to my house.</p>
               <p>My prosecutors affect to throw a suspicion as to the amount of the property on my premises, because, previous to my removing my insurance to the Atlas office, I had been insured to the amount of one thousand pounds only, on my stock in trade, at the Globe office; whereas, I increased my insurance on stock, in the Atlas office, to two thousand pounds. This can be only an affectation on the part of the prosecutors, because they had every opportunity of satisfying themselves on the subject. They have examined my servants as to my property, and they are here now to be examined by you, and from their examination it will appear, that at Christmas, 1811, my stock in Newgate-street was taken, and amounted to upwards of four thousand pounds. That stock was always kept up, and in the two months preceding the fire, my purchases did not amount to less than fifteen hundred pounds. My prosecutors say, that on looking over my stock in Houndsditch, they found it come very far short of the sum insured upon it, and they therefore draw an inference that the stock in my house in Newgate-street was equally short. My answer to this is a very plain one: previously to the insurance being effected, the stock in this shop was also taken, and amounted to about thirteen hundred pounds; but being advised by my friends to confine my business to my house in Newgate-street, I had given notice of quitting my house in Houndsditch, at Christmas. My business there was breaking up, and the shop was barely supplied with stock necescary to keep it open. Had the prosecutors found an excess of stock there, they might have said, that I had removed my stock from the other shop in contemplation<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181301130022"></xptr>of the fire, and which would have been a very natural conjecture. But I shall be able to shew that there was not a removal of stock from Newgate-street, but on the contrary, that at the time of the fire my shop was fully stocked. It may be proper for me to observe here, that previously to the failure of Mr. Shoel, my principal dealer, the balance of my accompt with him stood generally at about three thousand pounds; besides this, my dealing with other persons were very considerable. What then could have been my inducement for my setting my house on fire? I could not have contemplated a fraud on the insurance office, because it appears that I was not insured at above one half my loss. Moreover, if I had contemplated a fraud on the office, it must have been contemplated from the time of making the insurance. Is it probable that I should have given notice to quit my house in Houndsditch, if I had intended to set fire to the Newgate-street house? I think you will say, no. I trust I shall also be acquitted of any intention of destroying my wife, who, notwithstanding her failings, I tenderly loved. She was, moreover, the mother of my child. By her death I have lost a comfortable income from property at Bow, which she was entitled to for her life; the loss of which I could have guarded against, by purchasing the interest of these persons who were entitled to the property in reversion, and who were desirous of selling, if I had had the gift of prescience. What inducement could I then have had for committing this heinous offence. I trust you will say, none. The fact is, that the dreadful calamity has put a stop to a most flourishing business, destroyed all my prospects, and reduced me from a state of affluence to a state of beggary; for the remnant of my property, including the amount of my insurance, would not enable me to satisfy the demands of my creditors. It must, therefore, be evident that I could not be benefitted by this calamity.</p>
               <p>The prosecutors have said that they wished to avoid this prosecution, but that they were compelled to it by the popular clamour of the neighbourhood. A man who is unfortunate seldom wants calumniators. I have not deserved ill of my neighbours, for my conduct towards them was marked by acts of kindness. They have, however, circulated a story to my prejudice, respecting my purchasing some pitch, turpentine, and links, or torches, of Mr. Bull, an oilman, in Fleet Market, the evening preceding the fire, and that I refused to let Mr. Bull send them home for me; and they have added that I made the purchase with the view of using these articles in the conflagration of my house. The latter part I most solemnly deny, but that I made the purchase of these articles, is true, and also, that I chose to take them home myself. This may, at first, to you appear extraordinary; but, when you are informed (and it will be proved), that it was almost my constant habit to be my own porter, bringing home my own joint of meat from market, bringing my two or three gallons of oil from my oilman's, and, indeed almost every thing consumed in my house, it will no longer appear so. Pitch and turpentine are things that when they are set fire to, are very active in their operations. Now, it will be proved that I left my house in Newgate-street, about ten o'clock, in the evening of the fire, for the purpose of supping at Mr. Thorn's, who keeps a public-house in East Smithfield, and that I was there about a quarter before three in the morning, when the fire broke out. Would pitch and turpentine, if set fire to, have smothered for four or five hours? I think you will say they would not. Had the fire proceeded from these articles they would have emitted a strong smell. Now, the lamp-lighter, who was the first person to discover the fire, says, that he smelt no particular smell; and, moreover, that if he had had half a dozen buckets of water he could have extinguished the fire. Could he have done so if the flames had proceeded from pitch and turpentine? I think you will say, no. Besides, had I intended to set my house on fire, I need not have gone from home for materials; for the quantity of oil consumed by me in my shop would at any time have afforded me the means of combustion. It is, however, necessary that I should state for what purpose this pitch, turpentine, and links, were purchased. I before mentioned that my wife was entitled for her life to three houses at Bow; by some means or other the water found its way into the cellars of these houses. The person who acted occasionally as my clerk, in keeping my accompts, had been formerly in the employ of a surveyor, and went with me in the latter end of the summer to examine into the matter. He recommended an efficient drain, or sewer, to be constructed, which would operate as a drain to the neighbouring houses, as well as my own; but as the neighbours did not very readily come into this plan, it was thought adviseable to carry a trough, or trunk, through the cellars of my own houses, to drain off the water, and which trunk it would be necessary to pitch well for its preservation.</p>

               <p>This was resolved on, and it was at the same time resolved that an arris gutter should be placed round the eves of one of the houses for the purpose of conveying the rain water into a butt for domestic purposes. That it would also be necessary to pitch. Pitch was also necessary for the repairs of one of the flaps that opened into the cellars of one of the houses, from the street, and it was for these pur- purposes that the pitch was purchased. The torches were for the purpose of lighting the cellars when the work to the trunk was doing, as candles had been found not to give sufficient light. As to the turpentine, that was to be used in painting at Bow, and also a part of my back shop in Newgate-street. I have been informed, that since I have been here, the prosecutors have caused the premises at Bow to be surveyed, and have found a trunk lined with lead in the cellars. It may be so; but that was a matter not within my knowledge; for, at the time Mr. Pether and I went to Bow, the water in the cellars was up to our knees, and prevented us from finding out the actual state of the place, and what Mr. Pether and myself had concluded upon, was the result of conjecture only. Coupling this explanation with the want of inducement to my committing the offence charged against me, will, I trust, prove satisfactery; and the more especially, when it is corroborated by the circumstance of one of my tenants<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181301130023"></xptr>having, within two or three days of the fire, been very pressing for the repairs being set about. It may appear strange, that I should purchase these articles in Fleet Market, which were to be used at Bow; but it will no longer appear so, when you are informed, that the Bow errand cart used to call for parcels at the next door to me. I might also observe, that if I had intended these articles for the purpose of conflagration, and wished for concealment, I should have gone a greater distance from home for them than Fleet Market, where I am known almost by every one, and which is within three hundred yards of my late house in Newgate-street, and the persons resident there are in the constant habit of passing my door, and I believe few people are better known than myself.</p>
               <p>It has also been stated as a supicious circumstance, that I purchased a considerable quantity of chips from a journeyman carpenter, who was at work repairing a house opposite to me. It is true that I did so; it was done in the face of day. Several of my neighbours had availed themselves of the opportunity of doing so, and I was equally entitled to do so with them.</p>
               <p>It is also stated, that I denied having bought the combustible articles. This I must beg leave to contradict I never did deny that I purchased the articles; but when Mr. Metcalfe informed me that it was circulated in the neighbourhood, that I had purchased the articles for the purpose of setting fire to my house, I denied that; meaning to deny that they were purchased for such purpose. Mrs. Smith too was seen, when the alarm was given, to come out of her room ready dressed, with a candle in her hands. I am sorry to say that it was too often the case for Mrs. Smith to lie down with her clothes on. She had a propensity for drink, which she too often indulged, and was very frequently in a state not to help herself. Whether the accident of the fire was occasioned by her carelessness, in a moment of inebriety, or not, I cannot venture to say; and indeed it does not, I submit, appear very clear that the fire began on my premises; but this much is certain, that she was not prepared for the accident, as there is very little doubt but that her death was occasioned by the fright.</p>
               <p>The prosecutors, before the Lord Mayor, stated, as a ground of charge against me, that I made a claim as for a total loss, without stating the particulars; this is a matter for Mr. Anbrey, my solicitor, to answer; as the claim was made under his directions. I can only repeat here that the gentleman of the insurance office had every means afforded them of satisfying themselves on the subject of my property.</p>
               <p>It may appear strange that I should be from home at the time the accident happened, and that it was an unseasonable hour for a person to be out. I do not mean to justify it; but when a man has been closely confined to his shop from eight o'clock in the morning till ten at night, he wants some relaxation; it certainly might be taken more moderately; and as to my going home that night to Hounsditch, instead of to Newgate-street, there was nothing extraordinary in it. I had spent the evening and part of the morning at that part of the town, and it was no uncommon thing for me to sleep in Hounsditch on such occasions. It has also been observed that my son had also been removed from Newgate-street to Hounsditch. There cannot be any thing extraordinary in that. My mother lived in the house at Hounsditch, and surely there cannot be any harm in his visiting his grandmother. It was a thing he often did. But the mention of these matters only serves to shew how eager people are to catch at every trifling circumstance, that may throw the slightest suspicion on another.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I leave myself in your hands.</p>
               <p>COURT, to Mr. Finch. You saw Mrs. Smith come out of the room with a candle a light in her hand - A. Yes. She went down stairs with Mrs. Finch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see upon her any marks of intoxication - A. Not then. When she was at the Old Bailey she seemed very heavy; whether it was for want of sleep, I cannot say. She appeared perfectly steady when she came down stairs.</p>

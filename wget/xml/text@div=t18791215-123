I travel in the ginger beer line, and live at 14, Red Lion Mews, Wandsworth—early on Sunday morning, 9th November, I was going home, and saw Shea opposite the Lord Clyde taking off his coat to fight Michael Collins—I knew him by sight; the young lady with him persuaded him not to fight, and he did not—Michael said "I shan't fight," or something like it—Shea was very obstinate, and used bad language—he was not sober, or he would not have raged so—the two Collins returned together, and Shea took off his coat before they came up—he had taken it off, and put it on again—they had some words, and fought—Daniel was knocked down first; he got up, and knocked Shea down, and that was tile finish—Daniel helped Shea up after he had laid there a minute—he did not attempt to kick him, nor did I hear him use bad language—I am not intimate with the Collinses; I know them by sight—I am here by subpoena.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not hear the woman say "Don't do any more; he is dying"—he did not attempt to do any more; two rounds were fought, one blow was struck in the first round" Collins Was struck in the body, and went down—not many-blows were struck in the second round; Shea was struck in the head, and fell down in the middle of the road—I heard of the inquest, but did not give evidence, as it came so suddenly, and I could not leave at five minutes' notice—I knew the prisoners Were charged, but I thought they would get on without me—I should not have come here had they not pushed me.</p>

My daughter-in-law and I went to James Collins's door to serve him with a subpoena, but we could not; I, gave three knocks, and heard him say "There is old Mother Collins coming with a summons; tell her I am not at home"—I knocked at the door gently—his mother said "What do you want?"—I said "Give this to your son."</p>

Early on the Sundjf morning I was with Holland.; we stopped against the Lord Clyde, and Shea and Mary Kelly came up; we had Half a gallon of ale in a jar; Shelf used a foul expression, and would not have any, and he said "Here, I want</p>

               <p>you; where does your brother Dan live?"—I said "What do you want to know for"—he said "I had a row with him this evening, and I want to finish with him; will you go and fetch him?"—I said "It's not likely, as he is in bed—he said "I hear you are a better man than you brother, I will fight with you, and took off his coat, and threw it down—I said "No, you won't fight me, you can hit me if you like," and walked away, and left him, and went to my brother's house, and said "Ban, Timothy Shea stopped me, and said he wasted to fight you, and if I don't fetch you out he-frill pull you out of bed—he said "1 don't want him to come here and get me out of this place; I will go and see him, and get him to put it off till to morrow"—he lived with his brother-in-law, who is in the submarine telegraph office—he got up and dressed, and went book with me to Shea, who had his coat, waistcoat, and cap off, and said come on, you are just the bloke I am waiting for," and started sparing—my brother threw off his coat, and I picked it up—Shea struck my brother somewhere in the body, and knocked him three or four yards—he fell on the kerb, and broke his braces—he got up; they sparred in front of each other; they bott struck at the same time, and Shea fell in the middle of the read—Chapple held Shea's clothes, and gave them to Alien, and said "Hit him again, and you will do him"—my brother and Allen helped Shea up; Kelly stood there, but I did not see her put her hand to him—my brother, said he was very sorry, and he did not want to fight him at all—my brother was not anxious to fight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Shea knew the street my brother lived in, but not the house, and I did not tell him, but I went to my brother's house, as I wanted something to wrap my child in, which was to be christened in the afternoon—on my oath I did not go my brother's bouse to bring him back to fight Shea, as I was man enough for it myself without my brother—Shea wanted to fight me before I left, but he did not strike me—it did not strike me to say "Don't go out and meet that infuriated drunkard; he does not know where, you live"—there was an advantage in his going out, because if Shea came round kicking up a row at my brother-in-laws house my brother would have been turned out on Monday—my brother might have gone out to try and put it off till morning—my brother and I did not attempt to kick Shea—I ran after Chapple, as he was urging the other man on, and if I had caught him I would have struck him—my brother did not run after him; he was picking Shea up—Kelly did not say "For God's sake don't do any more; you have nearly killed him; how could she?" I nad not struek him—there were two rounds, and there might have been two blows struck in the first round; in the second round they struck one another's faces together—only one blow was struck at Shea's face in the second round—I did not try to raise Shea, as my brother and Ellen were doing so—he walked home between Kelly and a stranger—I had had a drop, but Was sober—I heard that my brother had been tipsy in the afternoon, but he had time to get sober between 6 and 1 o'clock, and perhaps lying down did him good—I did not want to fight him, and I did not want my brother to do so.</p>

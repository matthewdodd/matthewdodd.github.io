                  </hi>. I am barman at the Duke of Richmond, in the Caledonian-road. The prisoners came there about three or four weeks ago—Brown asked for half a quartern of rum—I served them; they both drank it—Brown paid me with a shilling, which I discovered was bad—I told them so, and I bit a piece out of it, and gave it back to them—Brown then paid me 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the rum they had had—they went away—I saw them in custody afterwards—they were brought back to the house and searched; but nothing was found on them.</p>

               <p>On 16th June, the two prisoners came together, and called for half-a-quar<lb></lb>tern of rum—Smith gave me a shilling, which I put into the till—there was no other shilling in the till—I gave them change, and they went away together—shortly after, my attention was called to the shilling, and I found it was bad—I wrapped it in a piece of paper, and put it in the back of the till by itself—on 26th, the prisoners came in again together, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening—Smith asked for two three-halfpennyworth of gin—I served them, and they drank it—Smith gave me a half crown—I tried it, and found it was bad—I had recognized the prisoners as soon as they came in, and sent for a policeman—I accused them of passing a bad shilling on me about a fortnight previously—they at first denied it, but after a few minutes Smith said, "I will give you a good shilling for the one I gave you before, and a good half crown for this one"—in going along the road, he called me on one side and said, "For God's sake, don't be hard against me, and I will give you a sovereign if you will let us go"—when I charged them with passing a bad shilling before, Smith said he had never been in the house before in his life.</p>

Q.</hi> What day was it I offered you a bad shilling? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On Thursday, I believe—it was 16th of June, about 7 o'clock in the evening—a person called my attention to the shilling after you were gone—I said I believed the day you were at the house was about 16th June—no one told me to say it was about the 16th—(<hi rend="italic">the deposition of this witness was read, and agreed with his present statement</hi>)—when the man told me the shilling was bad, I did not send him to look for you—I looked for you myself not a minute afterwards—I marked the shilling in our house—the officer marked it at the station, I did not—there was no other change in the till but a sixpence, and that I gave you.</p>

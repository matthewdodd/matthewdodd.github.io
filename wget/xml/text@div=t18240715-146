            . We had lodgings to let for single gentlemen. The prisoner came on the 23d January and took a room, at 6 s. per week - I asked for a reference - he said he was assistant to an auctioneer, under the Piazza, Covent-garden, and lodged at Mr. Brown's, 33, Wood-street, Cheapside, to whom he referred me; and wished to come in directly. I did not go to the reference for two days, it being wet. I then told him I should go - he wished to know at what time - I said between twelve and one o'clock - he called on me at that time, and asked if his portmanteau had come - I said No. and that I had not been for his character. He staid at home till between three and four that afternoon, and then went out (he had slept there for two nights.) I went into the parlour, and missed a chain and locket from my writing-desk, and in about two hours, on going to my drawers, I missed eight spoons and the sugar-tongs. I found six of the spoons in pawn - he had the use of the front parlour, but had nothing to do with the spoons - he had breakfasted alone, in that room, both mornings. I went to Wood-street, but could find no such person, nor was he known at the auctioneer's.</p>

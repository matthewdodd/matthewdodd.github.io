            . My Lord, I know her (the Prisoner) very well: She is my Neighbour. She came on a Saturday Morning; I am a Washerwoman, and she came to help me to iron, and she took a Shirt from me the Saturday before last, a Shirt of Mr. Bowler's, and she sold it in Monmouth-Street.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that it was <rs id="t17451204-12-viclabel63" type="occupation">Mr.</rs>

               <p>Colstone. There is a Mark upon it, a little Bit of Blue, and she confess'd it before Justice De Veil.</p>

            . I live in Monmouth-Street; I sell and buy Linnen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you buy any Thing of the Prisoner at the Bar?</p>
               <p>Bowger. I bought this of her last Saturday was a Fortnight; I gave her 3 s. I took her for a very honest Woman.</p>

               <p>Colstone. This is the Shirt that Mr. Bowler lost; I am certain of it, for I made it; there is a little Hole at the Bottom of it; it's Irish Cloth, it's almost new, it was made about last June.</p>
               <p>Q. How much may such a Shirt as this be worth?</p>
               <p>Colstone. It may be worth Ten or Eleven Shillings, but I can't say exactly, because my Master bought a whole Piece.</p>

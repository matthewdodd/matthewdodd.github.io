            , Esq., of Mecklenburgh-square. On the 14th of February I was going down Holborn, about three o'clock in the afternoon - the prisoner, who was a stranger, tapped me on the shoulder, and asked if I wanted to buy some cigars, as he had some very cheap; I said I would go and look at them - he took me to the <placeName id="t18310512-158-crimeloc924">Blackamoor's Head, in Beauchamp-street, Leather-lane, which is now called the William the Fourth</placeName>

            ' ship, Tooley-street, Borough;" the prisoner said he was captain of a vessel, and he had brought this from Holland - I said I would have it, provided it was worth the money, and I was to take it to some friends to have it valued - I asked one of them to go with me; they said they would not go with me, but I must leave a deposit - I am quite sure I offered that one of them should go with me, but they said I must leave a deposit, and they named two sovereigns - I should have said, that when I first went in I said I had no money in my pocket, but they said if I went away I should not return, and I must leave 1s. as a deposit - I at last left two sovereigns, which I put into the prisoner's hand, and went out to make inquiries about it; they said they would let me have it for 2l. 10s., as I was a servant - I took it home, showed it to the cook and lady's-maid, and it turned out to be only calico, worth about 6d. a yard - the prisoner said there were twenty-eight yards of it, but I found it only twenty-two; I went back to the house, and took the holland with me - the landlord said they had left the house directly after I had left it; I have never seen my sovereigns since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I suppose you smoke? A. Yes, I smoke tobacco in general - I thought I was buying real holland; I meant nothing but honesty - I did not ask if they had paid the duty; they did say they were smuggled, but this was not smuggled; if I had found it was real holland I should have thought it had been smuggled, and I should have laid an information; at least I could have done so - I should not have thought of buying any thing smuggled; they told me it was smuggled, but their word was not to be taken - I went out, because I was no judge of it; I did not know whether it was smuggled - they swore three or four times that it was real holland; I had an idea of laying an information.</p>
               <p>JOHN BLINCOWE. I keep the William the Fourth, in Beauchamp-street, Leather-lane. On the 14th of February some persons were at my house, and I believe the prisoner was one, but I should not have known him if I had met him in the street - my bar is on the right-hand side on entering the door - I should not have remembered the prosecutor if he had not come back again with the piece of cloth under his arm, and said he had been taken in - I had seen him before in company with two men, and I really believe the prisoner was one, but I could not swear it; the men went away soon after the prosecutor did; perhaps in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, not more certainly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The fact is, this man bought the cloth of me, and paid me the money for it - I told him it was worth 5l.; he considered it was worth that, and he promised to buy three pieces more, should it turn out as I represented it - I gave him my direction; I did not say I was the captain, but I said a person would meet him at that house - it was a bona fide transaction.</p>

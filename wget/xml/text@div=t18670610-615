I am the wife of George Edwards, of 161, New Kent Road—on 27th May, between seven and eight in the evening, the prisoner came for an <hi rend="italic">Evening Standard</hi>, and gave me a bad shilling—I broke it in two—I told him it was bad, and he said he had it from an omnibus conductor—he took the pieces and paid me with good money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Capern, who keeps the Prince of Wales beershop, 185, New Kent Road, about two minutes' walk from the last witness's—between eight and nine on 27th May the prisoner came for half a pint of beer—he gave me a shilling, which I placed on a shelf by itself—after that he had some more beer and tobacco, for which he paid me in coppers—he then called for a cigar, for which he paid me with a shilling—I tried it and found it bad—I told him so, and he said he had taken it at the Grown and Anchor public-house, and he would take it back—he snatched it up—I then looked at the one he had given me pre<lb></lb>viously, and found that was bad—I told him so, and he muttered some<lb></lb>thing and walked out—he was brought back and given into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is not Monday evening rather a busy evening with you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I was not busy then—when the prisoner came in he seemed a little stupefied, but he was not tipsy—he remained about twenty minutes—I think he had on the same dress then as now.</p>

I am a carpenter—on 27th May I was in Mrs. Ca<lb></lb>pern's house—she told me the prisoner had passed two bad shillings, and asked for a policeman to be fetched—the prisoner struck me a very violent blow, which I am suffering from to this hour—I had not said a word to him—I recovered myself and called him a d—rascal; he then struck me a second blow in the mouth which shattered one of my teeth—I took hold of him, and he tried to get away.</p>

The prisoner was pointed out to me in the New Kent Road by the last witness—I went to him and said, "I want you"—he turned round and knocked me down, cut my head, and gave me a black eye—I had hold of him by a handkerchief which he had round his neck—we struggled and both fell to the ground—further assistance came up and he was taken to the station—Mrs. Capern gave me a shilling, which I had at the police-court, and Mr. Pollard saw it, but I have since mislaid it—in my opinion the shilling was bad—in the struggle he got my thumb in his mouth, and bit it nearly to the bone.</p>

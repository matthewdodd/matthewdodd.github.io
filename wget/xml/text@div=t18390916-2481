                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother Thomas—we are bakers at Heston. The prisoner was in our employ—on the even<lb></lb>ing of the 5th of September, about ten o'clock, I went into the bread-room, and found eight loaves secreted under the corner of a shelf, and a box placed before them—my brother and I marked them, and replaced them—about five o'clock the next morning I observed the prisoner go into the bread-room—he came out, with his lap full of bread, and went in the direction of the yard, where the cart was under cover—I did not see any thing more till seven o'clock that morning—I then went into the yard, aid found the bread on the tilt, which was hung over the cart, and covered with sacks, and there I found ten loaves—I then examined my stock, and found there were two more loaves gone besides the eight—the prisoner generally goes out about ten o'clock—he came round with the cart to the front door—I called a neighbour, and made some inquiry of him—I told the prisoner he was robbing me—he denied it—I got up in the cart, and found the ten loaves there in the cart—he said it was the first time, and if I would for-give him he would never rob me or any one else.</p>

I could not go to serve her immediately, she walked towards the door, I lost her all in a minute, and the same time I missed a piece of flannel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find it again. - A. Part of it. I ran to the door, she was gone out of sight, we found out where she lived. I applied to Bow Street Office. I had a warrant, she lived in Great Earl Street, the officer<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181110300048"></xptr>mark to it, the other part she had made away with. I lost it about a quarter past five, and she was taken about half past eight the same day.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with the prosecutor to No. 30, Great Earl Street. I went up stairs and enquired for the prisoner, she came out. I saw her tucking up something under the bed, I asked her what she was doing there, she said what is that to you. I got a light from the next room, I took these two pieces of flannel from between the bed and the sacking, she had a number of halfpence, and she was rather in liquor, she denied taking it, or knowing any thing about it. This is the flannel.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is my flannel, we found about a couple of yards. I can swear to it by my mark.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into the gentleman's shop for silk and thread, that I used for shoe binding, I met a man that came out of the shop, that used it for haberdashery to sell again, he said hold this bit of flannel until I came back, he did not come back. I took it home. When the officer came he said where is the flannel, I said here it is. I thought it was the man that gave it me.</p>

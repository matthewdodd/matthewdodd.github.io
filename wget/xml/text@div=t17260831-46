             thus depos'd. About 9 at Night I met the Prisoners in Barbican I knew 'em to be loose Fellows, and that they had a Design upon me. For I had put'em in the Crown-Office, and sworn the Peace against them for threatening my Death and they had sworn Treason against me for cursing the King; and therefore being afraid they would do me a Mischief, I went into the Bell-Inn, and told the People there was, 2 Rogues laid in wait for me. I staid about an Hour, and then the Ostler went with me as far as <placeName id="t17260831-46-crimeloc210">Old Street</placeName>

I told him he might go back then for I believ'd I was pretty safe, but I had not gone far before they set upon me, took away my Hat, and Wig, and 40 s. Then they put a Rope about my Neck, and haul'd me to a Bridge, that parts Cripplegate Parish and Shoreditch, and there they try'd the Rope to the Rail of the Bridge, and turn'd me over towards the Ditch, and left me hanging there by my self But how long I hung, or who cut me down, or whether I was cut down or no, I cannot tell, but I found my self lying upon the Ground, with a piece of the Rope about my Neck, and in a very deplorable Condition.

             thus depos'd. Between 10 and 11 at Night, I heard a Man making lamentable Moan by the Bridge; it was Moonlight, and I went to him, found him lying upon the Ground, with this piece of Cord (I think its a Garter) about his Neck, and another piece about the Rail, he told me that two Men had robb'd him first, and hang'd him afterwards, but who it was that unhang'd him, was more than he could inform me. The Ostler at the Bell thus depos'd. The Prosecutor came in and said 2 Men, that had swore Treason against him, dog'd him, and he was afraid to go home. I took a Gun loaded with small Shot, and went with him. - When we came to Old-street, he said he believ'd he was safe, for he could go the back Ways, and miss them. The Prisoners in their Defence, call'd several Witnesses of good Credit, to prove that they were in another Place when this pretended Robbery was committed.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi> 728). About 1.45 on the 25th January I was in Aldermanbury and saw the two prisoners there—I watched them—they were just at the corner of Love Lane, a little way from one another, there were some parcels in the doorway of 11 and 12, Love Lane—White-horn laid hold of one of the parcels, but a man belonging to the warehouse took the parcels in—Whitehorn then came across to me and had a look at me full in the face—they joined together in Love Lane, and then Andrews came and had a look at me—they joined at the top of Wood Street—I followed and watched them for about half an hour, when they went into Milk Street, where there was a barrow standing containing two baskets—I did not know what was in them at the time—they stood opposite the barrow a few yards apart—the man belonging to the barrow took out a little parcel and went into a warehouse—soon after he was gone Andrews</p>

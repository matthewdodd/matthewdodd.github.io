                  </hi>. I am messenger employed by the Imperial Ottoman Bank, 28, Throgmorton Street—on the morning of the 18th March, about 9.50, I was standing between the two counters of the bank preparing to get the bank ready, and seeing that all was right—the prisoner and another man came in—one followed the other in—the missing man asked me for a list of the drawn bonds—I said I would give him one, and I went round the counter—the prisoner was standing near the left hand counter; I went round to a desk which one of the clerks has, and where the list is strung up on a nail, and while I was looking for the list I turned my head towards the door and saw the prisoner with a parcel in his possession—I holloaed out to him lustily, and he dropped it instantly—he seemed to me as if he was going to make his escape out of the swing doors—the door is about 2 yards from the counter where that package was placed; this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the parcel—I immediately ran round from behind the counter to the front, ran up to the prisoner, and asked him what he was doing with that parcel—he said "I accidentally knocked it off the counter"—I asked him what brought him there, what was his business, and he said he came in with the other gentleman—I said "Then I must detain you"—we sent for a policeman and gave him in charge—my wife came in at the same time as the prisoner and the missing man; so she told me—the packages of the cancelled coupons were about 2 feet high on the counter, and the counter is about 3 feet high—I examined the pile of packages and found one missing besides this one; it had been taken from the top of one of the piles—there were two piles, and a package had been taken from each—there was a broken parcel; that was on the top of the one that was taken away—I saw it on the counter after I had spoken to the prisoner; previous to that it had been on the top of the pile.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The packet of loose coupons was not on the floor when my attention was called to it—I did not see anyone pick it up from the floor and put it on the counter—the counter is 3 feet high, and each of the parcels of bonds was about 2 feet high on the counter—they were arranged one on the other, and were about the same size as this parcel—I believe they were all cancelled coupons—I did not find one parcel on the floor after the missing person went out—all the" others were on the counter, except the one which was taken away by the missing man—there was no other official of the bank there—there was a young gentleman who says he saw the parcel drop from the further part of the bank—he is here—his name is Mr. Beard—I don't remember that Mr. Beard and I had a discussion as to whether some of the bundles were on the floor and had tumbled down, and were put back on the counter—I don't remember it—I don't remember that Mr. Beard said that one of the parcels was on the floor, except the one that the prisoner dropped—it was not the paying-in counter where the parcels were—there is a right hand counter and a left hand counter—the parcels were on the left counter—the prisoner was near the counter where the parcels were—the other man was about 3 yards from the door when he made the inquiry of me; between the counters—I don't recollect the prisoner saying that he picked the parcel up after he had accidentally knocked it down—when I first saw the parcel in his possession he seemed as if he was going to strike out of the door—I spoke to him, and he let it</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness—we live at the bank—on the morning of the 18th March, I was going into the business part of the bank—I went in with two men who were going in at the same time—the prisoner was one of them—my husband was dusting the counter of the office, and one of the men asked him for a form or paper, or something of that sort—and he said "Very good, sir"—he left them, walked on, and the other men followed after him and I followed him—I knew there was another man at the door, but I did not look at him—my husband had to go round the other side of the desk to get the form—I turned to go up the stairs, and my back was to them till I got to the corner—when I got there I turned to the right—they were on my right side, and I heard my husband holloa out very loud—I looked sharp round and saw the prisoner at the swing door, and I saw a parcel drop from him—it was a parcel like this produced—I saw it drop from him—the parcels were about 2 yards from the swing doors—he was backing himself out of the swing doors—his face was to me.</p>

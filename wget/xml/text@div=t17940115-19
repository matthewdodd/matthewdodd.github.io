               <p>On the 13th of December last, I was awakened by my wife, saying, what is the matter? I made answer, and said to her, I thought it sounded like a bottle, or a pot, or a kettle. I sat up in my bed, and I thought I heard the cracking of glass, as though somebody trod on it; I got up in the bed, and stood by the bedside, and undrewed the curtain; I looked out of the back window, and there I saw a man standing in the yard, which is adjoining to the room where I sleep, which I believe to be the prisoner; I says to my wife, there is somebody broke into the wash-house, and she got up and looked out, and knocked against the window; and I ran to the front door to the street, and as soon as I got that open, I saw the prisoner; he came running out of the passage, which is joining to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Does that passage communicate with the yard? - Yes, there is a wall about eight feet high.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any communication without getting over the wall? - No. There is a door, but it was fastened. The prisoner ran up the street towards White-cross-street, and I cried out, stop thief! as soon as I gave the alarm, I saw two watchmen run to meet him; the prisoner then turned up an area, a passage which is joining a baker's shop; then I lost sight of him; but I heard the watchman say. I have him; the watchman told me afterwards, that he jumped over three walls.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him in the watchmen's custody? - No, I did not, till afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards? - It might be the value of two or three minutes, I cannot say to a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing in his posseffion? - Nothing but a knife.</p>

               <p>Q. You say, you was waked by your wife on the 13th of December, what time of the night was that? - Between twelve and one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you discover any thing particular in your house? - Yes, they broke a pane of glass, and unfastened a window, and pushed it back, and they had got in.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150052"></xptr>Q. Who had fastened that window the night before you went to bed? - My wife, she is here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her fasten it? - I did not; I heard her say, she would fasten it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing there? - Nothing of my own.</p>
               <p>Q. And when the prisoner was taken, there was nothing found on him? - No, nothing, only a knife.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, you never saw the prisoner? - Never. I know nothing of him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you look, to see if anybody had been in the house? - Not till my husband said there was somebody breaking in, or broke in; but when I approached the window, there I saw a man.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the mark of any window being opened? - Not at that time, till I went round, and went and looked to the kitchen. The bar that I put to fasten the window after ten o'clock, I found in the yard, and a pane of glass broke, to shove the window back; and the window was shoved back, there were two of them; one made two attempts to scale the walls before we caught him.</p>
               <p>Q. When you looked out of window, and saw the man in the yard, can you tell, whether the prisoner was one? - I really cannot. I did not see his face, they were shortish men in brownish clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see the prisoner? - To my knowledge, I never saw him, till I saw him before the justice in Worship-street.</p>

I had not stood long with him talking, before I heard the cry of, watch! I saw the prisoner that is at the bar, advancing towards us; I said to my fellow servant, he cannot get away, there is no thoroughfare. My fellow servant took him in a kind of an area, under a knife board; my fellow servant got him up by his hands, and I got hold of his legs, and we lifted him up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing on him? - No. We took him to the watch-house, and from there to Clerken well.</p>

               <p>I was tenant at that time to Mr. Hanney; the kitchen belonged to me, and part of the house besides. I rented the first story up stairs; the kitchen is in a line with the parlour. The night the robbery is slated to be committed, I lost the things mentioned in the indictment; they were removed from the kitchen into the yard through the window; they have been in my custody ever since; the magistrate permitted me to use the children's clothes, and some things that we wanted; the articles were marked prior to the robbery with the initials of my name. These things were moved from the horse in the kitchen, through the window into the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had left them there? - My servants and my wife; they had hung them up about the kitchen as they usually do. I do not know of myself that they were there, but Mrs. Hanney do.</p>

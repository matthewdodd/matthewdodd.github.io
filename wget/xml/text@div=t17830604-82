               <p>I am servant to the prosecutors, I lost twenty-three ewes, and twelve lambs, they have two or three farms besides, we lost one sheep between the 10th and 12th of May, I saw it myself on the 10th about the middle of the day, I went to look for the sheep, and there was a ewe missing, I went and saw the skin on the Saturday following.</p>
               <p>Court. Where did you see the skin? - Down at the Rotation Office.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you know that skin? - I believe it to be the same skin when we put him in that field, it turned the skin of a black sooty colour, there was a pitch mark on it; but that was carried away.</p>
               <p>Then you did not see that? - No.</p>
               <p>Then how can you tell, was there any mark on it? - No, only smoke and dust.</p>

               <p>I was the constable of the night, and was upon duty on the 12th; about three in the morning the watchman brought a man on the Monday morning, I ordered him to go back and see what was thrown away, and he brought back this skin with the heart, liver, and lights, all fresh, and the head just cut off, while he was gone for the skin, I searched the man, and he was secreting this knife, and it was all bloody, and he had a pair of trowsers on which are here all bloody.</p>

               <p>I saw the prisoner going with a bag on his right shoulder, I followed him, and he shoved the bag into an area; I was as close to him, as I am to your Lordship, I catched him by the collar, and I said, my friend, take up the bag and come to me, he said, the bag did not belong to him, he knew nothing of it, I asked him what was become of the other man which was in company with him: I saw another man in company with the prisoner, before I stopped the prisoner; I ran after the other man first, and came back and stopped the prisoner, the prisoner had hid himself in the grove, I took him to the watch-house, and then went back and fetched the bag; I am sure I saw him throw the bag over; the bag had got half the sheep, the four quarters and the head, and the head off; and when I took it out on the table, I could open the mouth as easily as I could open my own mouth; there was nothing else in the bag.</p>
               <p>Cottrell. I cannot swear to the ruddle mark, I take it it is the smoak that comes from the still-house, and that blackens the whole.</p>

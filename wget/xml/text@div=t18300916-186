               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you told us all about it? A. I believe so; I was in a cupboard in a room - I have excellent sight - I can see through a deal board almost; I was two or three yards from the prisoner - there is a door to the cupboard; there is glass in it - if there is a door it cannot be shut - I believe there is a door, but I do not know that it has ever been shut; there were two squares of glass over a fan-light for me to look through.</p>

            . I live with the prosecutor - I remember the prisoner bringing home the clean linen and waiting for the dirty linen - I was in the shop; he had a basket; I gave him the dirty linen, and was putting down the shirts in the book; Mr. Carpenter came and said he had a parcel - he was then near the door, going out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is this cupboard? A. It is a large cupboard - I was nearer the prisoner than the prosecutor was - I was about two yards from him, and he was, perhaps, three yards further - there was some glass between him and the prisoner - I suppose the shop is five feet wide; it is very well stocked - I do not remember any stockings falling into a basket by accident - there is only a boy named

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent; I was on one side of the counter, and the shopman threw the things over - I took them and put them into the basket, and never touched the basket till Mr. Carpenter came and said I had robbed him; I said it was more than I knew - he took the things out, and this parcel was in; he said "

                  </hi>. I am a labourer at Waterside, Wandsworth. I know Onley—he was employed at Locke and Nesham's in getting bricks from the barge—a few days before Goddard was taken, I assisted Onley in getting some bricks and bats out of the mud in the dock—they were thrown out on the cart road, and afterwards put in a cart; I suppose it was Brown's, he was with it—there were three or four loads taken away at different times in that way—no ticket was given with them—I and Onley had some beer—I do not know who paid for it; I did not, and I did not see Onley pay.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Locke and Nesham. Onley was em<lb></lb>ployed to superintend the unloading of the barges at the wharf, and it was his duty to give a ticket with all that were taken away—he had no right to send away bats or muddy bricks taken out of the mud without a ticket—I saw a load at Merton, at Mr. Atkins's on 27th, which I think were worth 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on 28th Sept., in consequence of what I had seen, I asked Onley whether he had sold any old bricks, or new bricks and bats, to Mr. Brown—at first he said no, but when I questioned him more closely, he said be had sold three or four loads of bats, he thought there was no harm in selling them, as I had frequently told him not to send the bats to the prison—(I had refused a quantity of bricks and bats as well)—I then asked him whether I had ever given him leave to sell these bricks and bats—he said, no—I asked him about the price, and he said he sold them to Brown at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a load—the prisoner had no autho<lb></lb>rity to sell to Brown, and Brown had no authority to take them away.</p>

Q.</hi> Was not the first question you asked him, whether he knew of Brown taking away bats and bricks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I asked him first whether Brown had taken any bricks—he said no, and when I asked him about the bats he said yes—sometimes the barges come with very bad bricks, and we have them sorted out from the good and stacked on the wharf—that was Onley's duty, and he was to let me know if there were any bad bricks, and I should examine them—I have more than once examined bricks that were thrown on one side for me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, V</hi> 31). I took the prisoner on 28th of Sept., and told him it was the intention of Mr. Jewell to take him in custody, he had heard he had been selling bricks to Brown—he said he had sold three or four loads from the dock, and the last he got 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for—I said, "I have seen some bricks at Merton that Brown took there, and there were some whole bricks with them"—he said it was them he sold, they were taken to Merton, and there might have been some bricks among them—I got these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from Atkins—they are a fair sample.</p>

                  </hi> I live at No. 38, Trevor-square, Knightsbridge, and have a house, No. 4, Manchester-street, Marylebone. On Saturday night, the 12th of June, I applied for a man to take charge of my house, No. 4, Manchester-street—the prisoner was appointed—I gave him the keys—I told him I had a cellar of very fine old port, and cautioned him to take great.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184707050008"></xptr>
               <p>care of it—I went away at seven o'clock—all appeared safe then on Monday morning I went again, and found the house was not opened—the prisoner was standing at the door—I waited till he went in—I then knocked, and he let me in—we then opened the house, after which I said if he would call again about twelve o'clock I would settle with him—I had agreed to give him a crown, if he took care of the property from Saturday till Monday—I then went down stairs, and found the back kitchen door, leading to the back yard, and the front door, unbolted—the padlock of the wine-cellar was torn off, and the Bramah lock was cut out to let the bolt up—I went to the police-office to acquaint Sergeant Rumball, who came with me and inspected the premises—I then found two or three cwt. of lead gone, and afterwards some brass bolts and six finger-plates, some brass hooks, some wire, and some of the old port gone—Sergeant Rumball found ten bottles hid on the premises—I know them—my name is on them—they ought to have been in my cellar—I have one burgundy bottle here, the same as one that was afterwards found in the prisoner's dust-hole—I had in the cellar burgundy, champagne, claret, and old port—I had been in the cellar, I think, about three or four hours before I gave him possession.</p>

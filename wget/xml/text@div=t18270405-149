            . I am pay-serjeant of the 1st Company of Coldstreams. On the 18th of March, about a quarter to nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came into my room, pulled out a quantity of silver in his hand, and said his sister had given it to him; he asked me to take care of some of it for him; I said he had better take care of it himself, but my wife took charge of four half-crowns - he called in three or four hours, and had them back; I heard of a robbery that day, and the prisoner did not attend the parade, but reported himself as sick; he came to the barracks; the prosecutor afterwards saw him among several others, and picked him out.</p>

            . I live at the Delawar Arms. The prosecutor came there with two soldiers; the prisoner was one of them; they were there some time drinking; the prosecutor did not tell me he had been robbed - I am sure of that - I did not see them go out; no alarm was given in the house - there was no other watchmen there.</p>
               <p>Q. You told the Magistrate there were two watchmen? A. I did not know it.</p>
               <p>T. ARMSTRONG. I asked this girl which way the soldiers went - she said she did not know; I had been drinking, but was sober enough to know what I did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in the house - two watchmen were there; he hit my comrade, who said he would knock him down; he called for half a gallon of beer - he fell down much intoxicated - his partner called a coach - I heard no more till about a week after when he came to the barracks - he said he did not know rightly which the man was - I was reported by Giles through a little spite and he said, "Is this the man?" he said he did not know'</p>

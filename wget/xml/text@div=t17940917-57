               <p>I am a pawnbroker, I produce a handkerchief, a muslin neckcloth, we distinguished them from neckcloths, by calling them half handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. It is to wear about the neck? - It is; a person brought it to our shop, I cannot tell who, she used to send several people in her name.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that pawned by her? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose name was it pawned? - Raesback her own name.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I know nothing about these things at all, as to the half handkerchief it belongs to my husband, I told him that I gave them all the liberty to search after these articles, I was not left in the house by myself, I was not trusted with the keys or any thing, or go up into the room without their going with me; I had not the liberty to be trusted where one thing was, not one thing. The prosecutor sent word down to me last Monday morning, that if I would even own to the things, he would say nothing at all about it, but let me clear; I would have done any thing to have got clear, for the sake of this child in my arms which is in a dying state, I have been in this dismal place for this month.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. When was this woman committed? - About three weeks ago. I know this handkerchief, it was made by me, back runned instead of being hemstitched.</p>
               <p>Q. What is her husband? - A coach harness maker.</p>

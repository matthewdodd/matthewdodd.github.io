               <p>On the 31st of July last, between nine and ten at night, a few doors off my house a gentleman told me my pocket was picked of a silk handkerchief, I found it was gone, the prisoner was close to me, I turned about and charged him with it, he denied having my kind of knowledge of it whatever, I told him I should take him to the watch-house immediately, and on endeavouring to secure him, I saw him put his hands behind him, and throw it into a gentleman's area; I then took him to the watchhouse, and gave him in charge; I did not stop to take up the handkerchief; as soon as I had secured him I returned for my handkerchief, and the servant immediately brought it up to me from the area, and gave it me in the presence of the gentleman who informed me I had been robbed; that handkerchief was mine, I am sure it was the handkerchief I had in my pocket, I am quite sure I saw him throw it down.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On Sunday the 31st of July, between nine and ten at night, being in the street where the prosecutor lives, I observed a man take the handkerchief out of his pocket, and drop it, the prisoner took it up, and put it in his right hand coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. How near was the prisoner to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140075"></xptr> the other person? - He was behind the other person.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner so situated that he could see the other take it out of his pocket? - I should suppose so, he was but a very little behind; I saw the prisoner when he picked it up, not before.</p>
               <p>Court to Elliot. When you laid hold of the prisoner, and charged him with the handkerchief, did he deny having the handkerchief? - Positively, several times.</p>

               <p>I picked up the handkerchief walking along.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness who gave him a very good character.</p>

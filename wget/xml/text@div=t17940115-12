               <p>I was at the sign of the Royal Hospital about eight or nine o'clock the 19th of last month, which was on a Thursday; the waterman at the coach stand informed me that there was a cheese put into the first coach in the stand, as such I immediately went out, the coachman came up as I was opening the door to look into the coach, I says to the coachman, is this your cheese? the coachman had been in the public house, he makes answer and says no, I said, don't you know how it came into your coach, he said no; I see the prisoner at the bar about two yards from me, and I asked him if it was his property? and if he had put it in there; he made answer and said yes, I then asked him how he came by it? he informed me that a man gave it him, opposite Durham House; I asked him if he knew the man? he said no, he was a stranger, on his giving me that kind of answer I seized him, as such I went and put him into our watch-house, on going there he informed me he found it among some shavings, at a place called Mr. O'Fear's gates, in Paradise-row; on his saying he found it there I had a greater suspicion of him, because I knew it was a very dirty place, and it was a dirty night, and the cheese was remarkable clean, as dry as it is this moment.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him to encourage him to this conversation? - No, as I was going along further with him I met the gentleman that had been robbed, he told me he had lost two cheeses, and he could swear to it.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Was there any mark on the cheese that you lost? - Yes, a W. it was put on in the wholesale dealer's shop.</p>

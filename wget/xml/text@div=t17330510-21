            , Watchman. The Prisoner walk'd slowly by me in Grafton street. The Woman came up and said he had robb'd her. I follow'd him to Newport-market and took him. - He's a Cocker, and she plays at Cups and Balls. The Justice sent her to Tothill-Fields Bridewell, to secure her till she came hither to give Evidence.</p>
               <p>Court. What Justice was that?</p>
               <p>Reno. Justice. -</p>
               <p>Court. He went beyond his Authority then; He ought to have known better.</p>

            , When the Prisoner took your Pocket, did he strike you, or threaten you, or put you in fear?</p>
               <p>E. J. No, he only snatch'd my Pocket, and that surpriz'd me a little, but he did not beat me, nor hurt me, nor threaten to do me and Mischief.</p>
               <p>Court. Then the Prisoner cannot be guilty of this Indictment. You may if you will indict him again for Felony.</p>
               <p>E. J. I did not desire to indict him at all as long as I got my Pocket again. I have suffer'd enough already by being kept in Bridewell, and now the Watchman will carry me back again, and keep me for my Fees.</p>
               <p>Court. They must not do that. - Do you hear [To the Watch.] Take this Woman to the Justice that committed her, and let him discharge her directly. - He has done more already than he can answer.</p>

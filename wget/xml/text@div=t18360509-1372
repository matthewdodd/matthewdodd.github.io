                  </hi>. On the 4th of April I was servant to Mr. Hick, of No. 149, High-street, Borough, next door but one to Mr. Ruck. On the morning I paid the prisoner a bill of 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which my master owed to Mr. Ruck—I gave him three half-crowns, one shilling, and one pennyhe signed my book, which I kept for that purpose—it was as near to half-past eleven o'clock as I can recollect—I did not see what he did with the money.</p>

                  </hi>. I saw Williams come to the shop—she put down three half-crowns, one shilling, and one penny, and gave the book to Caulfield—I saw him take the money, but I did not see him put it any where—I only took two-pence, and six-pence out of the till that morning.</p>

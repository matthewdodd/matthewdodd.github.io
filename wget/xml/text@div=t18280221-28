               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When the deceased said he had told his master a lie, he was in the pit? A. Yes; the prisoner was twelve or fourteen feet from him- he took the adze up as the deceased was getting out of the pit; the prisoner did not call him any name before the deceased told him he had told his master a lie.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he throw a wooden weight at the prisoner? A. No; nothing of the kind, I am sure of that.</p>

            . I saw Bowden and the deceased at work; the prisoner came up from his master, and said he wanted some tool - Corkwell said he should not have them- he said he would go and tell his master - he went away;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210042"></xptr>this was about eleven o'clock in the morning; I was there between two and three in the afternoon, and Corkwell then said to the prisoner, "If ever you go and tell your master such a lie of me, I will clout your head;" James said, "So you did," and called him an ill name; Corkwell said, if he called him that name again, he would get out of the pit and clout his head; he did so, and Corkwell got out of the pit; James took up an adze, and threatened if he came to him he would cleave his skull; Corkwell went up to him, and as he was in the act of striking at him, he took the adze from him, and pushed or struck him - I do not know which; James went towards a piece of timber, very near, and took up a chisel, which I produce; he threw it at Corkwell, and it stuck in his thigh; the deceased fell down with it in his thigh - I took him up, and set him on a piece of timber; the prisoner staid about a minute or two, and then went away - I went for the doctor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the deceased a full-grown man? A. Yes; he was much stronger than the prisoner; the deceased gave the first push or blow - he came three or four yards towards the prisoner; the prisoner used no offensive language till he told him he had been telling lies; I was there when Leicester came; the adze and chisel were both laying about.</p>

            . The deceased worked for me. I sent the prisoner to the deceased for some tools, and in consequence of the answer he brought, I went myself; the deceased said the lad had brought me a false message - that he said no such words, and Bowden agreed with him; I said, "Well, I would have what I came for," and took the oil, which the men had taken while I was at breakfast; the deceased said the prisoner had spoken wrong, and he would chastise him for it; I said, if he could do without it, it would be better, for I never lifted my hand against the boy, and I thought he might do without it, and if he did, he should cut that job, and do no more for me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had the prisoner been in your service? A. From the 10th of September - he is about sixteen years old - he behaved quite as well as I could wish.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was he a good-humoured lad? A. Yes, always, when I was present; when I was away they used to find fault with him; he was in Tothill-fields part of the time the deceased was alive; I bailed him out.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I saw the deceased on the 8th of November; he had lost a great deal of blood, and was very faint from the wound in his thigh, which I examined; the chisel produced was likely to cause such a wound; he recovered a little, but never properly; he died on the 21st of January, in St. George's-hospital; the wound was between two and three inches deep; the wound, and the absecess formed from it, occasioned his death.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were there not abscesses formed in the region of the stomach? A. None at all.</p>

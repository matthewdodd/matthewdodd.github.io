On the 8th of May, I had nine napkins, some stockings, and an apron in my boiler - they are my husband's property - I saw them safe at eleven o'clock that night, and I missed them in the morning as soon as I got up - I went to the prisoner Scholey's shop on the 9th of May - I asked if she had any napkins - she said she had none, and had not bought any - she denied it to me and the officer for a long time, and at last she said, "If I give up the property, would you wish to make a confusion?" - I said, "No" - the officer then said, "I think you have got this person's property, give it up" - and then she found these napkins - they had been marked, but the marks have been taken out - she said she bought them of a boy whom she did not know.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where they had any marks when they were brought to her you do not know? A. No; they were marked when I had them in my copper; but I know them - I have washed them many times.</p>

             (police-constable C 120). I was on duty on the 9th of May, and the prisoner Stockman came, and said he wished to give himself up to me, as the officers were after him - I asked what for? - he said, he had found a bundle, and some people said he had stolen it - I took him to the station, and, from information, I went to Scholey's house to look for some stockings - while I was looking for them, the prosecutor came in to inquire for some napkins - Scholey said she had none - I said I thought she had- she went into the back-room, took some things off a chest, and pulled out one napkin, she then pulled out the others.</p>

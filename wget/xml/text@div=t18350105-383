                  </hi>. I live in Friar-street, Kingsland-road. On Christmas-eve, I bought a pair of trowsers in Hampstead-road—I went towards my own home, but missed my way—I was a little intoxicated—I had my trowsers over my right arm—the prisoner came and snatched them from me—I tried to save them, and fell down—with my falling, the policeman could not get near the prisoner, and he made his escape.</p>

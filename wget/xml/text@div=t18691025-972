                  </hi>. I live at No. 1, Wellington Street, Rotherhithe, and am a hairdresser—on the afternoon of 19th October, about 1.30, I was in the Deptford Road—the prisoner overtook me, and by his invitation I went into the Windmill public-house—I have known him fifteen years he called for a quartern of rum, which he paid for—about a minute or so after we bad been in the public-house, the prisoner looked out of the window and said, "Who is this coming here?"—I went to the window, and saw that it was Abrahams—I told him to—Abrahams came into the house this spoke first, and said to the prisoner, "Halloa, Joe; you have beaten me to-day, you are here first"—Welsh replied, "You have beaten me this morning; I will have my money"—Abrahams said, "I will pay you, but not what you want"—Abrahams then said, "Well, let the work be judged by Mr. Finlen, Crackwell, or any other competent man you like; I will pay you all they say it is worth"—Welsh said, "When?" Abrahams replied, "Once within a week"—Welsh then said to me, "Mr. Fox, I have done the work for Abrahams, Abrahams has received his money, and he won't pay me mine"—I said, "Whatever differences there may be between you and Mr. Abrahams, you can settle without my interference"—Abrahams then handed me a Police Court summons—I have it here—it is a plaint for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for work done, taken out by Welsh against Abrahams—I knew nothing about the summons—Abrahams handed it to me, and said, "Read it, Mr. Fox, that will explain all"—he knew that I had known Welsh for many years, in fact, I have known them both an equal period, ever since I have been in the neighbourhood of Rotherhithe, that is fifteen years—Abrahams said, "Well, I will have a glass of ale; Fox, have you got any money?"—I said, "Yes—he said, "Lend me sixpence"—I did so, and Abrahams called for a pint of ale; be offered a glass to Welsh, he would not accept it—he said, "I would not drink with such a man as you are"—I was reading the summons, and I saw Welsh make a push at Abrahams with his two hands thus (<hi rend="italic">describing it</hi>)—it was a push, not a blow—Abrahams did not advance towards him, but he advanced towards Abrahams, and pushed him—Abrahams said, "Joe, keep your hands down; talk as long as you like, but keep your hands down;" and Abrahams put his open hand within about six inches of Welsh's face—I suppose they might have been two feet apart at the time, an arm length, and six or eight inches over—Welsh said, "If you could serve your wife in that way, you cannot stop my tongue"—I said, "Welsh, lot the dead rest, you ought to know better"—Abraham's wife had been dead about three years—Abrahams remained in the same position, with his ale in front of him—I was reading the summons, and I saw Welsh force Abrahams on to a seat, underneath the window on the opposite Me of the bar, at the back of me; he then retreated back from him, about 4ft.—I heard somebody call out, "Look out, Fox, Joe has got a knife"—I don't know who it was said that, someone in front of the bar; that caused me to turn round, and I then saw Welsh almost upon Abrahams, and the knife within about six or eight inches of his belly, and When wrote it into Abrahams' bells, before I could get hold of him scarcely—I pulled him from Abrahams with my right hand, and pulled Abrahams off the seat with my left, and thrust him out at the door, and followed him—I was standing in the door way Abrahams</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186910250112"></xptr>
               <p>outside and Welsh in, and Welsh was making an advance towards me, and I said, "Joe, get away"—he then had the knife open at his hand—it was a white-handled knife, 8 in. or 9 in. long, with a spring back—I did not see the handle then; I saw the blade—I did not observe whether there was any blood upon it—in consequence of what Abrahams said, I took him into the tap-room and examined him—I undid his trowser and found blood on his shirt, at the left side of the belly—I did not notice anything protruding then—I went outside and a policeman was called, and Welsh was taken into custody—I then took Abrahams inside again, and made a further examination, and I then saw the intestines protruding—I put him into a cab, and he was driven, first to the police-station, and then to Guy's Hospital.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You seem to have been reading the summons? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I don't think anybody could have seen much more of the transaction than I did—I saw a push; there was no scuffle—I saw Welsh push Abrahams on to the seat; there was no scuffle on the part of Abrahams—there was no scuffle, I did not see it—I was not with my back exactly to the two men—they were standing, as it might be, at the side of me—I know Phillips—I believe he would tell the truth in the matter—I can't think that anything could have happened which I did not see while I was reading the summons—I was not in the public-house three minutes before Abrahams came in—he was a carpenter and joiner—I had not seen him since the Sunday before this—when I went into the public house with the prisoner, I did not see Abrahams—I should think the public-house is a mile from the Police Courts—the prisoner did not say a word to me about Abrahams before he made his appearance—I can't say that he knew any<lb></lb>thing about Abrahams being about to come there, he had not mentioned it to me—Abrahams was a man very prone to <hi rend="italic">chaffing</hi>, and when he was the worse for liquor he was very irritating and insulting—he did not speak in that style to the prisoner that day—he said "Halloa, Joe, you haw beaten me to day," in a sort of light-hearted manner, not in a <hi rend="italic">chaffing</hi> way—I can't call it <hi rend="italic">chaffing</hi>—I was not reading the summons when Welsh pushed towards Abrahams with his two hands—Phillips was standing at the side of the bar—Welsh touched Abrahams and pushed him back—he pushed towards him, and Abrahams came back with the push he received—Abrahams was not advancing towards him—he was very near him, and he put one hand close up to Welsh's face, so—it was his left hand, I am quite sure of that, and it was open—he put it within 6 in. or 8 in. of his face—it was after that I commenced to read the summons, and it was while I was reading it, that I saw Welsh force Abrahams on to the seat underneath the window—I could see what occurred immediately before that, although I was reading the summons; they were at the side of me, and I could see what was going on; if I am looking fit you I can see my lord at the same time—nothing happened before but what I have repeated—I should imagine a scuffle to be, two men struggling together—I did not see any<lb></lb>thing of that sort.</p>

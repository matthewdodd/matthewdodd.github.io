                  </hi>. I live at High Street, Liverpool—my son alto lives in Liverpool—about the beginning of May I expected from him three bales of goods—he notified to me that they had come—one of them consisted of blankets and bedding—the other two contained men and women's apparel—the value of these two bales was 71<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 6th May I saw the prisoner at the Oakley Arms—I told him I would give him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. if he would go to the railway to receive some goods—I had never seen him before—he went with me to King's Cross—I asked for one of the three bales, which was given to me—that one contained the blankets and bedding—I told the prisoner the value of the other two bales—I took the one out to pay the carriage of the other two—I went with the prisoner to a pawnbroker's, and pawned the bale—I gave the prisoner 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he went away, and I did not see him again till</p>

               <p>he was in custody—I went to King's Cross to get the remaining bales, and I was then shown an order for their delivery, showing that someone else had taken them away—I did not give the prisoner or anyone else autho<lb></lb>rity to receive the two bales that were left—the order is not in my writing—I saw the prisoner on the 3rd, in the Waterloo Road, and gave him into custody—he was wearing a coat, a shirt, and handkerchief, which had been taken out of one of the bales—I am quite positive of that—I never gave the prisoner any of those goods, or anyone else.</p>

I am a porter at the goods office of the Great Northern Railway Company, King's Cross—previous to Thursday, 6th May, three trusses of goods were deposited there, in the name of Mr. Healey—about 1 o'clock on that day Mr. Healey and the prisoner came to the office, and on receiving an order from the delivery clerk, I handed to Mr. Healey one of the three trusses, and he took it away—next day, the 7th, the prisoner came to the office with another man, between 8 and 9 o'clock—the delivery clerk handed me this order (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I was at the counter at the time—I handed the prisoner the two remaining trusses, and I assisted them to load them into a cart which they brought with them—I did not see what name was on the cart—they then drove away—I am quite sure the prisoner was the man who came before with Mr. Healey.</p>

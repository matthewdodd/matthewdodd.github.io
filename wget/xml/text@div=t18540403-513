On Saturday evening, 25th Feb., the prisoner came to my shop and asked for a pennyworth of tobacco—I served him—he paid with a sixpence—I perceived it to be bad directly he laid it on the counter—I said "Where did you get this?"—he said he got it from Windsor—I asked him if he had any more—he said no, only a shilling he had in his mouth—he spat it out, and held it in his hand—I saw it, and to the best of my belief it was bad—he did not give it me—he drew back and went out—he did not get the tobacco nor the sixpence—I gave information to a policeman, and gave him the six-pence—this is it—here is where I marked it.</p>

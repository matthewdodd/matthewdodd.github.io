            . On the 9th of December last I was going of an errand; I saw two men go into Mr. Joslyn's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the person of either of them - A. I I am sure the prisoner is one of them; I saw a hand take a piece of cloth from the window on the inside, then the two men came out immediately; I turned myself short round, and put my hand upon each shoulder of the prisoner, and told him it was not his property; he had the piece of cloth between his coat and waistcoat; I saw the end of it hanging down by his knees. I called Mr. Joslyn, stop thief, Joslyn; the other that was with him come and gave me a push of one side, and they both ran off. This was about four o'clock; I did not see them afterwards.</p>

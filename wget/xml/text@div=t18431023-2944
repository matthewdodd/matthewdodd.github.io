                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live at Harrow. In the beginning, of Aug. the prisoner came to my house, represented himself as a Sheriffs' officer, and offered to collect debts for me—I employed him to do so—he was to have 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for debts under 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for debts of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and upwards—I had a debt of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. due from Alfred Dixon—I gave that to the prisoner to collect.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> I did not say that I was a special officer of the County Court of Surrey? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—you said an officer of the Sheriffs' Court, of London—I had two debts due to me, one from Dixon, and one from Herrick—I will not swear whether I gave you one or two debts to collect—I did not give you authority to receive the money—it was to be paid at my house—I gave you this authority—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I did not see any printed notice folded up by you, nor was one read over to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Herrick, of Bushy. On the 18th of Aug., the prisoner called on me, and produced a paper which I handed to the Magistrate at Edgeware—he said Mr. Goodwin authorized him to collect the debt—I owed Mr. Goodwin 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said it did not lay in my power to pay him then, and asked him if the paper was a summons—he said he belonged to the Sheriffs' Court, he would call on the Monday or Tuesday—I said if he called on Tuesday, I would endeavour to get him some money—he called, and I gave him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he receipted it on his own printed Paper for Mr. Goodwin, as he said—I intended that 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for Mr. Goodwin, in part of his debt—the prisoner was to call again—I told him I was not satis<lb></lb>fied</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> I saw the prisoner in the course of a day or two after this—he said he had served Mrs. Herrick with another order, and that was 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and she had paid him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of the expences, which amounted to 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. altogether—I paid him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the first order myself.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> The prosecutor called on me; he asked if I could collect debts in any county; I said yes, I was a special officer of two or three counties; he told me to call, and he would have a list ready for me; he gave me my authority; I applied to Herrick, she paid me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and pro<lb></lb>mised to pay 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a month, but the month was not elapsed when I was taken; I told him Herrick had paid the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but having the general authority to col<lb></lb>lect his debts, I did not think it necessary to pay him till the whole was paid; I had not absconded; I was living within six or seven miles, and had given out cards in the neighbourhood.</p>

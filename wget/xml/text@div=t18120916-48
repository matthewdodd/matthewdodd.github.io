               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner on the 21st of July - A. Yes, he came to my shop on the 21st of July. I was washing myself in the kitchen; there were several customers in the shop. The prisoner stood by the horse of shoes; he looked very earnest, as if he wanted to be served; and seeing him go out of the shop with his hat to his face, I went after him; and when I came up to him, I said, my friend you have got something I believe of mine. He said, I have got none of your shoes; he threw the shoes down, and said d - n your shoes. I said, if you do not want them, I do; and I will have you as sure as ever you have got a head on your shoulders.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would wish to know, whether any one else sells shoes in his shop during his absence.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Yes, my wife and daughter. These are the shoes; I saw him throw them down. I was close by the side of him: I picked them up. They were given into the custody of Read, the officer. I marked them before I gave them to Read. I am sure they are my property. And they are the shoes the prisoner threw down. I marked them on the bottom, at my first appearance at Hatton-garden, just before I gave them up to the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your wife in the shop at the time - A. I don't think she was.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was entirely intoxicated in liquor. I did not know what I was doing. I promised to buy a pair of shoes or two for a young woman; she was my wife. I spent the money, and had not a farthing in my pocket.</p>

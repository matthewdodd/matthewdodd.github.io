                  </hi>. I keep the Seven Stars, at North-end, Fulham. On the 20th of May the two prisoners and Liddy came to my house—Liddy called for some gin—he gave me a good sixpence—Flood asked for a pio of ale—I served her, and she gave me a shilling, which she untied from the corner of her handkerchief—I put it into a small wooden bowl in the till where were two or three fourpenny pieces and two sixpences, but as other shilling—they drank the ale at the bar, and then went into the tap-room—Liddy then came out, and spoke to me, and brought me a had shil<lb></lb>ling—I looked into the wooden bowl immediately, and found the shilling which Flood had given me was bad—in about a quarter of an hour Tustin came from the tap-room—she called for a bottle of spruce, and gave me a bad half-crown—she went back to the tap-room, and I sent for a constable—before the constable came the prisoners came out of the tap-room, and went a little way, but not out of my sight—I fetched them back—I gave the two shillings and the half-crown to the officer—I marked them in his presence.</p>

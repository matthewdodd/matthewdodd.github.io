               <p>Q. Was the prisoner a servant or a stranger? - A stranger. I was in the shop alone, sometimes I serve in the shop; he came into the shop, on Monday, the 3d of August, between the hours of eleven and twelve, to the best of my recollection; he desired to see some metal lockets; I took four out of the window, two plain ones; one enamelled one, and another; the one that I missed was the only one we had in the house of the sort, an old locket, this was an oval one, the other three were round ones; he wanted something shewy, as it was to make a present of to a young woman; I pointed out this locket in particular to him, and he took it in his hands and looked at it; he then pointed to a gold locket in the window, with his finger, but did not touch it, that had a device on it, and said he wanted something like that; I took out that locket and told him it was gold, and it would come much higher than he would like to go to; he looked at it and returned it to me again, and said, if it was gold it would; I put it into the window again, when I turned round I missed the oval locket which I shewed him before.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160099"></xptr>Q. Then you turned from him to put that locket in the window? - I was obliged to, to get at the window. I said, what was become of that locket which I had pointed out to him as best suiting his purpose? he said I had taken but three out of the window, and they were all there; then I said, that I would take my oath that I had taken four out of the window, and I could find but three; he then desired I would search him; I said, it was a disagreeable thing for me to search any body, what could become of that locket? and there was only him and I in the shop; in the mean time our young man,

            , came in; I acquainted him with the circumstance, and he asked me if I was sure that I had taken four lockets out of the window? the prisoner desired again to be searched; Mr. Ham said, if he would turn out his pockets it would be sufficient, and out of his coat pocket he took out a silk handkerchief, and Mr. Ham took up the handkerchief and shook it, and out fell the locket.</p>

               <p>Q. In what pocket was the handkerchief? - In the left hand coat pocket; I see it drop from the handkerchief.</p>

I gave it to the constable.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you a wife?</p>
               <p>Comber. I have, and two children, they were not up. When I came home to breakfast at eight the prisoner was gone. We did not miss any thing then, till my wife sent to me at noon. On the Sunday Evening I accidentally met with the prisoner in Swallow-street: I charged her with taking the things mentioned in the indictment, she did not deny it, but would not tell me what she had done with them. I got a constable, and she was taken to the Gatehouse that night, and on the Monday morning before justice Cox; there she owned that she had pawned them in Great Poultney street, at the three golden balls; I went and found them accordingly. [ Produced in Court, and deposed to.]</p>
               <p>Thomas Lane. I am a constable. I was charged with the prisoner, and went to the pawnbroker, and found the things; I do not know the pawnbroker's name, but I went by the prisoner's directions; the pawnbroker delivered them without paying any thing for them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in her defence.</p>

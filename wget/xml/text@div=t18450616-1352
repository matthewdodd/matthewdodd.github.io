I am the wife of James Matthews, and live at No. 94, White Lion-street, Pentonville, in the parish of St. James, Clerk<lb></lb>enwell; it is our dwelling-house; we rent the house, and live in it; we let lodgings; the prisoner lodged in the house. On Wednesday I remem<lb></lb>ber counting thirty sovereigns in the prisoner's presence, in my own room—when I had counted them I put them into a purse, and put them into a little box, which I locked and sent up stairs by my daughter, who is eleven years old—she is not here—I saw it that same night on the table where it always stood—the prisoner slept in that room with the little girl,</p>

               <p>myself, and another daughter—it was my money—I did not miss the box till the Tuesday after, between five and six o'clock in the evening—I had not unlocked it or seen the sovereigns in it from the Wednesday—I always kept the key of it, and had it on the Tuesday in my pocket—the key was not in the lock when I sent the box up by my little girl—I mentioned my loss directly—the prisoner heard me say, "Where is my little box gone?" and she searched and said, "Where can it be, where can it be?"—she seemed confused—she was given in charge next day—she was seven weeks in the house—she has borrowed 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of me two or three different times—I have never seen the box since—I do not recollect much about seeing it between the Wednesday and Tuesday.</p>

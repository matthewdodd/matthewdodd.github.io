            . I am the son of John Burridge, of Hammersmith - he is a dealer in marine stores. On the 22d of February I saw the prisoner at our house with a van - he left six dozens of bottles in a hamper, and told me to look over them, and tell him what they came to; when he came back I counted them, and paid him for them - I told my father of it; I had seen him there before selling bottles; I helped him with the hamper out of the van, but I did not notice the van at that time.</p>
               <p>JOHN BURRIDGE. My son communicated what took place between him and the prisoner; 6s. was paid to him for the bottles - he came again on the 29th; I sent a letter to Mr. Man - he came again with sixteen dozens of bottles, and was taken.</p>

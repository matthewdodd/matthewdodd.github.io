               <p>John Fosset. Between 2 and 3 in the Morning, Feb 5. the Watchmen call'd me up, and told me my House was broke open; several of my Pales in the Yard was pull'd down, and the Back Door of my House was forc'd open. The Rogues when they had got into my Yard, took out some Glass from a Window near the Door, and I suppose they put their Hands in and unbolted the upper Bolt, and the bottom Bolt they wrenched off, and the Batten of the Door likewise. They took the Things mention'd in the Indictment. We found 5 of my Plates that very Night in Bullock's-Court, which is next my House, and the Prisoner was taken the same Time.</p>

This Man, here, came to the Watch-house, and says he, - Peat, I want a Hand; I lent him a Hand, and they went out without their Lanthorns; and in about half an Hour afterwards they caught the Gentleman: He did the Fact, (by Report) but he said there was another with him, - as brave a Thief as any is in England. The Prisoner was mighty Obstrepolous, and I was forced to punch him on the Stomach to make him civil - like an old Soldier, - I have no more to say, - but have done - all at once.</p>

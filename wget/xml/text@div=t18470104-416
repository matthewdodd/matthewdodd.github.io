I was on duty in St. Paul's-churchyard on the 1st of Jan., and saw the prisoners there—I followed them into Cheapside—there was a crowd at a window—I saw Rees attempt to pick several gentlemen's pockets there—I saw him take a handkerchief from Mr. Wheeldon's pocket, and pass it to Webb, who put it under his coat, under his arm—I took them both into custody—Webb took the handkerchief from under his arm, and threw it down on the pavement—another officer picked it up—this is the handkerchief—I told the prosecutor his pocket was picked, and he claimed the handkerchief.</p>

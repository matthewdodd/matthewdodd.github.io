From suspicion, I took a constable with me, we went to Perkins's-buildings, No. 5; the same evening that I missed them; I got to No. 5, Perkins's-buildings, between seven and eight; I and the constable went into the prisoner's room; we found the sheets.

I found five sheets in all in the prisoner's room. I missed four from the yard, and one out of the back room.</p>

            's gardener gave me information; I went down her field, and examined her hay stack - the stack appeared diminished; I got a stick, and measured the footsteps across the field, and traced them out of the field into the road - I found hay dropped all along the road for nearly half a mile, to a shed in Chapel-side, by Bayswater chapel - the shed was fast; we found Govier in the shed, and Read in the yard adjoining - I saw two bundles of hay there, tied up, and some undone; I took them both into custody - I asked Read when he had the hay in; he said,"This morning;" it was Read's shed - he keeps cows, and sells milk; this was about eleven o'clock in the morning -Govier said he knew nothing about it, that he had come there, as he had two hogs; there were four pigs there - I took them both before the Magistrate; the hay corresponded in quantity with what had been cut - Govier's shoes were taken off, and corresponded in length with the footmarks; there was a particular row of nails round the heel; Read said he had bought the hay that morning, at seven o'clock, on the Uxbridge-road, in three trusses, from a little cart, which came towards London - I told him it was not market morning; he said he had left a knife at his lodging, which he had used to cut some hay for Mrs. Johnson with, but I found it in the shed, under the loose hay.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he not say he gave 1s. 9d. a truss for the hay? A. Yes; these bundles of hay were not exactly the weight of a truss.</p>

            . I am in Mrs. Johnson's employ. I saw her hay-stack safe on Sunday, and on Monday I found hay had been cut from it, and told Harris; I consider the hay found to be the same - I employed Read to cut hay sometimes; there appeared to be three or four trusses in all found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At what hour did you miss it? A. Nine o'clock in the morning; it might have been stolen in the night.</p>

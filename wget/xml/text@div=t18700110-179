                  </hi>. I am a seaman, and am now living at 28, Usher Road, Old Ford—in 1867 I belonged to a ship called the <hi rend="italic">Fusiyama</hi>—I joined that ship at Sidney—while I was in her I came across the <hi rend="italic">Maggis Leslie</hi> in Caspar Straits—we found her in distress and got her into Batavin—I came home overland, leaving other persons to bring the <hi rend="italic">Maggie Leslie</hi> home—I arrived at Southampton on 1st January, 1868, and I went to my parents' residence, No. 4, Mitford Cottages, Library Road, Old Ford, London—I lived with them up to the present year, except the time I was away with the ship a few days—my mother and father and two brothers and sisters and some lodgers lived there—we removed from Mitford Cot<lb></lb>tages in August, 1868—previous to that I had been at work at the chemical works of Messrs. Lewis, at Hackney, for about four weeks, from April to May—I went at 6 o'clock and left at 6 at night; but sometimes I worked over<lb></lb>time—on one occasion I was there all night, and on another occasion the best part of the night—I went there in my own name—I went in the place of a man named Richardson, who was discharged—on the 18th June the <hi rend="italic">Maggie Leslie</hi> left London—I joined her—we arrived in Newcastle on the 24th June—I stayed at Newcastle about six days, and arrived home on 2nd July—I lodged at James Conway's at Newcastle—during the whole of the time I was in London I never lodged at Henry Fayle's, at 8, Commercial Place, Commercial Road, Limehouse—it is not true that I lodged with him and slept there, and was there daily from 25th March until 16th July—it is quite false; I slept nowhere but at my parent's residence—I did not agree to pay him a guinea a week for board and lodging—I had seen Fayle before he brought the action—I saw him at his own residence about the end of February or the beginning of March, 1868—I met a shipmate named O'Brien in the East India Road—he was one of the shipmates of the <hi rend="italic">Fusiyama</hi>—we walked along the street until we came to the defendant's house—he said, "I am going in here a few minutes," and I went in as far as the shop—he came outside, and the defendant with him—as soon as I came outside a man named Buzzard was going up to have his affidavit read, and we went to Mr. Oldershaw's office, in Doctor's Commons, to hear it read—I saw the defendant again, a few days after—I was passing by there, and</p>

               <p>I saw him with the steward, and I went up to the City with them to say I would not sign any papers—they wanted me to sign some documents, and I went up to say I would not sign them—the other men were claiming salvage from the <hi rend="italic">Maggie Leslie</hi>—Buzzard came home in her, I believe—he was entitled to salvage—we went to Mr. Oldershaw's about his claim, and I afterwards employed Messrs. Pritchard as my proctors—I only saw the defendant three times until he brought this claim against me in the Lord Mayor's Court—after I refused to sign the papers I did not see him until the action—in the meantime Messrs. Pritchard acted for me, and in July I received nearly 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as salvage—that was my share—when the action was brought Messrs. Pritchard acted for me, and I gave evidence—the defendant never lent me any money; not a shilling—all these claims against me for money lent are wholly false.</p>

I had saved in Australia—it was coming home in the <hi rend="italic">Fusiyama</hi>—I did not borrow money of Captain Thompson in Singapore—I had no advances, except once, when he might ask if I wanted any money I could have a few shillings—I had 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when I got to Southampton—I had to pay my railway fare to London—I went direct to Mitford Cottages—the cottage had six rooms and a kitchen—I had two sisters living at home, and two brothers, and my father and mother—there were two lodgers there, and myself made nine—my father was not in very poor circumstances when I arrived—he was not out of work—one of my brothers was—he is blind, and could not work—one of my sisters goes to school, and the other helps mother about the house—my father was a journeyman painter when he was at work—I know a person called George Dunkley—he was also on board the <hi rend="italic">Fusiyama</hi>—I did not know that Peter Smith, Charles Hagmand, George Wallis, Buzzard, and Dunkley, had gone to sleep at Fayle's—on the three days I went there I did not see all those men there—I did not see Charles Hagmand or Peter Smith there—I went there with the cook of the <hi rend="italic">Fusiyama</hi>—I have seen Dunkley there, and O'Brien and Buzzard and Wall is—I knew nothing of any proceedings against the owners of the <hi rend="italic">Maggie Leslie</hi> for a month after the 1st January, 1868—I did not take any steps myself until I bad been home two months, and then was recommended to Messrs. Pritchard by Lloyd's Salvage Office—I had made no claim at all before I employed Pritchard &amp; Sons—I was waiting to see what I should receive for taking the vessel in—the brokers told me they thought the matter would be settled by arbitration—I went to the brokers to report myself, and get paid off, and they told me they were going to settle the</p>

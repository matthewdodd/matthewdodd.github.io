On 6th May, about nine in the evening, I was in Bishopsgate-street—Baun spoke to me, and I missed my handkerchief—I had had it half-an-hour before—I went up a court with him, about 100 yards off, and saw two men coming down it as we went up—they passed us; it was too dark to recognise them—we went into a public-house, and then to the station, where I saw this handkerchief (<hi rend="italic">produced)—</hi> it is mine, and is marked—I had it that night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to a Berlin importer, and live at 5, Lombard-street. On 6th May, I was in Bishopsgate-street, about twelve yards behind Mr. Woodin, and saw the prisoners coming towards me into the City—they passed me, turned back, and walked behind Mr. Woodin, across the road—I went at the same rate as they did, on the other side of the road—Fynn lifted up Mr. Woodin's pocket, put his band in, took it out again, and put it under his coat—Mitchelson was behind him, not half a yard from him, and turned round to see if anybody observed him—they both went up Angel-alley—I spoke to Mr. Woodin, and we followed them, and met them about half-way—I knocked at the door of a house in the court, to allow them to pass that they might have no suspicion of our following them—I told Woodin to go into a public-house, and I followed the prisoners into Bishopsgate-street, and gave them into custody.</p>

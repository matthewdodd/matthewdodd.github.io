            . I live in Grays-Inn-lane. On the 18th of December, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was at the end of <placeName id="t18170115-54-crimeloc274">Baldwin's-gardens</placeName>

I saw two young men lurking about me for some time; my bundle was taken from me-it contained the articles mentioned in the indictment. I got up, and called, stop thief. I afterwards saw my bundle in the watchman's possession. The prisoner is like one of the men who were lurking about me.</p>

               <p>JOHN LLOYD. I am a watchman. As I was going half-past ten o'clock, I heard the alarm; I ran down the garden, and saw the prisoner and another man run through the Hole-in-the-wall public-house, there is a passage through it; the prisoner had a bundle under his arm. I went round another way to meet them. I saw them both run down Beauchamp-street; the prisoner had the bundle still. I lost them. Soon after eleven o'clock, I saw him again, at the end of Drayton-street; I went after him, and he ran away; he threw the bundle away. I am sure it was the prisoner. I took the bundle up, and sprung my rattle.</p>
               <p>GEORGE FERRY. I am also a watchman. The last witness described the prisoner to me. I was going to the watch-house, and saw the prisoner with a girl; I took the girl, as I wanted her. The prisoner followed me to the watch-house, and I took him also.</p>

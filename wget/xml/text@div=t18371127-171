                  </hi>. I live in Cornwall-street, and am a sailor. On the 30th of October I went to work on board the <hi rend="italic">Lowther</hi>, in the London Docks, in the room of Benjamin Williams, the cook—the prisoner came an board—I saw him with a jacket on—he had none when he came on board—I called to him, but he went on shore and got away—I afterwards found him at the Paviors' Arms, with the jacket still on—I said to him, "If you don't mind you will get yourself into trouble about that jacket"—I went after Benjamin Williams, but could not find him, and then I went home,—Benjamin Williams came to the public-house, found him, and tot for me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I asked him if he was coming on shore, and he made no an<lb></lb>swer, and I never saw him again—he asked me to sell it and give him half the money, and because I would not do it he said he would make money of me. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No, I said nothing of the kind—I knew he had no jacket on when he came on board, and hardly any shoes, and no stockings.</p>

I lost my jacket from on board the ship, and found it in the house where the prisoner was—he said he had no jacks and had not seen it—a man took up the jacket and held it up, and I said, "That is the jacket, I will swear to it"—he said he knew nothing about it—I said, "I will take you to where your master and mine will settle it, "and I took him to the station-house—this is my jacket.</p>

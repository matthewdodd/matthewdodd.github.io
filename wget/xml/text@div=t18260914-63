On the last day of June, I was going to Hackney for my father, and when I came to a field opposite Canton-place, the prisoner came and asked if I was willing to earn a shilling - I said, Yes; he asked me if I knew where

I pulled my hat off, and shewed him how I would act; he then gave me the cheque in the letter to take to Mr. Taylor; I asked if he had any particular message - he said, if they asked who I was, to say I was Dalby Williams' youngest son; I told him, if there was any lies attached to it, I would have nothing to do it; he pressed me very much to take it - I thought there must be something bad in it, and refused; when I got home I told my father, who sent me next morning to Messrs. Taylor, and I informed them about it.</p>

            . I am seventeen years old, and live in James-street, Limehouse-fields. On the 1st of July, the prisoner accosted me - I do not think he is the man;(looking at him) I am sure that is not the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a man afterwards taken into custody? A. Yes; he looks like the man who was taken; he was taken on the 1st of July, by Tuson, the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you point out the person who was to be taken into custody? A. I saw a person run across the road, and said, that looked like the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the man who ran across the road, and whom you pointed out, the same person who had spoken to you before? A. He looked liked the same person - he was taken into custody - I am not positive that he was the person I had seen before - I was not positive then.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you were not positive, and that you did not swear to him? A. No - I was not positive- I never have been altogether positive; I have had no conversation with the prisoner's friends; I suppose I was about ten minutes with the person who gave me the note; I did not speak positively to the person when he was taken; I was sworn before the Magistrate, and what I said was written down.</p>
               <p>Q. When that man was taken into custody by the officer, did you, or did you not, speak positively to him to the officer? A. No, Sir, I swear that.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you believe the man, taken into custody, is the man who before had spoken to you? A. No, my Lord; I do not think it was the man; I did not say so to the officer; I was so frightened at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body speak to you that day, and give you any thing? A. The man spoke to me, and gave me a note - I was to take it to Mr. Taylor.</p>
               <p>Mr. BRODRICK. Q. What Mr. Taylor? A. The brewer- I delivered it to Mr. Blaikie, at the brewery in Ropemaker's-walk; I was to return to the person at Poplargate. Mr. Sewell, the clerk, and Mr. Tuson, the officer, went back with me to Poplar-gate - when I got back I did not see anybody for five minutes; I then saw a person run across the road, and then I beckoned to Mr. Sewell, and said I thought that was the person; I do not recollect the person beckoning to me - Mr. Sewell and Tuson saw him running - I called them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen any person before you saw the man run across the road? A. I saw a great many walking up and down the road; I pointed out the man who ran across; Sewell and Tuson ran after him; I suppose he ran nearly a quarter of a mile before he was taken - I believe Stop thief! was cried - I cried out once, I believe. The man was taken in the King and Queen, public-house, Three Colts-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the constable and Mr. Sewell up when the man was taken? A. No - I was up first; the constable came next - I did not point him out to the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how came this man to be taken? A. Because a man had hold of him by the collar; I did not point him out, nor say any thing to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say whether he was the man or was not? A. No - I did not point at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say he was the man or not? A. No - I do not recollect saying a word - I did not speak a word, or intimate in any way that he was the man - I did not think him the man - I had my doubt whether he was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you express to any body that doubt? A. No. The deposition made by the witness before the Magistrate was here given him to read.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. This signature is your writing, is it? A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now read to yourself, beginning at the words "I, the said John Stanbury, on my oath, say" - (he does so) - was the account you have now seen road over to you before you signed it? A. I do not recollect it being read over; I was asked questions; I believe I said to the officer what is written down.</p>
               <p>Q. To what officer? A. To a stout gentleman at the office, and then it was written down; I do not recollect it being read over - I believe I signed it, without it being read.</p>
               <p>Q. Now read it to yourself - (he does so) - having read that do you now know, who is the person who came to you in the morning with the letter? A. The man looked very much like the person at the bar, but that is not the man; I have seen a man since very much like that man.</p>
               <p>Q. You believe that not to be the man? A. Yes - I do not recollect what dress he had on now.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had gone to Taylor's, and Sewell and the constable came back with you, did you see the man who was taken up before he began running? A. No, Sir - I do not think he beckoned to me; I do not recollect his beckoning.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you do not think he did, or that he did not? A. No - he did not beckon; I do not recollect swearing before the Magistrate that he beckoned to me(the witness was here again desired to read his deposition) it says so there, my Lord, but I do not recollect his beckoning - I do not recollect saying so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you state before the Magistrate that the prisoner was the person who gave you that note? A. (hesitating) I had my doubts whether it was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you state that it was the prisoner who came to you, talked to you, and gave you that letter? A. I believe I did, but I was so frightened I did not know what I was swearing; I do not believe he was the man.</p>

            . I am a constable, of Limehouse. On the 1st of July I saw Stanbury at the brew-house, and went another way to the place appointed; he had told us where to go to look for a person; I went to that place - he pointed out the prisoner as the person who gave him the letter; I am quite sure he pointed him out; I had not observed the prisoner make a signal; I was across the road; it is impossible I could mistake the man he pointed out; I pursued, and he was apprehended in the King and Queen - I asked him why he ran - he said he was running for a coach for himself - he was standing still when the witness pointed him out - I told him it was a strange way to run for a coach up one street and down another - he said he was on very particular business, which he had to do before he went to the coach, and that was the reason of his running - he asked what was the matter; I said I would tell him when we got to the watch-house; I took him there, and Mr. Sewell gave charge of him, and, in the presence of two or three more, I asked the boy whether he was positive he was the man - he said he was; I asked him, moreover, if he could swear to him; he told me Yes; the prisoner then endeavoured to alarm the boy, by saying"Don't do so; you are not sure."</p>

On the 1st of July Stanbury brought a letter, containing a 25l. cheque; I went with a constable, and desired the boy to follow us; we went to Poplar turnpike - the constable went into the toll-house till Stanbury came - when he came he looked about for some little time, and presently I saw a man run across the Commercial-road - Stanbury called to us, saying, "Here he is, here he is;" the man was running, and continued running - we followed him; I was not able to keep us with him, he ran so fast; I went round in another direction expecting to meet him - he was afterwards taken at a public-house; I found him at the watch-house; I told him he had given me a very hard chance, and it was very likely the last chace he would give any body in this country.</p>

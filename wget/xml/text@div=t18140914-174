            , he lives at Pickstead in Essex. We happened to be together on Sunday the 28th of August, about seven in the morning, or soon after. I first saw the prisoner at the corner of <placeName id="t18140914-174-crimeloc983">Leadenhall-street</placeName>

I offered him an eighteen-penny piece to pay for this sixpennyworth of oranges; that was a good one; he said he could not change the eighteenpenny piece; he said if you give me a three-shilling piece I will give you half-a-crown. I gave him a three-shilling piece; he put it into his pocket, and said he could not change it; he said, if you give me an eighteen-penny piece I will give you a shilling. I put the three-shilling piece he gave me into my pocket. I gave him the eighteen-penny piece I first offered him, and he gave me a shilling. I did not take particular notice of it at the time. I put it into my pocket along with the three-shilling piece. I had no other shilling in that pocket, or three-shilling piece. My brother Henry was with me; he bargained with the man; they were both at one time. I then went to an aunt of mine, and after some conversation I examined the money I had received of the prisoner; upon that examination both the shilling and the three-shilling piece turned out to be bad. I marked them. I delivered the shilling that I had received of the prisoner to Draper, the constable. I am sure it is the same shilling I received of the prisoner. In the course of the day, I saw the prisoner again between four and five in the afternoon, in Cornhill. My brother was in company with me, my mother, and my wife. The prisoner saw me, he kept eyeing of me, and was walking away. I pursued him; he ran as soon as he saw I followed him; I overtook him; he had a basket of oranges with him; he throwed them down in the street, as I supposed that he might run quicker. I overtook him in Cornhill, and delivered him to the constable, Draper. I knew the prisoner directly; I have no doubt of his person in the least.</p>

            . I live at Pickstead; I was with my brother on Sunday the 28th of August on London bridge. I observed the prisoner selling oranges there. I agreed to buy sixpennyworth; I was to have four for sixpence. I offered him a sixpence first; he refused it; it was a good sixpence. On his refusing the sixpence, I offered him a dollar; he gave me two shillings and two shillings and sixpence. At St. Mary Axe I shewed them to my aunt, and found they were bad. Afterwards I saw the prisoner at the same time as my brother did; he ran away as soon as he saw me; he flung the oranges away. Draper secured him. I know one of the shillings he gave me; he bit it, and said it was good. The mark is on it now. This is the shilling he bit, and said it was good. I am quite sure of that shilling.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see Moss endeavouring to secure the prisoner - A. Yes, I went up and took the prisoner into custody. Upon searching him, I found one three-shilling token and twelve shillings, all apparently bad. These are the part I received from Moss, and these are them I found on the prisoner.</p>

               <p>found the kitchen doors all open—they lead up stairs to the shop—the area door was unbolted, and a pane of glass was out, which made an opening suf<lb></lb>ficient for a boy like the prisoner to get through—if he had got through that pane he could reach the top-bolt, and open the door—he could get from that part of the house up stairs, through the shop—I had seen that door at half-past eleven o'clock the night before—I bolted it top and bottom—I did not see whether the other doors were fastened—the glass was then quite perfect—I went up stairs and told Mr. Davies—he came down and examined the place—I missed a hair-brush of my own from the table-drawer, which I had seen there on the Saturday night—I also missed from the pantry some bread, and about three-quarters of a pound of beef—the drawers in the kitchen were all tumbled—there were tablecloths in them—they were all left at they had been the night before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at No. 390, Strand. The prisoner was my errand-boy about two months back, and had opportuni<lb></lb>ties of going about the house—the area door opens into a small front area, beneath the street—there are iron railings across it—I was called up on Sunday morning, I went down and noticed that the pane of glass had been taken out of that door very carefully—the opening made was large enough to admit such a boy as the prisoner—one of the bars of the area railing was missing when I took the house, that might leave sufficient space for a boy of the prisoner's size to get between them; but it seems almost impossible that a boy could get through—there was no other means of getting into the area—the glass appeared to have been removed by cutting the putty round with a knife—I found the pane of glass in one of the cellars, underneath the street, on the other side of the area—it had been newly put in, I think, about the time the prisoner left my service—I cannot recollect positively whether it was before or after—I do not think a boy of the prisoner's size could reach the upper bolt when standing on the ground—the door was unbolted when I saw it—I did not observe any chair or stool on which he could have stood—I afterwards searched the house, but did not miss anything myself—I saw a broom and a mat left in the passage near the front door, which was open—it is usually fastened with two bolts, one at the top and the other at the bottom, a chain in the middle, and a latch—there are four or five fastenings to it—a boy of the prisoner's height, I should say, could not reach the upper bolt—I saw no chair or stool near, on which he could have stood—I do not recollect whether I had gone to bed be<lb></lb>fore the servant—I went to bed, I think, about half-past eleven—I did not exa<lb></lb>mine any doors or windows below stairs—I examined the front door; that was fastened and bolted in the usual way—my servant lived in the house before I took it—I had an assistant in the house named Barnes, he is now living with me.</p>

On Sunday morning, about half-past five o'clock, I was on duty in the Strand, and passing Mr. Davies's door, I saw it was partly open; I pushed it wide open, and hallooed out, "Is all right here?"—the prisoner then came towards me from a passage-door, at the further end of the shop, with a hair broom in his hand and a door mat—I said he ought to be more careful than to leave the door open and go into the passage—he then shook the mat on the step of the door—believing he was Mr. Davies's errand-boy, I went away and thought all was right—I had never seen him before to my knowledge—I am quite sure he is the boy—he came out on the outside step of the door—I stood there about two minutes while he was shaking the mat—in consequence of information I afterwards went to his lodgings, 2, Wild-passage, and found him at home—I said he must come to the station with me, for being found in Mr. Davies's house—he</p>

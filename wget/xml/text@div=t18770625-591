I live at 5, Pleasant Row, Wandsworth—the prisoner married me on 15th October, 1876, at Kingston-on-Thames—he was living with his father then—he courted me for about four months—I was living with him when he was given into custody—a fortnight after he married me he told me he was a married man—I asked him every question, but could get no clue to it till about three weeks or a month ago—I wrote to his aunt and received a letter from his wife; she gave him into custody—I am in the family-way by him.</p>

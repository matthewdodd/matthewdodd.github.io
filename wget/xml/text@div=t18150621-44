            . I am a nurse in one of the wards in the London Hospital. The deceased was brought there on the 19th of May, and remained there until her death: on the 9th of June, she was perfectly sensible all the time, and thought she never would recover. During every conversation I had with her, she used to say, that the way this affair happened was, that she was fastened up in the room and the prisoner was sharpening his knife, and swore he would stab her; which threat she was afraid he would put into execution from his violent conduct on a former occasion. The prisoner constantly visited her until her death, and always seemed very much affected with her situation.</p>

            . I am a pupil attending the London hospital. The deceased was brought to the hospital on the 19th of May, and expired on the 9th of June. She had a fracture on one of the bones forming the hip joint. From the first day she entered the hospital until she expired, she daily grew worse and worse.</p>

At four o'clock on the morning of the 19th, I went out to look for the deceased as she had stayed out all night; she lived with me, I found her quite drunk, and brought her home; she wanted to have something to drink in the room, and I would not suffer her, and locked the door. When I was at work, being a shoemaker, I was sharpening my knife, and the deceased went over to the window and threw herself out; I had no time to save her.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Wagoner's Arms public-house, in Bell-court, Milton-street, Chiswell-street. The prisoner and the deceased rented a cottage of me, adjoining my house, since August last—she lived with the prisoner as his wife—I only knew her as Mrs. Doyle—on the 9th of Nov., about two o'clock in the afternoon, she came to me with her child in her arms, and told me something—the prisoner was not present—between six and seven that evening I saw her pushed out of the cottage door, I cannot say who by,—I saw the arm of a man—she appeared to me to have nothing on but her shift—she went across the yard into a shed—I directly went into the cottage, and there saw the prisoner and two other men—I told him that if I heard</p>

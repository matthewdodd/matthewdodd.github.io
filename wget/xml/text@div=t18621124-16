                  </hi>. I am manager of the Admiral beer-shop, Bromley—the prisoner came there for a pot of beer, which came to threepence, and gave me a florin—I had to send my wife upstairs for change, which made me notice it—I gave the prisoner the change, and she left—she returned in about twenty-five minutes for another pot of beer, and gave me another florin—I gave her the ohange as I was very busy—after she left I noticed that the florin was bad, and put it on one side, thinking she might come again, as I knew where she lived—the came again about half-past 9 for a pot and a half of beer, and put down another bad florin—I bent it, and told her I had another to match it, besides another somewhere else—she said, "Oh! are they bad? a party came over to see me, Mrs. Cook, of 2, Long-lane, Borough, who keeps a tobacconist's shop, and gave them to me"—I gave her in charge with the two florins—my wife detected the first florin in counting the money—the prisoner was a customer; but I have only been there a little time—she had never offered me bad money before.</p>

I am the wife of the last witness, and assist him in the business—on 12th November the prisoner came about half-past 7 in the evening, and my husband gave me a bad florin—I put it in the silver bag while the prisoner was standing at the bar, and gave him sixpences for it—there was no other florin in the bag, or put into it that night—I counted the silver when we closed the shop, and found a bad florin—the prisoner was in the habit of coming sometimes twice in the morning, and twice or three times at night.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> Mrs. Cook was quite intimate with my daughter. I had not seen her for six months. She asked my daughter to have a glass of beer, asked me to fetch it, and gave me the money. I new looked at it, and did not know whether it was good or bad. She afterwards asked me to fetch another pot of beer, and gave me another florin; and then she said, "Bring the jug full," and I did so. I threw the money on the counter, and it was bad.</p>

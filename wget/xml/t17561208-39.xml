               <p>Swallow. He was then a grocer at Hull, in partnership with one Brooks.</p>

               <p>Swallow. I traded with him about eight or nine months.</p>

               <p>Hilyer. I have a great many times, and know his writing perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this his hand-writing?</p>

               <p>Q. Is this bill the hand-writing of either of them?</p>
               <p>Hilyer. No, it is not. It is a very bad imitation as ever I saw. It is pretended to imitate Mr. Blunt's hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at the examining of the prisoner?</p>

               <p>I know Messrs. Sill, Bridges and Blunt to be men of credit, and this man that it is drawn on I thought to be as great a man. He is a person I have done great service to, and he promised to lend me a sum. I met him, and he told me he was disappointed of cash; but he had the bill, so I took it, and unhappily involved myself in this affair. He has made his escape. I was in hopes that, if I had my trial put off, by that time I might take him. You see very plainly I have nobody to plead my cause, and he is out of the way. What can I say in this dilemma? I hope your Lordship will take it into consideration, as I am but a youth, and the man that is witness of my taking this bill is about. His name is Oader.</p>

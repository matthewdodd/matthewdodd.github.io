               <p>Freeman. I live in Dudley-Court. I took the Room of one Ruth Burne. I lost there a Flock Bed, a Feather Bolster, a pair of Sheets, two Quilts, and a pair of Blankets.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you furnish the Room yourself? How long have you been in this Room?</p>
               <p>Freeman. I took it six Weeks before Christmas.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave your Lodgings; how came it that your Bed was gone.</p>
               <p>Freeman. I was oblig'd to go out to daily Labour, as Washing and Ironing, and whilst I was out, my Bed was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go out in the Morning?</p>
               <p>Freeman. Yes. About Six o'Clock and return'd about Seven in the Evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any Thing else gone?</p>
               <p>Freeman. I did not miss any Things besides what has been mention'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the Prisoner at the Bar?</p>
               <p>Freeman. Yes. I saw him three Days before he took my Bed and Bedding away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know what Relation he was to your Landlady?</p>
               <p>Freeman. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came home at Night, was you not much surpriz'd to find your Bed gone; did you not ask your Landlady about it?</p>
               <p>Freeman. Yes. And she told me he (the Prisoner) took it away.</p>
               <p>Q. And pray did not she tell you the Reason why he took it away?</p>
               <p>Freeman. She said he had been stripping and robbing of her likewise.</p>
               <p>Q. Did this Burne and your Landlady appear to be Man and Wife?</p>
               <p>Freeman. No. For they were always jarring together.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the Bed the Prisoner took away, that upon which he and his Wife lay?</p>
               <p>Freeman. No, my Lord.</p>

               <p>Perkin. In Short's-Gardens Drury-Lane : And I think about the 20th of December, I am not sure of the Day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Perkin. I knew him to be the very Man.</p>

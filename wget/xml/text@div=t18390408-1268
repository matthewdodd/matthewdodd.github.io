                  </hi>. I am a draper, and live in Beech-street, Barbi<lb></lb>can. On the 8th of March, between seven and eight o'clock in the even<lb></lb>ing, the prisoner came for a yard of penny shoe-ribbon—I served him—he gave me half-a-crown—I put it into the till—there was no other there—I gave him change—I saw him again about twenty minutes afterwards—he bought a pair of stockings, and offered me another half-crown—I put it into another till with the halfpence—there was no other half-crown there—I suspected the second one was bad—I said it was bad—he said, "No, it it is not; I have just taken it"—I showed it to several customers—they said it was bad—I then looked at the other, and they were both bad—I marked them, and gave them to the officer.</p>

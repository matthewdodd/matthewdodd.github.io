                  </hi>. I live at No. 3, Pear Tree-street, Westminster, and am an unfortunate girl. On the 5th of May, at eight o'clock in the evening, I heard a female scream in the next room to mine—I went to the door, and saw the prisoner in the room, with a piece of iron in his hand, which is used as a poker—he had hold of a female by the hair of her head—I believe her name is Bulling—I saw him strike her with the poker on the back of her head—her head and face bled very much—she called for a policeman as load as she could.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in the same house. I heard a noise a few minutes before eight o'clock, and heard a window break—I saw a woman fall from the upper window—she passed my window in falling from the window of the floor above mine, into the yard, on the water-butt—I looked out, and saw her lying on her back—I went down—her clothes were in a dreadful state of blood, and she was insensible—I thought she was dead—I lifted her up, and saw the prisoner looking out of the window from which she fell—I asked what he did it for—he said she ought to have behaved herself, and he would not have done it—I and two men took her to the hospital.</p>

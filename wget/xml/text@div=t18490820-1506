                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Messrs. Burton and Barber, Lower Thames-street. On 19th July, I was near the Royal Exchange—I stopped for a necessary purpose, and then went on—as I passed the Mansion House, I saw the prisoner—he said, "I have not seen you lately, what are you going to give me"—I said, "Nothing at all; I know nothing of you; you had better be off"—I continued on; I did not notice where he was—he came up again, and said, "What are you going to give me"—I said, "Nothing at all"—I continued on, and presently he came and said again, "What are you going to give me"—I said, "Nothing at all, you had better be off"—he said, "I will not leave you, I will expose you"—I did not make any reply to that, but seeing a policeman, touched him on the shoulder, and told him—he took hold of him, and asked me to follow him to the station, which I did—the charge was there entered—the prisoner begged my pardon, and said he had made a mistake; he took me for another person, that he was very sorry, and would do anything to oblige me—I did not know him at all.</p>

               <p>came to me and made a charge against the prisoner, who was close by, and I took him—he said he was very sorry, and he had made a mistake: he took him to be another gentleman, and he would make him any compensa<lb></lb>tion in his power if he would forgive him—the prisoner's face looked remark<lb></lb>ably red—I searched him, and found a small packet of rouge in one pocket, and this piece of wool or lint in another—the colour of his face corresponded with this rouge—he denied that his face was coloured, and said he used to follow a show, and bought it for that purpose—he said he lived at No. 2, Great Peter-street, Westminster—I went there, and could find no such person.</p>

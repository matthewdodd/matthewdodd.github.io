                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant</hi> 18 <hi rend="italic">K</hi>). On the night of the 8th December I was on duty in Romford Road, Little Ilford, and saw a waggon drawn by three horses, stop about midnight at a dark yard at the side of the Coach and Horses—Hocking was with me—I saw Drew come out of the public-house—I believe he is ostler there—he went up to the side of the waggon, and I then saw a dark lantern or bull's-eye turned on under the horses and waggon and round the field to the side of the stable, but did not see who turned it on—the light came from between the wagon and the yard—I heard Drew say, "Now"—I ran across and found him in the stable with a sack of something on his back—I said, "What right have you with that?"—he said, "I found it"—I brought him out and saw Jones in Hocking's custody—I said to Jones, "Who authorised you to leave that here?"—he began to cry, but made no reply—we took them to the station—I examined the sack and found the name of Mills on it in red paint, and sent for the prosecutor; it contained about two bushels of bruised barley and pollard, which is a kind of bran—the waggon belonged to Mr. Mills, of Ilford—I went there and was shown a bin in Jones's stable, from which I took this sample (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I compared it with that in the sack, and it corresponds.</p>

               <p>horses and down the field—I heard words, but could not say what—Hurst ran and I followed him and saw him lay hold of Devnish by the stable door, who had a sack on his back—I saw Jones walking quietly away from his waggon towards the public-house and apprehended him—he began to cry, and said, "Oh! Mr. Hocking, don't take me; I was only going to mix it"—I saw the sack at the station—it contained bruised barley and pollard, which was mixed—I was in the marsh at the other side of the road at the time the light was turned on.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a farmer, living with my father at Green Lanes, Barking—Jones was his carman—on the 29th December I went to the police-station, and saw one of my sacks, a sack containing barley and pol<lb></lb>lard mixed, which I cannot swear to, but it corresponds with what was on my premises—the value of the whole may be three or four shillings—Jones had no right to take pollard and barley away—he had no occasion to stop at the Coach and Horses to bait, but he could stop to get beer if he liked.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Would he have to pass the Coach and Horses? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—there were, I think, sacks like this in my stable—pollard and barley is given to horses, and he might mix it with chaff—it is usual to put chaff with it—I do not give bran and barley to horses without mixing it with chaff—we prefer barley to oats for horses—Jones came with an excellent character, and I am very sorry to be here to prosecute him—he has been in our service a year and a half, and the character we had with him was from a boy, for he had only worked at one place before.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

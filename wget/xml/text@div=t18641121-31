                  </hi>. I am a sub-warder in the Middlesex House of Correction, Cold bath-fields—on 10th November, at 10 o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in the tailor's shop there, supervising the prisoners—the prisoner was at that time undergoing sentence in the House of Correction—he came behind me; at least, I received a blow in the back of the neck, which nearly knocked me off of the stool I was sitting on in the middle of the shop—I put my hand up to my neck and found a great deal of blood running from it—I turned round, and saw the prisoner walking away with something in his right hand; I could not say what it was—I was conveyed to the infirmary by one of the chief warders—I fainted from loss of blood—I had reported the prisoner to the governor on the day previous, and was going to report him again that morning for a breach of the prison rules—I had not told him so.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sub-warder in the Middlesex House of Correction—on 10th November, about 10 in the morning, I was on duty in the tailor's shop—I saw the prosecutor there sitting down about seven or eight yards in advance of me—I saw the prisoner strike a blow at the back of his neck; he then turned round and advanced towards me—I closed with him, and while struggling with him, Mr. Parry, the master tailor, came out and took the knife from him—the prisoner remarked at the time, "You don't report me for nothing"—I saw the knife in his hand, and saw there was blood on the blade—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prisoner was employed in the tailor's shop as a cutter-out—he would use a knife occasionally—it was nothing unusual to see him with a knife—I saw him with a knife that</p>

               <p>morning, about a quarter of an hour before this—from what I could see, at the distance I was from him, he was sharpening it, or sharpening something with it—I heard him ask for a knife about a quarter of an hour before—he asked the assistant cap-maker for it—he said, "Lend me the knife."</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it one of his tools of trade? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he might have it for several things—he was a cutter-out, and he had the use of shears—he might want a knife to sharpen a piece of slate pencil, or anything of that sort—I saw him once marking a slate with it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the warders, and am engaged as master-tailor in the tailor's shop—the cap-workers work in the same place—I know this knife—it is one of the cap-maker's knives—the prisoner would not require it for his work—he was a tailor—I was in the adjoining room when this occurred—I took the knife from the prisoner's hand—there was blood upon it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon—on 10th November, about a quarter-past 10 in the morning, I saw Green, and examined his neck—I found a wound about two inches behind the ear, in the fleshy part of the neck—it was about an inch in length, a deep wound amongst the muscles—a small branch of the artery had been divided, and he had lost a considerable quantity of blood—this knife would inflict such a wound—it was not a dangerous wound—had it been a little further forward, it would probably have killed him—I did not examine the depth of the wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you cannot say if much force was used? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Except from its effect upon him—he was very much shaken by the blow for some days afterwards—I judged that considerable force was used—the neighbourhood of the wound was undoubtedly dangerous—it was near the large vessels of the neck; the place itself was not dangerous.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 19th of June I had a search warrant brought me; I was on my duty; and between twelve and one o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner at the bar, in Church-lane, St. Giles's with a hat; he seeing me coming, ran cross the way; I went and took hold of him, and this hat lay on the ground by him: I and the watchman went to the place were we first saw him; the watchman found the coat lying in the street: we took him to the watchhouse, and before Justice Cox the next day: I took this buckle out of his pocket. (Producing one.)</p>
               <p>Lockhart. This is a regimental buckle; I lost mine, shoes and all; but I cannot swear to it.</p>

               <p>The night I was taken my mother was brought to bed; she sent me down stairs; there came up a brewer's servant with a bundle; he said, if I would stay with the bundle, he would give me a halfpenny;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176407280027"></xptr> I gave information of this to the round-house keeper. I lately bought them buckles, having none in my shoes.</p>

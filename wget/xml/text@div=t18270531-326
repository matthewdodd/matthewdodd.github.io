            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Clarence-market, Regent's Park - the prisoner came on the 8th of May, about four o'clock in the afternoon, and offered to pawn three table-spoons - I asked what he wanted - he said 3l. - I asked if they were his own - he said they were, that his name was John Jones, and he lived at Kentish-town - I suspected the property was stolen, and sent one of my men for an officer - I question ed him about a shawl which he had previously pawned - he then opened the door, and ran out - I followed and brought him back again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did the prisoner run away entirely? A. No; 1 overtook him sixty or seventy yards off, and secured him - he left the spoons behind him. I swear positively he is the man.</p>

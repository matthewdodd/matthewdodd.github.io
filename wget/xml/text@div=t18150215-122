            . I am a watchman. On Friday evening January, the 20th, I was going on my duty, I met the man prisoner with a large basket on his shoulder a little before seven o'clock; I saw he had a basket full of coals; I took him to the watch-house, he said cannot we make it up without going to the watchhouse, I said, no, you must go and give an account of yourself there; when I took him to the watchhouse, the watchhouse keeper told him he had brought them from No. 28. Douglas-place, at the boarding school, he said yes, the cook had been down to his house in the evening drinking tea, and if he would go with her and take his basket, she would give him a few coals, he said he did not much like the job, she told him there could be no harm in it, and now he said you see what I have brought myself to; the constable of the night sent me to the Rev. Mr. Tomkin's, and Mr. Tomkins took me to Mr. Vye's house; I took the cook up she was in the parlour fastened in; I threatened to break the door open; she came out; I took her in custody, and took her to the watchhouse.</p>

               <p>Q. What quantity of coals was there - A. Near a bushel and a half, there might be more.</p>

               <p>there had been screws taken out of a patent lock of a door, which led into the passage of the house, out of Mr. Walmsley's warehouse into the general passage of the houso—I found up stairs that a panel had been taken out of the door—I also found an iron safe broken open—a person could have got in through the panel—the place was in confusion—I also found a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> that was brought from Angua's house—I compared it with the marks on the iron safe and the cash-box, and the marks exactly corresponded, especially on the iron safe—afterwards, in consequence of some information I received, I went to the Eastern Counties Railway; I saw there the man who went with Mr. Loveridge get out, and three other men get in—I cannot say whether the prisoner was one of them—they drove away and got out at Club-row—I then lost sight' of them—I saw them next coming out of Nichol-row; the prisoner was carrying a bag, and Angus following him—I jumped out of our cab as quick as I could; the prisoner saw me, dropped the bag immediately, and ran away—I followed him round two or three streets and had almost overtaken him; I just touched him as he ran through the door of a house; I hit my hand against a post; it knocked me backwards—the prisoner went through the house and jumped out of a back window, and when I got assistance we could not find him—I afterwards went to Hare-street, I went up stairs; the prisoner was in bed—I got some violent blows from persons up there, and he escaped again—on 27th I went to Spitalfields, to a house there, with some other officers, forced the door, and found the prisoner in bed; we <hi rend="italic">dropped</hi> on to him, and handcuffed him directly; we partially dressed him, and took him to Bow-lane police-station—he was told there what the charge would be, and as we were going in the cab he said, "You will not prove the burglary home to me; I had a little to do with the silk, and I thought I might as well make a few shillings of it as anybody else."</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Richard Evans, a fringe manu<lb></lb>facturer—I have been in his service seven years—I know the prisoner—I give him a very good character for honesty—we have been in the habit of buying goods of him—he has been in the habit of coming once a week always for money, as this book will show—we have always considered him an honest man; I have known him since 1858—he has had opportunities of robbing us if he felt disposed—he was always in and out of the warehouse.</p>

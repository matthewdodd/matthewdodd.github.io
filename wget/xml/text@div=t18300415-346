            . I am an officer. On the 8th of April, about nine o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner in company with another lad - I observed the prisoner put his hand into Laurence's pocket, and take out the handkerchief; I followed Laurence, brought him back, and found the prisoner with his hand in another<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150145"></xptr>gentleman's pocket, at the very moment, in the act of taking another handkerchief - I took his companion, but he was discharged: I found the prosecutor's handkerchief in the prisoner's pocket.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been out of place for six months - I have no father; I was trying for fifteen weeks to go to the Marine Society, but was refused by the doctor; I was told if I committed any act, that would send me there, or to the Refuge - I should be happy to get my living honestly.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BICKNELL. I found his statement, about the Marine Society, true - his companion was thirteen years old.</p>

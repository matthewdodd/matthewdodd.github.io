                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Foster, of Grosvenor Lodge, Junction Road, Holloway—the prisoner and his wife were in our service last year—the prisoner was a general servant, and had access to all parts of the house—last June I went to Brighton for a fortnight—I had four sovereigns and two half-sovereigns in the drawer of a table, which was locked, and my husband had the key—on my return from Brighton a com<lb></lb>munication was made to me by the prisoner's second wife, and I found the drawers were all open a little way, not forced, but unlocked with a key—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187006060020"></xptr>
               <p>the prisoner came in shortly after and said that thieves had got into the house—I said "No practised thief"—he said that he did not see them, because they ran away; but they got in at the window, and went out at the door, and that it was about 1 o'clock in the morning, two or three days before my return—he had my address at Brighton—I said "Whoever the thief was, was let into the house"—I ultimately missed five sovereigns—nothing further was done then—about three months afterwards I went to York; when I came back I unpacked a bracelet, and it was on the corner of my dressing table, between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening—my breakfast room is <hi rend="italic">vis-a-vis</hi> with my bedroom, and as I sat there, facing the door, the prisoner came up stairs in a peculiar manner, and seemed to go sideways round the door, and went into my bedroom—he had no boots on—I could see him, but I could not see into my bedroom—while he was in the room I said "What do you do there, Joseph?"—he said "I am going to draw down the blinds, Ma'am"—I said "You know very well the blinds are all down"—he then said "I thought perhaps you would want the gas lighted"—I told him he knew it was not his place, and he had no right to be in my bedroom, it was his wife's place to come up—he went down, and I went into the room, and missed the bracelet—I did not charge him with stealing it till my husband came home, as we had before that missed some diamond studs—I made a fuss about it, and they were put back into a box with some nails, and I thought probably the bracelet would be put back—I complained in his hearing, and forbade his leaving the house; but he would go out—I have never seen the bracelet since—I afterwards charged him with stealing it, and discharged him; after that he came to the area gate, and I spoke to him—he said "I did not take the bracelet"—I said "You know you pretended to break into the house, and you took the money"—he said "Yes, Ma'am, I know; I hope you and master will forgive me for that"—some spoons have been shown me which are like some I missed.</p>

                  </hi>. I was married to the prisoner in June, 1868; he had a wife living then, who is outside—I was in Mr. Foster's service with the prisoner—I remember Mrs. Foster being at Brighton about the middle of last year, and while she was there someone broke into the house at a little study window on the ground floor—I was disturbed—Joseph woke me up about 1 o'clock; he went down stairs first and called me to bring a light—I went down, but did not see or hear anybody—I looked at the little window; it was broken, the blind had been let down, but it was pulled up again crooked; several of the drawers were open and the papers were all on the</p>

               <p>flow; a match had been lighted, which I found on the carpet, and there was little gravel on the carpet; the room door was open, and four little pictures were taken down, ready to take away—Joseph went to the front door—I undid the bolt and the lock, and he went down the garden to see if be could see anyone—he asked a gentleman who was going along the road if he would stop with me while he went for a policeman—he ran down the road, found two policemen and brought them back—I do not know who they were—I have never seen them since—they came in and looked found, and the next day Sergeant Crooke came, and the following evening Mrs. Foster came home.</p>

On 4th August, some information reached the station, and I was directed by the inspector to go to the prose<lb></lb>cutor's house—I looked about and noticed a small window on the ground floor, which was broken at the catch, and the greater part of the glass was outside—it is a sash window—a geranium near the window had been pulled up and trodden down—some portraits of sporting men were taken down and put round the room—there were valuable pictures which were not taken down—there was a quantity of plate in the adjoining room—the window was large enough for a person to get in—it struck me as very strange that this gold coin should have been selected, which was English, and the Napoleons and half-Napoleons left, which were in the same drawer—there were very slight footmarks outside—the ground was very soft.</p>

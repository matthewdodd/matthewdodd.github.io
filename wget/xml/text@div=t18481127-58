                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Allen, who keeps a coffee-shop in New Church-street, Portman-market—the prisoner was in my service about nine days. On 12th Nov., between eleven and twelve o'clock, I gave my daughter my keys to go to my drawers for a handkerchief—half an hour afterwards I missed my keys, but could not find them—I asked the prisoner if she knew anything about them—she said she did not—between two and three in the afternoon the prisoner pointed out the keys to me, on a hot plate, in the yard—I then went to my drawers, and missed some shillings, two 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-pieces, a pair of cuffs, some lace, and a gold-clasp—I then went down to the prisoner, and asked her about it—she at first denied having been to the drawers—she afterwards said now I had found her out she would cut her throat, so help her God!—I afterwards went up to her room, and requested her to open a little box there—she did so, and I found part of the missing property in it—she said it was mine, and gave me part of the silver she had taken—she said she took it out of the drawer—my gold-snap was among the things—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—she said she was very sorry for what she had done.</p>

               <p>got home I was going to take the things out of the cart into the shop—the officer came and gave me information—I found I had lost a hare, some sau<lb></lb>sages and rabbits—he took Lane and Matter, and then the officer took me to the station—I found the hare there—I believe it was mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a charwoman, and work at the Beehive—on Tuesday, 8th February, I saw Mr. Bransbury's son going in and out of Mr. Cook's cellar frequently, from the afternoon up to 5 or 6 o'clock—he brought a lead pump, and a box, and a jar of colour, some earthenware pans, a sauce<lb></lb>pan, a box, and some dishes—the box was brought between 4 and 6 o'clock—it was light at that time—I believe the things are in the cellar now—I have seen all but the box there since Mr. Hardwick came—I did not point them out, but Mr. Cook saw them on the following Thursday, and spoke to me about them.</p>

I am an auctioneer, of Littlehampton—I was em<lb></lb>ployed by the assignees under the bankruptcy—I went to the Norfolk Hotel, kept by Mr. Stedmun, and took possession of some goods, of which I have an inventory—there were two builder's trucks, four ladders, two empty cement casks, a galvanized pail, and a hogshead—they are still in my possession—they are worth from 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—some time afterwards I went to Mr. Grudg<lb></lb>field's and took possession of a thirty-six gallon copper, a cask containing twenty-eight gallons of tar, a wash tub, two sash doors, a deal frame for a door, and other articles, value about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think the loft was unlocked—it was 4ft. 4 in. long, 10 or 14ft wide, and 12 or 14ft high—it had no ceiling—I think one of the cans was marked "Mander"—there was a label on it directed to Mr. Bransbury—one of those was shown to Mr. Stark—I went to the Beehive and found a mould for running lead casements, a box of books and papers, which Mr. Hardwick took possession of, a keg of Turkey umber, and some boards, and other small articles, worth about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but the box and the books I put no value upon—I afterwards went to a field with Mr. Hardwick, who took possession of a ladder of about forty rounds, value about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was about 200 yards from the premises in Surrey Street, lying under a wall in a field—the bankrupt had a horse, two carts, and two sets of harness before the bankruptcy, which I saw in his possession three or four weeks afterwards—I saw them when I was taking the inventory for the sale, under the bankruptcy, and he told me they did not belong to him—he had them I should think a year before the bankruptcy—I prepared the inventory of sale—the first sale was the 25th August, 1869—that was a sale of stock given up by the bankrupt—52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was the gross amount of the sale—I don't think that included any of the property at the Norfolk or the Bee-hive, or in the field.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi>) I took possession in the second week in February of a wooden box, which was secreted in the cellar of the Beehive—a policeman came to my house—I had the box taken to my office and sealed up, and on the following day I opened it and found a quantity of books and two new ledgers containing accounts, and amongst them a number apparently unsettled, I think to the amount of about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there are debts as to which liability was incurred—one is an account of Joseph Duffield, February 20th, 1869, and there are some previous to that—they continue down to 19th July—there is one of Mr. Wright, another of Mr. Staples, Mr. Cook, Mr. Snewing, and Mr. Charles Saunders—among the papers I found an estimate book—I could not state whether all the books are in the defendant's writing—here is one entry at the end for some work done at the police station—that is in his writing and signed by him—it is the estimate of work made for Captain Montgomery, and is signed "George Bransbury"—there is no date—the amount is 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.,—I also find Captain Montgomery men<lb></lb>tioned in the ledger account—it is not marked off as paid—it is one of the open accounts, but Captain Montgomery has paid it to the estate since the bankruptcy—here is an account which appears to be made out against Mr. Cook in the first part of the ledger; it begins December, 1868, and ends January, 1869, and the same account, with a trifling alteration, appears in July, 1869—it is almost identically copied but on a different date—the date has been altered in many places in the books, and some dates are altered by erasures—here is one account against Mr. Harmsbury, it is dated in July and the date has been scratched out and the 30th put in on an erasure, sub<lb></lb>sequent to the date of the bankruptcy—there are fifty-two accounts alto<lb></lb>gether subsequent to the date of the bankruptcy—there has been no information by the bankrupt with reference to those fifty-two accounts, they amount to 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I believe, originally, when the totals were taken out as they first stood, the debts entered in this ledger represented 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. but when they came to analyze them, and the collector came to collect them, there was a set-off which reduced them to 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there is no informa<lb></lb>tion in the books about any of the 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the original estimate which I got from Captain Montgomery—it is a copy of the one in the estimate book—it is dated 12th June, 1869—his son claimed the amount, and brought an action in the County Court, and the Judge decided in the defendant's favour—I find no trace of any of those accounts in the bank<lb></lb>rupt's books—I found a number of invoices in the box, as if made out for delivery from the ledger, as due to George Bransbury.</p>

I am a hairdresser, of Littlehampton—in April, 1869, I employed the defendant—his work was finished early in May—it is entered in this ledger, under date of June 15th—I am sure it was not done in June—on 7th July I paid him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which, with 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

I am a pork-butcher, of Littlehampton, and a tenant of Mr. Cook's—last spring my shop was whitewashed, and a few weeks before that some work was done by the prisoner—this work, described at page 28, was done early in May, but it is charged on 31st July—a par<lb></lb>tition was done a month or two before that; two sets of work were done.</p>

He held my two arms<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182012060019"></xptr>a moment or two, then loosed one arm, made a snatch at my chain, and got my watch out of my fob, turned round with a quick motion, and went up the alley. He held my other hand till he got the watch. I turned round to follow, but found two men close behind me; they hustled me to prevent my following, and then ran up the alley themselves - Gregory immediately came up. I am positive the prisoner is the man, I cannot be mistaken. I gave information at Worship-street, and saw him there a week after - I recognized him immediately he was brought to the bar - his face is too particular for me to be deceived.</p>

            . I live in Paternoster-row, Spital-fields. On the 1st of November, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was in Bishopsgate-street, and saw the prisoner just against the Marine Society's house, walking by my side in a shuffling way; I immediately turned round, and saw four more, apparently in his company. I slackened my pace, the prisoner got before me with two of the others - I did not observe his features till he came to the corner of Camomile-street, there was a good light there from a window. Two turned down there, two stopped behind looking at the window, and the prisoner came just before me - there was a strong light on his face. From what I thought I was induced to watch him, and observed his person. I crossed Camomile-street, and placed myself at a cheesemonger's door, from which was a strong light - he passed, and I had a very good look at him. When I came to the corner of Houndsditch the prisoner and a tall man made a stop, and both immediately started over the way to the other side. I kept on the other side of the way, and saw them at the corner of Old Bethlem. The prisoner looked round, and I saw his countenance by a gas-light from a chymist's shop. I saw them cross over to the right side, where I was, within about three doors of Catherine-wheel-alley. I saw some people collecting and went up, the prosecutor complained of having been robbed, the prisoner and the other men were then gone. I and Capper immediately went and gave information at Worship-street - this was on Wednesday, and on the Tuesday following I went with Garton and two others to the Cross Keys, in Wentworth-street, which is five hundred and forty paces from the alley, and found eight or nine in the house, the prisoner was one, sitting in a box alone - I knew him instantly, and told Garton he was the man - I am positive of his person. Garton said he had a wooden leg. My attention was fixed to his face, and he had trowsers on, quite down to the ancle, when I saw him. I said,</p>
               <p>"If he has no legs at all he is the man." He had trowsers on then too. I am positive of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are certain of him - A. Yes, I could tell him from a hundred thousand. Another man, named Garsey, was apprehended, but he was as much like the prisoner as I am. I went to Capper before he saw him, to prevent anything being said to him.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. I went with Gregory to the Cross Keys, he immediately fixed on the prisoner. I asked him where he lived? he said in a court in Wentworth-street, No. 3, but the court had no name. All the courts there have names.</p>

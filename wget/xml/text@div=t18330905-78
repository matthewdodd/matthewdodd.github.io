On the 13th of July, in consequence of having missed some goods, I marked four half-crowns and gave them to a young man, to give to his wife to come and purchase goods; together with ten shillings, which were not marked - we all left the house except the prisoner, just before nine o'clock, and I returned just before ten - I went into the counting-house, and returned to the prisoner, who was in the shop; he said, "I have just taken some ready money" - I had just looked into the box where we put the money, and saw two of the half-crowns which I had marked - I asked the prisoner how much he had taken; he said, "14s. 9d." - I went and looked at the book, and he had entered 14s. 9d. - the young man then came in to whom I had given the four half-crowns, and from what he said, I sent for the officer - I called the prisoner into the counting-house to Mr. Partridge, my partner, and told him I suspected him, and wished to search him - the officer found on him two of the marked half-crowns, and two black silk handkerchiefs, which belonged to me and Mr. Partridge; they are worth 7s. - the prisoner was to have 30l. a year, and his board and lodging.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. How do you know these handkerchiefs? A. By the mark on them - this mark is put on at the warehouse; I cannot say who put it on - the same mark might be on other handkerchiefs - the prisoner was the only person in the shop besides myself and my partner - we had another young man, but he was not accustomed to the business, and did not serve in the shop; our other shopman had left before the prisoner came - if these handkerchiefs had been sold the ticket would have been taken off and they would have been entered in the book - I had seen these handkerchiefs there the day before; we had no other of that price - I looked this morning to see if we had any other tickets the same as these, and we have not - if persons in our employ ask for goods, we let them have them - there was a quarter's wages due to the prisoner on the 27th of August; it was 7l. 10s.; he had had 3l. in money, and 30s. or 40s. worth of goods.</p>

             (police-sergeant G 6). I was sent for, and found these two half-crowns in the prisoner's waistcoat pocket, and these two handkerchiefs in his coat pocket; he did not say whose they were.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). With respect to the two handkerchiefs found on me, I can account for the possession of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050050"></xptr>them as my own property. Some time ago I purchased a lot of(about eighteen) silk handkerchiefs, and gave them to a friend(the witness Mrs. Longdon, who, with her husband, lives at the house of my uncle) to make up for me. On Sunday, July 7th, I called upon, her for some of the handkerchiefs, when she told me they were not done, but that I should have a couple of them in the course of the week. Being out on business the Friday following, I called for them, but finding they were not ready, I took the two silk handkerchiefs with me in the same state in which I bought them: I put them into my coat pocket, where they were found the next morning on my being searched.</p>

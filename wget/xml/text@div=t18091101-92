            . Q. I understand you have the management of the East India company's warehouses at the docks, the two prisoners were employed there. - A. Yes, on the 6th of October the prisoners were loading the caravans from the ship named Winchelsea, my suspicion was excited by seeing both the prisoners go from the caravan several times that day to the privy; suspecting they had something about them I desired they might be brought into the office, they were searched in my presence, upon Carter was found tea in a bag made as a truss to wear between his legs, upon Wood was also found tea concealed in the same way; upon examining the chests in the caravan, one of the lids had been broken open and tea had been taken out. The tea found on the prisoners corresponded with the tea in that chest.</p>

            . I saw the chest weighed No. 1334; it weighed three quarters of an hundred weight; the prisoners took it to the caravan immediately I weighed it, and they were the only loaders; the caravan was locked up under the company's and the King's lock.</p>

            . I examined the goods conveyed by the caravan; I found the weight of the chest 1334 deficient of upwards of a pound, I had suspicion of this chest from the lid being broken open.</p>

               <p>The prisoners said nothing in their defence; Wood called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I conduct the National School in Little Guildford-street, Bloomsbury. About one o'clock on the 10th of March, I was at the school—the prisoner came to me and stated that she met two ladies in the square, and one of them was Miss Powell, who was a teacher in the school—she said that Miss Powell met another lady, who was a teacher in the school, but she did not know her name, and described her dress—that one of these ladies bad bought a bottle-jack of her, and requested it to be brought to me, to be left with me, till she should send her servant to fetch it—she said I was to pay her 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, and this lady's servant should bring me the money—the bottle-jack was worth 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. ort 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—believing she came from the lady, I gave her the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I knew Miss Powell very well—I wondered they had not paid for it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If she had come and used the name of Miss Powell, without describ<lb></lb>ing her dress, should you have let her have the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I very likely should, but the dress confirmed to me that she had evidently seen Miss Powell.</p>

I am confident he is the man. There was a crowd about him, I afterwards saw him at the watch-house, my watch was found by Mrs. Stanfield, I went to her house, and she gave it to me. I have it here, the glass is not broken.</p>

            . I live in Grosvenor-market. About a quarter before eight o'clock on this night, I heard the alarm of Stop thief! I ran out, and Huntley called Stop thief!, I saw the prisoner coming up the steps into the market towards me, running as fast as he could towards Oxford-street. I seized him by the collar, but he got away. Huntley and I stopped him between us. I saw him pass Stanfield's house, I was close to him then endeavouring to stop him. He is the man.</p>

            . I live at No. 5, Chandler-street. I heard a cry of Stop thief! I ran out and saw the prisoner running down Chandler-street, towards my shop, in a direction from James-street, I did not see Walden, I opened my arms to stop him, but he turned to the left and ran up the steps to Grosvenor-market - we took him in the market. A crowd collected and several people tried to take him from us. I got myself very much hurt indeed in taking him, I had a fall in running after him.</p>

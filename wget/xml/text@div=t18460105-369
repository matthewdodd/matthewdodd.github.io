I live at No. 64, Whitecroas-street, Cripplegate; I am one of the agents of the Imperial Insurance Company, and also agent to the landlady of the premises, Mrs. Charlotte Owen. I let the premises in Brain's-buildings, Cripplegate, to the prisoner about three years and a quarter ago—when I let him the premises it was simply an old carpenter's shed—it consisted of the space represented in this model, (<hi rend="italic">looking at one produced</hi>) but not of these erections—some alterations were afterwards made in them by the prisoner—this model, I should say, represents the state of the premises at pre<lb></lb>sent—they have been several times altered, and a portion of them let off—he took a lease three years ago last Christmas, and was bound to insure for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the building only—the original insurance was in the York and London Fire<lb></lb>office—I</p>

               <p>was then an agent for that office—the business of that office has since been transferred to the Imperial Insurance Company—there was no other insurance effected by the prisoner until recently—in Nov. last be called on me, and stated that in addition to insuring the premises he wished to insure his stock and his household furniture, as having recently lost hiswife, he should occasionally sleep there—he stated at that time that his stock and utensils in trade were not of the value of the amount he was about to insure for, but he was about to bring stock there—I took his insurance—he insured for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on stock and furniture and other things, making 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have here as extract which I have since made from my book—I have not got the book hert—I think he said 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on stock and utensils in trade, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on furniture, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on watches and trinkets, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on china, glass, and earthenware, and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think, on papers and prints—I do not recollect that there was any insurance on wearing apparel—I would not say there was not—this was prior to the 20th of Nov., because on the 20th of Nov. he came to me again, and said he bad discovered he could insure for a twelvemonth's rent—I told him he could, and he said he would do so, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., making in the whole 410<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is an old policy that was agreed to be cancelled—here is an account of the items on it, but not in my handwriting—he paid me altogether a premium of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. at various times—the policies are not delivered at the moment of payment; se<lb></lb>veral weeks generally elapse—he paid his premium on different occasions, because he did not state all the things at once—he paid his premium on each occasion on all he did state—he called on me at several different times before the 20th of Nov.—I cannot say that he came a different time about each thing, but he came several times, mentioned a different item of insurance, and paid an additional item on it—he called once, a few days after the 20th of Nov., and asked if his insurance was all correct, and I said it was—I told him we had put all the various items into one policy, by which we had saved him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I returned him the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I do not think I saw or heard any<lb></lb>thing more of him till after the fire—he came to my office on Tuesday, the 9th of Dec—he said, "This is a bad job"—I said, "It is, Ford"—he said, "How am I to proceed with respect to my claim on the office?"—I said, "I believe you had not brought in the presses and the furniture you spoke of when you effected the insurance"—he said, "No, I have not"—I said "Then you must make me out an inventory of what your loss is"—he said, "It will be impossible for me to set down every little article"—I said, "The office won't expect you to make out every trifling thing; make out the best inventory you can, and give it to me, and I will deliver it to the directors"—I am not quite sure whether I asked him when he was at the premises last, or whether he said he was there late, but certainly it came at that he was there late on the evening of the fire—he said he was there at eleven o'clock, and the fire broke out, I believe, about half-past eleven—I said, "What induced you to be there at that hour of the night?"—he said he came down to fetch his keys, which he had left there the evening before, and he had not been able to get at his razors to shave—he said he had got to meet a gentleman on business the next day at eleven o'clock, and he had come down for the purpose of getting his keys to get to his drawers, that he might get his razors to shave.</p>

               <p>been to the house about eleven o'clock—it is sometimes four or five weeks before the policy is transmitted after the insurance is effected, and I have known it to be six weeks—it is according to the business they have at the office—they give no memorandum—they consider the insurance effected through me—the policy is sent to me at their convenience, and I forward it to the person—at the time this fire took place the policy had not been forwarded—I have known the prisoner ever since he has occupied the premises, about three years and a quarter—I do not know that he previously kept a small oil and colour shop—I knew he had a printing business in Cloth-fair—I made the necessary inquiries as to his character before I advised the party for whom I am agent to grant the lease of these premises—I received a very excellent character of him, and he has always borne that character since he has been on the premises—I consider 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year a good rent for the place—it was a mere carpenter's shed, but has been converted by him into a dwelling-house—at the time he took it it was all in a very dilapidated state.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know that he has from time to time used tar and other matters of that kind to keep the rain out from the roof? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He used to do so sometimes—I remember his applying to me for permission to tar the outside of the place instead of painting it, as required by the lease, and I objected—I knew he had been using articles of that kind to keep out the wet—I have been on the premises since the fire—I think I saw the remains of some furniture, but everything was so completely destroyed it is impossible to say—there might be a few articles on the premises—there were the remains of a few—I had asked him if the presses and furniture had been brought into the house, and he replied, "No"—his stock and utensils in trade were insured for 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that would include the presses—he told me he was going to bring two presses in addition to what he had there at that time—I am not a judge of the value of presses—I did not know that he had been unsuccessful in his business—he kept his rent regularly paid up as if he was going on with the business.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did he build his premises of? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Principally wood, I believe—he covered them with tile—the tar was used about the guttering of the roof—when he first came to me about the insurance he said his stock and utensils in trade consisted of his presses, his type, and paper used for printing—he said that was on the premises, except the two presses, which he said he meant to bring on—when he came on the 9th to make the claim he did not give any estimate of the amount of his claim—I did not, at the time I prepared the insurance, at all gather from him the value of what he intended to bring on the premises, as compared with the value of that which was on the pre<lb></lb>mises.</p>

               <p>twelve o'clock at night I was alarmed by a knocking at my door and a cry of "Fire"—I ran out and saw flames rushing from the window over Mr. Ford's gateway (<hi rend="italic">referring to the model</hi>)—part of the premises were occupied by Mr. Al<lb></lb>len as a school—this is Mr. Allen's school-room—this is the window I saw the flames come out of—I think Mr. Allen had been there about six or eight weeks—the prisoner has carried on no business there for the last nine months—if mes<lb></lb>sages came I used to take them in for him—the first of my taking in messages for him was concerning the letting of his premises to Mr. Allen—about three weeks before the fire the prisoner called on me, and told me I need not send anybody else to Highbury-vale to him, for he was going to give up business and was going on the travelling system—he told me he lived at Highbury-vale—I was never there—after that, I observed him at the premises much oftener than usual—I saw him come very often—I cannot say exactly about seeing him go—I never saw him bring anything—I saw him for the last time about the Thursday before the fire—on the Saturday before the fire, about half-past eleven o'clock at night, I smelt a very filthy smell, and I saw a very large light in Mr. Ford's room, from the window where I afterwards saw the flames—I cannot say what kind of light it was, but it was a very large bright light, for the room was entirely lit up—it was not such as a candle or lamp would give—the room appeared to be quite illuminated—I did not notice how long the light continued—the fil thy smell of pitch and tar was very strong, as if it was burning—I sat down by my window where I could hear everybody pass up and down—the prisoner has a particular step, and I did not hear him or see him there—I did not notice the light any longer than as I was coming up the gateway and going into my own door—that was for a minute—I did not smell the smell after I got in-doors—I spoke to the prisoner about a smell twelve months ago, but not about the smell on the Saturday.</p>

On Sunday night, the 7th of Dec., about twenty minutes after eleven o'clock, as I was going up my staircase, I saw a little redness in the sky, and I saw some sparks fly up—it was a fire—our house is opposite to the entrance of Brain's buildings—as you go up the buildings the entrance to the prisoner's premises exactly faces you—it if not a thoroughfare—there are three houses of each side—on seeing the fire I immediately went down stairs, ran over the road, looked up the buildings, and saw the prisoner's premises on fire—I noticed the flame through the window over the door—the school-room was in dark<lb></lb>ness—I saw the flames perfectly—as soon as I came to have a clear view of the premises the flames were coming out oi the window—I will not say at the moment I first saw it, but the moment afterwards I did—when I first saw the house it was entirely in flames—I did not notice the time by any clock—I speak from recollection—it was about twenty minutes after eleven o'clock, as near as I can say—I stood and looked at it for a moment or two, and them</p>

               <p>I went out of the buildings to fetch my nephew; but finding my niece had outrun me, I turned back and looked at the fire again—I then went home to fetch the keys of the school-room, to save the daybook and ledger—it is my nephew's school-room—I know the prisoner—I saw him on, the 17th of Nov. in my nephew Mr. Allen's school-room—he and I were alone—I forget how the conversation began, but the prisoner remarked to me, that if a fire took place in that building it would be confined to those walls—I said it was impossible he could say where a fire would stop, as the buildings were very narrow, and I thought the whole of the houses would come down, or some<lb></lb>thing to that effect—he looked round and said, "Oh no, the fire would be confined to these walls, it would go no further"—I asked him whether he intended to set the place on fire—he said no, he hoped not—I told him it would be a dangerous experiment—I think he began the conversation by asking me whether my nephew had insured yet—I told him he had not, but he was on the eve of doing so; in fact, I think that very day he had gone about the business—the prisoner said he wished he had, or he wished he would, or something of that kind—I think this about the insurance was at the commencement of the conversation.</p>

I was in his school-room with Allen and the prisoner—the prisoner said he wished Allen would insure—Allen said he would as soon as possible—something was said about a railway at that time, but I do not exactly recol<lb></lb>lect what—the prisoner said he understood he could insure a twelvemonth's rent—my brother did not say anything to that—the prisoner said he had a fresh policy out—the conversation turned upon railways, and I do not ex<lb></lb>recollect what it ended in.</p>

               <p>was it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, about insurance—that was not introduced by talking of the railways, it went off to the railways—I think the insurance was to be made from a notion that there would be a greater value in the premises if a railway came there—I had no acquaintance with the prisoner's wife—I knew him by coming into my brother's premises—my brother had been there about six weeks when the fire took place—he took the premises of the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a schoolmaster, and reside at No. 2, Bun<lb></lb>hill-row. About six weeks before the fire I took part of these premises of the prisoner for the purpose of a school-room—there was no internal communi<lb></lb>cation between my premises and the prisoner's after I put them into repair—they were quite separated then, but only by a wooden partition—on the Sa<lb></lb>turday before the fire, I left the school-room about a quarter past two—it was a half-holiday—I left my premises quite safe at that time, and no fire in the stove—no one slept in the school-room—I locked the outside door, and took the key with me—I was aroused about half-past eleven on Sunday night by a cry of fire—I went to the spot—the fire was then coming out through the windows of the prisoner's premises, and reaching round the corner into the first window of mine—there was no appearance of fire in my part—the fire continued until the premises were destroyed—I had not effected any insurance on my property there—I had frequently been into the premised occupied by the prisoner—the last time, I should think, was a fortnight before the fire occurred—I did not then go over the premises, but I had opportunities of seeing into all of them—the whole were filled with different materials, arranged without respect to order—there were printing materials—there were no presses there at all—there were cases of type, and a hetero<lb></lb>geneous mass of different materials, blacking-bottles, cobbler's lasts, and a variety of things unconnected with the prisoner's business, as well as things connected with it—I cannot state with any certainty the number of cases I saw—I cannot say they contained any type, they were on the top of each other—there was type lying in the room adjoining my school-room—it was standing on the floor, arranged—the type cases stood on the floor, piled one upon another—I cannot swear they held type—I saw no furniture there, with the exception of a Windsor chair, and one or two broken articles—there was no amount of furniture, nor any appearance of business going on—no busi<lb></lb>ness was carried on by the prisoner since I have occupied my portion of the premises—the prisoner for the most part left his key with me, until, I think, a week before the fire occurred—the last time he came to me for the key was, as near as I can say, on the Tuesday or Wednesday before the fire—he then told me he wanted the key, as he intended to bring some furniture into the place—I understood him to say from Highbury—I think that was between twelve and two o'clock—he looked in in a day or two after, to know whether any message had been left—I saw him on the Monday, the day following the fire, in Brain's-buildings—the persons from the fire—he were there then, Mr. Mallet, the head engineer, Mr. Atkinson, and the two Mr. Nynes—Mr. Nyne asked the prisoner, in my presence, when he was last on the premises—he said, "About twenty minutes past eleven o'clock on Sunday night," the night before—he asked him what he went there for it such a time as that on Sunday night—he said to get the keys that he had left behind him on Saturday night, to get his razors that were locked up in some drawer at Highbury—Mr. Nyne then said, "How is it you did not shave this morning?"—the prisoner said he had shaved, but in cold water—he did not appear as if he had been shaved that day—I said I had shaved, and was in the habit of shaving in cold water for years—he then said his razors were blunt</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184601050031"></xptr>
               <p>the prisoner expressed his surprise that I was not insured—he seemed to be under the idea that I was—he said, "What, are you not insured?"—I said, "No, not for a farthing"—he expressed a doubt as to whether his insurance would cover his loss—I told him an inquest would be held on the fire—he said he could say no more at the inquest than he said then—I believe it was after that he said the insurance would not cover his loss—he said he had furniture there—I told him I knew of none—he said he had brought it in on the Saturday—I asked how he had brought it in, whether in a cart or truck—he said he had carried it himself from a person named Cummins, in Willow<lb></lb>walk, Tabernacle-square—I asked what quantity of furniture he carried him<lb></lb>self—he said, "Four mahogany chairs without the cushions"—he was asked if he had a light there on the Sunday night—he said, "Yes," and he recol<lb></lb>lected having stumbled as he was coming out of the premises with the light in his hand—I then asked him whether the light had fallen from his hand—he said no, he had grasped it tight—he came into my school-room several times before the fire and talked about insurance—he asked me whether I had insured, and he showed me his policy on one occasion, and he eventually told me he had altered it three times—he said the fact of my having a stove, which was in the centre of my school-room, affected his policy, and he was obliged to alter it on those grounds—he came to me several times about it, and once he showed me his policy, and said he had been obliged to have it altered on account of my stove increasing the hazard—I should think that was about three weeks before the fire—he asked me whether I should insure, and I said I intended to do so—on another occasion he told me he had again altered his policy to insure property on the premises—I think that was about a fortnight or three weeks before the fire—it was after he had spoken about my stove—he told me he had effected an insurance on property on the premises to the amount of 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I think—it was, I think, on that same occasion we were talking about fire, and he said if a fire took place there, it would be confined to the corner; that the wall of Mr. Bassington's was thirteen inches thick, and the wall of the house on the other side nine inches thick—I looked round and said, "Yes, a fire would indeed clear out the corner"—on one occasion I saw some black stuff on his premises which I thought was pitch, but which he told me was printing varnish—it was in the gutter of the roof—the gutter was full of it—that must have been five or six weeks before the fire—it was while my portion of the premises was repairing—he said the apprentices had filled the place up with it, he had a quantity of it there—there was a small tub of the same stuff standing in the yard—he told me it was printing varnish—I Went on the premises on the Monday morning after the fire—the fire appeared to me to have begun in the corner against the wall, where the black mark is on the model—one reason for my thinking so, was finding the wall blackened all round for the extent of three or four feet, like the smoke that would rise from the beginning of a fire—it adjoined that portion of my premises where my heaviest property was—there were vestiges of property left in that corner—my opinion is that some combustible matter had burnt there, and then gone to the other part of the premises—it must have been so—the fire commencing there would have scorched the walls before the flames gained sufficient ascen<lb></lb>dency to destroy the premises—I saw a pile of type cases in the corner near the wall, and I saw some type in them, but I did not lift them, and do not know what was underneath.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>and papers tied up, and a considerable quantity of type—I cannot speak with any certainty as to the quantity—they were square cases, such as are used in printing-offices, about three feet long, by two and a half wide—they are not more than an inch deep—they hold one layer of type—I do not think I stated before the Magistrate that he said he doubted whether his insurance would cover his loss—I have not been examined by the solicitor for the prosecution, or by anybody since I was before the Magistrate—I have given no further evidence—I have avoided it strictly—he expressed a doubt whether his insurance was completed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And was not the doubt he expressed, whether not being completed, it would cover his property? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, because the question I put to him di<lb></lb>rectly, was, "Have you paid up the demands of the office on you?" and he said, "Yes"—I said, "Then there can be no doubt about the safety of your insurance"—he expressed a doubt about the safety of his insurance previous to my telling him so—the ground of his doubt was not having his policy in his own hands, not whether the 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would cover his loss—he conveyed to me that four chairs was about the extent of the furniture he had in the house—he told me that was what he carried in on the Saturday night—that was all he told me of—he did not tell me that was all he had—when I saw the flames they were coming out from this corner—(<hi rend="italic">referring to the model</hi>)—there is no window near there—there had been one, but it was boarded up—it had a wooden flooring—that was very little injured.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the engineers of the London Fire Establishment—our station is in Whitecross-street, from 80 to 100 yards from Brain's-buildings. On Sunday evening, the 7th of Dec., about a quarter to twelve, I was called to the place where the fire happened—the whole of the building was on fire when I got there—it took about half-an-hour to get the fire under—the roofs of the workshops were all burnt down—after that our officers were placed in charge of the building, one relieving another, from the time the fire was extinguished, till Tuesday, the 9th, so that no person could have an opportunity of going into them to put anything there, or take anything away—on Tuesday, the 9th, we commenced examining the premises of Mr. Allen, and on Wednesday we began to examine the prisoner's premises—the officers kept possession until then, from the time the fire was extinguished—on Wednesday I found these books saturated with <hi rend="italic">turps</hi>—(<hi rend="italic">producing them</hi>)—I found them in the prisoner's premises, near the type-cases, where the black mark is on the model—they were in the same state they are now, wet—we smelt the <hi rend="italic">turps</hi> before we discovered them—they were under the rubbish which had fallen from the roof—it did not appear that any water had got to the books—the rubbish had sheltered them from the water—they were wet from the <hi rend="italic">turps</hi>—every leaf is saturated with <hi rend="italic">turps</hi>—I have had charge of them ever since, and they are in the same state as when I found them—I kept them locked up in a box in the engine-house—they have not received any wet of any kind since they have been in my possession—they were in one heap, near the wall—under these books I found a layer of shavings, some of which I pro<lb></lb>duce, saturated with gas-tar—they smell of it now—I know the difference be<lb></lb>tween the smell of gas-tar and Stockholm-tar—I should say this is gas-tar—I found nearly a sack full of these shavings under the books—in my judgments it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184601050033"></xptr>
               <p>was impossible for the books to have been in the state in which I found them had the turpentine been spilt on them—in my judgment they must have been steeped in turpentine—there does not appear to be any turpentine connected with the shavings, that I can smell—they were about a foot in depth—on the day following we discovered another sack of shavings—part of the sack is burnt—(<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—it was lying on the floor with these shavings in it and about it—I did not find the remains of any burnt shavings about the same room—I found the sack of shavings within a foot of where we dis<lb></lb>covered the books, and close to the wall, that was burnt up—in my judgment the fire commenced in that corner near the party-wall—the wood-work of the building was quite destroyed at that corner—I found among the rubbish the remains of some chairs, and portions of an old bedstead—I have often seen and smelt the varnish used by printers, it is impossible I could have mistaken the smell of the shavings for that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you know that turpentine is very often used for cleaning type? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I have understood printers use a great quantity for that purpose—supposing the fire had commenced in the centre of the floor, and had been attracted to that corner, the appearance would have been differ<lb></lb>ent from what I saw; the shavings must have been burnt, and the bottom of the sack must have been burnt, but instead of that the upper part was burnt—the sack was lying lengthways on the floor, about three feet from the cor<lb></lb>ner, and about a foot from the party-wall—I observed nothing but rubbish between the sack and the other end of the room; I mean the rubbish from the building when it fell—there were some loose shavings at the further part of the building, over the entrance to the door—there were no loose shavings where the fire began, except those we found under the books—they were not in a sack—they were partly burnt—this is all the paper I found saturated with turpentine—it was not fastened together, but as it is now, folded toge<lb></lb>ther; not lying loose about, but in one pile, as if it had formed a book—there was no appearance of any books saturated with turpentine having been burnt—the room in which the fire commenced was about five or six feet by six—I cannot say whether there had been a door to it—all that part was quite destroyed—the loose shavings extended over the front of the doorway—there were none in that room—the shavings under the books extended beyond the books—there seemed about a sackful—there was a little rubbish between the books and the shavings, rubbish arising from the destruction of the building.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-sergeant, No.</hi> 101.) I was at the station in Moor-lane when the prisoner was brought in—I saw him write this paper—he was about passing it to his uncle, who was with him, and I took it from him—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"8, College-terrace, Highbury-vale. Get the key of the bed-room out of kitchen cupboard; also the pocket-book of my wife's, red; open the bed-room at the top of the house; open the middle drawer with the spring<lb></lb>key; take out of the right hand corner drawer, and with ring-key open bottom drawer, and take out watch and key: also out of corner cupboard near window the tickets in the letter."</p>
               <p>----<hi rend="smallCaps">MATTHEWS</hi>. I am a surveyor and appraiser, and live in Cloak-lane. I went to these premises by the desire of the Company, to examine the rem<lb></lb>nants of the fire—I found vestiges of the following articles:—4 tin canisters, or cisterns, with printing ink; 2 iron-bound casks; leather covered trunk; folding steps; about 1100 wood letters; 5 woods; 15 old plough-knives; 20 binders' tools, letters and flowers, and 27 others; 12 binders' rules; 1 spanner for a press; about 5 cwt. of paper, various, as pamphlets, maga<lb></lb>zines, &amp;c.; 31 chases, imposing-stone and stand; 450 stereotype plates; 12 copper plates; an ink-roller; 68 wood type cases, stand for ditto; hand copper-plate press; about 2600 weight of type and furniture; 500lbs. fused metal; 6 pages of letter-press stereotype; a quantity of blacking-bottles; certain ink, German-stove, glue-pot; 6 tin cans, 5 mallets, a mattock, brass cock, a quantity of shoemakers' lasts; 3 shop show jars and covers, and muller and stone—in furniture I found an old cooking apparatus, 5 rush-seat chairs, 4 mahogany ditto, a hearth-brush, 1 pillar and claw mahogany-table, a 2-flap table, 1 Windsor arm chair, a Dutch clock, bellows, 4 iron pots, warming-pan, kitchen-fender, and 2 old wire ditto; 2 tin tea-kettles, 3 spoons, Waterloo bedstead, 2 scuttles, 2 blankets, 2 sheets, and a quilt, printed cotton bed furniture, and a check ditto; 4 old waistcoats, 2 pairs of trowsers, 1 pair of</p>

               <p>breeches, 2 coats, a jacket, 15 printed books, and a press bedstead—that is the salvage of the whole fire, exclusive of Mr. Allen's—the German stove had apparently heated part of the prisoner's premises—I should consider the amount of stock, at a very liberal price, would be 82<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or 83<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the amount of furniture about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or rather more, including wearing apparel—that includes all I saw—that is presuming he had to sell it, and that the articles were as I suppose they were before the fire.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> If he had had to buy them, I presume you would put a higher value on them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly, because the greater part would have been type—if he had been obliged to buy them the value would have been far exceeding the amount of insurance.</p>

When I came to Hampstead I was informed, if I went to the Coach-and-horses, I should hear where my goods were. I went, and was informed they were at the house of one Muddock, a constable. I saw the goods at Muddock's, and knew them to be mine. I went the next day, and took an inventory of them; my niece took the inventory; I was by at the time. I saw all the things mentioned in the indictment at Mr. Muddock's, (repeating them). They were all in the house when I left it. I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman in the parish of Hampstead. Upon the 18th of December, as I was crying the hour at three in the morning, I met one Mr. Brown with a lamb cart; he told me had seen a little cart coming along the road, and he thought it had some stolen goods in it. He said, he thought there were two men upon the cart, and one by the side. He had told my brother watchman of it before. I walked up the town, crying the hour, and met Osborne, Ball, and Hilsdon, and two others beside.</p>
               <p>Who were the two others? - One was Wilkins.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner? - I cannot say I do.</p>
               <p>Who told you there was one Wilkins? - Ball.</p>
               <p>Is Wilkins the prisoner at the bar? - I cannot say that he is.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner one of the five? - I cannot be positive that he was.</p>
               <p>Should you know the man that they call Wilkins, if you was to see him. - I cannot say that I should.</p>
               <p>Did you stop the cart? - I intended to stop it, but they drove away from me; they drove against a brick-wall, and overturned it, just above the pump, in the town of Hampstead, and I and two other watchmen came up to them; there was household furniture in the cart. When it overturned they endeavoured to make off. I struck at one of them as he turned the corner of the butcher's shop; as I struck at him Ball came up, and I collared him; he immediately struck me in the neck. I took Ball only. I delivered the goods up to Muddock the constable.</p>

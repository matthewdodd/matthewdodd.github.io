On 11th September, I was returning home at nearly 3 o'clock in the morning—I went into the Jolly Farmers, in Cumberland-market—I saw the prisoners there, I entered into conversation with Williams, and gave him some gin and water—I remained there about ten minutes—I had some gin and water—I was quite sober—I left the house, and went across the market into Albany-street—I passed on to the bridge, but did not cross it—immediately I turned the corner of Albany-street, I saw two men, who I believe to be the prisoners, approaching me—I guessed what their intention was, and immediately called "Police!"—I then received a blow on the left side of my head—I do not know who gave it me, but I believe it to be the prisoner Harding—one man came behind me, and passed something round my neck—I was pulled down on my back by it, I presume, and the man in front of me tried to take my watch from my left hand pocket: I believe that it was Harding—he then passed bis finger through my other waistcoat pocket—I called "Police!" nearly a dozen times; the police came, and the men ran away—I afterwards saw a cab near me—I saw one man run down Park Village East, that was Harding; it was a tall man, I could not see his countenance at the time; it was dark.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you ultimately apprehend him when he had put the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> on to the stand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I met him in Albany-street, and ran into the road, shouted, and caught hold of the reins—that was not after he had put the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> in the stand.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LILLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not he pull up when you shouted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was drawing up, but he did not pull up till I caught hold of the reins; he was pulling up.</p>

I said I had a right to look at who I pleased, and so might he if he would; then the other man told me to go along about my business, I told him I would, and one side of the road is gravelled and the other is not, I had not got off this gravel not above ten yards from him before the prisoner fired a pistol at me, I saw him point the pistol at me, and heard the flash, I kept my eye upon him, with that I cried out stop thief, and this man run and the other stopped; I had a stick in my hand, I took the other with the assistance of a gentleman, and took him to the watch-house, and somebody brought in the prisoner; then the prisoner at the bar ran up to me and gave me several blows, and he gave me a blow on the jaw that I could not open it for fourteen days, it was a moon-light night, I am quite sure of the prisoner's person, I had an opportunity of seeing him as he was not many minutes out of my sight, this was when they were both hand-cuffed together carrying to prison; I did not know either of them before that night, they did not demand my money.</p>

               <p>How came this man to fire at you? - I do not know, it was his wicked inclination.</p>

               <p>Did you observe whether he pointed the pistol at you or not? - Yes, he did.</p>

               <p>Was the pistol loaded? - I cannot tell, it made a very loud report, as if loaded with something heavy, it alarmed the neighbours; he had only that one pistol when he was searched, I was sure he was the same man<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110144"></xptr> when I saw him at the watch-house; it had been raining just before, it cleared up and was quire light.</p>

               <p>If I was guilty of doing any fact, I should not do it where I was known to every body, I fell down, and in consequence of the pistol being cocked it went off, but I made no attempt to fire at him.</p>

               <p>Court to the other witnesses. Was he in liquor? - He did not appear to be so.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, the only question for your consideration seems to be whether you are satisfied under the circumstances that he fired the pistol, which was loaded, at the prosecutor, with a felonious intention of killing or wounding him.</p>

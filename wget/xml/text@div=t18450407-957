                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and live in Haberdasher-walk, in the parish of St. Leonard Shoreditch. It is my dwelling-house—this tea<lb></lb>chest produced is mine, and when I lost it was full of tea, and worth more than 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it had never been opened—I saw it safe on the 7th of April, about twenty minutes past nine o'clock at night, within the cill of the shop-door, on a chest of congou—I did not see it taken, but I missed it in a very few minutes—people came round the door, and said, "<hi rend="largeCaps">A</hi> chest of tea is gone"—I left the shop and ran across the road, and saw the chest of tea lying on the ground, and Heath in the policeman's custody—I did not see either of the other prisoners at that time, but have no hesitation in saying that I saw John Caffyn looking in at my window about three quarters of an hour before the tea was stolen.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. About five minutes past nine o'clock on the evening of the 7th of April, I saw Heath standing some few yards from Mr. Bagley's shop, and also saw William Caffyn and a man resembling John, but of him I am not positive—I am positive of William—I knew him previously—I saw him looking in at Mr. Bagley's shop window—I did not notice him any time there—suspecting what they were about, I asked Sergeant Boyd to watch them for a short time, while I went to change my clothes—the two went away, leaving Heath in the street, whom I did not then suspect—I changed my clothes, came back, and followed them a little distance—I saw them run up Myrtle-street, near Hoxton-church—I lost sight of them for some little time—I then went back to the shop, and found all three together close to the prosecutor's shop, looking in at the window—they crossed and recrossed the street two or three times—I then saw William Caffyn go and stand at Mr. Bagley's private door, and Heath and the other were on the opposite side of the way—William Caffyn crossed to them, and all three were together again—I then saw Heath go to Mr. Bagley's private door—after watching him some time, I saw him put his foot on the cill of the shop, and take the chest of tea—he crossed to Buttesland-street, and went some distance up the street—I followed him—William Caffyn and the third man walked towards him—as I went towards Heath he dropped the chest of tea, and was about to run away when I made a jump at him, and seized him—the other two got away—I knew where William Caffyn lived—I went to his lodging, and apprehended him—he said he had not been in Hoxton that night—I am positive he is the person I saw with Heath—I should be sorry to swear to John—he is like the third person.</p>

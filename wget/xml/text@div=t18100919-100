               <p>"Honoured Master - I hope you will not advertise me, or mention the circumstance to my relations; I have been one of the greatest villains to you; I was young and inexperienced to Mr. Bates, he is an old man, and should not have betrayed a boy to commit such a crime; he said, he would tell me how I might steal the boots from you, and to mark the name of any person in the shop that took the work in, and he would give me sixteen shillings a pair for them; he said he would send them off for Bombay, he told me that he sent them off to a captain. I am now assured you can hang me for forging the name of the men in the shop. I hope you will forgive me for the sake of my poor aunt. May God protect you, is the prayer of the wretched</p>
               <p>"Sebastin Pullen."</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I received this letter after I had desired Owen, one of my men to go to Pullen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, after you had received this letter, go to the house of Bates with

             - A. I did, to number ninety-five, Bartholomew Close; he is a shoemaker, and keeps an open shop there. Leadbetter searched his shop in my presence: the prisoner was not within; Leadbetter opened a cupboard in the shop and found thirteen pair of boots, twelve pair of them were in an unfinished state. I swear, to the best of my judgment, the twelve pair of unfinished boots were my property. Bates then came in the shop; Leadbetter addressed him, he said, that he had got a warrant to search the house, he had found them boots, he wanted to know how he could account for them. Bates replied, that he bought them of Mr. King, that he could produce the bill and receipt. He took the file where he usually filed his bills, and sorted them over for about ten minutes; the officer seemed impatient, seeing he could not find it, said, he must come along with him. He was taken away. In four or five of these boots are my marks, and the others have the appearance of the marks having been rubbed out; I place the number in the back of the boot.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Your usual method of doing business is this, that you or your, clickers deliver out the materials to Pullen, and he is to bring back these materials to you made up into boots - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. How many clickers - A. I have three that are in the habit of doing that.</p>
               <p>Q. You have three clickers, and the duty of the clickers is this, he delivers out the materials to the maker, the maker brings the work home and receives from your clickers a shop-bill, which is an acknowledgment of his bringing home the work that he had taken out - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the production of that shop-bill to you, you or a clicker pay him for his work - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore what is here conveyed in the letter, by marking the initials of your shopmen, is imputing this sort of fraud, instead of bringing home the work that he should have obtained from your shopman, a shop-bill, purporting that the work was brought home; that you understand by that - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. So that the fraud is a double fraud to you, you pay for the work, and do not get back the boots - A. That is the case.</p>
               <p>Q. So that you have given out the leather for the making, and the boots are not brought back to you, and yet you have paid for the making - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. These marks that you speak of are made upon the leather before it goes out to be made - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore the crime which you impute to Pullen, instead of bringing the boots home to you, he obtained from you the money for making - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They were never in your possession in the shape of boots. You have charged him with having taken these boots from you; they were only boots in the shape of legs and soles - A. No other way.</p>
               <p>Q. The finishing is only the blacking and polishing; afterwards did you find any last at Bates's - A. I took five, but I thought one of them did not belong to me; I found them in the shop with the numbers rasped out from the usual place where I number them.</p>

After I had found these boots, in about ten minutes, Bates came in; I then asked him how he accounted for them boots being in his possession; he said, he bought them of a man of the name of King; he could shew me the bill and receipt for them; he took down two files of receipts, he looked them over two or three times; I told him I could not wait, as he could not find them; I advised him to put his papers up and examine them at leisure. Mr. Limebeer took out six lasts from the rails, five of them he thought were his, and one was not.</p>

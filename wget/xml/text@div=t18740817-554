I am the wife of George Edward White and live at 15, Felton Street, Hoxton—the deceased young woman, Julia Georgina Murphy, was my daughter—she had been married to a man named Henry Murphy—she was twenty-one years old last November, and she had been cohabiting for about twelve months with the prisoner—I saw her in the middle of the day on the 18th—I saw her on the Sunday evening, the next evening, and she then seemed to be ill—a medical man was called in on Monday afternoon, and she died on Tuesday the 28th.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>.

               <p>and two others had a pint of ale and two bottles of ginger beer—the deceased said something to the prisoner and he ordered her out, and then he carried her out and I saw no more of them—he took her round the waist and put her into the street and he followed—her bonnet came off.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at 177, New North Road—on Monday, 20th July, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I was called to see the deceased—she was lying on the bed in the front room of her own house—she was suffering from severe pains in the head and symptoms of fractured skull—there was a bruise behind the right ear and a slight graze on one of the arms—I discovered the fracture afterwards by the result of the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—the skin was contused, and by taking away the skin behind the ear I found a fracture about an inch long through the temporal bone corresponding with the bruise, and then it extended two inches through the base of the skull—the fracture was the cause of death—she died on the 28th.</p>
               <p>

The appearances that I saw might have been caused by a fall on stones, or a hard substance—it would not be impossible—the bruise might have been caused by a fall, but not the fracture—if he had fallen on a hard substance, I should not expect to find the fracture sthere, but in a different part—I think it would be impossible to fracture the skull by a hard substance in that part—if it had been a fall, I should expect to find a bruise at the back of the head, not behind the ear—it might have been done by a fall.</p>

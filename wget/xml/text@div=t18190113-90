I sleep at my father's, and he supports me in victuals and clothes. I was running behind a hackney-coach, two boys shoved me against the coach, I told them to go away - they said very bad words. I left the coach, and was walking on the footpath, the prisoner came to me, took my hat off my head, gave it to another boy, and told him to run away with it - I am sure the prisoner took it; they were the two boys who pushed me against the coach; the other ran away - I have never got my hat. I followed the prisoner for my hat into a dark passage; he then beat me, and said he had not got it. I followed him into Spital-square, where a gentleman collared him, as I informed him of it. I gave him in charge. My father bought the hat for me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective officer. On 2nd April, I received a warrant for the apprehension of the prisoner, and went with Mr. Zuccani to Southampton—I found the prisoner there on the following day at 4, Yorkterrace—I was answered by a man who called himself Marshall—I said, "Mr. Marshall," he said, "Yes;" I said, "I am a police officer, and hold a warrant from the Bankruptcy Court for the apprehension of Joseph and John Legge"—I did not see the prisoner then—in consequence of what Mr. Marshall said, I found it necessary to search the premises; there was a great deal of resistance to my doing so, on the part of Marshall and the prisoner's wife—after I had searched the greater portion of the house, the prisoner came from the upper part of the house; I lodged him at the police station at Southampton that night, and brought him to town on the following day, Monday, and handed him over to the officer of the Bankruptcy Court—on 20th April, I was at Guildhall police-court—I saw Marshall in the prisoner's presence, in a room adjoining the police court—after the examination of Marshall, I said to him in the prisoner's presence, "What money has your son given to you?" the prisoner replied, "I have not given him any, it was given by Mr. Wontner"—Mr. Wontner appeared for him on that occasion—I did not see any money pass—I do not remember that Marshall himself said anything—I have seen Marshall and the prisoner in conversation together, but I have not heard the particulars of the conversation—I have not heard them address each other as "father," or "son"—from the character of their language I always considered that they addressed each other as such; I cannot tell the words, it was from the general conversation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You suspected that they were father and son before, did you not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I do not remember any particular expression in their conversation that led me to believe it; I did not hear them address each other as "father" or "son.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DEARSLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> However, I understand you to say, they admitted to you that that was the relationship? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not together; they have done so at different times—the father did not admit in the prisoner's presence that he was his son—the prisoner has not admitted to me in direct terms that Marshall was his father—I do not recollect anything particular that he said about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What took you to Guildhall? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was instructed by the solicitor for the prosecution; Samuel Marshall Legge was charged with conspiracy, I believe by Mr. Nicholson, one of the creditors—the charge of conspiracy was against the prisoner, his wife, and his father; those three were charged with couspiring to defraud the creditors of their goods—I think I attended four or five examinations before the Magistrate—the first examination was not a long one, but the subsequent examinations were very lengthy; the result of it was that all the prisoners were discharged; the charge was dismissed—I have not seen Mr. Zuccani here to-day, he has been here on every other occasion; his name is on the back of the bill—I did not go direct to No. 4, York-terrace, I traced them there—I left London, and chose to go to Southampton; I was not desired to go there, I chose my own course—I did not know that Marshall was living at Southampton; it was stated before Mr. Fane that Marshall was at Southampton, but I went there before that.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you no instructions to go to Southampton? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I used my own discretion about that; I heard certain accounts in connection with this business, and I thought it most prudent to go to Southampton—the furniture that I found in the house there was cabinet and upholstery furniture; some was finished, and some not; there were tables, and chests of drawers, and sofa frames, and chair frames—it seemed the stock of an upholsterer's and cabinet maker's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DEARSLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were the parties remanded four' times on the charge of conspiracy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe they were, I did not attend the whole of the examinations; I believe the case was beard before four different Aldermen—I went to Southampton because I heard that certain goods had gone there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What quantity of property was there at Southampton? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No. 4 was a six-roomed house, and two kitchens besides; it was full of furniture, and there was some more at No. 5, the house adjoining, No. 4 not being sufficiently large to hold it—I do not mean that the house was furnished for habitation, but the rooms were crowded with furniture, piled one on the other—I believe there was four or five tons of it—I believe it to be worth some hundreds of pounds—what I said to Marshall at the police court was, "What money has your son given you?"—I am sure I used that expression, and then it was that the defendant answered—I remember nothing more being said—beseemed to recognise the expression as alluding to him, I did not address him—I have heard them conversing on other occasions, but I cannot mention anything that they said.</p>

                  </hi>. I know the prisoner; I believe he is my brother. I have known him many years, and he has been brought up as such; I could not prove he was or was not—he has always lived in the family as my brother—my father's name is Legge, his Christian name is Samuel Marshall—I believe his name is Samuel Marshall Legge—I and the prisoner have lived together with him as his sons—my father has never to my knowledge gone by any other name besides Legge—my brother, father, and myself were not living together previous to the bankruptcy—my father did not live with me at Brompton, he did in Chelsea; he then went by the name of Legge—I will not swear that my father never went by the name of Marshall, to my knowledge; he might have done so at York-terrace, Southampton, but I was not present when he took the premises—I went down there on the Thursday night, and left on the Sunday morning following—I think he did go by the name of Marshall there—I have been in business with my brother—I have aided him in selling furniture by auction, P arranged the sales—the first sale was at Tunbridge; I arranged that with a gentleman, to whom P was well known for twelve months before, and he sold the goods by auction for me without my brother knowing anything about it—there was afterwards a sale at Canterbury; my father arranged for that sale by my instructions—my brother had an interest in that, but he was not present—it was a sale by public auction; I was there and received the money—the goods were sold in the name of Legge—I went by the name of Anson there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you been in partnership with your brother? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About ten weeks altogether; my name was used jointly with my brother's for about ten weeks—I entered into partnership with him about 1st Jan., the business was then carried on jointly in Churton-street—sales were effected at Canterbury and Ramsgate; the goods were sold by public auction—the name of the firm was Joseph and John Legge; the goods were sent down to Canterbury, and sold there by public auction—I was known to the parties, although I went in an assumed name, as is commonly done—P was known as the proprietor of the goods; after the sales at Canterbury and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185309190004"></xptr>
               <p>Ramsgate, certain sums were paid to the creditors—I do not know how much exactly—some money was paid to the creditors immediately after the sale at Canterbury—the whole of the money taken at the sale at Canterbury was expended in the firm, and principally paid to the creditors; my brother disposed of the money that was realised from the sale at Ramsgate; I believe it was paid to two different creditors—I assisted in taking the goods down to Southampton—we intended to sell them there, and offer them as a composition—we thought of selling them at a great advantage, as I am well known there, better than in my native town—they were to be sold in the same way as had been done at Canterbury and Ramsgate—my father bad formerly occupied a house at Southampton in his own name—that was in 1847, I have no doubt that there were cards found on the premises that would prove it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DEARSLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he live there in the name of Legge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, in the new town there; I do not know how it was that he came to take the name of Marshall—the sales I speak of were what are called speculative sales—they were forced sales, we were obliged to make up money for our bills, but I have speculated in sales for years, and have realised more than I could otherwise.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What do you mean by a forced sale? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say it would be to go and sell a certain amount of goods for about half their value.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DEARSLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there a loss to you in every case? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was a very heavy loss at Tunbridge and Ramsgate, but the loss by the Canterbury sale was very trifling; I believe, there was a loss—they sold for much less than we had to give for the heavier goods, but then we were charged an exorbitant price for them—you will find on looking over the sale account, that the goods I had from my creditors fetched the full value—my father had ceased to live at Southampton for two or three years before this affair—he had then been known there under the name of Legge, and myself too.</p>

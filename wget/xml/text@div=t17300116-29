             thus depos'd, Coming from Hackney between Kingsland and the Cok , I bore a Lanthorn before my Master , and I heard some Horsemen, as I thought, advance towards me, when they came up they viewed me, and as soon as they came to the hind<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173001160010"></xptr> Wheel of the Chariot, they fir'd a Pistol, shot the Coachman in the Arm, and he died this Morning; when they had shot, I heard them cry out, your Money, Sir, your Watch and Rings; my Master said nothing, I stood close with my Lanthorn, and Johnson was by me, the Horsemen took the Money, and Johnson held a Pistol to me, and bid me Dismount; I look'd at his Face, and he looked as if he would let off the Pistol in my Face, and that would have been very hard indeed; so I got, or rather tumbled off my Horse, and he said to the other, Get up, Get up; the other got upon the Horse, rid away, and turned him up at the Turnpike, and the Saddle and Bridle were lost - Keys came on Tuesday Night to Mr. Brown's at Stoke Newington , and confessed the Robbery, going home that Night with Mother Mare , I met Mr. Brown , and he told me of it, and asked me to go to his House - It put me into a Tremble, and I was going Home for a Stick, but that I thought it might fright my Wife; so I goes without, and saw Keys, and he said he was one of the three that Robb'd my Master - I would not believe it, he said he was, and said, if I had had a Blunderbuss I had Died, for they view'd me well, and more then that he would kill my Master; and since I was so great a Man with a Blunderbuss, he would kill me if I offer'd to take him, and wish'd he had Johnson with him. Johnson was the Man that held the Pistol to my Head, the Man on Foot was a civil Fellow, and I said 'twas pity to take him - I see Johnson afterwards in Newington Town when 'twas almost Dusk, and he but just turn'd his Face, and I knew him; I confin'd Keys in the House, and carry'd him to my Master, and then before Justice Cook, who committed him to Newgate.</p>
               <p>Keys said, he met this Evidence in Red-Lyon-Street, London; that he gave him a Pint of Beer, and told him the Circumstances of the Robbery, and they running in his Head when he was Drunk, he knew not what he said.</p>
               <p>Gibbins did not deny his giving Keys a pint of Beer, but said he did not tell him the Circumstances of the Robbery.</p>
               <p>Gibbins was ask'd some plain Questions by the Court, and he prevaricated; which did not much advance the Credit of his Evidence .</p>

Brown answered no, nor was ever at his House before.</p>

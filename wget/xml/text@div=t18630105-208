I am collector to the Scottish Hospital, of the foundation of King Charles the Second—the premises, 18, Fleur de Lis-court, Fetter-lane, belong to them—the prisoner was employed to do some repairs there—some lead was afterwards missing from the roof, and a lead cistern was stolen on the night of 11th December.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Plough-court, Fetter-lane—I was working under the prisoner, in December last, at 18, Fleur de Lis court—on 20th December he told me to get a chisel, and go up and take some lead off the gutter, in the parapet—I told him I could not do it, and he went and got a jemmy and a hammer, and I went and got a candle, and held it while he did it—he told me to roll it up and put it in a basket, which I did—he then told me to carry it with him—I did so, to 24, Earl-street, Seven-dials, and put it in the scale—when it was weighed he told me to leave the shop, and I did so.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Donaldson, architect and surveyor—I have been superintending some repairs at 18, Fleur de Lis-court, Fetter-lane—the prisoner was employed to do those repairs from 15th December to the 23d or 24th—I did not give him permission to take away any lead from the premises; he had no authority to take any—I have examined the roof, and seen that some has been removed from there—he was employed to repair the roof—he was to do any repairs he considered necessary, as he had said there were some broken slates—he had no authority to do anything to the lead, and he charged nothing for it—he has not put any new lead where the old was taken away.</p>

Q.</hi> Was I not to do what was requisite to make a good sound roof? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Of course—it is possible the lead may have been worm-eaten—you put tiles and cement instead of the lead—I do not find fault so much with that, as I do with your cutting off the gutters and loosening the parapet—you plastered it up in cement, but left gaps through which the water came.</p>

I know a lad named David Smith—Mr. Cocking, a baker of Woolwich, has been a customer of my father—in the latter part of last year Smith had goods of me from time to time for Mr. Cocking; he told me that he was in the service of Mr. Cocking—Mr. Cocking settled with my father for all the goods he had last year—on 4th Jan. Smith had some more goods as for Mr. Cocking, 14 lbs. of flour—I have made this memorandum from my book, which is not here—he told me that he was living with Mr. Cock<lb></lb>ing—I thought it wafi true, and supplied him with the flour—he came again next day, and had half a bushel of flour—that occurred nearly every day in Jan.—the last time was 1st Feb.—those'deliveries amounted to upwards of 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we sell baking powder—I have since been shown some packets of baking powder, which must have come from our shop.</p>

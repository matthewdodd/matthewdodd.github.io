                  </hi>. I am a retired naval officer of 2, Manor Park. Terrace, Streatham—about August last I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Tim</hi>, in consequence of which I went to 309, Regent Street—I first was referred to a man named Grant, in Devonshire Street, and he referred me to 309, Regent Street, where there was over the door "Great Northern Coal Com<lb></lb>pany "—I did not see the prisoner then, not till two days afterwards, when I told him that I had seen an advertisement requiring a secretary or collector with 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., at 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I asked the manager, Darby, who was present, if I might be allowed to look at the books, as I had not been in business before, and wanted to know what would be required of me—he said "Yes" I looked at the books and found that I could do the work quite easily, and I said to the prisoner "I will agree to take this appointment, as a guarantee of good faith I will send you a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque to-night or to-morrow morning," which I did, and it was returned by my bankers as paid—that is part of the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I charge—I sent the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. so that he should not give the appointment to anybody else—I saw him again within a week, and gave him a cheque for the 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 23rd August—an agreement was made out in August,"which Mr. Carter, of Old Jewry Chambers, has—there were two agreements—the 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque was returned through my bankers as paid—I entered on my duties, and in October I told him that I heard that the manager was going to leave, Mr. Darby, and that I could do the work, and was willing to take his place—he said that he was agreeable to my doing so—I asked him what further investment he would require—he said that 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be required</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187602280053"></xptr>
               <p>—I said "I have heard something about a company; if you turn your business into a company I will not have anything to do with it"—he said "There has been some talk of a company, but the idea is done away with."—I was going away and he said "Before you leave will you give me a note as a guarantee of good faith that you will pay in this money so that I shall not engage anybody else"—I was to have 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year as manager—before I paid him the 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I saw him again in November, and he told me I must hurry up and get the money, as he had two or three other gentlemen who were wishing to take the post—I told him that I would get the money, but I would not have anything to do with a company—he again assured me that there was no company—I saw him again a few days before I drew up my agreement—in the notes which Unintended taking to my solicitor there was a clause stating that there was to be no company, and I read the clause to the prisoner—I paid the 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 24th December—there was no conversation with the prisoner then any more than reading the agreement—I mean this agreement (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) it was drawn up and signed by both of us. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated December 24th, between Nicholas Berani and Augustus Richard Ring staling that in consideration of the sum of 1,0001. handed to Berani by Ring, Ring was to be manager of the coal business for the term of nine months, receiving interest at the rate of</hi> 8 <hi rend="italic">percent., Berani agreeing to pay the acceptance at maturity and giving Ring as security for the</hi> 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">the good will of the business empowering him to dispose of it in default of payment.</hi>) That agreement was entered into between us and I handed over these two cheques, one for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the other for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Darby was present—those two cheques were returned as paid my bankers, and in exchange for them the prisoner gave me this acceptance.

Nicholas Berani</hi>). That is in the prisoner's writing—about the 10th January they came and wrote up over the door "Sovereign and Belgian Star Coal Company, limited"—upon that I went down to the office to see if such a company was registered and it was—I went to my solicitors and told them to make inquiries, and next morning I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner and asked him how it was that that name was put over the door of my office—he said "Oh yes, there is a company, but I am going on just the same, you stay where you are, and you will get your salary regularly enough"—I said "I shall not do so, it is against my agreement, and I shall take proceedings"—I saw him again two days afterwards and asked him about the company, and he told me the same thing—I said "What did you take toy money for when you knew you must go to prison for doing so?"—he said "Well, you know I must have a little something to liquidate upon"—I said "I shall tell my solicitor to take proceedings at once," and I took these proceedings—I parted with my 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. because I saw that the busi<lb></lb>ness was such that he could pay me out at any time he chose; there was a good ready money business and very few bad debts to the best of belief—I parted with my money strictly on the understanding that the business should be kept on under the prisoner and not transferred to any company I had an opportunity of seeing and inspecting what was going on when I was manager.</p>

               <p>certainly said it, I should not say so if he did not, I am sworn to speak the truth—I had been there three months before I advanced 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I found the business a thoroughly good one as far as I had opportunities of judging—I do not know that the prisoner would not have liquidated at all if it had not been for the pressure I put upon him—I do not think he meant to pay me—it was not my pressing him which caused him to liquidate, I am not the only person who has been done in this way—I saw at the Registrar's office the name of the company and that there were 4,000 shares at 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, and I noticed the name of the secretary—I did not notice the names of the shareholders, I left my solicitor to do that—I do not know that the company has really no existence, I see it stuck up on the door still—I do not know that there are no <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> shareholders, I know nothing about it—I believe there are seven shareholders with one share each; I do not know any of their names—that is the book, here are seven shareholders in it—I do not know how many of the seven have paid—I was careful enough to take his bill—I mean seriously to tell you that I did not know that the company was a mere myth—I do not know that there are only three shareholders—my solicitor is not here, he has not told me so, I have not seen him at all—I know that the prisoner was to get 2,000 shares if the company was floated, and that 2,000 shares fully paid-up would represent 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know that he got no money from the company—I have not looked into the com<lb></lb>pany at all, but I know that it has existed; it is registered—I am a trustee under the liquidation—I have heard from the company once or twice, they gave me notice to quit about a month ago and I sent the letters to my soli<lb></lb>citor—I am disputing the right of the company on behalf of the creditors. <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have collected a <hi rend="italic">few</hi> pounds in debts', but no furniture has been sold, there is not much to sell—he puts down 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as assets, but I do not think we shall get 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the business is being carried on for the benefit of the creditors; they claim the business, I suppose—we are in pos<lb></lb>session at present, but the company will move, I believe, about 16th April, on which day they have some sort of agreement—I have never received a farthing of my 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 1 have never had any pay since I have been there.</p>

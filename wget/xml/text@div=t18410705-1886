                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Cockerell. On the 3rd of July, after twelve o'clock at night, I was going up stairs—I saw the prisoner coming down—I asked him if he wanted any thing in the shop—he said, "No"—he went down, and I heard some money fall in the shop—I ran down immediately, and met him coming out of the shop—I asked what he wanted, he said, "Nothing"—I then asked what he did there—he said he wanted a pint of beer—I looked at the till, and that was all right—I served him with the beer—I then saw the puree hanging half out of the drawer, and a half-crown, a sixpence, six shillings, and three fourpenny-pieces were on the floor—there was no one to take it but the prisoner—there was no one else in the house.</p>

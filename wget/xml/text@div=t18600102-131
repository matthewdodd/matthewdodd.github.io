Best and Sons, in Henrietta-street, Cavendish-square, and saw a van there—I cannot say whether that was the van that I had seen on the Tuesday morning, at the wharf—it was a four-wheeled van—when I went to Messrs.

Moses' place in Leadenhall-street and seen a number of casks—they were shewn to me by a gentleman in the firm; they did not shew me the casks, but I went round and round the warehouse, for there was a great number of casks, and I picked out some casks similar to those that I saw in Taylor's cart—it was a two-wheeled cart, because it made me make a remark when I met with him—I said "Hallo, George! what, have you got in your old trade again as a carman?" and he said "Yes, sir"—he then went on towards Postern—row, and I went to my place of business—I should say this was very near upon half-past 8 o'clock in the morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Moses and Son, of Leadenhall-street—on 27th October, in consequence of information, I went to Nicks in Worship-street, and took this card with me—I asked ldm why his traveller had net been respecting the bristles he had offered us previously—he said, "Well, the fact is I had a better offer for them"—I told him he had offered the bristles to us, and he must stand by his bargain—he said that he thought his traveller was going to make a mess of it, and was going to cheat him in some way to make something by him—he mentioned Richardson as his traveller—I had not mentioned any name—I only said his traveller—he said that if we would give 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent, more than we were going to give, we should have them in spite of his traveller—I was to go back to Messrs. Moses to see whether they would do so, and to hasten my coming back he would pay cab hire and give me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for myself—this was between 1 and 2 o'clock—I went back, had a conversation with Messrs. Moses, went back to Nicks, and told him we should take them, but he ought to let us have them at the same price as his traveller's friend was to have them at—he said, "We cannot, because we are under obligations to him"—he did not tell me the name of the traveller's friend—I asked Nicks for a memorandum, and he gave me this contract—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated October </hi>27<hi rend="italic">th, </hi>1859<hi rend="italic">, and signed by Nicks, stating the sale of the bristles at </hi>16<hi rend="italic">l. and </hi>22<hi rend="italic">l. net wish, and that they were to be fetched away within one hour, or the contract to be null and void</hi>)—I asked him why he wanted them away so quickly—he said that if we did not take them away, his traveller's friend would come and fetch them away, and we should not get them—I asked him for some samples which he had in his hand and which had bark round them—he said, "No, they must go with the bulk"—he offered to show me them up stairs, but I said I knew nothing about them—as I went out I saw two of his carts loading at the door, and said, "If you are in such a hurry to send them away, send your cart with them."—he said, "No, I always like parties to take them away themselves"—as I was leaving he said, "You will bring the money for them, of course?"—I said, "I cannot do that as I do not know the quantity"—he said. "Well then, you can bring a blank cheque"—I told him that Messrs. Moses would not allow me to fill up a blank cheque, but I would bring him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account—he said, "I will give you that which I promised you"—he said that it was the first transaction we had had, and he dare say it would not be the last—when I get to Messrs.

               <p>on me about noon, I think, and presented a card and a bundle of white and a bundle of grey bristles—they were tied up with bark, and I never saw any like them before—he afterwards left and took the samples with him—he returned again about 3 o'clock, or a little before, and in consequence of what he said I accompanied him to Nicks' premises in Worship-street—he went to the counting-house and brought Nicks out, and introduced him to me as having come to look at the bristles—Nicks requested me to go up stain and he would follow—I went up with Richardson to the first floor, and found a quantity of bristles arrauged in piles on the floor, tied up in bundles with bark, to the best of my recollection—a man and a girl were engaged in tying up some loose bristles in a small heap on the floor, which had broken—there were some loose barks with the bristles, but whether they tied them with bark or string I do not know—Nicks was in the room; he followed me up—either he or Richardson replied that the bristles had been packed in bags and some of them had become loose in carriage—I said, "That is a very unusual way of packing bristles, in bags"—he said that he suspected the parties who sent them to him were not accustomed to pack bristles—Nicks said that he had formerly sold bristles on his journeys; shoemakers' bristles, I think he said—they are the most expensive kind, and sometimes sell as high as 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pound—the man and the girl handled them very badly, and I said, "It fidgets me to see them handle them in that way," and took a bundle up and tied it myself to show them how to tie them up—there were about three hundredweight of each kind of bristles in the room—Nicks then went down stairs; I followed him and asked him if he could not take some<lb></lb>thing less for the grey bristles—(Richardson had mentioned the price)—he said no, and that Messrs. Moses would take them at the price he asked—I agreed to take them at 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per hundredweight for the grey, and 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the white, subject to 2 1/2 discount for cash, and an allowance of 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound for those which had been retied and which were loose in the room—he engaged to send them home either that afternoon or the next morning—I said that we closed at 5 o'clock, and he might send them before then or next day—I went there about 3 and left about a quarter of an hour afterwards—about half-past 10 next morning Richardson brought them in a cart with this invoice—(<hi rend="italic">This was made out in ilie name of T. J. Nicks, for</hi> 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.)—I gave Richardson a cheque for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and crossed it "City Bank," as I understood from Richardson that that was Nicks' bank—the bristles were tied up with string, except one bundle, which was tied with bark like this—this weighs something less than one pound—on Monday, 31st October, one of our people opened some of the bundles, and some of these labels (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were found in some of those which had been retied; they were evidently accidentally tied up with the loose bristles; here is the name of Memantoff on it—the officers first came to our place, I think, on the Tuesday—Ray came first to make enquiries—I gave the officers the bristles either on Tuesday or Wednesday, and they took them all away.</p>

I had some conversation with Nicks—I recollect his saying something about Taylor's ad<lb></lb>dress, he said he had got it somewhere, but he could not find it then—I asked him whether he had an entry of the transaction in any book or any bill, and he said, "I have a cheque in my hand I want to get cashed, and if you will let me, my young man will be in at three o'clock, if you will call again;" that was exactly what he said.</p>

I am the superintendant of the Thames Police—on 8th November the prisoner Taylor was brought to the police-station in custody—I said, "Taylor, you are apprehended for this charge in consequence of Nicks having told the officers that he bought the bristles of you"—he said "Well, I sold him the bristles, but not for myself; I sold them on commission for another person"—I said "Are you disposed to say who that person is?" he said "No; it is not likely"—I said "Very well then, you must be charged on suspicion of stealing them," and the charge was taken—this letter was handed to me at the police-station on 8th November by one of the officers—that was after Taylor was in custody—in consequence of that letter I gave some directions to Dyer—I do not know how long Taylor had been in custody when I received the letter.</p>

               <p>I open the first door of the two shilling gallery at Covent Garden, it was at half price, the prosecutor came up, there was a great company on the stairs, I saw him seize the prisoner at the paying place, he insisted on searching him, I begged him to go into a private place fit for that purpose, he searched him, but found nothing on him, the prisoner was sent to the Round-house, I carried down the cash with the accounts, and returned and sat on my seat about twenty minutes from the time the prisoner was first apprehended, and I saw something say on the landing-place of the stairs, near to where the prisoner was first seized, which was this purse; it was opened the next day, and there was a guinea in it.</p>
               <p>(The Purse deposed to.)</p>
               <p>How much money was there in the purse when you found it? - It was opened the next day at Sir Sampson Wright's, and there was a guinea in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Was there a great company? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council to Prosecutor. I suppose you bought this purse at some shop? - I bought it in the West Indies.</p>

               <p>I was going in, and there were three or four hundred people, this gentleman laid hold of me, I was taken into a room and stripped, the prosecutor was very much in liquor, and he stood over me with a drawn sword at my breast, and he behaved more like a madman than any thing else, he was blasting his eyes, and crying damn your eyes, you buggerer; take off such a thing, even my shoes, stockings, and breeches, he had taken off.</p>
               <p>Court. What are you? - I am a chamber master shoemaker, I live two doors from Baldwin's-gardens, Leather-lane.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

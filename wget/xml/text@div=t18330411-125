               <p>JOHN DAVIDSON. I let the prisoner a ready-furnished room for 3s. a week, upwards of five months ago; she had not left when I missed these things - she owed me about 4s. rent; she used to follow needle-work - I believe she is a window; her daughter, who lived with her, had fits, and on the 4th of March, my wife went into the room and missed this property.</p>

            . I keep a chandler's shop. The prisoner asked me to let her have a few things, for some duplicates, for four days, as she had some money coming from the country, and if she did not come in four days I was to do what I pleased with them; I kept them four months, and as she did not come, I took the things out- here is a bed, bolster, pillow, two sheets, and two blankets.</p>

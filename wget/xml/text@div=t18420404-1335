                  </hi>. I keep the Coach and Horses, public-house, in High-street, Shad well. On the 1st of April, the prisoner came to the front of my bar, and called for half-a-pint of beer—my wife served her—I took notice of her—she sat on a bench, and put the pint-pot by her side—she sat some time, and drank the beer, and then carried the pot out of the house under her cloak—my boy ran after her, and caught hold of her—I was close at his heels—I got hold of her as soon as he did—I took the pot from her, and took her to the station—I told her she had stolen it—she cried, and made no reply—this is my pot, and the one I took from her.</p>

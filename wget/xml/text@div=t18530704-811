                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, P</hi> 248). On 19th June, about midnight, I saw sixteen people come out of the George public house, Walham green, Fulham—most of them were tipsy—they were shouting, cursing, and swearing—I told them to go away quietly, and waited that they might do so—I was alone—another constable came up, and we both persuaded them to go away quietly—they refused, and continued shouting, swearing, and saying they did not care for the police and no one else—on that I took one of them into custody, when the others assaulted us, struck us several times, trod on our toes, and endeavoured to get their companion away—one man seized me by the throat, and drove his knuckles into my stock—that was Morris Roach—I took him into custody—the others still assaulted me, and tried to take him away—we did not take out our staves—we struck no woman there—we did not drive the people to Lord Ravensworth's gates; we were driven there by them—there was no staff drawn—I saw the defendant standing on the path—she never spoke to me—we took our prisoners to the police office—the defendant's husband was in our custody, and there was no other witness there but the defendant.</p>

               <p>yards from the George—I do not know who the first man was that we took into custody, but he is here as a witness for the other side—I know him perfectly well—he has just gone out of Court with the rest of the witnesses—the defendant was the only witness at the police court—I called no witnesses—there was no witness present, at the police court but me and the other officer—Mrs. Bowen keeps the George—she is here—the people were moving on very slowly when I arrested the other man—he was shouting and hallooing, and we had no means of preventing a disturbance without taking some of them into custody—I have been in the force eleven years—I was suspended once for a month, but was not out of the force; it is four years ago—there was a disturbance at North-end, I and the summoning officer were assaulted, and I struck a man on the head with my staff—he was in the hospital some time—he was not very nearly dying—he had a slight fracture of the skull, but I was reinstated without blame—it was not for drawing my staff without proper cause, for I had the whole of my pay back—the name of the other policeman is Holdenby—it was about 12 o'clock when the people came out of the public house—they were staggering about, but they knew what they were doing—they were able to stand—most of the women were drunk—they knew what they were about—I had my staff with me that night—I did not use it.</p>

I was with Pharo on 19th June—I did not see the people come out of the George, but I saw fourteen or sixteen men and women standing on the carriage road, using obscene language, and creating very great confusion in the street—they appeared to be drunk—we went up to them, and requested them repeatedly to go away home, and keep quiet, but they would not, and one of them was taken into custody; upon which they all turned on us with great violence, and struck me several times on the breast, and kicked me on my legs—I saw one of</p>

                  </hi>. I am second clerk at Hammersmith police court.

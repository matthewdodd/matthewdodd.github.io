                  </hi>. I live at 6, Herbert's-buildings—the deceased was my father—he was a cooper, and his name was William Hutton—on the Tuesday that this happened he was in good health—he had just done a tub—he was sitting near the fire—the prisoner came in and hulloaed out, "Mrs. Hutton"—my mother was not at home—the prisoner had lent us two lasts, and she came and asked for her lasts—I got up and gave her one, and said as soon as my mother came in I would give her the other—she then made use of bad language, and said she would not go without the other—my father said, "If you use such bad language before my children I will put you out"—she said, "You, you <hi rend="italic">muck</hi>; you nor your betters could not do it"—father came out of the shed where he worked, and when he was about half a yard away from the prisoner, she struck him on the right temple with the last—he bled very much, and fell into David Brown's arms—he told me to fetch a policeman; I went, and could not see one, and when I came back the prisoner was gone—my father sat by the fire, with his hand up to his forehead, and he was never sensible afterwards till he died.</p>

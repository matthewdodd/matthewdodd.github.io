I was in the house, and saw him come in. As they entered the tap-room door they called for a pint of beer - I followed them in immediately, and seized the prisoner's right hand. I had been observing him all the time. I found three notes in his right hand, and asked him where he got them? he said he picked them up there, pointing to the floor where he stood. I am certain he had not stooped at all - I had my eye upon him all the while; he could not have picked up any thing without my seeing him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. I was in the house first. Riddell came in, and told me they were coming. I seized the prisoner first - I did not watch Williams so much as the prisoner; my attention was fixed entirely on the prisoner. He never went near Williams.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was with Vann. I saw the prisoner join Williams at the corner of the court in Barbican. They went up the court, into the Jacob's Well, public-house - I kept my eye on him until I secured him. I was close to them, and saw Vann take the three notes from him - He could not have received them from anybody, or picked them up, from the time I first saw him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was watching there by agreement. They could not have been put into his hand. Williams was near him as he went up the court-the public-house door is on the right-hand side - I was two yards behind them; there were no other persons in the tap-room.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the King's Head, Orchard-street, Westminster. At a quarter past twelve o'clock, in the morning of the 7th of Dec, the pri<lb></lb>soner entered the bar—she waited ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I had occasion to go up stairs with some liquor—I returned in about three minutes, and she was walking out—I saw her back as I came down stairs—I had some money to put into the till—I went to the place, and the till was gone—I looked after her, but she was gone—I spoke to two policemen—she was brought back afterwards, and my till was found—it contained two shillings, a sixpence, some pence, and halfpence—no one had come in but her.</p>

I produce this till—I found it in a house in Union-court, under the stairs—from information I received from Bees, I went in search of the prisoner—I saw her come out of a court adjoining the prosecutor's house, about one o'clock—she then turned down a street next to the house, and ran—I went after her, and fetched her back—the prosecutor identified her.</p>

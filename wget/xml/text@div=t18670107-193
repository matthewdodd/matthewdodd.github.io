I am landlord of the Pauline Arms, Penge—on Saturday, the 8th December, about nine at night, I served the prisoner with half a quartern of spruce and one pennyworth of tobacco, which came to three<lb></lb>pence—he gave me a crown, I placed it in the till, gave him the change, and</p>

               <p>he left—I afterwards found it was bad—there was no other crown there—I am sure it was the same—I marked it and gave it to the constable—on the 15th December, about nine in the evening, the prisoner came again—I served him with half a quartern of spruce and one pennyworth of tobacco—I recognised his voice, and turned round and said, "The same man has called this evening"—he gave me a half-crown—I broke it in the detecter, went round the counter, and said, "Do you work here, governor?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "You paid me a visit here last Saturday night, I did not expect you again so soon"—he said, "What do you mean?"—I said, "You gave me a bad crown last Saturday, and now you are trying it on with a half-crown"—he said, "I was not here last Saturday evening"—I am positive he is the person—I sent for a constable, but could not get one, and the prisoner stepped out at another door; I went after him with Bailey, and found him some distance off lying in a hedge, and gave him in custody with the two coins.</p>

                  </hi>. I became acquainted with the prisoner, and married her on 17th May, 1849—I had been living with her as her husband for two or three months before—some time after I married her I found she had got a husband living, and when I came home from my work I had no place to go to—I spoke to her about it—we separated, and I allowed her a maintenance for three or four years, but I went home one morning and found a man in bed with her; from that time I have never allowed her anything—she has come and annoyed me, and I told her if she did not go away I would give her in charge—She said she would not go away and I gave her in custody, and that led to this prosecution—I have lost two or three situations through her drunken habits.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner is my sister-in-law—I was not present at her marriage with my brother—I know they lived together as man and wife—the last time I saw them living together was about 1838—I believe he left her with one child and near her confinement with another.</p>

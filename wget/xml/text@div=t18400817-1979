                  </hi>. I am a printer and publisher, and live in Fulwood Rents, Holborn. The prisoner was in my service, and had been for nearly six years—I printed a book for a gentleman about six years ago—I delivered him 1600 copies, and the rest remained in a cupboard in my warehouse, which the prisoner had access to—on the 8th of July my atten<lb></lb>tion was called to some paper which I saw in Mr. Arnold's shop—I made some inquiry—I then went to the cupboard where the copies had been kept, and a large quantity was missing—about eighteen reams are missing—it would cost me 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to replace it—I had never given any body authority to part with it—I sent for the prisoner, and asked if he had sold any waste-paper lately—he had sold waste-paper for me in order to clear the warehouse, but not paper of this description—when he has sold waste-paper he has accounted to me for it, but he did not account for this paper, nor for any part of it—he said he had not sold any for a year and a half—I asked where he had sold it—he said he had never sold any but to Mr. Arnold—I told him to recollect, and he said it must be more than six months—this is the paper—(<hi rend="italic">looking at some</hi>)—it is the publication I have spoken of.</p>

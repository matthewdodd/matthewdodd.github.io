I will pay you if you will put a receipt stamp on the bill;" which he did, and I paid him—he came again the same evening, and said "Are you open to buy eight more?"—I asked him how he got them—he said again "At a sale," and I paid him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the eight boxes—I had sold the others that morning for 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a box to Mr. Marks, a shirtmaker, who said that that was the market price—I sold the eight boxes for 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a box, to Messrs.

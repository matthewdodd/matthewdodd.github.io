               <p>I am the wife of the prosecutor, who is employed in selling salop in Moorfields; I went out according to my usual custom in company with my husband and daughter, who assisted me in carrying my table and salop into Moorfields, at four o'clock in the morning; at about nine my daughter returned and perceived that the box in which this money was kept was broke open, and the money gone; my bureau and the place where I kept my clothes and other effects were all opened, and the things contained in them were thrown about the floor, and there were two of my gowns wrapped up to all appearance, with an intent to carry them away; this bag lay near them, I apprehend it was meant to put these clothes and gowns into the bag and carry them away; but the person, I suppose, was disturbed, and therefore left the bag behind him. I am sure that this bag which has been produced, was the bag that belonged to the prisoner, for the prisoner had applied to me before for a bag; I had offered him one, which was worth very little; he refused to accept of it, in a short time after that I saw he had a bag, which I made particular observations upon; it had more holes in it than that I offered him, and was like a dirty-pillow case. I said so to him at the time he showed it me; I made such observation upon it, that I can swear to it. When the prisoner was taken up, the sum of one pound seventeen shillings and six-pence was found in his breeches pocket, one six-pence which was a part of that money that was in my box, at the time that this money was stole; the forty-four pounds was not made up when I removed, but put up into the box afterwards.</p>

               <p>I am the daughter of the prosecutor. I came home at nine in the morning, the prisoner's bag was found there, this is the bag: I was present when the bag was produced by the prisoner to my mother. I made the same observation upon it at the time the prisoner produced it, and said, it was not much better than that my mother had offered him; and it was like a dirty pillow case. I am sure it was the same identical bag which the prisoner before had produced, and the sixpence that was found in his pocket, I take upon me to swear is the identical sixpence that was in the box at the time we went out in the morning. I am sure it was in the box when it was broke open; another reason for suspecting the prisoner, was, he assisted in placing the box where it stood.</p>

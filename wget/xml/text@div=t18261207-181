               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you quite certain of him? A. Yes; I do not know where he lives; I heard he was a weaver. I received a wound in my head, by diving in shallow water, and when I drink, that causes my head to be affected - I had received my pension, and drank 6d. worth of gin and water, and two glasses of Port wine - I never said to Henry Schofield that I had had two glasses of gin and water, or that I was groggy; I never said so to Hart or anybody, or that I ran against three men and lost my watch, but could not tell who took it - I was speaking to Hart to-day: the prisoner's wife told me that he was at sea; his brother Henry has been to my house twice; I never received a message that the prisoner was ready to come to me at any time - his friends came to me and said that his father was in a dangerous state, and that he could not have done it; but I was confident he was the man: his friend laid some money on my table, I did not take it - I never offered not to swear to him if they gave me money.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who put money on the table? A. A man put down three sovereigns (which laid there some time) for me not to prosecute - I said I knew nothing about law - a person said it was only not to appear at Worship-street; and I got out of the way till I was forced to appear. I laid the money on the mantel-piece after some time - I know the prisoner was living at Bethnal-green on the 6th of November, three or four hundred yards from where I was robbed, and about two hundred yards from me - I do not know where he lived before - I complained of somebody throwing dirt at my windows, but not that it was him - I heard he was often passing my house.</p>

            . I have known the prosecutor for five years, and drank with him; sometimes he is very quarrel - some after drinking; he told me he was rather groggy when he lost his watch, and did not know who did it; this was fifteen or sixteen months ago.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he say he did not or should not know him? A. He said he could not swear to the parties.</p>

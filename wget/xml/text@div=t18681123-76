I am a wholesale provision merchant, in Half Moon Street, Bishopsgate—the firm was formerly Smith &amp; Valley—I knew the bankrupt, Henry Spackman, about twelve months before his bankruptcy, not quite from the beginning of his trading in Union Street—I think he had been in business some little time—I was a creditor of his at the time of his bankruptcy to the amount of 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I was one of the trade assignees—in October he owed me 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was nearly cleared off, less about 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he did not pay me—other goods were supplied, and at his bank<lb></lb>ruptcy he owed me 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went to him on Monday, November 5—I believe the adjudication was on the 16th—I saw him twice the week previous, and once that week—I saw the stock in his shop on these occasions—I should say it was worth from 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a good bit over 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., certainly—it consisted of a quantity of American cheese, which I valued in my own mind at about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, twenty-five firkins of butter, which would cost 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and hams, bacon, and other things that I had supplied him with—nearly the whole of the 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was contracted in October, and early in November—after the bankruptcy the name of Ball was up—I know the prisoner—I never saw him when I passed by the shop—I saw him once or twice when Spackman was in full business.</p>

               <p>cheeses, sometimes butters; there might be two, fire, or ten cheeses some<lb></lb>times—I saw that done of a morning—Spackman had a stable at that time in Norfolk Street, at the back of the shop—by his directions, I removed property to that stable in sacks of chaff—he ordered a sack of chaff, and cheese and butter was placed in the middle of it—it was then filled up with chaff, and I was told to take them to the stable, as he wanted to get them away without his neighbours seeing it—that happened with cheeses a great many times—I can't exactly say how many; more than half a dozen—it might have been twenty or thirty, and butter about the same, or, perhaps, not so many—I don't think there was anything else—he used to take them away again from the stable—I have seen Ball at the place—he used to come and help us at times, to help serve on Saturdays—he is brother-in-law to Spackman—I had seen him in the shop before the removal of the things—I remember taking two cheeses to Mr. Beard, and I took some to Mrs. Ramsay, or Rose, in Bird Street, West Square—I think it was a cask of butter and one cheese that I took there—I took two cheeses to Mr. Allatt's, the Montpelier Tavern, and a cheese and a cask of butter to Mrs. Franklin, and one cheese to Mrs. Twiss—I took two cheeses to my own place—I believe Ball was living in Trinity Church Terrace, about ten minutes' walk from the shop—I know a person of the name of Fielder, in Trinity Street—I brought one cheese away from there, which Mr. Spackman had left; that was on the morning of the 16th November, the morning of the bankruptcy—I met Spackman in St. George's Road, in another cart, and I gave the cheese to him—I can't say whether I saw Ball on that occasion—I believe I did, but I can't say whether it was him or his brother—on that same day, the 16th, I took the two cheeses from my own house—I met Spackman, and I gave them up to him in St George's Road—I believe somebody was with him, but I can't say who it was—it was either Ball or his brother—it was at the same time that I gave him the other things—I remem<lb></lb>ber two cases of eggs coming in about three days before the bankruptcy—they were removed before I went in the morning—I saw them there before I left overnight, and when I went next morning they were gone—I believe I saw one of these cases afterwards in the shop, after the bankruptcy—I saw some of them brought back—some were brought back by Spackman, and some by Ball, the prisoner—I can't say exactly how many cheeses were brought back after the bankruptcy—I did not count them—two or three lots were brought back—at one time eight or ten casks of butter were brought back—at another time two casks, and about ten cheeses at another time—I never took much notice of the time—they were cut up and sold in the shop—I was receiving wages as assistant to Spackman—I continued to receive my wages from him after the bankruptcy—he remained in the shop, attending to the business—there was no difference after the bankruptcy to what there was before—the name was altered to Ball instead of Spackman after the bankruptcy, about the beginning of December, I think—I think it was altered to "William Ball," if I am not mistaken—I saw the prisoner at the shop, at times—he did not give me any directions after his name was up—I received my orders from Mr. Spackman—he and his wife continued to occupy the house just the same as they did before—he did not sleep in the house after the bankruptcy, that I am aware of.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 77, Red Cross Street, Borough—I keep a horse and van—in November, 1867, I met Spackman in Horsemonger Lane—he asked if I was going home—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Would you take these two or three cheeses to my shop"—he fetched them from a private house, No. 4, Church Street, at least, Trinity Square, I think it was; I have been taken to the house since with the prisoner; it was the same house—I don't know that it was Ball's house; I pointed out the house to the constable, Fensor—I took the things from that house to Spackman's shop—there were three cheeses, half a tub of butter, and, I think, a ham wrapped up in a cloth—I can't say within a day when it was, it was from the 14th to 15th November, I am certain it was in November—I cannot say, for certain, whether it was before or after the 16th.</p>

On the 25th of August, about twelve o'clock at night, I met the prisoner Hopkins, and went to <placeName id="t18180909-280-crimeloc1551">Lascelle's-court, St. Giles's</placeName>

As soon as I got into the room she put her hand into my pocket, took my money<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181809090091"></xptr>out, and ran off with it. The prisoner Haswell and three others were in the room at the time. There was no light, and I was afraid to make any noise. As soon as it was daylight he took me down stairs, and told me to go away. I asked him for my rule, he went up stairs, returned, and said it was not there. I saw it in his bosom, and went for a watchman; he followed, and gave it to me. I gave him in charge. I found Hopkins under the bed, and gave her in charge also. I was not with her a moment.</p>
               <p>COURT. You told the magistrate you were with her half an hour - A. I was not.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PRICE. I am a watchman. The prosecutor fetched me, and gave the prisoners in charge. I found the rale on Haswell. I found no money on either of them.</p>
               <p>HOPKINS'S Defence. He was intoxicated, and gave me nothing.</p>

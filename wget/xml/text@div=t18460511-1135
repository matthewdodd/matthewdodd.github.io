                  </hi>. I am a lighterman; I live at Wapping, and am employed on the Thames; the prisoner was my apprentice for nearly five years. On the 31st of March he was to take my barge, the <hi rend="italic">Jane</hi>, alongside the barge <hi rend="italic">Albion</hi>, to work sixty-one quarters and five bushels of peas—about the middle of the day I went on board the <hi rend="italic">Jlbion</hi>, and was there nearly an hour—there was a meter measuring the peas, and I waited till he had done—I then desired the prisoner to take the <hi rend="italic">Jane</hi> to St. Andrew-wharf, and to ship the peas on board the first Glasgow trader—he afterwards produced to me a meter's bill, and told me he had taken the barge to the <hi rend="italic">Dunchatton</hi>, and they would take the peas on board the next morning—the next day he told me the peas had been taken on board—I went to the wharf, and got the receipt from the wharfinger for 123 sacks and a cotchell—the prisoner told me in the evening that he had been to the vessel, and put the cotchell into three other sacks, which he had distinguished by putting a cross upon them: and he said the sacks were all taken from the <hi rend="italic">Jane</hi> on board the ship—I said he should not have done so, for I had taken a receipt for the full quantity—he said his object in doing so was to reserve the sack in which the cotchell was—on the 20th of April I received a letter from Glasgow: in consequence of that I asked the prisoner what he had done with the cotchell of peas—he stated he had put it into three sacks, and marked the sacks—the <hi rend="italic">Dunchatton</hi> went on its voyage, and it returned to London about last Tuesday week—I then received some information from the mate, and I spoke to the prisoner again about the cot-chell—he said he knew nothing more of the peas than he had told me before—I asked what sack it was he had brought from the vessel across the wharf—he said it contained the sweepings of some oats that he had gathered up in the barge—I said I did not believe his statement, and gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an umbrella-manufacturer, at No. 64, Burlington-arcade. On the 17th of Sept. the prisoner, who was a stranger, came and asked to look at some canes and whips, which I showed him—he said he had not time to stop, I must bring them to his apartments, No. 13, Hans-place, Chelsea—I took them, and waited about two hours; I was then taken up stairs, and saw the prisoner—he said he had not time to look at them then, but asked me to leave them till the next morning for his in<lb></lb>spection—I left two canes, two whips, and an umbrella—I went the next morning, and the prisoner and the goods were gone.</p>

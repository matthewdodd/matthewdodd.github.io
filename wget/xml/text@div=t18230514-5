I had left them in the shop, and bolted the door, but it could be unbolted outside. I did not wish to hurt him, and let him go, as he said he was distressed - the people said they hoped I should be robbed again, so I secured him again.</p>

            . I am a butcher. I knew the prisoner by sight before. On the 25th of April, between two and three o'clock, I saw him passing my father's door with a basket of tools in his hand - a mob followed him; he dropped the tools, and ran away. I saw Matson take him afterwards, and am certain he is the man. The basket appeared to be the same as I saw him with.</p>

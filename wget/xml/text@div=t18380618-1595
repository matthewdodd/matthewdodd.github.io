                  </hi>. I live at No. 1, Fleur-de-lis-court, Gray's-inn-lane. I knew the deceased William Norris—he was about twenty-five years of age, and appeared a healthy man—between ten and eleven o'clock on Satnrday night, the 9th of January, I was at the Two Blue Posts, Gray's-inn-lane—Norris and Cunningham were waiting there for me—we had one pot of half-and-half, and a quartern of gin-and-peppermint between Cun<lb></lb>ningham and I, and the deceased, my wife, and sister—the prisoners were in the tap-room—the deceased went into the tap room to light his pipe while we stood at the bar—there was a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> occurred between the deceased and the prisoner—I did not see it begin—I saw Norris standing with his back leaning against the wall when I opened the tap-room door, with his nose bleeding—there were seven or eight of them stood before him—I ran in and jumped on the seat, ran over the table and got by the side of him—he said, was there nobody there to take his part—I said I would take his part as far as I could—some fell about me and some fell on him, and we were Pushed out of the tap-room door—I do not know that Linford shoved me out but they were all shoving—I do not know Soulter—I did not see any thing</p>

               <p>more occur to the deceased after that—Linford struck Norn's, and I struck Linford—I did not see Linford strike Norris—he struck him before I came in—nobody saw him struck—Cunningham carried Norris out of the room.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 7, Gray's-inn-square. I saw the prisoner Linford and the deceased fighting—a few blows were struck, and Linford left off, went out of the tap-room, and stood in front of the bar—his hat and coat were on the seat—I took them out to him, and was helping his to put them on, when Garnham came out of the tap-room, struck him, and knocked him down—Soulter was at the bar lighting his pipe at the time and he struck Soulter also—Soulter then struck him—the deceased came out of the tap-room, and, seeing his friend Garnham fighting with Soulter, he fought Soulter also—another man came out of the tap-room, and seeing two on Soulter, he fought with one of them, and both fell down against the door, (Garnham and a man that is not here)—they were parted and push<lb></lb>ed out—the deceased first appeared ill about twelve o'clock—I did not see him ill at all—the last I saw of him was when he was fighting in the souffle.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 5, North-place, Gray's-inn-lane, and as a member of the Royal College of Surgeons. About half-past two o'clock in the morning of the 10th, I was called in to the deceased—I examined his body, but found no visible external marks to prove he died from any injury—I had an order from the Coroner to make a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examina<lb></lb>tion, and, on the 12th, I removed the skull-cap—I found no fissure—I found two fractures at the back part of the brain, and an extended state of the vessels, but the ruptures of the brain might arise from excessive drink—no doubt, the man died from the injury, from the internal hemorrhage which arose from concussion, from fall, probably—I cannot tell whether he was struck, I was not present to see.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 14, Coleman Street, St. Luke's—the prisoner is my son—on Tuesday morning, 24th April, I was standing at the gate outside Field &amp; Hanbury's Brewery, and saw the deceased, Henry Tait, come towards the gate—the prisoner said to me "Father, here comes the man who insulted me last night, I will go and see what he has to say for himself this morning"—he then said to Tait "How is your temper this morning?"—Tait said "The same as it was last night"—they began to pull off their clothes and threw them down in the road, and then went into the middle of the road and stood up to fight—I saw no blow but they struggled together, Tait's heels caught the kerb and they fell together, my son on the top of Tait—I then went down the yard, and was gone about five minutes, and when I came back my son had his waistcoat on and was tying Tait's scarf on, who was standing against the wall—Tait came up and said "We are friendly, are not we?"—my son said "Yes," and they walked down the yard—Tait had a little blood behind his left ear—just two little streaks, it scarcely ran—I believe he then cleaned two horses, but I did not see him.</p>

                  </hi>.—I am in the employ of the Cannon Brewery Company and knew the prisoner and Tait—on 23rd April I was in the Crown tap—house, St. John Street, Clerkenwell, when there was a bit of a quarrel between them—there seemed to be a little bit of jealousy between them about the work, as to who came first of a morning—Tait was the worse for liquor, but the prisoner was sober—Tait wanted to fight—I parted them; and kept Neale back for five minutes afterwards—on the 24th I was in Aylesbury Street at 4.45—Neale and his father stood at the brewery gate—the prisoner had his coat under his arm and his father had a switch in his hand—Tait was coming the reverse way with his coat under his arm, and was blowing his nose with a red handkerchief—Neale said to me "Harry"—I said "Halloo"—he said "Do you see that man coming?"—I said "Yes"—he said "I am going to knock Kim," and threw his coat down on the kerb—Tait was then 25 or 30 yards off—I did not stop till he came up, I went into the yard—the prisoner's father said "Stop a minute, Harry"—I said 'Not me, I have got two horses to look after," and I went away—the prisoner, half an hour or an hour afterwards, told me <hi rend="italic">as how</hi> they had hold of one another—he said "We fell, and my head was underneath his chin, and when we fell the back of his head caught the kerb—I saw Tait, he seemed all right—I said "There are two horses for you to go and clean," and he cleaned two horses.</p>

               <p>Tait was lying on the pavement with his feet about a foot from the kerb and his head towards the shops—his head did not come against the kerb—I went to the prisoner and said "What is the matter?"—he said "Me and him had a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> last night, and it caused me to get drunk, or else it was to come off last night, so we was to meet this morning"—the prisoner put his arm under the deceased and sat him against the shops—he did not take him up, he only drew him along the ground and put him in a sitting position, and as soon as the prisoner loosed him he fell over on his left side, apparently through weakness—the prisoner then put his own clothes on and tied his apron round him and then lifted Tait up, who went a little way by the shutters of the shops and he held him up—he could not stand alone without being against the shutters, and as soon as he put him against the shutters Tait said "Where is my <hi rend="italic">Missis?</hi>"—the prisoner said "I'll <hi rend="italic">missis</hi> you"—I saw some blood on Tait's hair and on his left shoulder, but not by his ear.</p>

I am the widow of the deceased, he was an odd man at the Cannon Brewery—on 23rd April, the prisoner followed us up Sutton Street—and my husband said "I think some of you must sit up all night for it"—I suppose he meant for the job—the prisoner said "No we don't sit up all night, but if you are there at 4, I will be there at 3, and if you are there at 3,1 will be there at two"—Gibson a drayman called for a pint of ale and handed it to the prisoner and said "Here, drink and have no more bother"—the prisoner offered it to my husband who put out his hand to take the glass of ale but drew it back and said "No, I will see you b——d first"—I stood between the two with my back to the prisoner, and my husband shoved me against the prisoner which upset part of the ale on the prisoner who said "There, there is a b——for you, he has shoved the old woman against me and upset the ale," and he tried to throw the rest of the ale in my husband's face, but it went on a gentleman standing against the partition—he said to the gentleman "I beg your pardon it was not intended for you" and called for another pint of ale—my son came in and got his father away—my husband left home next morning at 4.30 or 4.35 quite well—he had eaten a hearty supper before he went to bed—I saw him insensible at St. Bathelomew's Hospital at 7.30; he did not know me—the prisoner was quite sober on the Monday evening, but my husband was very drunk.</p>

I told him I would see him to—morrow morning; the landlord came round to eject him from the house, and next morning I was in St. John Street, at the Cannon Brewery, standing against the gateway, and saw Tait coming up the street;. I met him and asked him how his temper was this morning, we both took off our clothes and then closed together, and both fell on the pavement; Tait underneath, and me on the top—I afterwards picked him up and dressed him, and he went down the stable yard—sometime after that I went into the stable and saw Tait lying in an empty stall, a cab was sent for and I assisted in taking him to the hospital"</p>

On the morning of 28th November last, about half-past 1 o'clock, I was on duty in High-street, Whitechapel—I saw the prisoner at the corner of the street In company with three other persons—I watched them—they had with them this empty basket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I placed myself in a doorway—whilst there I saw the prisoner in company with another one, the other carrying this basket with a small quantity of straw in it, go up to No. 1, Commercial-street, Whitechapel, or 110, High-street—they went up to the shutters, and they pulled a bar out with their two hands, and the prisoner held it while the other got the shutter down and pushed the shutter back on one side—I then saw them pull out something which appeared to me to be white—I did not hear the window break—I saw these drapery goods pulled out and placed in the basket by the prisoner—I then rushed out from where I was and apprehended the prisoner—he ran away for about twenty yards before I caugnt him—on the way to the, station he said, "For God's sake let me go, for I only had 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to come and look out lor the others"—I afterwards examined the shop window, and found it broken, and called up the prosecutor.</p>

            . I am the wife of the prosecutor. The prisoner came about half-past three o'clock on the 26th of November, and said he came from my husband, who wanted his black coat and umbrella, as he was going to the Archbishop of Canterbury's with three men, whose names he mentioned; I rather doubted it, but as I knew they were in the habit of going to the Archbishop's, I delivered them to him. I did not know him but he appeared to know me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. How long was he in your company? A. About five minutes. I can swear positively to his person.</p>

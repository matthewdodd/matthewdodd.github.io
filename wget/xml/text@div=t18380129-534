                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer, and live at No. 2, Prince's-street, Whitechapel. On Wednesday evening, the 10th of January, about seven o'clock, I and my wife were sitting by the fire—I heard a noise at the next house, which, is No. 3, and is empty—I went into the house, and called "Halloo"—a man on the stairs answered me—the pri<lb></lb>mer is the man—I said, "You have no business here"—" Stop a minute," said he; and he ran off—I pursued and took him, without losing sight of Mm, and I gave him in charge—I then went into the house, and found one sash had been removed, and set by the side of the door, and the lines of the others had been cut—he had got into the house by the street door—he has a wife and three children, and two he has just buried with the small-pox.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. He stated that he went through several streets after me, and I was standing at my own door at seven o'clock. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I have not the slightest doubt he is the man that was in the house.</p>

               <p>the man running in front when I first saw them—they had run about 400 or 500 yards from the house—I took him back to the house, and there found the window-sash of the front parlour cut out, and set a little on one side of the window—several other sashes had the cords cut, but were not removed—I then took him to the station, and came back to the house, but found nothing more—I went to his lodgings, No. 19, Princess-street—there was scarcely any thing in them—I found some skeleton-keys then—I do not know how he got into the house—there was no violence used.</p>

The houses, Nos. 1, 2, and 3, Prince's-street, belong to me—I let this house to a tenant last Michaelmas—he went away, and took the key with him—I then went to King, and told him to give a look out if he heard any one about the house—when I went to the how I found one sash removed, and the lines of the others cut.</p>

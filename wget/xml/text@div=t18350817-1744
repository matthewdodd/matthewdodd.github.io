                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Uxbridge. I was at Hayes, on Wednesday evening, the 3rd of July—I had been mowing for Mr. Norton—we came up to cut some grass for him at Hayes—we could get no lodging at the public-house, and went to lie down in Mr. Batt's barn—I went to sleep; and after that, the prisoner came and awoke me—he fell upon me—he was thumping me, when I awoke—there were of my partners in the barn when I went to sleep—I had seen nothing of the prisoner before this happened—when I awoke he was astride of me—I laid on my back—he stood across me, and swore he would kill the first b----r he could get at—after I got up, I cast him down, turing him</p>

               <p>underneath—I got him down on his side, and he called out for help to his partner; and his wife and partner came—I never saw any of them before—they all three fell upon me—two of my partners got out of the barn as soon as they could; the other could not get out so soon as he wished, and he received a cut across his hand—he swore he would cut my b----head off; and he cought upu the scythe, and struck at me; and I fell towards him—the scythe caught at the side of the barn, and it borke right in two—it was John Newman's scythe—it was lying at one end of the barn—there were four together, lying down at the end of the barn—they were what we had been working with—the prisoner had no scythe of his own, that I know of—he picked up the piece of the scythe, which broke off, and cut me in the arm—he broke both the blade and handle—he struck at me with the handle, after he broke the blade, and hit it about the side of the barn, and broke it in two—I cannot say what was the cause of all this; whether it was because we laid down in the place where they were, or what, I do not know; but we never interruupted them, nor saw them—he was not in the barn when we first went in—I do not know what complaint he made; but when he awoke me, he was knocking me about, and straddled over me—he did not attempt to take any thing from me, but he meant murder—he swore he would take my life—I was sober—I do not know whether he wa—he cut me just by the elbow—it was not a very big cut—it was the point of the scythe drove in—it bled uncom<lb></lb>monly—it nearly bled me to death—I got out of the place as soon as I could—he said nothing more to me—we had a scuffle—I scuffled to get away—we had a scuffle before he struck me with the scythe—when he first came to me, and I got him on his side; he got me on my back; I was throwing him over on his side—he ealled for help, and then his wife and the other man, all three of them, came upon me—that was all before he got the scythe—I tried to get away, as well as I could—I did not strike him; but when I was down, I tried to knock him off me—there was no reason given for all this—I never saw him or the woman before—I dare say I struck him, in endeavouring to get him—I cannot say how it was—I dare say I gave him a <hi rend="italic">pop</hi>, somewhere or other—my partners did not come to help me till he got the fork, and swore he would kill the first b—he could get at—he found Batchelor, and then he hit at him with the scythe; and then Batchelor knocked him down—that was after I was cut—he swore he would run the first b----through—I cannot say what was the cause of his saying so—he broke one scythe to pieces then.</p>

               <p>This person, the prisoner, brought a quantity of handkerchiefs to my house to wash them out, the 2d of August, which I suspected, from the marks, to be Madam Picault's, having the initials of her name on them in red ink; she was charewoman to my house; there was a cap, which struck me more than the rest, that I had made for the lady, and I took it to the lady, to enquire if she had given it her; and she said, she had not, she had stole it; and so the prisoner sent for a warrant to take me up, because I would not deliver them to her; which was the means of her being brought to justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you live near Mrs.Picault's? - I live at No. 30, Broad-street, Carnaby-market; I work for Mrs. Picault.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. Did the prisoner work at your house? - She was called in to attend my husband; he was very ill.</p>

               <p>The prisoner brought the handkerchiefs to me to mark M.

These stockings I sold to Mrs. Dewman, the 30th of June, and I had them of a valet, who lived in St. James's-square, for money that he owed me, when he went abroad with an officer to Valenciennes; the gown and part of the handkerchiefs I bought of some lady's valet or page, and never altered the gown till the time I took my money of Mrs. Picault.

               <p>Prisoner. I have sent to none of my friends, because that I knew I was innocent. When I nursed her husband, she gave me a guinea, and made me a present of four handkerchiefs, two whole and two darned; she sent me out for the nankeen to make the stays, and I brought the person for her to pay the money to, and she made me a present of the petticoat and shirt.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I never gave her any of the things; she told me she had things in pawn; but the stockings are marked with my name and the handkerchiefs.</p>

            , the prisoner confessed to me that they were all our property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. Was that confession reduced into writing? - I fancy it was.</p>
               <p>Then you must not talk about it? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do not you believe about it? - I believe nothing at all about it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Your Lordship I humbly submit will not hear any thing about that confession.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Can you or can you not say from your own knowledge, whether it was taken down? - I cannot say, it possibly might.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was there any examination of the prisoner reduced into writing? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>You have no belief about it perhaps? - That I have no reason to tell.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, this was a subject discussed very much at length the last sessions, and I understood the Court expected it in all cases.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. The examinations of prosecutors, but not the confessions of the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The act of Philip and Mary understands it should.</p>
               <p>Court. No, not confessions.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I do not know whether I state correctly what was the direction of the Court last sessions, it was very much discussed here, whether any thing said before a Justice of Peace could be received in evidence that was not reduced into writing; and I understood the Court to say, for the information of Justices, that it was the duty of a Justice to reduce every thing into writing, for that the neglect of the magistrate should not operate against the prisoner at the bar, who may have said something, which, if reduced into writing, might appear in a different light, but which the witness keeps back, or part of it, and therefore monstrous mischief to prisoners might happen if part is to be kept back, and a witness who is unwilling to disclose the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070090"></xptr> whole truth should come and give an oral evidence in part.</p>
               <p>Court. The Justices have no right to ask a prisoner to confess, but if the prisoner does confess, it should be taken down no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Here is no confession returned.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was Mr. Harvey by at this time? - He was.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that there have been some promises made to this young man if he would make confessions? - Not that I know of, I did not, and I did not hear Mr. Harvey; he is not here, I never heard from Mr. Harvey that he made any promise; I do not know or believe that he did. Here is a pair of stockings that I can swear to, there were so many in the paper of the same sort, and one pair is gone, which I am sure and positive are my own property, they were bought of a person that buys his goods at a public sale, and I bought what he had of him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I ask you whether these stockings might not be matched? - I do not suppose they might.</p>
               <p>Do you believe upon your oath that they could not? - I never saw any more of the same, I will swear upon my oath they are my property.</p>
               <p>I shall repeat my question till I get an answer; upon your oath do you believe there is a possibility they might be matched? - They possibly might, I do not know that they might, I never saw any like them I will not swear that there are none of the same sort, but the person I bought them of had no more.</p>
               <p>He may have had some scores of the same kind of stockings? - I am very sure he has not had any of the kind.</p>
               <p>Give a reason for your certainty, as that will go to your credit? - He very possibly might.</p>
               <p>Then very possibly the prisoner might have purchased some? - It is rather unlikely; this is my own writing on the outside handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Is there the same sort of writing on other outside handkerchiefs like that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you have sold some like that? - I never sold a handkerchief off that piece.</p>
               <p>But off other pieces of the same pattern have not you sold? - No, I never sold one of them.</p>
               <p>But your people have? - I do not know that they ever sold one.</p>
               <p>That is a shuffle, that will not serve you? - Yes it will, I do not know that they have.</p>
               <p>How many were there at first? - There was only twelve of them in the first place, and I believe I have nine, and this makes the tenth.</p>
               <p>Who sold the other two? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Then there are two that are otherwise disposed of than you know of? - They might, my servants never sold these to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>That you do not know? - Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>For God's sake, Sir, have a little regard to your oath and character? - I do, I have as much regard to my oath and character as you have.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you put private marks on every handkerchief? - On every outside handkerchief, this is the outside handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Was there any mark on any other? - No.</p>
               <p>Will you venture to swear that that handkerchief was not sold by any of the other servants of the house, or by the prisoner? - I will not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The prisoner was entrusted to sell handkerchiefs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Will you venture to swear this, that he never sold this handkerchief and put the price of it into the till? - I think it is very unlikely, it is not possible I think.</p>
               <p>You mean to swear, that a man entrusted to sell handkerchiefs to himself or any body else could not have done so? - It is not possible for a man to sell goods to himself.</p>
               <p>No! - He does not do it without giving some knowledge of it to some person in the shop, it is not right.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070091"></xptr>Court. It is very odd that he should.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. But it is no theft, it may perhaps be an impeachment of the prudence of the prisoner, but not of his honesty; you cannot swear, however, that the price of this handkerchief has not been paid, into your till? - I will swear it was not paid to me, and I will bring my partner and my servants to swear that it was not paid to them.</p>
               <p>Whose hand writing is that? - That is my partner's.</p>
               <p>What is it? - It is one of my shop bills, it is a bill of parcels.</p>
               <p>For what? - For the goods that are mentioned in it; two yards and one-eighth of Florentine, and five weeks wages at twenty pounds a year.</p>
               <p>Then he has purchased that? - Yes, it was booked, and allowed in his wages.</p>
               <p>Do you know of his buying any stockings of you? - I believe he had a pair or two of my partner; I am sure he had not this handkerchief of my partner.</p>
               <p>Explain the cause of your certainty? - My partner told me so.</p>
               <p>That is all you know it by? - Yes.</p>
               <p>

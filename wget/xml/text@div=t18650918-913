                  </hi>. I am the wife of Mr. William Weall, of Wood-cote-villas, Loughborough park, Brixton—on the morning of 10th August, I was awoke by a noise—I first of all went up-stairs, thinking it was a child ill—I then heard the noise again, and went down-stairs—when I got to the dining-room I saw a man kneeling at the sideboard, surrounded by the contents of it—thinking that others were there, I immediately ran up-stairs, and called, out "Thieves!" and a policeman came—the prisoner got through the kitchen window on the other side of the house—the constable sprang his rattle, and I saw him stop the prisoner—I have been shown a cigar-case, a handkerchief, a rule, and some stockings—those articles are the property of my husband—they were in different parts of the dining-room the night before—I also lost three keys, which the prisoner afterwards gave to the constable—Mr. Weall picked up the key of the plate-chest—the desks and workboxes in the dining-room were all tossed! about—the sideboard has been tried in six places, and the panel was broken—all the kitchen drawers were ransacked, and a cupboard broken open in the children's schoolroom.</p>

               <p>attention was drawn to Woodcote-villas, Loughborough-park—I saw that the kitchen window-blind was cut away from the frame—I saw a man come eat at that window into the yard in front of that house—I stopped him—it was the prisoner—he drew this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from his breast—I told him to drop it, and he threw it to me—I took him to the station—he had get about ten yards from the window when I seized hold of him—on the way to the station he offered three keys to Mr. Weall, saying they were no use to him—I have not got them now—these are the things Mrs. Weall identified, and which I got from the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-inspector, p.</hi>) I went and examined the premises of Mr. Weall after the prisoner was taken—I found that the kitchen-window had been forced, a blind torn, a rent made in the wire-blind, and the hinges of the shutters forced—there were footmarks on the green in front of the kitchen window outside, and I found footmarks inside corresponding with them—I found several wax matches in the house, and the last witness found some on the prisoner which corresponded with the others—the dining-room was very much in confusion—the prisoner said at the station that he had only been a short time in this country, that he had lost all his money, and he meant to "do a turn," but it had been unlucky—there were only foot-marks of one person.</p>

This handkerchief, which was found on the prisoner, I left on the dining-room sofa the night before the robbery—I picked up the key of my plate-chest just outside the kitchen window—I have it here—the night before it was hanging up in the sideboard, which was broken open—the prisoner was in the custody of Sims when I first saw him—I went to the station with him—on the way there the prisoner said the keys were of no service to him, perhaps they would be of service to me—I said, "We will see about that at the station."</p>

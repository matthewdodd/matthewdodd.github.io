In a hurry, betwixt 9 and 10 o'clock on Sunday night, I accidentally left my key in the lock where this money was, there it remained all night; on the Monday morning, betwixt eight and nine, I went to my desk, the first thing I saw was the key in the drawer; I immediately drew it out, and saw my two bags were gone.</p>

            , the landress, for I at once suspected the prisoner, who was her servant. She said she gave the girl the key of the door, and she went and lighted a fire for the other gentlemen. Looking upon. my desk, I found the key of my chamber door lying there. The prisoner was taken the same day at Shadwell. I went there: the first thing I asked her was, about what time she took this money. She said, she took it out after she had lighted the fire; that she went in in an unlucky hour; seeing the key there, she open'd it, and was tempted, seeing a yellow bag, to see what was in it; and seeing a large parcel of gold, she took it away. She made this confession in presence of several gentlemen, and never denied it. The yellow bag was produced in court, with the letters

            . I live in Shacksby's Walk, Shadwell. The prisoner at the bar came to my house the 18th of February, about a quarter after 11 o'clock. I had little or no knowledge of her, but she knew my daughter. She staid till seven o'clock. I found she had shew'd this money to my wife. My wife told me of it. I said to her, my dear, you have got money about you, tell it, that it may prevent any mistake, &amp;c. She took it out, but could not tell it. She drop'd one guinea, and I made her take it up. I saw there were 68 guineas, besides half guineas and Portugal money. (There is now a memorandum in the bag that was made before the justice, it being told over upon his worship's table.) I think in all there is 110 l. 12 s. 6 d. The money was in a dirty linen bag. I never saw the yellow bag in my house, but I saw it afterwards. She told me she receiv'd it for prize-money belonging to her husband. I ask'd her what man of war her husband belong'd to. She could not tell: nor could she tell whether she received the money in Broad-street, or at a banker's. Then she said, she had sold her conosity for 500 l. and such like talk. I sent for a constable and took her up. and took her before justice Bury. The bag was produced in court with the money and memorandum in it, sealed with the justice's seal.</p>

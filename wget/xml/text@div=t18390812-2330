                  </hi>. I am a porter, and live in Rose and Crown-court, Bishopsgate. At half-past seven o'clock on the evening of the 23rd, I saw Mr. Cobley's wagon in the Commercial-road—it went on till it got just past the end of Gloucester-street, and stopped about one door past the street—the prisoner was standing against the hones or the wagon—a man got up into the wagon, and put out a bag, which appeared, by the description on the bag, to be East India sugar; and another man, who is at large at present, took the bag on his backhand carried it into Mr. Mew's, a confectioner's shop—the prisoner was at the time by the side of the hones or the wagon—I did not notice whether the man who carried the sugar came back to him.</p>

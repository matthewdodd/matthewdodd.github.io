In the morning he was taken before Justice Kynaston in the Strand; as I was going to take the oath, he made a spring away down the street, he ran very well; he was pursued, and taken coming up towards Covent garden; he was brought back to the Justice's; the Justice said, now you have done for yourself, this is a confirmation of your guilt. The prisoner said, as soon as I get my liberty I'll be revenged of you all, and particularly the constable.</p>

I said to Sir James, they have both sticks or canes in their hands, you had better go up and look at them; he did not much care to go: then I went; the prisoner stood with his hand over the head of his cane; I said, Sir, be so kind as to let me look at that cane: no, said he, I will not; I said, I insist upon looking at it: he made some resistance; I took it out of his hand; it was Sir James's cane, it had his crest upon it.</p>

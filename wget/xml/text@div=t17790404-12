In a short time the prisoner came down, and went into the snuff-room, took some paper, laid it on a stand, and dipped his hand two or three times in a stand of snuff, took out about half a pound, twisted it up, and put it in his pocket. He then went into the warehouse, where the tobacco is; I could not see him in that warehouse, but heard him take the lid of a stand up. My apprentice was concealed in another part of the warehouse, and saw him take tobacco. I had watched him, and seen him take snuff three sundays before this. I did not take him up, because I understood that his sister came of a Sunday morning to receive parcels from him. On the Saturday following I desired one Badcock to get a constable ready against the next morning; and if she came, to take her; if not, to take him. I concealed myself again. On Sunday the 28th, the prisoner came again into the snuff-room, and took three pounds and a half of rappee snuff. He then went out; the constable took him, and found the snuff concealed in a pair of breeches under his coat. The constable and I searched his box; there were several suits of clothes and tobacco in almost all the pockets, and a letter directed to his sister, desiring her to come to him the next morning at seven o'clock. When the constable stopped him, he said he was going to take it to a customer of mine, one Mrs. Baker at Charing-Cross.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. On Saturday night, the 27th of February, I had an information that the prisoner was mistrusted of stealing things out of his master's house; on the 28th in the morning I apprehended him as he came out, and found almost four pounds of rappee snuff upon him; he asked what I wanted with him. I said he must go back to his master; he had a pair of breeches. I asked him what he had there; he said a pair of breeches he was carrying to mend; the snuff was tied up in the breeches. Before the alderman he said he was going to carry it to a person, who desired him to bring him some real rappee snuff, because they were used to adulterate it.</p>
               <p>Did you understand that he meant he was going to carry it to a customer of his master's? - Yes. I went and searched his box, and found some tobacco in his pockets, with a letter directed to his sister.</p>

               <p>Mr. Haynes told me he suspected his servant robbing him, and desired me to watch his coming out of his house, which I did three Sunday mornings running; he sometimes went into the Cock and Crown, and sometimes went another way. On the 27th the prosecutor desired me to get a constable the next morning, and, if his sister came, to take her; if she did not, to take him. I went and saw the prisoner come out with a parcel under his arm. I went after him, with the constable, and bid him stop. He said, what must I stop for? Couchman came up, pulled out his staff, and told him he was his prisoner. We took him back, and Mr. Haynes said he had some snuff about him; that he saw him take it. The prisoner said, that he was going to carry it to a customer; but I forget the name.</p>

             lives at the corner of Westmoreland-buildings; he used to ask me to give him some snuff, and told me I could get more. Is that an honest man to swear against a person that would do that? Mrs. Baker is a customer of my master's; I took some goods to her on the Friday; she desired me to get her some of my snuff; to be sure I that worked in the vineyard would not take the worst of the grapes. My master would not sell snuff retail without adulterating it; she desired me to bring her some of my sort of snuff, I served my master duely and truely as I ought to do; I never wronged him of any thing.</p>

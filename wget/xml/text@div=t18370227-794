                  </hi>. I live in Thomas-street, Southwark. About four or five o'clock in the morning of the 21st of February I went into the Crown and Thistle public-house, in the Hay market—I leaned upon the bar with one arm, and went to sleep—I had a pin in my breast at that time—when I awoke it was gone—this is it.</p>

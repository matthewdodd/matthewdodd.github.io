                  </hi>. I am a seaman, lodging at 95, Old Gravel-lane, St. George's-in-the-East—on the Friday previous to 14th November, I was in Ratcliff-high way with the prisoner and two shipmates in a public-house—the prisoner said some girl had stolen his coat, and he would beat her—Isaid he should not—he then said he would beat both of us—I said I did not think he could do that—I took that as an insult, and caught hold of him by the coat, some blows followed, and we fell on the ground—when I got up he had a knife in his hand, and I found I was stabbed in the hand.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He followed me all the way from Tower-hill—I had a watch of his, and he said he would beat me if I did not pay him, or give him back the watch.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital—the prosecutor came there about 6 o'clock on Friday evening, the 11th—he had two wounds in his hand—they were dangerous at the time—this is the kind of knife that would have caused such wounds—it must have been a very broad knife.</p>

I went to King David's-lane and found the prisoner—I charged him with cutting Grant in the hand—he said, "I only did it in self-defence"—I searched him, and found this sheath knife upon him—I took the prisoner directly after this occurred—he was the worse for drink, but knew what he was about.</p>

               <p>Court Then he had quitted the coach, or rather you had quitted him? - He stopped me again to get their watches.</p>

               <p>Court. What time was that? - It was about ten in the evening.</p>
               <p>How far from Bloody-bridge? - Not half a mile, he went into the pond that is by the side of Chelsea-common, by that time we came up level with the pond, and he came out of the pond, and one of the men came up and we took him, he was going to put his hand in his pocket, and Carr took his hand away, and put his hand into his pocket, and he found a pistol, and I took him off his horse and searched him, and found a metal watch in his left-hand waistcoat pocket, and a medal and one half-penny, with some holes in it: we went to the Admiral

               <p>What sort of a horse? - A dark mare.</p>
               <p>About what size? - I am not acquainted with what they call the hands; it was a middle size horse, rather of the smallish kind, we secured him; when I took him off the horse, he clapped his hands together, and said, O Gentlemen, if you knew my distress you would pity me! I told him we were only doing our duty, and we would by no means use him ill at all; this is the watch that was taken from him.</p>

               <p>Prosecutrix. I cannot depose to the watch, it was such a sort of one, a green shagreen one, the glass was not broke, I never knew the number of it.</p>
               <p>Court to Creedland. When you took the watch out of his pocket, was the glass broke? - It was.</p>
               <p>Did you find any of the glass in his pocket? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know the watch Mrs. Popham? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court to Creedland. Has the watch been in your custody ever since? - Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Your watch, I think you say, Madam, had neither the glass nor hour hand broken? - No, I am very sure it was not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Mr. Creedland. I believe when you came up not knowing you or having a good opinion of you, he was so mistaken as to take you for highway men. he told you, you should have every thing he had, or something of that sort? - He said, for God's sake, Gentlemen, do not use me ill, any thing I have is at your service, when I took him off his horse, he was trembling in such a manner, he said, O Gentlemen, if you knew my distress, you would pity me!</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Just what I should have said, on the like occasion; now in what situation was his horse, like one that had been gallopped vehemently? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen upon this evidence, it is unnecessary to put the prisoner upon his defence, nobody can swear to the man, and the only circumstance that could have fixed him at all with this robbery, would have been that of the watch, then perhaps it might have been evidence to have been left to you, to have given it the construction you pleased: but, you see the watch cannot be identified.</p>

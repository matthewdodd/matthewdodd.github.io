               <p>Court. Did you observe this man before you were first knocked down? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Are you sure and positive, consider the prisoner's life may depend on your oath, and therefore you cannot be too cautious; look again and see whether that is the man? - I am certain sure that is the man.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt about it? - No sir, I am as clear and as confident about it as can be; I said I have seen the man's face, I think I should know him again, but I did not know where I had seen his face.</p>
               <p>Were you at all in liquor in that time? - I suppose in the course of that day I might<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178212040039"></xptr> drink eight or nine pints of beer, I had just drank a pint of beer before.</p>
               <p>Was your head confused at all? - I was very sensible, but I will not say I was as sober as ever I was, but I remember what I did as well as I should now this minute.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's counsel. You are a carpenter, I believe. - And joiner both.</p>
               <p>Had you worked that afternoon? - I had not been at work that day.</p>
               <p>You had been drinking all day? - No, I may call myself sober, or thereaways; - I was able to take care of myself.</p>
               <p>I suppose you could walk well? - Walk well, or discourse.</p>
               <p>But you was not so capable, perhaps, of discerning every thing as if you was perfectly sober? - I was, upon, my word.</p>
               <p>You think you was? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What time of night was this? - I think about a quarter or twenty minutes after six; it is not ten minutes walk from the place where I live to the place where I was robbed.</p>
               <p>It was a very dark night, I believe? - No, it was a very fine clear night, I am sensible it was a very clear night.</p>
               <p>Do you know Job Carey? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you at his house that night? - It was the last house I went out of.</p>
               <p>Was not you when you went out of Carey's house very much intoxicated in liquor? - I was not.</p>
               <p>Was you at Carey's the next morning after this robbery? - Yes, and I asked him who was in the house.</p>
               <p>Then you was so much in liquor the night before, you could not tell who was in the house? Did not you tell Job Carey the next morning that you was so much in liquor over-night that you could not tell who was there? - I did not; upon my word I did not.</p>
               <p>Did not you say that you could not tell whether any body came in with you or went out with you? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>How was the prisoner dressed at that time? - In a light coloured great coat, buttoned up very close, and a flapped hat; I saw his face because he stood up to me, and being of my own height, or thereaways.</p>

               <p>Nor the colour of his clothes? - I described the colour of the clothes the next morning before the Justice, I did not tell Baker I could not describe the colour of the clothes, I did not tell him any such thing.</p>

               <p>Did not you go to his lodging, or speak to any body, representing him to be the person that robbed you? - I was at work just by, a person says to me, perhaps it might be Fraser; I believe it was one Sigby; I did know him at that time, but I could not call him to mind; I recollected the men afterwards that he was not the man.</p>
               <p>Did not you say at that time perhaps it might be Fraser that robbed you? - It was Sigby that said so.</p>

               <p>Could you distinguish the features of a man's countenance so as to swear to him again? - I really think that was the man to the best of my knowledge that looked under my bonnet, there was nobody in company with him when he crossed the ditch; he said nothing to me, he immediately went a-cross the ditch again, there was another man a-cross the ditch; I did not observe his height, they swore to one another, and said it would not do, or something of that kind; I went on about forty yards from there, and I heard this carpenter stopped, and I heard the man asking for the money, but what it was I do not know, nor whether there was one man or two; when I heard the man cry out, I made the best of my way home; the man had a light-coloured coat on, buttons one, to the best of my remembrance, a light brown great coat, he had a roundish hat flapped over his face, he looked me under the bonnet, and he pushed his hat up: I observed his face; I saw him again at the Justice's, which was a fortnight and a day after, to the best of my remembrance, they came to fetch me to go.</p>
               <p>Was you called upon to find the prisoner out amongst several others? - He held down his head, and I could not see his face, then he held up his head, and I saw it was him, I knew him immediately; I said directly to my husband that was standing by, that it was him; I said to the best of my remembrance to the Justice that it was him; she that was with me is quite a child, and troubled with fits.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at the man again. - I am positive, Sir, that is the man that looked me under the bonnet in my face; to the best of my remembrance I can swear to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. What are you? - I wash and scour.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prosecutor? - I never saw the man before in my life, before I saw him at Carey's door drinking a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>You know there is a on this occasion in case the prisoner? - No Sir, I do not.</p>
               <p>You say you believe him to be the man, you do not to the man positively? - I am positive sure it is the man that looked me in the face.</p>
               <p>You did not know him before? - No, but he looked me in the face full, and crossed the ditch again.</p>
               <p>As the prosecutor (you say) and you are entire strangers, how came you to before the Justice? - The man found me out, Arnold knew me, I ran in my fright to the publick-house and ordered a pint of beer; I went home immediately, and I up and told the landlord there was a man robbed; they told him to look up, and he looked me in the face and then I knew him again.</p>

               <p>Do you remember Sir any part of the conversation, at any of the two last meetings, any thing said about the darkness of the night? - No Sir, not to my knowledge; it was quite dark when he went out of my house, so that you could not see the length of your hand.</p>
               <p>Court to Tall. You have heard what the witness has said, did you hold such conversation? - I went to his house, and asked him who was in his house, whether any body might have been there and waited for me.</p>

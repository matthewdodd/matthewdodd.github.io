                  </hi>. I am the manager in my father's business, a saw and tool warehouse, on the Holborn Viaduct—on the 20th October I came into the shop and found the prisoner there—he was looking at a sawing bench, and asked me the price of a lathe, and the length—I told him, and a moment after he asked me again "3 feet is it?"—I looked up, and he was looking very suspiciously, and I then found the stocks and dies in his hand—they were in a parcel—they had previously been in a rack on the wall—I sent for a constable—he tried to get away from me, and put his hand in his pocket and dropped a packet of files on the floor—the constable then came and took him into custody.</p>

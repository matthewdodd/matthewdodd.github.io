                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Greek-street, Soho. On Saturday night, the 30th of May, about half-past ten o'clock, I was called in to see the deceased, he was lying on a sofa—I examined his person, and on the left side of the lower part of the belly, I found a wound, evidently inflicted by a sharp, cutting instrument—such a knife as this would inflict such a wound—I inserted a probe, and it indicated a depth of about an inch, but on a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, it was found to be deeper—I probed it as far as was considered necessary—I did what is usually considered necessary in the case—in my judgment there was no hope from the first, from the nature of the wound—he lived till four o'clock on Monday—after death I examined the wound more minutely, it was nearly two inches in "depth, and had pene<lb></lb>trated the bowels in two places—the instrument had transfixed a portion of the bowel, passing from one side of the intestine to the other, making two wounds, two openings in the bowels—the bowels were highly inflamed, in consequence of this wound, and a portion of the contents of the bowel had escaped into the cavity of the belly—I observed approaching symptoms of mortification, a dark colour from the inflammation—the cause of death was inflammation produced by this wound, the contents of the bowel escaping—the liver, stomach, and every thing else was healthy.</p>

               <p>stabbed her, or something of that kind—I did not understand precisely—he said, "Say more," or "Don't say anything more, my sweetheart," or some<lb></lb>thing of that kind—I came close to him, looked sharp, and said, "You must put it into your pocket, or put it down"—he eventually put the knife again into his pocket—I turned round to see if there was anything with which to arm myself to make him put the knife down, and saw nothing but a chair—I went into the parlour to find some poker to speak to him more sharp, and in a second or two when I came back he was gone—I saw him going into the street—several persons from my place were there—that was the last I saw of him till I heard of this—he was not at all sweet on my sister, nor she on him, but my sister used to speak to him in that manner, and it was so with every girl he was acquainted with.</p>

                  </hi>. My father keeps the Blue Posts in Berwick-street. About a week before Keim's death, the prisoner came to our house, brought a gallon bottle, and ordered a quartern of gin in it—I served him—he took it away—he did not appear anything extraordinary—I did not know him before.</p>
               <p>—Smith. About half-past two o'clock on Sunday afternoon, the 24th of Sept., the prisoner called at my place, with a stone bottle in his hand, I should say about a gallon bottle—he asked me to drink—I said, "You have been at Broad-street; I don't like that sort of drink"—(there is a pump in Broad-street)—he said, "No, it is very good,"—he took a wine-glass out of his pocket, and poured but half a glass—I tasted it with him, it was gin—there was not above a glass more in the bottle—he poured the contents out, and drank it himself—I had known him about twelve months—I consider him a person not of sound senses—I thought he looked very strange—he never spoke to me before, to my knowledge, although I knew him some time—I thought he was not in his sound mind.</p>

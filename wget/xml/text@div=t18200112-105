            . I am street-keeper of Whitechapel. On the 28th of December, about half-past nine o'clock, I was going down Rosemary-lane, heard a noise at a public-house, and went to see what was the matter; the landlord was disputing with the prisoner about some liquor, because he could not give him change for a 1 l. note - I said I could give him change, which I did, and asked him his name? he said Brown, No. 74, Lambeth-street, next door to the White Bear. I went to the White Bear with him to have a pint of porter - I enquired of the landlord if he knew him? he said he lived next door, and that his name was M'Carthy. I then suspected the note was forged, and took him to the watch-house. While I was there a man came and told me to detain him for robbing the prosecutrix - she came to identify the note.</p>

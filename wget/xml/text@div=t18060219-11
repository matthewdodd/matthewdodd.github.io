               <p>- LEPPINGWOOD sworn.

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed.</p>
               <p>Q. All you know you found some mutton; countrymen have commonly nails in their shoes. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any footsteps between the road and the house. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not observe the track of a great many other persons, or any other person, besides the track of the person going to and returning from the spot. A. None in the road to his house, there was the track as far as the house.</p>

               <p>Q. He meant London. - A. Yes.

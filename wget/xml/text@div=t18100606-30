            . I am an headborough of Shoreditch; I took the prisoner in custody. On the 10th of April, the sister in law of the deceased came to me, desiring that I would get the deceased into the hospital; I gave her some temporary relief, and desired her to let me know how he was; the next morning she came to me and announced that he was dead; I went with her and saw the deceased lay on the floor, with a cut on his head; I went to Mr.

             the surgeon that attended him, he told me he had not a doubt but that blow on his head was the cause of his death. The wound on his head appeared to me to have been done with a blunt instrument; I searched the room, I found this mallet, on examining the mallet I found several marks of blood. I found the mallet under some matting, the prisoner was in the room, I asked her what the use of that mallet was; she said, they used it in platting their work. They were door matt makers.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner any relation to the deceased - A. I believe the prisoner was wife to the brother of the deceased, but cohabited with the deceased.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the prisoner about the death of the deceased - A. She said she knew nothing of the death of the deceased, nor how the blood came on the mallet; she told me he came home on Friday night, the 30th of March, very much intoxicated, he quarrelled with her and threw her down stairs; she went up a second and third time; after that there was a candle lit by his desire; they had a scuffle again; he pulled the lighted candle out of the candlestick, and thrust it into his eye, which very much burned his left eye.</p>

               <p>Q. How far is that from Puryers - A. A good distance. They live in French gardens.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Yes, and the deceased; they lived together as man and wife for many years. The deceased rent for me on the Monday as he died on the Tuesday, I found him very bad, he told me he thought he should die before night; he complained of his head and asked me to stop with him. I saw a plaister on his head, I did not look at the wound, I asked him how it came.</p>

             throwed the wooden mallet that they worked with at his head; he told me they had some words some days back and then she throwed the wooden mallet at him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he tell you what happened in consequence of those words - A. No; he was almost past speaking when I went.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you understand from him that in consequence of these words that she threw the mallet at him - A. I should think so.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if I understand you right, you understood they had a quarrel together; they had many words, she threw the mallet at him in consequence of that - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many children had they - A. Two; they have had five. I have known them twenty years.</p>
               <p>Q.Had they lived well together and orderly - A. They lived very unhappy, they frequently quarrelled and fell out.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that blows passed from one to the other - A.Sometimes they often parted for a day or two.</p>
               <p>Q. There was nothing at all that passed from him for which he charged her with the cause of his death - A. He only wished her to take care of the children; he said he should not die happy if she did not come and take the children away.</p>
               <p>MR. WESTON. Q. You are a surgeon - A. Yes. On the the 9th of April the deceased came to my house, he stated that he could not open his mouth; I examined and found him with a lock jaw. I found a confused wound on the back of his head by some blunt instrument; considering him in great danger. I wrote a letter to Mr. Ashley Cooper, a surgeon of Guy's hospital. I requested the deceased to go with that letter that he might be admitted into Guy's hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he got into Guy's hospital - A. No. He went to Mr. Cooper, he did not see him; the servant saw him, he told him he had a lock jaw. Mr. Cooper told him he might come on the Friday, he would take him; he came again to me, I saw him at the door; I told him to go again, he would die if he did not get into the hospital immediately. He then stated that he hoped I would bring his wife to justice, that he considered himself as dying; I told him he would die. When I came home I was surprised to see him at my house, he told me that Mr. Cooper said he must come on Friday, I told him he would be dead before then; he died on the next day. He had some medicines from my house.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had told him he must die did he tell you how he received the wound - A. Yes; he stated by his wife throwing a mallet at him; I said, I suppose you were both drunk; he said that she was drunk, and that she thrust a lighted candle in his eye. He died on the 10th of April. I saw him on the Thursday following; upon examining the head there was a confused wound, with extraversated blood between the scull and the scalp, which covered the scull; the scull was not fractured; there was a slight extraversation under the scull, on the membrane of the brain, and injuries of the head frequently produce death. I conceive that the blow was the cause of his death. I consider the blow on the head produced a lock jaw and after that death.</p>

            . Q. Do you know the deceased - A. Yes. I met him the next morning after he had been fighting, and having words by Whitechapel-market; he asked me if I had heard of his row; I told him no. I live in the middle of the court, he lived at the top; he said, how do think my Sall served me; I said I did not know, I was a bed; he replied, we had a few words last night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to be in a dying situation - A. No; his face seemed scarrified and scratched.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went at this precise time to buy some stuff, the gentleman was not at home; he said, Sall, you go in here and have a pint of beer; I went in along with him, we had another pint, after that he sent me out to see if the gentlemen was come in, where I buy my stuff; he said, Sall, we'll have another pint of beer; I said, my dear, do not have any more, we will go home. After we came out he said, Sall, we will have a glass of gin; I said no; then he said he would have some beer; I said I would have a glass of peppermint. When we came home he had all the money in his pocket; the children asked me for bread; I said I have none until your father gives me the money; he immediately throwed me down stairs three times; I begged of him to let me in, he did. I know nothing about the mallet. After we had the words he laid down and went to sleep, he awaked again and said, strike a light; I said my dear, lay still and have rest; he would not; he began again immediately; I struck a light, he dragged the candle one way and I another; that is all I know about it.</p>

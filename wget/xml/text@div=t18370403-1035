I was in Covent-garden market, and saw the prisoner give my father a sixpence—he bit it in two and threw it down—she picked up one piece, I picked up the other—she said she would take it to the person who gave it to her—I gave the half to Mr. Stace—I am sure it was part of what she gave my father-in-law.</p>

               <p>Warehouse-room to get a deal table out for my mistress—I returned to the shop in about three minutes, and missed a chair, which I had seen safe five minutes before—a woman gave me information—I ran down Wentworth-street, and saw the prisoner walking away with the chair on his back—I went up to him, and told him the chair belonged to my master—he said nothing—I took it from him, and be ran away—I followed him with the chair in my hand—he went into No. 21, New-court, George-street—I went a little way from the house to look for a policeman, but did not lose sight of the house—I saw the prisoner then come out of that house and go into another at the corner of George-street —he came out of there, and went into a chandler's shop—the policeman then came up, and I gave him in charge at the corner of the chandler's shop—I am sure the prisoner is the same man—he had a hat on—the gas was lighted, but there was no gas in our shop.</p>

I took the prisoner by Smith's desire—he was going in to the chandler's shop—I told him he was wanted—he said, "What for?"—I told him he was charged with stealing a chair from a shop in Brick-lane—he said he knew nothing about it—he went very quietly till within one hundred yards of the station—he feigned to be very much intoxicated, but I do not believe he was so—he then put his foot out and threw me down, but with the assistance of the beadle, who happened to be near, I got up and secured him.</p>

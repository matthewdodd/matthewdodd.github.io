I brought her out of the court, and gave her in charge, and two sovereigns were found upon her. I had no mark on them.</p>

            . I am a constable, and assisted in searching her. I found two sixpences in her left stocking, which she said he had given her. When she first came into the watch-house, she said she had no money at all. I found the sovereigns in her right stocking; she was rather intoxicated, and said it served him right, he ought to have paid like a gentleman. As I took her to the Compter, she said she was a fool not to have swallowed them. She was drunk then.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He gave me 2 s. as I thought, and having no pocket, I put them into my stocking. He gave me the sixpences as we came down the court.</p>

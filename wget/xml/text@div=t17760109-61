               <p>"he was a rascal and a scoundrel; why did not he give the waiter six-pence and he would bring him some snuff?" and said,</p>
               <p>"if he had any manners, he would not teaze him for snuff, while he was in conversation with other gentlemen." The discourse then dropped, and Mr. Hunt went to the door to make water, he came in and walked about the kitchen, and then came into the bar again; he went to sit down, and then the deceased challenged him, and said,</p>
               <p>"he should be glad to decide the affair with him;" the deceased clapped his hand upon his sword, which was under his left arm, but did not then draw it;</p>
               <p>"very well, said Mr. Hunt, if you must have satisfaction, I shall decide it where you think proper." Porter the prisoner said, if you mean to decide it, you shall decide it here, you shall not go out of the house to decide it; yes, said Mr. Roupell, they shall decide it here; and he took one candle, and Porter the other; Mr. Roupell then went out into the passage, and stood till Hunt and Smith came; Hunt and Smith then came out of the bar, and Porter got before them, and went up stairs first, then Hunt and Smith followed, and Rou pell followed them; then I went up out of curiosity to see the affair, I was not called; they had their swords drawn before they went into the room; the deceased drew his sword first; Hunt had his in the scabbard; Hunt then drew his sword; they put themselves in a poster of defence against each other; they made several pushes at each other, but neither of them were wounded; Mr. Hunt then drew back, he appeared to me to be rather daunted, and said to Mr. Smith,</p>
               <p>"Smith, what necessity is there for you and I fighting;" he spoke very coolly to Smith, but Smith answered very abruptly,</p>
               <p>"d - n you, I shall resent it;" Smith held the point of his sword slanting towards the floor, and Mr. Hunt rose up and made a lunge at him towards the right side, somewhere against his ribs.</p>
               <p>Was Smith off his guard at that time? - No; he was not, he held his arm in a right line from his body, but his sword was rather bent, which made it appear to incline downwards; Mr. Smith made a lunge at Mr. Hunt, but missed his aim, and then they closed in with each other; when they closed in, Smith's sword passed by Mr. Hunt's right side; Porter then put down the candle, interfered, and took Smith's sword out of his hand, and flung it into the next room; I went immediately and put Mr. Hunt's sword into the scabbard, and left it upon the table; Hunt and Smith were then parted, and both their swords taken out of their hands; Smith pointed to his wound, and said, see here; there was a little blood upon the outside of his waistcoat; he called Hunt a d - d rascal, hit him a blow upon his lip, and made his lip swell and bleed: Hunt then took his sword, and Porter, Roupell, and he went down stairs, and left the deceased and me in the room, and I saw his colour change amazingly; I told him, if he would please to come down, I would lead him down stairs; he came out of the room with me, I came out first with the candle; I asked him when he came out of the room to stop a minute, till I picked his sword up, which was in the next room; he leaned upon the bannister, and instantly fell down; I went down stairs and told the company I believed the deceased was mortally wounded: I got some water and sprinkled it in his face, and it seemed to refresh him a little, but he did not speak; I then came down again and told the company, which were Mr. Hunt, Mr. Porter, Mr. Sheepcut, and Mr. Jennings, that the man was motionless; the company immediately: got up, and Jennings strongly desired that a surgeon should be sent for immediately, Mrs. Roupell said it was only a slight wound, and that she would take up some salve and dress his wound; that it was nothing but drunkenness.</p>
               <p>Court. Were they at this time drunk or sober? - They appeared to me to be intoxicated; Mrs. Roupell, Mr. Hunt, and Mr. Porter went up; I went to Salisbury-street for a surgeon, but he was not at home; I then went for an apothecary, Mr.

             the apothecary came; he probed the wound, and decleared it not mortal, but he said it was highly necessary to sent for a surgeon; one came, I went in with him, we found Hunt and Porter bringing the deceased down to the one pair of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177601090050"></xptr> stairs; they put him into the room, he stretched out, and rolled about the carpet very much: Hunt seemed much concerned, and asked the apothecary what was best to be done with him, the apothecary advised them to take him to St. George's Hospital; Hunt said, no; I should like to take him to the Westminster Infirmary, as I should like to have it done more private; Hunt said to me, let us lift him up and put him in the coach, and take him to an hospital immediately: in bringing the deceased down stairs, he begged to let him sit up a little; we then brought him down and laid him in the passage; there was a mob about the door; a surgeon was going by, and asked what was the matter, he came in, looked at the man, and declared he was a dead man, and that it was needless to move him; he died of the wound about an hour and a quarter after he received it.</p>
               <p>Q. from PORTER. Whether I did not fetch, or attempt to get a surgeon? - You did; while I went to Salisbury-street for a surgeon, I met you coming down while I was going up Catherine-street; but he had never a surgeon with him.</p>

               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>When the deceased, Smith, was asking Hunt several times for snuff, what was Hunt a doing of? - Engaged in company with other people.</p>
               <p>What about? - Playing at dice.</p>
               <p>Then Smith was repeatedly interrupting him for snuff during the time he was at play? - Yes; while at play with these other gentlemen.</p>
               <p>You say when Hunt went out to make water, he was challenged immediately upon coming in? - Yes; he dropped the discourse, and did not speak a word to Smith, but Smith challenged him.</p>
               <p>Were there any opprobrious names given at that time? - No; a challenge was given by Smith; Hunt answered him very coolly, I shall decide it wherever you will.</p>
               <p>Directly, they went up stairs? - Yes; almost instantly.</p>
               <p>You said before, Hunt did all he could to get a surgeon? - He offered to take him to an hospital; and do all in his power to serve him.</p>
               <p>Did not I say I would pay him all the expences to get a surgeon immediately? - You did.</p>

               <p>"d - n you, if you are a gentleman, give the waiter six-pence, and let him go and bring you some snuff;" he still kept frequently asking in the course of a minute or two perhaps, for a pinch of snuff; Hunt, as he was losing his money, was a little out of humour, and upon his teazing him said,</p>
               <p>"d - n you, you deserve to have your head broke:" soon after the company refused playing any more with Hunt; Hunt went out and returned in about a minute; I moved from where I was, and sat next to Mr. Sheepcut; I said to him, as you are a winner, I would advise you not to play any more; while I was talking, the deceased, Hunt, Porter, and Roupell went out of the room together: I did not hear any challenge given; I did not know what they were going out of the room about; in a few minutes after the waiter and the maid came into the bar, and said one of the men was wounded; I directly said, then why don't you go for a surgeon; I ordered the waiter to go for a surgeon, Porter immediately came into the bar, and said the deceased was wounded; I bid him fetch a surgeon; he directly went out for Mr. Howard; he came back, and said he could not find him; I made use of some warm expressions, and asked him what business he had back till he brought a surgeon with him; he went again and a surgeon, a foreigner, came in, I believe, with him; he said he had been to see the deceased, had probed him, and he was a dead man; Hunt seemed extremely unhappy at hearing it, and walked up and down the bar or the kitchen; I then told Hunt I was unhappy in being there, and likewise that the accident had happened, but as it had happened, I must take care that he was delivered into the hands of justice; he seemed quite satisfied: the constable and watchman were sent for, and he went with them.</p>

               <p>I believe I have know serjeant Hunt twenty years, or more; he always behaved himself extremely well and with humanity; he is a very respectable serjeant: the deceased was my serjeant likewise; they both have very good characters and were very good friends; I should have supposed such an accident would never have happened, if they had not been piqued to it by the people about them.</p>

               <p>I have known serjeant Hunt seventeen years; I had opportunities of knowing a great deal of him; I was lieutenant in the same company for above fourteen years: in the absence of the different captains, when many of them were in Germany, I had, in some measure, the command of the company; I ever looked upon him as a man of great humanity and benevolence; when there has been any misbehaviour of the men, he has endeavoured to put a favourable construction upon it; and though I frequently asked the men if they had any complaints to make against their serjeants; I never recollect during the course of the whole time, that there was any instance of tyranny or oppression in serjeant Hunt.</p>

               <p>I remember serjeant Hunt about sixteen years; I was lieutenant in the grenadier's company for some time; during that time he always behaved himself like a humane good man.</p>
               <p>Many more gentlemen would have attended, but they thought these were sufficient.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Asbhurst, after having with great accuracy summed up the evidence to the Jury, concluded to the following effect:</p>
               <p>This, gentlemen, is the evidence that has been given on one side, and the other; now it will be proper for me to tell you that in point of law, wherever death happens in consequence of a deliberate duel, at a future time and not immediately upon the quarrel, that in the eye of the law is murder; but if two men fall<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177601090052"></xptr> out, and having their weapons with them, fight immediately with those weapons, or if in the heat of passion they go instantly and fetch their weapons and fight a duel immediately, if death happens in consequence of that, the law makes such an allowance for the frailty of mens passions, that it does not suppose that malice in the act, which is necessary to constitute the crime of murder: then, gentlemen, you will carry back your attention to the facts that have been proved in the present case: it has been proved by the evidence of the waiter, and likewise by the evidence of Mr. Jennings, that this quarrel was sudden: the first challenge you find came upon the part of the deceased, Smith, though that indeed is not absolutely material, in order to distinguish whether it does or does not amount in law to murder; for upon which ever side the challenge or provocation comes, if they fight in the heat of passion, and upon equal terms as to weapons, in that case it is not material in point of law from which side the provocation comes; but the law looks upon it in that case to be no more than manslaughter; but it is still a circumstance more favourable for the prisoner; when the challenge comes upon the other side; the quarrel arose in this case, from the deceased teazing the prisoner, not the prisoner teazing the deceased; they were both a little in liquor, though to be sure the law does not allow that as an excuse; the deceased upon that gave him a challenge to fight him; you find this was so sudden and so instantaneous, that Jennings happening at that time to be at the other side of the room speaking to Sheepcut; he tells you he was not there above a minute, while he was talking to him the challenge was given; the deceased, Hunt, and the two others went out of the room, and went up stairs; and so short a time was it about, that he did not so much as hear the challenge given, or so much as know what they were gone about; therefore, that shews that they did immediately go up stairs upon the quarrel to decide it, and that with such weapons as they had then about them, for they were both furnished with swords: now the only circumstance I ever entertained any doubt about was afterwards cleared up; I thought from the evidence of Carrick at first, that Smith at the time this wound was given, was off his guard; for he said his sword was pointed towards the ground; but afterwards he explained that, he said his arm was then in a right line from his body; and that the sword happening to be a little bent, gave it the appearance of an inclination downwards; but, in fact, he was then on his guard: it does appear to me, from all the circumstances, to be nothing more than the crime of manslaughter; there is not that deliberate malice which is necessary to constitute the crime of murder; therefore you will find him guilty of manslaughter only; and, I think, you cannot find him guilty of more: this is only as to the case of Hunt; as to the case of Porter, to be sure where a man is present, and in any respect aiding and assisting to a murder, that makes him what the law calls a principal in the second degree, and if murder does happen in consequence of it, if the principal is guilty of murder, a person so present, aiding, and assisting, will, in the eye of the law, be likewise guilty of murder; but if the principal is not guilty of murder, then the other of course cannot be guilty; and if you should be of opinion to find Hunt guilty of manslaughter, as there cannot be an accessary in that, you will then acquit Porter.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure these things were all silver? - A. Yes; I had the care of them.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know the value of them, do you? - A. No, I don't rightly know the value of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose house was this? - A. My master's house.</p>
               <p>Q. He does not lodge there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You are quite certain that is the man that left the shoes? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What length of time was it, from the time the prisoner was in your house, till he was taken? - A. About a week.</p>
               <p>Q. You never spoke to him but when you went up stairs? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. A week had elapsed, and though you had but a momentary glance of him, you undertake to swear the prisoner is the man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never seen him before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He had a round hat on? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You shut the hall door when the man came in? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that man's life is at stake? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. It is, and, after I tell you that, will you undertake to swear he is the same man? - A. I can tell by his face, I shut the door after him, but there was a light in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Notwithstanding there must be a shade from the hat, and though you had never seen him before, you undertake to swear to the man? - A. Yes, by the length of his face.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had seen another man with a face the length of his, you would have sworn to him? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you now swear to this man? - A. He is the man that brought the shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was your duty to take care of the plate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If it was lost, you were liable to a chastisement yourself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner was apprehended, there was nothing found upon him? - A. Nothing that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. You went up to the drawing-room to your mistress? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were some time delivering your message? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If the prisoner had committed this theft, he might have run away while you were up stairs? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know that the other servants had not been in the parlour? - A. I know there were no other strangers in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you undertake to swear to this man, after what has been said? - A. To the best of my knowledge, he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. You swear to nothing but the length of his face? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to these things, were they silver or not? - A. Solid silver; there were the stamps upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. This house belongs to Mr. Aickin; how do you know your master's name is Francis? - A. I cannot undertake to say.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You always understood his name to be Francis? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. When he was at Bow-street, he said, he did not miss a part of the plate till next morning.</p>
               <p>Witness. I missed some of the things the overnight; in the morning, I found the others were gone; I am sure they were on the side-board in the evening.</p>

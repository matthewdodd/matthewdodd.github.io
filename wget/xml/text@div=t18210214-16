               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODERICK. Q. When you saw the turkeys they were without feathers - A. Yes, I lost them on Wednesday, and saw the cock on the following Monday, that was not picked.</p>

            . I am servant to Miss Weeks. On the 31st of January, I locked the poultry in the stable, which is enclosed with the dwelling-house by a fence; I locked both locks, and took the keys into the house; the cock and turkeys were then safe. I afterwards saw the cock in the possession of the constable, one of the turkeys was old and the other young. About half-past seven o'clock next morning, I found the door open; it appeared to have been done by a crow or chisel. There were also traces of footmarks, which lead over a fence six feet high. I can swear to the cock having seen it from a chick; it was whole with the feathers on. The constable also had two turkey's heads, and some fowl's feet.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODERICK. Q. How far is the stable from the dwelling-house - A. Eleven yards, it opens into a paddock which is a quarter of an acre, it is fenced quite round. It was dark when I found the door open.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Does not a wall connect the stable with the dwelling-house - A. Yes, it goes from the house to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182102140008"></xptr>the stable, and then on to the garden, and connects again with the house. I got up about a quarter past seven o'clock, it was dusk then. I do not sleep near the place.</p>

            . I am a constable. On Friday the 2d of February, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I went to the prisoner's house, and in the coal-hole found a hamper containing two hen turkeys picked, one was bigger than the other. I asked the prisoner who they belonged to; he said they were his, and were sent from Suffolk by his mother. I asked him if there were any more poultry there; he said No, I felt there was, and brought it up. I gave it to a person at the door, charging him in the King's name to take care of it for me. Mrs. Wilson who keeps the house was fighting to get the prisoner from me. I found the cock in the same basket, and a great quantity of feathers; the cock was not picked. I also found two hens in the basket, which were picked. I took him to the watch-house, returned to the premises with Cadby, and on taking up a board in the privy floor, I found a quantity of fowl's heads and feathers, the quarter of a fowl cut up, and the remains of several fowls.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were the turkeys and three fowls all in the same basket - A. Yes. He lodged at the house. I produce the head of the cock.</p>
               <p>MISS WEEKS re-examined. I know this to be the head of my cock, the comb was cut off when it was a chick in a particular manner, and the spurs were sawed off; it is a game cock; we lost twenty-six or twenty-seven fowls that night.</p>

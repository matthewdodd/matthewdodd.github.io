                  </hi>, I sometimes work at Messrs. Pontifex's, the coppersmiths, in St. Martin's-lane. On 28th Aug. I was out—I was tipsy, and I do not remember anything after I was in the Borough-market—that was about 3 or 4 o'clock in the afternoon—I had a tobacco box; this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it, I have had it two years—I remember having it in the Borough-market about 3 o'clock—I was not perfectly sober at that time, but I had my recol<lb></lb>lection then; I was sober in the fore part of the day—I have no recollec<lb></lb>tion of seeing the prisoner, or of anything that happened to me after 3 or 4 o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a basket maker, in White-street, Southwark. I was in Kent-street between 11 and 12 o'clock at night, on 28th Aug.—I heard a female voice, and went across the road to the place it came from—I saw the prosecutor lying down in the gutter, and the prisoner leaning over him; she appeared to me to be rifling his pockets, from what I saw when crossing the road—I did not see her take anything out; it was rather dark at the place—she got up from him and commenced kicking him, and kicked him in the face—I called her a <hi rend="italic">faggot</hi>, and told her she ought to be ashamed of herself, and I should take her up—I took hold of her, and pulled her away from him—she broke from me, got to his back, and began kicking him again—I secured her, and when the constable came up I gave her into custody—she might have been drinking, but she knew what she was doing—the witness Bryant was standing close by at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tanner, and live in Kent-street. Between 11 and 12 o'clock on the night of 28th Aug, I was in Kent-street, standing at my own door—I saw the prisoner and prosecutor coming along—just as she came up to the door, she took and <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> him down into the gutter—he could not stand—it did not require much to <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> him down—when he was down she leant over him, and put her hand into his left hand pocket—I do not know whether she got anything—she then turned to his right hand waistcoat pocket, and when she took her hand out, I heard some money drop on to the stones—she did not say anything at the time—after she took the money, she kicked him twice over the forehead—she then turned round to his back, and kicked him twice in the back, using disgraceful language—she said that he was the man that took her away from her home and seduced her—MR. Williams came up, and the prisoner was given into custody.</p>

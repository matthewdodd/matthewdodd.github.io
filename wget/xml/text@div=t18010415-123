               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am an unfortunate person; I met the prisoner in Clare-market, he asked me if he should go with me; I said he might if he would make me a compliment; he said he would, and he gave me a half-crown piece; I said that was too little, and he gave me another: I undressed myself, but had nothing to put round my head; he said he would lend me his handkerchief, which he did; I awoke, and was very dry, and was going to get something to drink, thinking to return before he awaked; he followed me, and said I had robbed him; the two shillings and sixpence I had before of my own. <rs id="t18010415-123-verdict687" type="verdictDescription">

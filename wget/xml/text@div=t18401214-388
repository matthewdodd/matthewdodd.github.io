                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Bernard Morley, a labourer in the London gas factory, and live in Vauxhall-walk. On the 28th of November, a little after three o'clock in the afternoon, Richardson and Webb came to<lb></lb>gether with a coke-cart—I wanted a sack—I told them to take it up stairs in the front room—they went up—Richardson had the sack on his back—there was a hole in it, and some of the coke fell out on the stairs—they began laughing—I told Webb not to stand laughing there, but to put his hand to the sack, that the coke might not fall out—he did so, and they went up into my room—I followed them and picked up the coke, which detained me a little on the stairs, and they were in the room alone—I met them coming down stairs—Webb was one stair before Richardson—I passed Richardson, (who rather took up the width of the stairs,) and went to see whether my watch was safe—it was gone—it was safe before they came into the house, lying on the drawers—no one could have taken it but them—immediately I missed it, I spoke to Richardson about it—he said, he had not got it, that the other one must-have got it—I asked him who the other one was and where he was—he said he had no knowledge whatever of him, on his oath he denied it, and said many bad words to that effect—he said, he would run after Webb—he returned again to the cart, and I gave him into cus<lb></lb>tody—the watch produced is mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Masland, a pawnbroker, in West-minster-road—I received this watch on the 28th of November, about nine o'clock, from the prisoner Thomas—not liking his appearance, I asked who the owner was—he said, he was not the owner—I told him to go and fetch the owner—I stopped the watch—he went and fetched the prisoner Rice, and I ultimately took it of her—I said, "You are the owner"—she said, "Yes, it is all right."</p>

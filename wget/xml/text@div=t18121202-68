               <p>Q. Did Schlicht lodge at your house - A. He did, and Brown; they both lodged on the same floor, but not in the same room. They had lodged in my house a month. They came together. They both belonged to the same ship. On last Sunday fortnight, I went out of my dining-room a few minutes before three, and they were only three lodgers in the house, myself, my husband and two female servants. The prisoner was not there. At the time I left the dining-room I heard the catch of a lock. Brown had no clothes in the house; they were on board a ship. I left two sailors in the dining-room; they were smoking. The prisoner came in and went up stairs. I heard a knocking, and at the time I thought he had no business with a chest. I heard a lock pass and repass. I went out in the afternoon, and when I returned the other lodgers were at supper, but the prisoner. The other lodgers went to bed about eleven o'clock. I heard some one cry out my chest is broken open. I went up stairs, Schlicht said he had lost an old pocket handkerchief, which held six guineas as he said. I never saw the guineas. He said, Brown had done it. The next morning my husband got an officer to take Brown. My husband said to him, give up the money; I will not hurt you. He said, Mr. Hellman, I have got the money. He came home with my husband; a constable was sent for. The prisoner went into the kitchen to wash his hands. I saw the man take up three guineas. I did not hear it fall. Brown was washing at the sink, and no one else. The sink was too dark for any one to see it. The constable asked the girl to bring a light. She brought a light and the constable took it out.</p>
               <p>GEORGE PATRIDGE. I went in the kitchen. I saw the prisoner, and the prosecutor standing along side of him. The prosecutor said, he had found two guineas in the sink. I said, fetch a light. I found one more in this pocket-book, and sixteen shillings and sixpence in this pocket-book. There is a protection belonging to Schlicht.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Is that your protection - A. Yes. When I was on board a ship I had no pocketbook, I gave it to the prisoner to keep for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the money drop - A. Yes. As he was washing himself at the sink I heard something fall. I went to the sink and found two guineas. The constable called for a candle, and found one more. The prisoner said, do not be hard with me; I will give you your money back again.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot swear to the money, can you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I said, Schlicht, you are a villain; you have spent your money, and you want to replenish yourself with my purse. I asked the officer that took me not to manacle my hands, and to take me through the streets like a felon, because I am not one. He manacled my hands, and I was taken through the streets like a felon. The money, I assure you, is my own. This woman that stands there, said, if I would run, no one would run after me. I said, was I to run from my own property. On Saturday, the prosecutor had four guineas in his chest. He has made a mistake. He thought it was six instead of four. I really think he wishes to do me out of my money, and nothing else.</p>

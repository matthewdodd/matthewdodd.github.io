               <p>Was it so placed that it was likely to fall out of the cart? - I cannot say; I should think it was not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am porter at the four swans, Bishopsgate-street, I was in that Inn yard at half past one, I went with an order of Hinde's and Butterfield's, I saw nothing in Bishopsgate-street; as I was coming back, the turnkey of the Poultry, said, I must go with him, I told him my name and my business; this gentleman said, he saw a carman take a basket off my back, I was very contented, I neither saw the basket nor the cart.</p>
               <p>Court to Davies. Are you sure you can now swear to the prisoner's person, you had but little time to observe him? - I remarked a little mark on his cheek, I am clear is the same man.</p>
               <p>Jury. When did you see him again, how long was it? - It might be an hour very likely.</p>
               <p>To Coates. How long was it from the time you lost sight of the man, when you went to the Compter, till you took up the prisoner in Cheapside? - I believe five or six minutes; we took him up a little beyond the Old Jury, but a little from the Compter, the man threatened me, says I, my friend I think I am very clear, because I passed you, he said he had been at Hinde's and Butterfield's, as he tells you now, I went to them knowing them, they said he had been there, in that he has given you a true account; I am very glad you asked that question because it made me recollect.</p>
               <p>To Coates. You met him again returning that was between Hind and Butterfield's and the old Jury? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure and positive as to his person? - I am very clear in it that it is the same person; I immediately followed him, I did not lose sight of him, but just at the turning of Threadneedle-street; I overtook him without running, because I thought it would only alarm him, then I looked at him, I verily believe him to be the same man, I looked at his face, his coat and his stockings, he had very brown stockings on.</p>
               <p>You learned that he was a porter at the four swans? - Yes, sir; I went there.</p>
               <p>To Coates. Was the prisoner's hair tied behind or not? - I cannot say.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been in the army. I was with Jones at Hampton Races, selling cards—on leaving the ground I saw that she had 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had had some money, but I paid it away before I left the race-course, and had not a farthing left—on our road home we went into a public-house, and called for a pint of beer—the prisoners were there—I asked Smith to drink—he asked where I was going—I said, "to Staines"—he said, "I am going to Windsor, for my wife is there, and my cart; and I will go along with you on the road to Staines; it will be company for you;" and we all six walked out together—when we had got about a mile on the road, Smith asked me how I got on at the races—I said I had taken about seven or eight shillings—upon that I saw Shearman give his fiddle to one of the women, and the men got one on each side of me—I told Jones, who was walking about two yards in front of me, to come back, that I would not go on into Staines, for I thought they were going to do something to me—the men then caught hold of me, one by each leg, and threw me down—Smith placed his right knee on my breast, and his left foot on my throat; and Shearman searched my waistcoat and trowsers; and finding nothing on me, they said, "She must have it," and they then went from me—I do not know what they did, for I had no power for five or ten minutes, through their violence—Smith kicked me on the leg when I was down, so that I could not recover myself to go to Jones's assistance—while I was sitting on the road-side, buttoning up my things, Smith came back, took a little wooden box from his hand, took off the lid, turned out the money in his hand, and said there was just 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it—Shearman said, "Don't take it from her, give it back to her"—I saw no more of it—as soon as I recovered myself, I went back to Hampton, and gave information to the police.</p>

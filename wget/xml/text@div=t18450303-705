                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable T</hi> 25.) In consequence of information I was watching at Grove-lane station, Kensington about six o'clock in the morning of the 4th of Feb. I was at the first-floor landing window, which prevented persons in the yard from seeing me—I saw Mott open a gate which leads into the station-house yard—he was a police-constable, and had charge of the inspector's horse—Jackson keeps a chandler's-shop and a beer-shop—he is a gardener, and used to come once a week to the station to take away the dung—when Mott had opened the gate Jackson led in a horse and cart and backed round to where there was some dung—I then saw Mott go to the door of the station, go in, and come out with a sack on his shoulder, which I afterwards found contained three bushels of oats—he placed it on the cart, and both he and Jackson gave it a <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> towards the front of the cart—Jackson then commenced putting dung into the cart, which completely covered the sack—they then stayed in the yard ten or fifteen minutes, and both went away together, Jackson leading the horse and Mott walking by the side—followed them to the Hand and Flower, at the corner of Grove-lane—they went in there and came out in about ten minutes—I then said to Mott,. while Jackson was within a few yards of him, that there was some<lb></lb>thing in that cart which ought not to be there—he said, yes, there were a few</p>

               <p>oats, which he had given Jackson in exchange for some brana—I then said, "I shall go to the station with the case, where you had best come and state what you have to say about it"—Jackson went off with the horse and cart while I was speaking to Mott—I followed Jackson and said, "I want to see about this corn which you have got in your cart"—he said, "What corn?"—I said, "We must go to the station"—he walked there with me and the cart—I mentioned it in Jackson's presence to the acting inspector, and Jackson said, "I hope you will do nothing is it, it will ruin me and my wife, and break up my home"—he said, "I thought I was doing no harm in giving bran to Mott for some musty oats which he said he had"—as far as I can judge, he had had no opportunity of seeing the contents of the sack at that time—I had not seen it at that time—the sack was brought in out of the cart, and left in the charge-room at the station—it was tied up—while Jackson was at the station Mott came—I examined the con<lb></lb>tents of the sack about one o'clock the same day—as far as I could judge, it was in the same state as when I left it—I untied it, opened it, and found it contained about three bushels of very good oats, worth about 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

I was with Hogan, and saw the cart driven by Jackson in the yard about six o'clock, and backed round to where the dung was lying—Mott went to the station-house and brought out a sack on his back which was heavy—he put it into the tail of the cart, and I heard it pushed along the cart—the tail-board was then put up by Mott, and Jackson began to put up the dung—they went away with the cart.</p>

I saw a cart at the station—Hogan lifted up some dung in the cart—I then saw a sack containing something—it was taken into the charge-room—I had occasion to go to Hammersmith, and when I came back, in about an hour and a half, I examined the sack—it appeared to me in the same place as when I left it—Mott had the care of my horse, which had been very ill—he was very fond of the horse, and very attentive to it till it was sent away to Westminster—there was corn at the station for my horse, which was the property of the receiver for the metropolitan force, John Wray.</p>

               <p>Mott would have had to pay for bran if he had got it, but I found about a bushel and a peck of bran in a bran sack in the room—the bran sacks con<lb></lb>tain five bushels, worth about 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a bushel—a couple of sacks of bran might have been about the same value as the oats—I cannot exactly tell the price—Mott looked after my horse five years, and treated it with unusual kindness.</p>

             began first to burn the books; they had four large books in a sack; they began to cut the covers off, and there was wrote on them in Turkey leather, Ledger Wast-book, and Envoice Book; they burnt them all.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of seeing these books before this?</p>
               <p>Graham. On the 20th of Jan. in the morning I was called out of my bed by Joyner, he desired me to open my master's back door and he would bring in a chest. I went to the back door, where was Joyner, Nichols, and Cutts, and the chest. I asked Joyner what he had got there. He said it was stationary ware, and what was that to me. I told them my landlord was not up, and I believed he would not allow the things to be there. I saw four large books in a sack they had with them, they were not opened, but I saw the edges of the paper marbled, and covered with calf; and after that they came and carried them away to the Ship and Blue Ball in Five-foot-Lane, and from thence to the house where they were burnt.</p>

I live in Hickman's Folly, in the parish of Bermondsey, and as I was coming home on the 24th of Jan. between eight and nine at night, my wife standing at the door said, I am glad you are come home, there is a chimney on fire at that empty house: I went to the house, there I found a fire, and having my pole-axe in my hand, desired to be let into the room, or upon refusal I would break open the door. I spoke to them, hearing people there, four or five times, but had no answer. At last I got in, there was

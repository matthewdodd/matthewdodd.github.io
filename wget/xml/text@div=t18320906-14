On Friday, the 10th of August, between five and six o'clock, I was at the back yard door, leading into the yard, and heard my wife speaking to the prisoner; I heard her say, "Oh, you nasty spiteful fellow, to go to our employer to take the bread out of our months;" he said, "Yes, you d - d wh - g b - h, I did;" I then advanced towards him, saying, at the same time, "Will you dare to call my wife a wh - e?" he laid down a trowel, which he had in his hand doing something with some bricks, and took up a hammer - he met me as I was repeating those words, and hit me a most tremendous blow with it on the head; the blow did not stun me - I endeavoured to take the hammer from him, but he parried me off with one hand, and my wife, to save me or prevent a repetition of it, came forward - he directly turned his eyes to her, and gave her a blow with it on the forehead; I endeavoured to get the hammer from him, but failed, and he then made a deadly blow at the infant which she had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060017"></xptr>in her arms - he hit me several more blows; I desired my wife to go out and call Murder! she went out immediately, and called Murder! several times - he gave me one or two more blows, and I should have had more, but I prevented him - I did not get hold of the hammer till one or two persons came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive more than one blow on the head? A. Several - there was one here, and two wounds were dressed by the surgeon; when the persons came in he had me round the neck with his left arm, and as he was inflicting the last blow I put my hand up just in time to catch the hammer - a witness rushed forward, and with assistance we got the hammer from him; I had two wounds, which bled most profusely - I went to a surgeon immediately, taking the hammer with me; I was under his care about ten days.</p>

            ; he came in on Sunday evening or morning with Mr. Arueson, my doctor; it was the Sunday after I received the injury, which was on Friday - it was a very severe blow indeed: I should not like to meet with a similar punishment - I was not confined to my bed, but was so weak I could not go to the office to give evidence; I could not attend to my work for ten days after - I was weak; I did not go to work till the Tuesday week following; I went to the Policeoffice the next morning, and went to the surgeon the same evening, with the hammer in my hand - he lives there hundred or four hundred yards from me; he plastered and dressed my head, and I had medicine to take - I believe it was only a bottle; I neither struck the prisoner, nor attempted to do so; he was building an oven in his back kitchen at the time - he was using the trowel; I did not see the hammer near him till he took it up; it was within his reach - when I overheard the conversation between him and my wife I was at the yards door, about two yards from the kitchen and about four yards from where the prisoner was - the place where he was working was open, so that I could see him from the yard door; when I heard him use this language to my wife I did not rush forward, I advanced slowly - I had not been at all troublesome to the prisoner before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he had consulted his attorney to get you out of the house? A. Not that I know of - he gave me notice to quit; I think it was on the Monday before.</p>
               <p>Q. I presume you do not make shoes and work with your hammer on Sundays? A. Yes; I have been obliged unfortunately - I have been in custody twice; I believe they might be termed charges of felony - I can specify them; I am not ashamed of them; it was illegitimacy.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean respecting a bastard child? A. Yes - the other was a robbery of a chapel.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. And likewise for a rape, I believe? A. That was the same person - the child; I was charged with rape in that case.</p>
               <p>Q. On an infant eleven years old? A. No, a person twenty-three.</p>

               <p>Q. What do you mean by calling it illegitimacy? A. Because the person, who swore the rape against me, swore the child to me afterwards; I was then about twenty-one years old - I am now twenty-five; I think it was about four years ago - I can almost take on myself to swear it was in 1828 - I was not charged more than once with a rape, that I will swear; I have been a potato-dealer - the affair of the chapel was in November last: I have not been in the habit of singing ballads about the streets; I swear that positively.</p>
               <p>Q. Among other persons that came to the spot, was there a Mr. Patteson? A. I do not know a person of that name, nor Susan Smith - Mrs. Heaps was there, and a Policeman's son, named Cook - I did not see any body else; I went to the surgeon as soon as Heaps and the boy came in and rescued the hammer from him - several persons came to the office to give an account of the transaction; there was a woman named Abbott - I do not know Mrs. Smith or Everard by name - two females came up stairs where they took the evidence down, but they said there was sufficient evidence then, but if they found it necessary they would let them know - they were witnesses on my side; I did not advance to the prisoner with my fist doubled; my fist was down at my side - I felt hurt at my wife being called that name; I advanced to him slowly, not in anger or hostility - I was not in the constant habit of quarrelling with him; I never insulted him - I never had any words but on one occasion, that was a disputation on tea and camomile - that was after I was charged with the chapel robbery; it was after that I went to reside with him - he occupied the back parlour and the back room up stairs;

On Friday afternoon, the 10th of August, the prosecutor came to my house, accompanied by Moore; his head was considerably stained with blood, and on the left side of the forehead there was a wound, and another towards the back part of the head, and a slight scratch on the nose - the wound on the forehead was, I should think, such as would be inflicted by a blow from a hammer; it was about an inch long, and penetrated to the immediate covering of the bone of the head, and owing to the swelling of the scalp, was about half an inch deep - the cut on the head was towards the left side, on the upper part, throught the hair, and penetrated to the scull, or its immediate covering; there had been a considerable effusion of blocd - I dressed it; it healed favourably - I did not consider the external wounds dangerous, but could not say that dangerous consequences might not result.</p>
               <p>Q. Is a blow on the head, producing that sort of laceration, a dangerous thing? A. If it is given with considerable force.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw it - would a blow producing such consequences be dangerous? A. It might; I was desired at the office to say whether I could pronounce him out of danger a day or two after, and was not then able to pronounce him out of danger.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you a member of the College of Surgeons? A. No, I am a licenciate of the Apothecaries' Company; I put some adhesive-plaster on the wounds after washing them with water - I put plaster on each of them; there were three wounds, including the scratch on the nose; Mr. Heath, a friend of mine, saw the prosecutor on the Sunday morning - when I considered the manner in which the wounds had been inficted, I certainly considered dangerous consequences might result.</p>
               <p>Q. When you heard what was done? A. No, from what I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. When you speak of the scalp being divided, you mean the skin? A. The integumeuts.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not a man with a hammer in his hand, intending to murder another, split his skull with the greatest case? A. If his arm was quite at liberty, I suppose he might; I should not consider the wounds slight, except the one on the nose; I did nothing to the wounds but putting sticking-plaster on his head - I dressed them afterwards; I gave him physic: if there had been symptoms of fever, I should have bled him; there was no fever - there was a little degree of excitability.</p>
               <p>Q. Much the same as might be produced by hearing his wife called ill names? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If you anticipated the slightest injury to the brain, would you not have bled him? A. I should not have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060019"></xptr>bled him from apprehension, but if I saw fever approach I should do it; I did not order him to keep his bed, but to keep himself quiet, and abstain from any thing of a stimulating nature, and enjoined spare diet.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there the slightest reason why he should not have gone to work the next day? A. Yes, I think there was; I am sure there was - I coutinued to attend him perhaps eight or ten days, and removed the plaster perhaps five or six times; I called at his lodging the following morning, but heard he had gone to Worship-street office; he called on me in the course of the day - I did not think it necessary to confine him to the house; I saw Mrs. Langford - she was not very bad: her scalp was divided; I mean the skin and integuments.</p>
               <p>Q. What a nail or a pin would do, if drawn across the forehead? A. No, a penknife would; the scalp is perhaps a quarter of an inch thick.</p>
               <p>Q. I am speaking of Mrs. Langford's wound? A. Her wound was not so serious; I did not think it serious at all- I gave her no medicine.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. For a blow with a hammer, through the man's hair, to divide the scalp, must it be given with some force? A. Yes, I should say so.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor and his wife both rushed on me at one time, in a hostile manner, which he admitted in his examination, and then retracted it after being examined - I was at work with the hammer in my hand, and had not time to lay it down, in a little place where I had not an opportunity of getting away from him- from his general conduct, and the manner he rushed upon me, I considered my life in imminent danger, and drove him off with the hammer - I held him in my hands, to prevent his returning on me, and had no hostile intention towards him whatever - I did nothing more than I considered I was justified in doing in defending myself, when I considered I was in danger; I desired that he should leave my house peaceabley, which he would not do; I have evidence to prove his intention was to do me bodily harm before he would leave the house; as to swearing and calling his wife a wh - e, I have never sworn a profane oath for twenty-five years: as to calling her a wh - e, I never did, in the presence of your Lordship and God; I am a sober, steady man - I do not drink a pint of beer a day, nor spirits; I mind my own business, and nobody else, but he is a very violent person, and continues in no place long - he was determined not to leave me without doing me some injury; after this he continued in my house, and the Magistrate was obliged to order him out; and from what I have been informed my locks have been picked.</p>
               <p>MR. ARNESON re-examined. Q. In wounds where no vessels are divided, is the mode in which you treat them merely closing it, and putting on adhesive-plaster? A. It is the most approved method, and if it heals without inflammation, that is all that is done.</p>

            . On Friday, the 10th of August, I lived at the prisoner's house, in Philip-street - I am his housekeeper; Langford and his wife were lodgers. The prisoner was building an oven in his back kitchen - I was up stairs, in the back room, between five and six o'clock; the window was open, and commands a view of the kitchen, where he was - the oven was building by the kitchen wall; the wall was down, and open - the prosecutor occupied the parlour floor.</p>

               <p>Q. If Mr. Langford had any thing to say to the prisoner, could he see him from the yard door very well, without going into the kitchen? A. Yes; the yard door commands a view of where he was, and was within a yard or a yard and a half of him - I heard some words pass between the prisoner and Mrs. Langford, but could not make out what it was; I was coming down stairs, in consequence of a knock at the door, and could see the yard door - Mrs. Langford was then in the yard, and Mr. Langford in the parlour; I heard Mr. Fuller say, "You good-for-nothing muck," and with that Mr. Langford came out, and said,"How dare you call my wife a wh - e?" he came out of the parlour, and ran furiously towards the back door - (he did not walk slowly, with his arms down) when he got to the back door, he rushed violently into the back kitchen; the prisoner was at that time working at the oven - there was a hammer there; I did not see him use it, and there was a trowel - when the prosecutor rushed into the kitchen, the prisoner was at the oven, which stands in the corner, and it was impossible for him to defend himself.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, till Mr. Langford rushed violently into the kitchen, did he come from the oven? A. I never saw him; he could not rush from the oven without my seeing him; when Langford rushed in, it appeared to be with his fist clenched - I saw Langford strike the prisoner in the forehead immediately he came into the kitchen - the prisoner did not strike any blow with a hammer, or any thing, till he received the blow from Langford; I saw one blow, and do not know whether Langford struck more - he appeared to be in a very violent passion indeed, and Mrs. Langford appeared very ill-natured and spiteful; immediately as the blood came she ran to the door; she first of all fell upon the prisoner, to disengage her husband - the prisoner had not seized Langford when he struck him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do to Langford when Langford struck him? A. I do not know, but I saw the blood come; there was no blood till after Langford struck the prisoner - I distinctly saw him strike him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did Mrs. Langford rush upon the prisoner? A. The moment the blood came - he had done nothing to her at that time; he appeared to me to strike her in the scuffle, not on purpose; I am sure no blow was struck at her or the baby - he was very fond of the child; the prosecutor's conduct to the prisoner since he has been in the house was very insolent indeed, and very abusive.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see the prisoner strike any blow? A. No; but I saw the blood come from the prosecutor over his face, but saw no blow struck; I have been the prisoner's housekeeper about five years; he is a widower, I believe; we have three rooms; the back kitchen, the parlour, and the room over it; we have only one chamber - there are two beds, both in the same room.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

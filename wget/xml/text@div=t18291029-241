            . I am a carpenter. I was working at the same place; the prosecutor's wife called me to look after a person who was coming out of the building; I went and saw the prisoner coming out and going away - I asked him what he wanted in the building; he said he was looking for a job; I saw he had something under his coat, and drew out this saw.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence I was looking for work, and saw this building not finished - there was no carpenter's bench nor tools, but this saw was on the floor; I thought some carpenter had left it by mistake, and I took it to take to the public-house to inquire what carpenter had been at work - the witness came and asked what I meant by stealing the saw: I said I meant to take it to a public-house.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WELLS. I constantly work there - we generally leave our tools on the bench; they were not hid - I was at work up stairs - my bench was on the first floor.</p>

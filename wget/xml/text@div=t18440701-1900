                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, and live at the Three King<lb></lb>doms tavern. I had a booth at Moulsey races, and had some wine and spirits there. Between twelve and one o'clock in the morning of the 14th of June, I saw the booth safe—I had there a cask of brandy, and a cask of gin, some bottles of sherry, a box of cigars, and some tobacco—I was in bed at the booth—about two I was awoke, and missed all the articles stated—this cask is mine—I know it by the painting on it, and the marks on the taps—this is another of my casks—one had rum in it, and the other gin—I had seen the prisoner and one or two others lurking about the day before.</p>

On Friday, the 14th of June, I was coming to London with my horse and cart—I came to Coombes-warren, and saw the prisoner—I am sure it was him—he asked if I was going to London—I said I was—he asked if he might put a bag up into my cart—I asked him how heavy it was—he said, "Not very heavy"—I said I would put it up if it was not very heavy—he called "<hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>" to some man in the wood, and lifted the bag off the man's shoulder to the cart—I drove on towards London, and the prisoner followed me—when I got about a mile and three quarters, two officers stop<lb></lb>ped me, they took the bag out of the cart, and took these casks out of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am pot-boy to the Bank of England public-house, in North-wharf-yard, Paddington. On Sunday night, the 26th of April, I went to the Hope, in Berkley-street, and saw the prisoner—I was rather the worse for liquor, but not drunk—I went into the yard and was sick there—I remember a hand being introduced into my pocket in the yard—Moore, my brother-in-law came out into the yard—he said, "If you touch him, I will split your head"—he said so to the prisoner—I at that moment was so sick, I could do nothing—there was nobody in the yard but me and the prisoner at the time—I missed from my pocket two half-crowns, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a button—I charged Moore with taking it at first, and searched him, and found he had but 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; he was in the privy—I then went into the tap-room and charged the prisoner with taking two half-crowns and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he had done no such thing, and that he had 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. about him—we had a scuffle—I struck him, and he struck me—I had two half crowns and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and a button in my pocket before I went into the yard—I had the button in my pocket for a fortnight—it had not come off my dress.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. He said it had come off his trowsers; and he showed an iron shank, and said it had come off there the same day. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I said I had it to put on where that was off—there was a button off my dress—the button I lost was not part of my dress—I had picked it up in the street, and was going to put it on my trowsers—it did not correspond with the prisoner's dress.</p>

               <p>Edgware road. I was at the public-house with the prosecutor—I saw the prisoner and prosecutor in the yard when I went out there—I went into the water-closet, and left the door open; and presently I saw the prisoner touch the prosecutor, and say, "Well, comrade, how are you?"—I saw him put his hand into his left-hand pocket—I said, "If you don't let him alone I will split your head off"—the prisoner then caught hold of the door, and went into the tap room—my brother-in-law said, "Joe, have you taken my money?"—I said, "No; feel;" and he searched me—I had only 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he went into the tap-room, and accused the prisoner of taking two half-crowns, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and a button—the prisoner said, "I have got 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pocket now?"—the prisoner was intoxicated—Williams came in, and asked him to let him see what money he had; and all he could produce was two half-crowns, two sixpences, and a button—he had paid for a pot of half-and-half with a shilling, about three minutes after I came into the tap-room—he had the beer before he went out, and the waiter asked him for the money—I did not see what he paid for it myself, but the waiter says he paid a shilling—he is not here—that was about seven minutes after he came out of the yard—I did not charge him—my brother-in-law accused him, and I said, "I saw you put your hand into his pocket"—he said, "I did not"—Walsh fetched a policeman, and he would not give the money up till he got to the station-house—he carried it in his hand all the way to the station-house—I charged him with it seven minutes before the policeman came.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Your brother charged you with it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—my brother struck him in the tap-room—they both struck one another—the prisoner sat down in the tap-room, and the policeman was fetched—the prisoner produced his money and the button before the officer came—he gave it to Mr. Wil<lb></lb>liams, who returned it to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I went and called for half-and-half—I tossed for a pot of beer, which I lost and paid a shilling for—I went into the yard, and in about ten minutes his brother came in and struck me, and said I had picked his pocket—I denied it; he had charged the witness with it at first—we had two or three blows a-piece—a policeman was sent for—I gave up the money and button—he swore to the button as soon as he saw it put down, and I saw the place where it had broken off my brace-button—he pretended to show where it belonged to his trowsers—there was an iron shank left there, and he said it had been on there.</p>

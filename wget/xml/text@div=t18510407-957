                  </hi>. I live in Windsor-terrace, City-road. On 24th March, I was in Chiswell-street, about half-past four o'clock in the after<lb></lb>noon—I was looking at a placard, and felt my dress twitch—I put my hand down, and felt the little boy (Deane's) hand coming out of my pocket—I caught him by the arm, and I saw the hand of the arm that I had hold of, go into his own pocket—he struggled to get away—I then held him by the collar of his coat—Jones came and took him by one arm, and another boy took him by the other arm, and took him forcibly away from me—they got away, and ran down Whitecross-street—I ran down after them till they came to some courts and lanes, and there they dis<lb></lb>appeared—I had had three half-crowns, two shillings, and a sixpence in my pocket—I felt my pocket the instant the hand was withdrawn, and the money was pone—I went to the station-house, and gave information as soon as I could, and I saw Jones in custody of an officer in about a quarter of an hour afterwards; and while I was in the police-office I looked out and saw Deane opposite.</p>

I was in Chiswell-street in the afternoon of 24th March—I saw Deane put his hand in the lady's pocket—she caught his arm, and he slipped his hand into hit trowsers pocket—the lady then caught hold of his collar, and two boys came and kicked the lady and got him away—they ran down Chiswell-street, and down Whitecross-street—I ran after them, and so did the lady—there was a mob.</p>

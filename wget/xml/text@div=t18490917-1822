                  </hi>. I live in Nelson-street, Greenwich; I am a jeweller. On 4th Sept., about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoners came into my shop, and Bennett asked me to show him some wedding-rings—I showed him a card, cut one off, he tried it on his finger, handed it to Kilburn, and said, "See what you think ef it; "and Kilburn ran away with it on his finger—I ran after him, leaving Bennett in the shop—I lost sight of Kilburn without overtaking him, came back again, and found Bennett still standing outside the shop—I said, "I must look for a policeman, "and in about a minute Bennett ran away in the same direction as Kilburn had—Kilburn was brought back in about a quarter of an hour with the ring on his finger—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is mine.</p>

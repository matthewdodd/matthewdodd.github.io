                  </hi>. I live at 8, Verulam-place, Gray's-inn-lane, and am a labourer—on Monday evening, 27th May, between twenty-five and twenty-eight minutes to 7, I was working at the station that is being built for the Metropolitan Railway at King's-cross—the prisoner was deputy <hi rend="italic">ganger</hi> there—Driscoll, the deceased, was in his gang—I was near where the prisoner was at work, on the fifth rib from King's-cross, forming the span of the roof of the station—Driscoll was called down from the top and took up his own place where he was at work before, on the rib—the prisoner came up and said to me, "Mike, I want you down the other side"—I was on a plank between the two ribs—I said "I can't go till I get a cord to make fast"—Driscoll said to him, "You can't show us our work; we can always do our work, can't us, <hi rend="italic">mate?"</hi> speaking to the man that was along with him—I then went down to the next rib and took a cord with me; that was the rib opposite where they were—I was not standing, because you could not stand there; I was coming up cross-legged, the same as Driscoll was when he fell—I saw the prisoner striking Driscoll—I was right over them, opposite to them—the prisoner hit Driscoll several times, and Driscoll said, "Let me go down into the road and I will fight you"—the prisoner then hit him again, and Driscoll said, "If you hit me again I will put the <hi rend="italic">podger</hi> in your b—eye"—the <hi rend="italic">podger</hi> is an iron that we use; he had it in his hand at the time—the prisoner, I think, was in such a passion that he hardly spoke a word—Driscoll had only one hand to hold on by, he had nothing but the rib to hold on by; the prisoner had a <hi rend="italic">derrick</hi> in his favour, he had more power, he was on the highest part, he could hold by the plank at the top—they were both on the rib—the <hi rend="italic">derrick</hi> is the thing that you pull up by—the prisoner had hold of that, and he had a great deal of advantage over Dris<lb></lb>coll; he was in a more level part—the prisoner was the strongest man of the two—they were both sitting straddle-legged across the rib, face to face—the</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could you see what caused him to drop down in that way? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The prisoner stood up over him, and as I looked down I saw the man's legs come over—they were still straddling across, but the prisoner stood up on the plange—I was in such a position that I could not exactly see; I was between the two ribs; I was over them, right on the top, on two planks—the depth that Driscoll fell was from forty to fifty feet—I assisted in taking him to the hospital.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is this a <hi rend="italic">derrick-pole (referring to the model)? A.</hi> Yes; a thing like that—it was in that position—the prisoner was on the top, on the side of the <hi rend="italic">derrick,</hi> and Driscoll was underneath on the slant part—the prisoner had not got his hand on the <hi rend="italic">derrick;</hi> he was using both his hands, and he was leaning with his shoulder and leg against the <hi rend="italic">derrick</hi> to support himself; one was on one side of the <hi rend="italic">derrick</hi>-pole and one on the other.</p>

I live at 3, Haverstock-place, Hampstead-road—on 27th May, between 6 and 7, I was at work on the same rib with Driscoll—I was standing up holding by the rope that came from the <hi rend="italic">derrick</hi>-pole—Driscoll was three feet from me on the lower part of the rib, sitting straddle-legged across the rib—the prisoner was there when we went there—Driscoll got on the lower side of the rib, and said to the prisoner, "Come out, let us do our work; you can't show us our work"—the prisoner said, "You sha'n't do any more here," and I believe he knocked Driscoll's cap off—Driscoll said, "You had better mind your fingers"—the prisoner then hit him in the face; I can't say whether it was with one or both hands; it was two or three blows, I can't say with which hand—Driscoll then said, "I will knock your eye out with this <hi rend="italic">podger</hi> if you hit me any more"—I did not</p>

               <p>hear the prisoner say anything, but he hit him again somewhere about the body or shoulder—I saw the blood begin to flow from both—I saw Driscoll then hit the prisoner with the <hi rend="italic">podger</hi> across the arm or face, or anywhere he could get at—I then saw the blood flowing, and turned to and made a bow-line knot with the rope that I had behind me, for the purpose of throwing over Driscoll, who I thought was getting weak; at the same time, as I did not know which was going first, I clapped my hand on the prisoner's shoulder to keep him on—I saw Driscoll falling at the time that I placed the rope over his head—I got the rope over his head and caught him by the arms, but his head slipped through it; his arms did not catch hold of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, and live at 259, Pentonville-road—on Monday evening, 27th May, between 6 and 7 o'clock, I was on the leads at the back of my house, which overlooks the new station—Mr. Smith was with me—my attention was directed by some quarrelling to the ribs, which were from sixty to seventy feet from where I was standing—I could distinctly see what was taking place there—the first I saw was the prisoner hit Driscoll on the side of the face three or four times—Driscoll defended himself with a <hi rend="italic">podger</hi> in his hand, and hit the prisoner with it on the arms, as he struck him, and I heard him tell the prisoner to come below and fight it out—I heard a voice come from the part, but where it came from I cannot my, "I will throw you over," or "pitch you over"—I am not sure of the words, but that was the effect of it—I was almost on a level with them; it came from near where the prisoner was; it came from off the ribs—I would not swear that it did not come from the prisoner, and I would not swear that it did—after hearing that, I saw the prisoner lean forward, and the two were close together—the prisoner raised himself up and held Driscoll by the shoulders, and he was lifted off the girder so that his legs came right up; both legs came above the girder and he dropped so (<hi rend="italic">describing it</hi>), with his arms out, and his feet down, so that his feet came first to the ground—I saw his feet reach the ground.</p>

               <p>can't say whether he hit him on the face or not—I saw him hit him on the arms, but not anywhere else—I did not see any blood on the prisoner's face—I don't think I was too far off to have seen it—I did not see Driscoll hit him on the head; he might have done so, but I did not see him—I could see the other workmen on the ground below at this time—there were several there—they were calling out to the men, telling them to leave off—the voice that said he would pitch or throw him over came from off the girder—I can undertake to say it did not come from the men below, and that it was not, "he will pitch him over"—I could tell whether a voice came out of the cut<lb></lb>ting or off the top—I am certain it did not come from the men on the ground—there were men below calling out, one man in particular—I can't exactly say what he called out—I heard him hallo out and tell them to be quiet; the principal thing he said was, "Leave off quarrelling up there;" but I can't tell exactly what the words were.</p>

I am a cheesemonger and grocer, and live in North-road, Highgate—on the afternoon in question I was with Mr. Downton on the leads of his house, and my attention was directed to the girders by some quarrelling—from where I stood I could distinctly see what was going on the girder—when I first came on the leads I saw the deceased and the prisoner struggling together, striking at each other; they were face to face, straddle-legged across—after they had struggled for a second or two they divided, and sundry words passed between them—I could not say what; they were oaths and quarrelsome language—I then saw Gregory strike at Driscoll with his right hand—he then struck him in some part, from the position I was in I could not say where, and then a man who stood at the back of Gregory threw a rope—when the rope was thrown a word was said that they would fall off if they did not desist quarrelling—when the rope was thrown over Driscoll he appeared to be very exhausted—he threw up his arms and threw the rope off as it fell over his shoulders, and then made a thrust at Gregory with an iron bolt or something in his hand; with that Gregory took hold of Driscoll, lifted him off from the girder, and let him fall down—I saw him fell—I should consider that he took hold of him by the collar and under the arm to lift him—I saw it—I saw him take him by the collar and some part of the body.</p>

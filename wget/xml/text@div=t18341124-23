                  </hi>. I am a sailor, and live at North Shields. On the 21st of November, I met the prisoner by the George, Commercial-road, about one o'clock in the morning—I went home with her to John-street, Com<lb></lb>mercial-road—Thomas Crain, my friend, went to bed with her, and I laid on three chairs in the room—about fire o'clock in the morning he called out that he was robbed—I immediately got off the chairs, and called for a light—the landlady brought a light down, and I found my handkerchief was taken off my neck—I was sober, and am sure it was on my neck when I went to sleep—it was found round the prisoner's neck when the light came—I had not paid her any money—she had some refreshment, but not at my expense—I did not give her my handkerchief—she said she lived there—Crain gave me a shilling, I went out and got a candle—brought in the officer, and had her apprehended.</p>

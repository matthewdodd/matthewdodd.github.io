               <p>Q. Did you lose a carpet from the house any time - A. I did not miss it until the patrol alarmed me. About five o'clock in the morning the patrol informed me of the street door being open. My husband and I occupy the parlour only, the other rooms in the house are let to lodgers.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your husband at home when the patrol gave you this alarm - A. Yes, he was, but not awake until I awoke him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you the last person up the night before - A. I was I left it on the spring-lock; the door was left unbolted; there is a small string goes through the door for the lodgers to let themselves in.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not one of the lodgers come in and have the door open - A. It might happen so, but I do not know it. When the patrol gave me the alarm he had the prisoner in his possession. There had been no force at all used to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the house did that carpet belong to - A. My own parlour; the carpet was taken up and moved in the yard, at the back of the house, to have it swept before I put it on the parlour again; no person could have got to the back yard without coming through the house.</p>
               <p>- SAUNDERS. I stopped the prisoner; I had a suspicion that she had stolen the carpet. I first saw her in Archer-street, about a yard from Mrs. Costello's door. I brought her back, and knocked at the door. Mrs. Costello claimed the carpet as soon as she saw it. This is the carpet.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. It is my carpet; it is worth twenty shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I found the carpet and a shawl together in the street.</p>

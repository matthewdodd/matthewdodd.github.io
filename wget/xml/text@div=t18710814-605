                  </hi>. On 27th June I was in the employment of Mr. Ring, solicitor, of Worship Street—I went to the office about 9.30, and on the table I found this post card (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I know the prisoner's writing, and this is written by him—I have received several letters from him (<hi rend="italic">Read:—</hi>

               <p>"26/6/'71. 5, New Ormond Street, W.C.—If you and Ring do not pay the balance, we will seize again any furniture on the premises, at any time, not minding which of the two claims the goods. You will be a loser by it, and if there is not enough to pay the balance, we know what to do. We see, like the judge, what kind of people we have got to deal with. We give you only one day to consider.") Then it is endorsed—"Ring is accustomed to that sort of game in Gresham Buildings. He assists Benham in the same way. His name is on the door, jointly with Benham, to plunder all the tradesmen in the neighbourhood." That is addressed to "Mr. Lazarus, Worship Street, E.C."—I received that in the same state as it now is—I had had some wine through the prisoner's agent, about eighteen months ago, and there was a dispute about it—when I received the card I had been in Mr. Ring's service about two months—to my knowledge Mr. Ring has never seen the prisoner.</p>

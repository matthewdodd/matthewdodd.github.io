                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable P</hi> 236.) On the 18th of September, I was watching, at a quarter before eight o'clock, at the Greyhound public-house, Clapham-road—Osgood, who has been convicted, drove up in a horse and cart—he got out, put the nose-bag on the horse, and then opened the door at the back of the cart, and this prisoner pulled out a bundle of hay, about 46lbs. weight—he took it into the stable, followed by Osgood and another man, carrying a sack with some corn in it, which had also been taken from the cart—I followed them, and saw the prisoner throw the hay under a stair-case in the stable—I took him into custody—he struggled violently and got from me—he seized a pitch-fork, made a thrust at me, and said, "D—n your eyes, now come on, I will not be taken"—he got away then, but on a subsequent occasion I took him—he refused to go till I told him the charge, and he resisted very much—I called two brother officers, and he was taken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was called to give the horse some water, and while I was doing that, another man took the corn—I took the hay, but I did not know it had been stolen—the other officer told him to knock the b—r down. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. No; my brother officer said, "Knock him down," which I should have done—but I could not get at him for the fork.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk to Mr. Lewis, the attorney. I was present at the trial of Skelton, who was ostler and occupier of this stable—it was sworn on the trial, by the policeman, that he directed three per<lb></lb>sons to take the hay into his stable, as they supposed Osgood would re<lb></lb>turn from town there to feed his horses—I have seen the stable, and the place in which this hay was thrown is not an improper place to put it into—Skelton was acquitted, and it appeared that this prisoner is one who hangs about as a cad, to get a shilling of any passengers who call there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am master of a brig. On the 13th of Oct., at nine o'clock at night, I was on Tower-hill—the prisoner came up to me, and asked me to give her a penny to get her a drop of beer—I said I had not got one—she knocked at my pockets, and said, "You have got plenty"—I said, "I have not"—she said, "I know you have"—I had a bag full of things slung over my shoulder—I put my hand into my trowsers' pocket, and gave her 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she had her arm round my neck, over my right shoulder—I had a canvas bag, containing twenty sovereigns, in my right trowsers' pocket—I had had them in my hand when I felt for the penny—I had no button to that pocket—after I had given the prisoner 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., another woman came up and asked for one—I told her to go about her business, and she went off—the prisoner was by me at that time, and said, "I shall go off about my business, and leave you to talk with my partner"—I said, "I want no talk with your partner, nor you either"—they then went away—the other woman never touched me—I had not gone above forty yards when I missed my twenty sovereigns—I went back and met a policeman, and about eleven that night saw the prisoner at the station—the inspector asked me whether she was the girl that robbed me, and I said yes—she denied it, and said she had not been on the hill that night—I am certain she is the woman—I had never seen her before—I know her by her speech and her dress—she was with me about two minutes—I spoke to no other women but those two—I have never found my bag or money.</p>

I went to the prosecutor's for half a quartern of bread; I gave a sixpence, and she returned the change; at night I went for two half loaves; I paid for the bread, and Mrs. Peacock's son came across to me with a bad sixpence, and said, "How many more have you got of these?" I said, "I don't know what you mean, if it is bad I was not aware of it;" with that he gave me in charge; I have dealt with these people about nine months; I am a widow, and the mother of fifteen children, and now I have nine living; in all my life I was never accused before.</p>

               <p>On the 27th of February I went out in the morning to my labour, my wife went out before me, she returned home about nine o'clock, and stopped at home about half an hour; I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290041"></xptr>out between five and six, she returned to me and brings me the key, and I came home about six in the evening, and I found the door open, and the window open, this was after she came home in the morning; she had locked up the place and brought me the key; it appeared to me as if the door and window was forced open; the prisoner at the bar came to my house about three nights before, and asked me if I was not afraid of having my house broke open? I knew her before, she is a <rs id="t17930529-21-deflabel111" type="occupation">servant</rs>

I think they had need bring something into my house instead of taking any thing out; she makes answer, Lord, Francis, I should be afraid of having it broke open; I lost an handkerchief, an apron and a pair of red gloves; the value of them altogether is ten shillings; the prisoner took them to a pawnbroker's to pawn; I have heard of it.</p>

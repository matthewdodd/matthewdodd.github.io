I am a bricklayer of 14, Ann's-place, Bethnal-green—on 13th March about half-past 12 at night I was in Boundary-street with Thomas Carrington, and met my wife and brother—as we went along I saw the prisoner standing on the step of a door—he said: "Oh, you are the b—r, are you!" and stabbed me in the neck directly—I saw a knife in his hand—I lost a great deal of blood and staggered up against the wall—Carrington went to the door to see what was the matter, and got stabbed through the nose immediately—I cannot swear positively who stabbed him, but I saw the party who stabbed me on the step of the door—he did not go from the place—I saw him stab Carrington through the nose and I saw the knife.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 5, Camden's-head-gardens, Bethnal-green-road—on the night this occurred I was standing in my father's shop, nearly directly opposite No. 3, and I heard the cries of "Murder" about a quarter-past 12 o'clock—I ran out to see what was the matter, and saw two or three persons collected round the door of No. 3—I crossed over, and saw three men in the passage, and a woman—the prisoner was down in the corner, and two of the witnesses were striking at him, or over him—I pulled the woman out of the passage away from one of the witnesses—I took the prosecutor by the arm, and pulled him away, and he ran down the steps—I did not know that any one was stabbed until I came outside, for I heard no complaint in the passage of any one being stabbed, neither did I see any knife; afterwards I saw two of them bleeding—I saw one of those two in the passage striking at the prisoner—I did not observe that he was bleeding then; it was five minutes afterwards that I saw it, when the men ran out of the passage—I remained in the passage with the prisoner—I did not know at that time that any one was stabbed—I said to him, "You had better shut the door, and have no more bother"—he shut the door, and I came outside, and then I saw the men that had been stabbed, and not before—when I first went up, I suppose there were six or seven people there.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 2 1/2, Boundary-street—on the night in question I saw a party of men come up; there might have been a half-a-dozen or ten—they came up to Mr. Feurdery's door—I saw Fourdery sitting on the step of the door—I did not know the prisoner; it was dark—Fourdery was talking to somebody; I could not tell who it was—I saw the party come up, and one of them said, "<hi rend="italic">Bill,</hi> this is the b—r that hit me;" the other said, "Is it? the Lord thunder me blind, then, we will kill him;" and they rushed into the passage—I could not see into the passage; it was so dark—I shut my shutters and came to the door, and I saw one come tumbling down the steps—he got up and came on again—a few minutes afterwards they came out, and one said, "I am stabbed;" and another one said, "So am I"—I did not see any knife—I do not know the prisoner at all—I do not know which of the persons it was that used this language; there were so many of them—I could not swear to any of them.</p>

Q.</hi> Cannot you tell who were the two that you afterwards found bleeding? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, those two (<hi rend="italic">Carrington and Geary</hi>), I am not quite sure, it was not the prisoner who called out, "We will kill them," I will not wear it was not—I heard somebody call it out, and afterwards found these two men bleeding.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Bamberger, a shoe manufacturer, of King-Street, Snow-Hill—the prisoner has been in our employ for nearly two years and-a-half—he has always borne the character of a peaceable well-conducted young man, always ready to do a kindness, and never quarrel-some—I never knew of his carrying a knife, indeed, I have censured him for not doing so, because in our business a knife is requisite, a pocket-knife especially—he has often borrowed one of me, and I have said to him, "Why don't you carry one yourself?"—only a fortnight before this occurrence I lent him one, and he lost it for me, but I found it again, he had mislaid it in our warehouse.</p>

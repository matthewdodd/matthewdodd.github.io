                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable H</hi> 194.) I was on duty in Church-street, Shoreditch, about ten minutes past one, on the morning of the 22nd of September, I heard the sound of a rattle, which led me to Nichol-row—I there saw the deceased James Carroll—he was a police-constable of the division, No. 160—he had hold of a man there, who was struggling with him to get away—I also laid hold of the man—there were about a dozen people there—Carroll and I took the man some distance—he was very riotous—when we got to the Knave-of-Clubs public-house, in Club-row, we saw the prisoner—he came up to us, laid hold of me and Carroll by the collar, and said, "You b—s, you shall not take him; you shall let him go"—I told him we should not till, we got him to the station—he said he had done nothing—I said, if he could persuade the Inspector, when be got to the station, he should be let go, but that he should come to the station first—Smedley said, "You shall not take him; I had once three months for knocking a fly off a policeman's nose, and I can do it again"—I then saw his arm move, and he struck Carroll about the left ear—Carroll stag<lb></lb>gered and fell—I immediately drew my staff, and said, if he struck me or my brother officer again I should break his arm—he then struck me ofter the left eye—Carroll got up again, and we both laid hold of our prisoner again—we were both knocked down, and the man we had hold of rescued from us by Smedley and the mob—I told Carroll, if we could not haw our prisoner, we would have the man that rescued him from us—Smedley upon that ran away—Carroll and I ran after him up Club-row into Church-street, and into Turville-street—we stopped him there—he stood in a fighting attitude before us—we closed in upon him, and he again knocked Carroll down—I then laid hold of Smedley—he twisted from me with the assistance of the mob, and ran up Turville-street, towards Church-street—we</p>

               <p>followed, and the mob too—we sprang our rattles all the way—when he got to Church-street, at the top of Turville-street, he turned hack again, and we stopped him in Turville-street again—we laid hold of him—the mob bad increased by that time, and the general cry among the mob was, "Murder the b—s," don't let them take any body"—we went down Old Nichol-street with Smedley into Nichol-row, and be again knocked Carroll down—I took hold of him—my brother officer, Ffelan, came up to oar assistance—I told him Smedley was the man we wanted—he and Carroll laid hold of Smedley, and I got behind, with my staff drawn, to keep the mob back—Carroll let go of Smedley, and laid hold of another man over Ffelan's shoulder—Smedley then struck him several times—I cannot say where—Carroll crossed off the footpath into the road to avoid the blows which Smedley made at him—I saw Carroll fall again—I ran to his assistance, to take the man he had hold of, and before I got up the man had got up from Carroll, and was running away—I followed him up Church-street, and into Little Anchor-street, and being exhausted I stopped—the man I was following then threw Carroll's staff at me, and got away—I did not pick it up—it was found after the affray was all over—I went to turn back, and found Carroll with a man, having hold of him—he was bleeding—I spoke to him—he made no answer—I called a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> which was standing by, put him in, took him to the station, and afterwards to the London Hospital—he died on the Saturday, as this happened between the Tuesday night and Wednesday morning—I assisted in taking Smedley to the station, and saw him afterwards—he appeared to me to have been drinking, but was sober enough to know what he was doing—his conduct was very violent.</p>

                  </hi>. I lived in Gloucester-street, Hoxton—I was out in the middle of the night of the 22nd of September, a little after one o'clock—I was going home—whilst going along High-street, Shoreditch, I beard the sound of rattles, and went up Church-street as far as Nichol-row—I there saw two or three policemen—I saw one knocked down just as I came up—I saw a man in a dark-sleeved waistcoat, who I believe to be the prisoner—Carroll let go of him, and another policeman took hold of him—the prisoner turned round, struck Carroll with his fist, and he fell—his hat fell off—as he was getting up he endeavoured to pick his hat up, and the prisoner kicked him, made use of an oath, and swore he would <hi rend="italic">do for</hi> him—Carroll said, "O God, you have broken my jaw"—he was picked up, and the blood was streaming from the left side of his eye—I believe the prisoner to be the man that kicked him—I was very close to him—there was a gas-light at the corner of the row—it was not moonlight—I should say about five minutes elapsed between Carroll's being knocked down and king put into the cod—about twenty or thirty people were assembled at that time—they were coming up at the time—the rattles were constantly springing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am waiter at the Dolphin public-house, in Church-street, Bethnal-green. I saw the deceased Carroll in the London-hospital after he was dead—on the morning of the 22nd of September I heard rattles sprung—I went down Turville-street, along Nichol-street, to the corner of Nichol-row, where I saw Smedley in custody with two or three policemen—his back was against the brick wall—I saw Carroll throw the light of his lantern on the mob, and then collar a man—the man said, "What have you collared me for? I have done nothing, I am innocent"—they got up against a water-spout by a gate belonging to an undertaker—the man caught hold of the water-spout—the policeman snatched him away, and he fell to the ground—the policeman lifted him up from the ground with his left hand—his staff was in his right—the man said, "Don't ill-use me, if I am to go to the station, I will be quiet"—as soon as he said that, I saw a man snatch the staff out of Carroll's hand, and strike him with it over the left eye—he fell to the ground directly, and the man ran away—I did not perceive that he had the staff with him when he ran away—when the man struck the policeman, the prisoner was about six or eight yards from the spot, in custody of other policemen, and continued there—Carroll fell as soon as he was struck with the staff—I helped to lift him up, and he was put into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he was insensible.</p>

            . I am a police officer. On the evening of Sunday, the 18th of February, about seven o'clock as near as can be, I was in the West India Docks, and saw the prisoner coming up the Export Dock, coming up towards the entrance that leads to go out; on his coming up, he said, was he too late or was the door shut; I said the door is not shut, but it is gone seven o'clock; as he came near, he seemed to be very bulky, and I crossed over, and stopped him; I asked him what he had concealed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030018"></xptr>round him, and he said, nothing, at first. Then I got hold of him by the collar, and said, you must have something here, and then he said, he had got some shirts. I asked him to let me see them, and on unbuttoning his jacket, he burst a string, which confined something round him; I heard the string burst, and he pulled a piece of cotton and linen check from under his jacket, I asked him what ship he had come from with it, and he said, he had come from the Gartland; she was then lying in the Export Dock. I asked him if the mate of the Gartland knew that he had taken that out of the ship; he said, no, he did not; but there was a man in the Gartland that knew it. I asked him if he belonged to the Gartland, and he said, he did not. What ship do you belong to then, said I? he said, no ship at present in the Dock; but he belonged to the Porthumous, and that he had left her, and took this piece of check out of her on Saturday morning, and put it on board the Gartland, along with a friend of his, if he could get an opportunity of getting it away. I then took him over to our night box; then there were three officers more sitting down in the box, and I called them out, and put him in, and searched him, and found nothing more. An officer of the name of Winnel, asked him what ship he had taken it from, and he said, the Posthumous. We then took him to the watchhouse, and then Winnel and I went to the Gartland, and there saw Larkin, the ship's steward. I received from him three more parcels.</p>

I had received them from the prisoner Flowers; I received four at first; the fourth the prisoner had taken away that evening; the piece the officers stopped him with I believe was the fourth; he brought the four to me on Saturday, the 17th, in the morning at about six or seven o'clock; the time he brought then the Porthumous was lying in the West India Docks; I knew he belonged to her. She left the Docks in the course of that day. I don't know whether the prisoner went with her or not; he told me he left her at Gravesend.</p>

            . I keep a lodging-house, in Blackwall. The prisoner at the bat lodged with me one week. On Monday, the 19th, Mr. Gotty came and found some things at my house; those things were partly brought up in the room where I lie myself; the prisoner Flowers had brought them there; he had no chest at my house, so he delivered them into my care; he brought them in two parcels, tied up in his own handkerchief, and having no chest at my house, gave them me to take care of. When he brought them, he turned them out of his own handkerchief on the table where I was working; he told me to put them by; that they belonged to a man who gave them to him to dispose of them for him when he got clear of the ship. I knew to what ship he belonged. I knew when that ship went down the River; he belonged to the Portbumous, and he told me he went down the River with her on the Saturday; he came back from the ship on Sunday, and was taken into custody that same evening I believe; he told me he belonged to the Porthumous; but said he was not going out in h he had got his things on shore! He did not name the person to whom he had disposed of any of these things. He said his friend was on board the Gartland, and he said he was to see him for something very particular that evening, Sunday. He brought these things, one parcel on the Wednesday night, and another parcel on another night; but he brought the two parcels running on the Saturday. He came from the Porthumous on the Saturday; she was in the Basin; he brought two pieces of na een on the Saturday; he brought both when the Porthumous was lying in the Docks.</p>

            . I am clerk to Darby and Davis, in King-street, Cheapside; they are warehouse men. In the month of January last, we furnished the house of Higgin and Whiteby with a quantity of goods, of which these are parts. I have examined them at the Thames Police office; the name of Darby and Davis on them are my own hand-writing. Those three pieces in brown paper are nearly in the same state as when I packed them. I look at those handkerchiefs, which are romotl's handkerchiefs, it is a term given to them; there is something very particular in some of the patterns, it is a red mark.</p>

               <p>JURY. Was any more of that pattern ever made for any other house - A. That I don't know. We had five dozen made for us; one piece of these four is not in papers; that is the one found on the prisoner; it corresponds with the other three.</p>

               <p>MR. GURNEY. Have you any doubt that those are part of the goods sold to Higgin and Whiteby - A. No doubt whatever.</p>

            . I am wharfinger at the West India Docks. On the 10th of February I received the goods specified in that receipt; the package was put on board, the Porthumous on the 13th; I I kept them in the warehouse under lock and key until they were put on board.</p>

               <p>JOHN WALTER. In February, I was mate to the Porthumous. On the 13th of February; I received a trunk on board; it was matted and regulary packed; it was deposited in the gun-room. The prisoner was a seaman on board that ship; the ship left the Dock at three o'clock in the afternoon, and she arrived at Gravesend on the Sunday morning. The prisoner went down in the ship as one of the seamen, and he left her in Gravesend; he was to have gone the voyage with us. He told me he was going up for his things, for he had not got them on board. On Monday, the 19th, Mr Butler came on board, he was one of our owners; by his desire, we fetched up this trunk, and examined it; it appeared not to be in the same state as when it came on board the ship; it appeared to have been opened, that was very easy to be seen. We then opened it; we found some swabbs and books in it; books belonging to it; the swabbs were swabbs belonging to the ship.</p>

               <p>MR. BUTLER. I know nothing more than the examination of the trunk, and finding it in the state the last witness has described.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. On the part of the prisoner, took an objection, as to whether a vessel in the West India Docks was entitled to that protection which would be offered to a vessel in the River Thames, by its being a capital offence to steal to the amount of forty shillings on board her; and, whether the West India Docks could be considered belonging to the said Navigable River, any more than any other pond or place watered by the Thames.</p>

               <p>THE COURT. However over-ruled the objection, on the ground that the West India Docks were apart of the Port of London.</p>

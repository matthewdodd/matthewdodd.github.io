On the 18th of July, ten minutes before nine o'clock in the morning, I went out, having double-locked the room door; I shut the street-door after me, and left the prisoner in the house-the owner of the house, who is his uncle, gave him leave to sleep in one of the empty rooms. About two o'clock the constable came for me, I came home, went up stairs, and found my room door broken open-Slack, the constable, had been up before; the screws were forced, and the box of the lock forced back; I looked into my boxes and cupboard, all the things were turned over, and the articles stated in the indictment gone. I saw them all again at Worship-street, except the money. The prisoner was not in the house when I returned - He had only been two nights in the house.</p>

            . I am a headborough of Clerkenwell. On the 18th of July I saw the prisoner at the end of Rawstorne-street, opposite Islington-road, he was reading a duplicate; knowing him before, I watched him, and saw him go into a shop and buy some ham and bread, he came out, eat some of it, and threw the rest in the kennel, he then went and laid down on the steps of a door; I went up and asked him if he was out of work, he said, "Yes." I told him there was plenty of hay-making; he said he could get nothing to do. I asked him how long he had been out of work; he said, a great while, and that his uncle, who lived in Whitecross-street, kept him - He then said he lived in Coleman-street. I asked him if had a duplicate about him, he said, No; I said he had one; he said he had not, for he had given it to a boy named Gunn. I told him no boy had been with him since I saw him reading it, and that he had it about him; he said if he had it was nothing to me, I had no business with it; I pulled out my staff, and shewed it to him; he then said he had torn it and thrown it away - I told him to shew me where he threw it, he said he would when the crowd were gone; he took me to the place, where I found the duplicate torn in pieces; I endeavoured to collect them, but could only make out that it was something pledged for two shillings, and asked him what it was - He said it was a pair of gaiters. I told him he must go with me, and asked him if he pledged them, he said, No; I then asked him who did, he said a boy. I told him to come with me to the King's Arms public-house, in Rawstorne-street - as we went along he said he had seven pence, which he would give me to let him go. I searched him, and found a row of beads, a gold ring, an hymn book, and 7s. 2d. in money; I left him with Morgan while I took some more boys into custody, who were by; I was absent about half an hour, and when I returned he told me it was not a pair of gaiters that were pledged but a gown, which was pledged at Mrs. Nichols's, near Finsbury-square - I went there, produced the pieces of the duplicate, and got the gown; as I was taking him to the office, he said he had broken into a young woman's room, which she rented in his uncle's house, and took the property out; he then took a pocket-book out of his hat, and said, you may as well take this, as it cannot be worse than it is. I went to the prosecutrix's house about half-past two o'clock, found the outer door open, and went up to her room with a little girl who lived near, and found the screws of the lock quite wrenched from the woodwork-the box of the lock was quite loose. I saw the prosecutrix about three o'clock,she was not at home when I first went.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Clerkenwell. On the 18th of July Slack left the prisoner in my charge, at the King's Arms in Rawstorne-street; he said they were not gaiters that he had pledged, but a gown - I said nothing to induce him to confess. I saw from the broken pieces of the duplicate that were found where the gown was pledged-it was at Mrs. Nicholls's; he said it was near Finsbury-square.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, L</hi> 196). On Wednesday night, 19th Nor., about half-past 5 o'clock, I was in Princes-street, Lambeth, watching Bennett's shop. I was not in uniform—I saw Miller come up, and go into Bennett's shop—he came out again—Powell went past Bennett's with a truck, and Miller went and fetched him back—it stopped at Bennett's shop—there were four scaffolding boards on the top of the truck—Powell took them off, and then took the lead out, and took it into Bennett's shop, and Bennett weighed it—Miller was in the shop—I stood at the door, and saw it weighed—I heard Bennett say, "There is one quarter and six pounds"—they then all three came out together, and went into the public house next door—after some time they all came out together—Bennett went into his own shop, and Powell and Miller took the truck away—I followed them to Vauxhall-road, and took them—they told me they got the lead from where they had worked that day—I asked them where they had</p>

               <p>worked, and they refused to tell me—after I had taken them into custody, I went back to Bennett's shop, and told him I wanted that lead that he had just bought—he said that he had not bought any lead that day—I told him I wan an officer, and I saw it come there—he again said that he had not bought any lead—I called in an officer who was in uniform, and Bennett denied it then—I said, "It is no use denying it, it is behind the counter," and with some hesitation be let us go behind the counter, where I fonnd the thirty-four pounds of lead—I have since examined Mr. Hearn's yard, and found it had been taken from there—I have fitted it, and it fits exactly.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer: About a quarter past two, on Tuesday, the 7th of this month, I saw the prisoner coming out of his master's shop, and, about fifty or sixty yards from it, I stopped him; he had this bag in his left hand, in which there was twelve pair of men's shoes, six pair of women's shoes, and six pair of boy's shoes; I took them back to the prosecutor, and, on the Wednesday, they were taken before the Lord-Mayor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You are a City constable? - A. Yes; and have been so seventeen years.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you been indicted? - A. Never; I deny the asstertion; nobody can say that of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been under any charge before the Lord-Mayor, or Aldermen? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what this man is charged with at present? - A. With felony.</p>

               <p>Q. Of what sort? - A. With a capital offence, of it is proved, as far as I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the indictment read against him? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he charged with? - A. With stealing a dozen pair of shoes, and three seven-shilling pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear it read? - A. I did not particularly attend to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know it is confined to shoes? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You know he carries out his master's shoes? - A. Yes; I have frequently seen him going home with work.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not see his master by him at the time he took the shoes out of the shop? - A. No, I did not.(The women's shoes identified.)</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. White. ) Had you given him any orders to take those shoes? - A. No; he had no power to take out shoes without orders from Mrs. White, or me; whether she gave him orders, or not, I cannot tell; I saw him go out with them.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to suffer him to go by you with them? - A.Because I had an officer to secure him.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Were you in a situation that he could see you? - A. Yes; I was not above a yard from the door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave my defence of my Counsel.</p>
               <p>Jury. (To Mr. White.) Q. Did you see the shoes collected together? - A. I did not see him collecting them together, but I saw the bag full concealed in his bed, before he took them out, and I missed the shoes out of their different places.</p>

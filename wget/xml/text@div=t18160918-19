               <p>GAYTON MANSFIELD. On the 6th of August last I was <rs id="t18160918-19-viclabel111" type="occupation">coachman</rs>

               <p>Q. What do you know of him - A. About six o'clock in the evening of the 6th of August, I went out to exercise one of my horses, and when I came back, my young mistress was waiting to go out riding with the poney. I went into the stable and took off my coat, and took it into the harness room; the harness room is part of the stable, and the stable joins the rest of the house; kitchen, stable, and all join together. I went into the harness room, and brought out a coat like this. As I was coming out of the harness room, there was a man behind the door; he came from behind the door, and said I thought it was your master, and I said my man what do you do here; it was the prisoner. I asked him his business, and he said he had no business; and I said why do you come here? this was about six o'clock in the evening; and I turned him out; then he said that the footman wanted to buy a ferret, and I said I was sure the footman wanted no ferret. At last I turned him out; I left my great coat in the harness room, and locked the harness room door, and put the key in my pocket; the stable door was left open the first time he came. I went out the last time, I shut the stable door, but did not lock it. Then I went out with my young mistress as far as Tottenham High Cross; my master's house is at Edmonton; I was out about half an hour altogether. When I was coming back with my young mistress, I saw the prisoner at the bar about a quarter of a mile from my master's house; I saw him with a long coat on, drawing on the ground; I thought it was mine. When he saw me he turned up a lane, and when I got up opposite the lane, I got off my horse, and went an I examined the coat. I laid hold of him, and the great coat, and knew it to be mine; it was the same I hung up in the harness room. I said my man, you have got my coat, he said he had not; I examined him and said, you have not got mine only, but you have got two of my fellow servants also. He had got three coats over his own. I asked him how he came by them, and he said the footman gave them to him. I took him by the collar, and led him to my master's house; there was one coat a livery, it was a coat belonging to a former footman: I called the great coat mine; my master gave it me two years ago, so it was my property. We took the prisoner to Mr. Roberts the justice at Tottenham; there the coats were delivered to the constable, his name is Grinley.</p>

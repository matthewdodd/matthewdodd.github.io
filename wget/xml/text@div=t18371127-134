On the 21st of October a person came to my house, and took three or four other men into the tap-room to pay them, and wanted change—I believe the prisoner is the man—there is an alteration in him, and I will not undertake to swear to him positively—my niece was in the room at the time—she received the note from the hands of the man, and gave it to me—I asked him what address I should put on it, and he told me "John Stevens," which I immediately wrote in his presence, and the date—I should know the note again—I gave the same person change for two notes—he brought one first, and then came back with a second in five minutes—he had only gone into the tap-room—he said he had not sufficient change, and would I give him change for another—I carried the change of the two notes to him together, and gave it to him in the tap room, before all the men—I wrote his name on both notes—he did not give me any address—I wrote on both the notes, "John Stevens, navi<lb></lb>gator," but no place of abode—I took the notes up stairs to my wife, who was ill, and she looked out the change—I afterwards paid them away to the collector, and one was returned as bad—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it is one of those I received that day—I have heard nothing of the other.</p>

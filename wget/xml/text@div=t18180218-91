I took it to town-the prisoners overtook me in Drury-lane, before I got to No. 126 - I had seen them at the farm when they bought it. They asked me to stop a few minutes, as they were taking a cup of coffee - They asked me to have something to drink, and I went into a public-house with them, and we drank together. Bontein asked me if I had the receipt for the hay? I said I had. He asked me for it, and I gave it to him - He gave me a sealed letter. I asked him if that was the money? he said, "Give it to your mistress, it is all right." They told me to wait a few minutes - I waited outside the door. They came out and said I was to go with them down the street; I went some distance. Bontein delivered the hay to Crafer, who put it in the loft of the Peacock-yard, Clare-market. I never opened the letter. I thought the prisoners were brothers. I supposed the letter contained the money, or I should not have let them have the hay. Next day I went back, but could not see any of it. Walbank took me, and shewed me some of it. (Looks at a letter)-this is the letter he gave me (read)-</p>

I knew them before-Crafer is a butcher in Clare-market.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181802180035"></xptr>They said they had a load of hay to sell, and asked 5l. for it - I told them I thought it far too much, as I never gave above 4l. I went to the Peacock-yard, saw it, and offered them 4l. for it-they said they could not take it; Crafer said I should have it. I gave them 3l. 15s. for it. They were together at the time. Crafer shewed me a receipt; he said he shewed it to me to convince me that he had given 5l. for it, but it was not so good as he had bought it for. Bontein read the receipt to me, it was for 5l. - he said it came from Action. This was after I paid the money.</p>

               <p>MR. ALLEY, on behalf of the prisoners, contended, that this was not a larceny; that the possession of the hay was parted with, and the witness (Mrs. Medley) had entered it in her book, and that it was only a fraud.</p>
               <p>MESSRS. CURWOOD, ANDREWS, and ARARIN argued, that from the beginning to end it appeared that it was the prisoners' intent to defrand the prosecutor, and that the possession was never parted with.</p>

               <p>PATRICK CULTON. I am a watchman. I took the prisoner between three and four in the morning, on the 11th of May, in Drury-lane; he had these cushions, harness, and two bridles; I stopped him with all the things; he said he was going to take a Marl coach at half past three. I told him he must go to the watchhouse first.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I can wear to the harness, and the cushions belong to my own gig; the bridles are so mutilated I can hardly speak to them.</p>

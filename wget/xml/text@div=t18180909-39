            . I am shepherd to Mr. Newman. I saw the sheep all safe on Friday, the 28th of August, at eight o'clock at night; at six o'clock the next morning, I found one of them killed in the fold-it was alive overnight. One of the shoulders, and the hind-quarters were gone-the rest was left in the fold. I afterwards saw a hind-quarter, which appeared to be the same size; I cannot say whether it was part of my sheep or not.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BUCKLAND. I was by when the hind-quarters were found in the basket, it was compared in my presence-Haines was there; from circumstances it appeared evident that it was part of the sheep. In taking the skin off the sheep, part of it was left on the leg; the hole in the skin corresponded exactly with that part. The tail was also cut in a very particular manner, which also corresponded. I have no doubt of it being part of the same sheep; these were the two hind-quarters. When I took them, they were eating mutton, which appeared to be a shoulder. In going from Cranford to Ditton-green, Harlington would be very little out of the way.</p>
               <p>THOMAS MONTAGUE. I am a constable. I saw the prisoners eating a shoulder of mutton. I saw the hind-quarters compared with the rest of the sheep, they fitted exactly. The prisoners said they found the mutton.</p>
               <p>JAMES HAINES re-examined. I saw both the hind-quarters compared with the sheep; part of the skin was left on the leg; the same part was missing from the corresponding part, and belonged to the other part.</p>

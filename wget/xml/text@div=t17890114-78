It was a hare-skin muff, lined with silk; I had no opportunity of seeing the man that did it; it was very sudden indeed; I do not suppose it was a moment; he took it out of my hand, and ran down the court; he was on the left hand. An acquaintance of mine, a young woman that was with me, cried out, stop thief! and the prisoner was taken. It was not five minutes, before I saw a man, and the muff and the tippet again.

               <p>I live in Dunning's-alley, Bishopsgate-street. Last Saturday night, between six seven, I heard the cry of stop thief, and I ran out of the door, and faced the prisoner; he was running past my door; I stopped him, and I took the tippet from him; and I was not master enough for him: he chucked the muff into my arms, and I catched it; I kept close to him, running after him till he came into the broad way of Bishopsgate-street, and a young man faced him and caught him in his arms, and we delivered him to the patroles. I was not above half a yard off when he was caught.</p>
               <p>From the time that he chucked the muff to you, was he out of your sight? - No; he was not half a yard from me; I had all but hold of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. First, he says, he met me; but before my Lord Mayor, he said he pursued me; another thing, he never mentioned a word about tippet before my Lord Mayor; he said that the bundle was chucked at him; next, he is a person of that character; and I have sent for persons to prove, that I am not the first that he has been witness against; and the woman that he lived with has been transported. I hope the court will take it into consideration, that I stand on my life; not only that, but he has bought stolen goods.</p>
               <p>When was the prisoner taken, and in what manner? - He was taken in Bishopsgate-street, just coming on to the kerbstone from Dunning's-alley, at the corner almost of Angel-alley.</p>

He was running, and I clasped my hands round him; I laid hold of him on the one side, and the Jew on the other, and we delivered him to

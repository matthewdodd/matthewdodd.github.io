Mr. Sparks, whom I was shaving, has got the things, and was to have been here as an evidence, but he is engag'd at this time; the prisoner fell on her knees, and ask'd me to forgive her; I ask'd her how she could go up into other people's apartments in such a manner? she said it was necessity that drove her to it, she and her child wanting bread. She offer'd me a shilling for a dozen of beer to let her go, saying, her father was a very honest man in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were these things?</p>
               <p>Young. They were in a room above stairs; when I got up, the shoes stood in the window, the cloak and handkerchief were hanging behind the door.</p>

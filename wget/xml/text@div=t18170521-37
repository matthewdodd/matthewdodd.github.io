               <p>SECOND COUNT, The same, only stating them to be the property of a certain person unknown.</p>
               <p>JOHN MANNING. I live in Hatton-court, Saffron-hill, and was a watchman. On the 13th of February, a man charged another with taking his seals - I found them in the kennel; the man did not appear, and the prisoner was discharged-the magistrate told me to keep them. I kept the ring in my pocket-the prisoner slept in the same bed with me, and several others slept in the same room; in the morning when I got up, I found the prisoner was gone out, and the ring and seal gone also; some days after, from what I had heard, I opened the prisoner's box, and found the duplicate of them - I went to Mr. Hill's and found the seal.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. I am not a watchman now; I was discharged because I could not produce this ring and seal. I lost the seal, I never pledged it - I pledged the ring. I found the duplicate in the prisoner's box.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Hill, who is a pawnbroker. I have a gold seal and ring pledged for 2s. I remember Manning coming to enquire for it with the duplicate; I do not know who pledged them, but I know the prisoner's face. I do not know when I saw the prisoner, I remember seeing him at the shop as a customer; I do not know what he came there for.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. On your oath, on what occasion did he come to your shop - A. I think to pledge the seal-the ticket found in his box is ours.</p>

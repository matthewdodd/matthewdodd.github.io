                  </hi>. I am clerk to Fisher and Robinson, lace-manufacturers. On the 18th of November I was at the paid-window of the post-office, and somebody called out behind me—I felt my pocket, and missed my handkerchief, which I had used shortly before—I turned round, and saw it in the constable's hands—that now produced is it—I know it by the pattern.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer employed in the Post-office. On the 18th of November I saw the prisoner near the paid-window—there was a crowd of people in front of the window—I observed him pushing up, and as he had no letter in his hand, I watched him, saw his elbow move, and suspected he was at some gentleman's pocket—I pulled him out by the collar, put my hand under his jacket, and pulled out this handkerchief—I called out to know if any gentleman had lost his hand<lb></lb>kerchief—the prosecutor turned round and said, "I have"—he was in front of the window, and the prisoner close behind him—there were seven or eight persons there paying for letters—I am quite certain he had no letter—he said he had a letter, and I asked where it was going to, and where did he bring it from.</p>

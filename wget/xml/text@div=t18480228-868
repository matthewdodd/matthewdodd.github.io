                  </hi> I am waiter at the Cock Tavern, Fleet-street. The prisoner had been porter there five or six months—it is the dwelling-house of William Collett—I saw the money stated safe in a drawer there on Mon<lb></lb>day night, the 14th Feb., at half-past one o'clock—I missed it next morning when I came to business—the lock was apparently safe, but the money had been taken by a brocket having been removed—the prisoner absconded the same morning at eight, and on the next Thursday morning a letter arrived—it was not addressed to me—I do not know the prisoner's writing—no money has been found.</p>

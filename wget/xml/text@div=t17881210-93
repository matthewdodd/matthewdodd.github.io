            , officers of Excise, and John Owen, collector, came to me with three marines; I had received information in the morning of that day; I had given them previous notice of my intention; Owen went away immediately to get a waggon, and Williams, and Curtis, and myself, assisted by the marines, began to take the tubs out of the thicket, that we might have them in a convenient place for loading; when we had got them nearly all out, (I suppose there might be about twenty left in the thicket) there came a large gang, a large company of men; one in particular had his face blacked, some were armed with horse-pistols, others with a pocket-pistol, one with a blunderbuss, some with prongs and long sticks.</p>
               <p>Are you enabled to say nearly how many the number might consist of? - As near as I can guess, about thirty, but they were not all armed; I recollect one had his face blacked, and one bad a double barrel-gun.</p>
               <p>Did you perceive England, the defendant, at the bar, among the number of men? - I do not recollect that I did: when they advanced upon me, I desired them to desist; there was a gate between us; we laid the tubs against the gate which separates the road from the field; I was on one side of the gate, and this gang of men on the other; some of them presented their arms over the gate towards us, and the others drew off to the part where the tubs were, and sunbunded us; I persuaded them not to meddle or make with them; I told them that I know a great many of them, and that they would forfeit their lives, if they meddled with them; they swore; I threatened them; and the man who had his face blacked, whose name is

            , came and beat in the hand of one of the tubs with the heel of his shoe, and prevailed on the soldiers to drink; I desired them not, but I could not prevail on them, so the soldiers took a little of the brandy; after they had been there about ten minutes, there came two waggons, and the mob, the company of men, immediately began to load the waggons.</p>
               <p>Were those the waggons that Owen was to bring? - No, their own waggons; some of them formed themselves into a sort of line, and handed them one from the other, and some carried them in their hands; when they had got them all up in the waggons except about twelve, they consented to give us forty of them; and I asked them for a waggon to take them away, and they said we should not have one of their waggons, but they would let me have a cart.</p>
               <p>How many tubs might there be in all? - About two hundred; one of the men immediately went with me to a farmhouse and got a cart; I left Williams and Curtis with the tubs; I returned in about twenty minutes, then the waggons were gone, but the people were not doing any thing; one of the waggons was gone before I went for the cart: I saw England in the line long before that; the first time I took any notice of him was when he was lifting the tubs in the line.</p>
               <p>Was he amongst the men in this line, lifting the tubs from one another? - He was.</p>
               <p>Did you perceive, or take any notice of him at any time when you saw him in that situation? - No, I did not; I am sure he is the man; for when I went to the farmhouse with the cart, I accused him with it;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100076"></xptr>says he, I have a night to do what I please on my own gowned and I think I saw head about way to the farm-house.</p>
               <p>Then you have no doubt at all of the man? - I am sure it is the man.</p>
               <p>Did Williams and Curtis drink of this brandy when the cug was open? - I do not know; yes, Williams got very drunk, Curtis was very sober; when I was going away with the cart loaded, one of the soldiers was so drunk, he could not walk, and I was unwilling to leave him behind, and we lifted him on the cart, and we had a great struggle; and I tied him on with one of the things; and Williams was so drunk, and he lifted up his eyes, and I tied him on with the soldier, and I fastened him on, and the horse was not able to draw him, and I took him off and put him down; and one of the smugglers took him on his back, and ran away with him; and so I desired Curtis to take care of the man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd, prisoner's council. How long might you be about all this, from the time you first made your seizure? - I suppose it might be two hours or more; I cannot so well conceive of the time in such confusion.</p>
               <p>You did not see this man at first? - No.</p>
               <p>The first time you observed him, was lifting the tubs from one another? - Yes; they formed a line in the place.</p>
               <p>Was not that after you had agreed to take the forty tubs? - No; they never proposed giving us forty, till they were all loaded, except twelve.</p>
               <p>Did you see England there till after you made the agreement about the tubs? - Yes, long before that; he never spoke to me at all, nor I to him in my life, till I spoke to him at the farm-house.</p>
               <p>He was not there when the forty tubs were loaded? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Do you remember a woman going to strike you? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not England prevent the smugglers from beating and attacking you? - No, not in the least; if he did, he did it secretly; I am sure I am a stranger to any such thing.</p>
               <p>Had he any arms? - I did not see that he had any.</p>
               <p>How long had you been at the spot before you saw him? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>You must recollect; I mean from the time of the first seizure? - I suppose more than an hour before the mob came; I cannot tell exactly.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that? - I cannot tell exactly; we must be pretty near an hour before any of the mob came.</p>
               <p>How long after the mob came did you see England? - I suppose about twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>I think you say you told several of them that you knew them, and they were committing an offence against the laws? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You know several of them now? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How comes this man to be the only one against whom you gave information? - They are not yet taken.</p>
               <p>Have you ever seen them since? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have not you frequently seen them within the last two years? - Yes, many of them, but I knew I did not dare to touch them.</p>
               <p>How came the others not to be taken? - I hardly dared to look at them; I staid there at the hazard of my life; I did not fix upon England; it was not I that took him; I have been gone from the country above a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that you could not have taken many of the others in the same way you have taken England? - I</p>

               <p>Do not you know now that it was last September that this man was taken? - It was sometime about the last sessions.</p>
               <p>How long did you remain in that part of the country after this happened? - I suppose eight months.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen England between the time that the affair happened, and the time that you quitted that part of the country? - I had.</p>
               <p>At his own house? - I never was at his house in my life to my knowledge; I saw him at Salisbury market, and frequently about Salisbury.</p>
               <p>Did you know where he lived? - I knew he lived at Aldborough, but not particularly to the house; I knew his name.</p>
               <p>You saw him several times at Salisbury about his common ordinary business? - Yes, I saw him several times at Salisbury.</p>
               <p>You took away your forty tubs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>By agreement? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came you to compound? - We could not get the whole.</p>
               <p>Did you make a bargain with these smugglers to take forty, and that they should have the rest? - They forced us to do it.</p>
               <p>So that you thought if you could not make a seizure according to your duty, the next best thing was to make a bargain with the smugglers? - I did the best I could.</p>
               <p>When did you give information about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100079"></xptr>this? - That was not my business; I informed the collector immediately; I knew if I attempted to take any of them, I was liable to have my house pulled about my cars.</p>
               <p>Did you ever point them out? - Yes, I did to the collector; he informed the Board of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. I believe you was in Essex, when this man was apprehended? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had discharged your duty in informing the collector? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. When some of the people presented their arms at you, their guns, and blunderbusses, and pistol, and the other part drew off to the tubs, you did not at that time see England there at all? - I do not recollect I did; I had no personal knowledge of the man before; the first time that ever I took notice of him was when he was handing the tubs in the line.</p>
               <p>Then after you saw England there, there were no arms presented at any of you? - They had conquered us then; the arms were with some of the smuglers.</p>
               <p>When they took the tubs, and put them into the waggons, you were entering into a treaty and capitulation? - They had taken all up but twelve; then they consented to give the forty.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. Was not there for a long time a dispute whether you should have thirty or forty? - They would not consent to give us any at first.</p>
               <p>Did you ask any? - Yes, I intreated them a great many times not to take any away, but they would not.</p>

               <p>Did you ask them for any smaller number? - They made the proposal, they first proposed forty; that was the first consent they made.</p>
               <p>What proposal, and what conversation was there about dividing this between you; about their having one part and you another, before they consented to give you forty? - The agreement was among themselves; I consented to take forty, and if they had offered me but ten, I suppose I should have taken it, rather than have gone away without any.</p>
               <p>Then there had never been a word about their giving you thirty, upon oath? - Not that I know of, I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Why you recollect whether there was any bargaining or no? - There was no such bargain; it was among themselves, if they made any bargain, it was their own proposal.</p>
               <p>Then among you officers there was no bargaining that you should take less than the whole? - Not at all; we consented to take the forty; I was afraid they would not let us have the whole; there were six of us, and more than thirty of them.</p>
               <p>If they had a mind, they could have carried it all away? - They could if they would.</p>
               <p>There were several of them armed, and about forty against six? - Yes, they might very easily have carried away the whole if they chose it; the remainder of the forty, above the twelve, were unloaded out of the waggon; they sorted out some of the common liquor, and I objected to take it, but they said I should have that or none.</p>
               <p>As they could clearly have carried away the whole without your being able to give them any obstruction at all, how could you object to any thing they thought fit to give you, unless there had been some bargaining between you, that nothing more should be said; was there any thing of that sort upon your oath: you thought yourselves in a scrape; these men could murder you; did you, in order to get out of that scrape, and to get quit of these fellows, say if you will give us thirty tubs or forty tubs, we will part friends, and there shall be no more of this? - I did not say we would part friends; they proposed it, and we consented to take forty.</p>
               <p>Then after you had consented to this, you thought they were not using you fairly, in giving you common liquor, and you objected to it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner the possessor of that ground, as he said he had a right to do what<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100080"></xptr>he pleased on his own ground? - I do not know.</p>

               <p>Mr. Shepherd. Why these smugglers were very generous? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You told them you would have nothing to do with it, except you could get the whole? - Yes.</p>
               <p>But you took forty? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You said no, and took them? - Yes, but not to come to any capitulation.</p>
               <p>You had the tubs, and what they produced at the sale? - Yes, I suppose so; I never asked them for any, not ever heard any word pass that nothing more should be said, if they would give forty; that I swear.</p>
               <p>When did the Excise-office hear of this? - I do not know; it was not to get myself out of any charge; I was sent for to town, last September twelvemonth; we were before an attorney in Salisbury.</p>
               <p>How long was it before the smugglers came up, that you first saw England? - It might be five or ten minutes, I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Will you swear it was not half an hour? - I cannot pretend to swear, it may.</p>
               <p>Then you cannot tell whether it was five minutes, or half an hour? - I cannot say, we were all in confusion; the first I saw of him, he was moving the tubs.</p>

               <p>Was it not above half an hour after? - It may be about that time.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed; in his Sunday cloaths? - Very tightly.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. What are you? - A little farmer and butcher; I live in the parish of Aldborough.</p>
               <p>Do you remember whether you were at church or not on Christmas day, 1786? - Yes, I was at church, and received the sacrament there, at Aldborough church.</p>
               <p>Do you remember coming from church? - Yes; and I remember coming through my own ground; and when I came within a stone's cast of my own ground, I saw a parcel of people got together; and great disputes; a quantity of people, men, women, and children; when I came there, I saw Hiscott and Williams, whom I knew very well; and then I knew what was the matter I did not know Curtis.</p>
               <p>Did you see Mr. England there? - No, I do not remember that I saw him there; for I was not there but a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Did you see any thing of England that day? - I do not know that I saw him all the day.</p>
               <p>Did you make any observation what those officers were about? - I went to Mr. Hiscott, and asked him; and he said they could not agree concerning the tubs; and I asked him what agreement they wanted, and he said that he wanted forty tubs, and never no more should be said of the matter; that it should end there.</p>
               <p>What did they say to you first? - When I first came to Mr. Hiscott, I asked him how he did, and said, Sir, I am for this; says he, so am I; are you come with respect to these tubs; I said no, I am just come from church; it is our road: he said they would not come to an agreement about these tubs; and he said they wanted forty; and I went to the opposite party, that was against them, and said, gentlemen, here will be rioting; there were a parcel of women; they were got very rude; and I said there certainly will be mischief; you had better agree; you cannot blame the officers, they are in the king's business and immediately I went and told them of the consequence of these here things; they agreed to take forty tubs; and there was a sample lay on the ground, and I went home directly. Hiscott, and Williams, and Curtis were called together, and they all three agreed that nothing should be said of the matter, if forty were given; the smugglers were not willing to give more than thirty at first; I persuaded them to give all that they required; for I thought the consequence would be great, and mutiny would ensue.</p>
               <p>Who counted out the tubs? - I do not know; the officers stood at the same time to see that they had forty: as soon as it was settled, I said good morning to you, gentlemen, and I went home to dine with my wife and family; I was not there above a quarter of an hour; I know England very well; he is a dairy-man, and keeps cows; he has four children; he has been next door neighbour to me for twenty-four years; I knew him that while; I never knew but that he was always a very honest and industrious man; I never knew him guilty of any smuggling, nor never heard by any man that he had a bad character, or was a man of that sort; he was always an industrious man for honesty; I have had a deal of dealings with him myself.</p>
               <p>From the time that this transaction happened, where has he lived ever since? - There, in the same house; always attended the markets every day, except two days, then he had the misfortune to put his knee out; he was never in secret, he always was at market twice a-week with his butter and bacon.</p>
               <p>Was he lame in Christmas, 1786? - Yes, he was a little limping; he could not walk without a stick.</p>
               <p>Was this place in your way home from the church? - Yes, in the high-road; it was not two stones throw from the road; it is England's road from the church, and his road to the ground that he rents for his dairy; we can fling a stone.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100082"></xptr>Mr. Fielding. Cross-examination. When did you come to town? - Tuesday morning I sat out this day se'nnight for Salisbury, at four o'clock; I do not remember that I saw him that day, but I question but I might.</p>
               <p>Why did you say to Williams and Curtis, you were sorry for this? - Because I thought there would be mischief by the women being almost drunk; I was sorry to see there was such a riot; I was come from such a place of receiving the sacrament, I was coming into a very bad place.</p>
               <p>But you knew they had seized a parcel of goods, and were opposed by a parcel of smugglers? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you offer any assistance to them? - Hiscott asked me if I would go and ask them to come to their terms; he said he, did not like it; and I went and apprized them, and they come to the terms.</p>
               <p>In what manner were the people employed when you first came up; were they putting the cags into the waggons? - Oh, no, nobody meddled with the cags at that time.</p>
               <p>The waggons were there at that time? - There were some in the waggons, and some laid on the foot path.</p>
               <p>Were not they then in the very act of putting those cags into the waggons? - They were put into the waggons, I believe, except them on the ground; they took enough out of the waggon to make them forty; I staid till the forty tubs were put on a heap, and they agreed; and then I bid them a good morning, and went home.</p>
               <p>Do you know Mr. Bungay? - Yes; he was at church.</p>
               <p>But your next door neighbour you did not see? - We sit at a great distance, and then I staying behind, and he did not; that might be the case; I believe he might be at church.</p>
               <p>Court. All that were put into the waggons that you saw, were put into the waggons before you came up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And the bargain was not compleat, for you assisted in making this bargain? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. Did you see Williams? - Yes; he was as sober as I am at this very minute.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. What, was Williams sober? - He was as sober as any man in England.</p>
               <p>Did you see the marines there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How were they? - They were very sober; they told me the women got a cag, and beat in the head, and drank out of their shoes.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Was you an officer of Excise at this seizure? - Yes; we found a quantity of goods in an open copse; they were cags of brandy; then we removed them to a little distance, about two hundred yards; we came there about nine; it took us near an hour to remove them; we put them close against a gate; the smugglers came between ten and eleven; they said they would have the goods; they did not belong to us; we at first said they should not; this was about an hour before the waggons came; I do not know who fetched the waggons.</p>
               <p>Was you resisting when the waggons came? - Yes; he proposed to let us have a few, if we would accept of them; as near as I can guess, it was ten in the first place; there several propositions, so they came to fifteen, twenty, thirty; they were loading the waggons all the time, so we said we would not accept of one less than forty.</p>
               <p>Who said that? - Mr. Hiscott, and we all together; we said we would not accept of one less than forty; there were women by at the time of this conversation; the prisoner, I am sure was one; he tried to persuade them to give up the forty tubs, and Mr. Symonds was the other, he tried likewise, and at last they agreed to give us forty tubs; and we said that then they should carry them safe home to the Excise-office; the defendant went away with Mr. Hiscott to borrow a cart; they did borrow one, and the defendant helped me in particular to load the forty tubs into the cart:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100083"></xptr>the defendant had the same clotahs on then he has now.</p>
               <p>At the time the smugglers first came up, was the defendant there, or was he not? - I never saw the the defendant till about twelve, or a little after, not to take any notice of him; that was more than half an hour after the smugglers came up.</p>
               <p>Had he any man with him? - Nothing, but a little stick, about the size of mine.</p>
               <p>Did he attack or abuse the officers in any way? - Not in the least. There was a woman going to strike me, and going to strip to fight me; the defendant took hold of her, and persuaded her to be quiet, and put her on one side.</p>
               <p>Then you say he did nothing at all to hurt any body, or to abuse the officers? - Nothing at all, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Cross-examination. You knew the prisoner before, I take it for granted? - I had seen him before, several times, in the market.</p>
               <p>You are quite sure of your man? - Yes, yes.</p>
               <p>You are quite sure he was the man who endeavoured to persuade them to give you up the 40 s.? - Yes, he and Symonds in particular; and there was another man: they did that as soon as I saw them.</p>
               <p>Did you see which way Symonds and the prisoner came? - No, Sir, I did not take any notice till they began to interfere; I do not know whether they came up together.</p>
               <p>It was a very fatiguing day to you, Mr. Williams; you could not walk home? - Yes, it was. I fell down.</p>
               <p>I believe the marines had some hard service? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You and the marines had such hard service that you were very much fatigued? - We had a good deal of trouble in removing the tubs.</p>
               <p>Who was put up into the cart? - I never saw any body put up on the cart.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, you was not put up on the cart? Come, now, with this hard service of yours, - I was not put on the cart.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to deny that the marine was put on the cart? - I cannot say, because, after I fell down, I could not go any further.</p>
               <p>There was nothing to drink; you did not drink? - Yes, I did; I drank twice.</p>
               <p>You drank by word of mouth? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What liquor might you have? - It was brandy.</p>
               <p>You took two hearty sucks at it? - Not very hearty.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner was the man that came up with Symonds? - Came up with him! I never took any notice of him, till he interfered. I saw Symonds in one place interfering, and the defendant in another. Sometimes they were passing each other; sometimes very near to each other.</p>
               <p>Near enough for near neighbours to know that each other were there? - I should imagine so. The prisoner did not go away with Symonds; Symonds went away directly, as soon as the matter was settled. The prisoner went away with Hiscott, to borrow the cart. I saw the line of tubs formed: I did not see the prisoner at that time.</p>
               <p>Who took you up, like any other drunken log, and carried you away on his back? - I cannot remember. I believe Curtis was there, by my side.</p>
               <p>Where did you find yourself when you got to your senses? - Why, at a farmhouse. I was in my senses before I got there.</p>
               <p>Who was the farmer? - His name is 
               <persName id="t17881210-93-person676">
                  John
                   Lawrence
               <interp inst="t17881210-93-person676" type="surname" value="Lawrence"></interp>

                  </persName>
            . It might be between three and four.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that Lawrence is one of the defendants in this indictment? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Was not he one of them that were armed in this affray? - I believe he was.</p>
               <p>What piece of fire-arms had he? - To the best of my knowledge it was something of a gun broke, only longer than a pistol.</p>
               <p>A gun-barrel cut down; that is what you mean? - Yes.</p>
               <p>One of the smugglers, so armed, carried<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100084"></xptr>you away? - Yes. At that time I was hurted by my fall.</p>
               <p>But, except being hurt by your fall, you was as sober as you are now? - There were many hurt besides me.</p>
               <p>Do you remember being tied up on the slings on the cart? - No, nor nobody else; I will contradict it.</p>
               <p>What was you turned out for? - I was not turned out the last time; I was turned out once. I have now got an estate of about 60 l. a year left me, and I thought it was a deal better than the excise.</p>
               <p>I believe you had had a hint that it was as well to resign? - Not in the least.</p>
               <p>Do you live near the prisoner now? - No, seventy miles below that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did you drink any of of this brandy till all the matter was over? - Yes; once after we removed the tubs we every one of us drank, and not a drop after that till all this matter was settled; and that only once.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you drunk or sober when you fell down, upon your oath? - As sober as ever I was in my life, till I fell down. It was so slippery, that no person could hardly stand, neither horse nor man, and the ground all a cake of ice. I mean to say that I was sober, sober enough: I cannot say but that the brandy might effect me a little, having eat nothing all day; but sober enough to know what I was about before my fall.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Hiscott. You hear this? - Upon my oath, I was the person that assisted in putting him on the cart: he was put there on account of his drunkenness, and being unable to go; and there he would have lain, if the horse could have drawn him: and as soon as we took him off, we laid him on the green, and he lay as dead, like a post; and one of the smugglers, Lawrence, took him up, and run away with him; and I desired Curtis to go after him.</p>
               <p>Court to Curtis. Upon your oath, was he drunk or sober? - He was very much in liquor; he could not walk; and I assisted Hiscott in putting him on the cart; and then the horse could not move, and he was taken down again. I clapped him upon his back.</p>
               <p>Was he so drunk as to be unable to move or stir, or take care of himself? - He was not able to walk at all. I never drank myself till after Mr. Hiscott was gone after the cart.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you swear that Williams was in liquor, or might he not be able to walk from the blow? - He did not fall till after he was on the cart, and taken down again. I helped to lead him some distance on the arm, behind the cart.</p>
               <p>Court to Hiscott. Did you hear the evidence of Symonds to day? - Yes. I very well recollect seeing Symonds there, but the particulars of the conversation which passed between us I cannot recollect a syllable of it. I was in such a slurry, and so frightened, that I cannot say what I did say; and so much time has elapsed since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester replied, and the learned Judge summed up the evidence.</p>

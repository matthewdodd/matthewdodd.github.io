On<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176706030027"></xptr> the 2d of May a witness that is here called over to me, and asked-me whether I knew that woman that was just come out of my house with something under her arm; I went out and overtook her, it was the prisoner at the bar; she had a copper pot of mine under her left-arm, and a saucepan under her petticoats; I brought her back and took the things from her, and took her before Justice Wright; there she owned the fact before him and the constable; she was committed to the Gate-house; (the goods produced and deposed to.) I said to her when I laid hold of her, why did you take these foolish things, why did you not take a tea-kettle, (there was one where she had them that cost me half a guinea) she said, I should have come again for that.</p>

               <p>I am a poor woman with one child in great distress; I met a woman that wanted me to write a few lines for her; she took me into a beer-house, and I wrote it for her; she gave me some liquor, I did imagine I had used these people with bad language: I was intoxicated, but could not tell what I had done when I was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did she appear to be in liquor?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, she did not; she said she had a child ten years of age; I saw a child here since she has been committed, I believe it is her child, she called it so, and it is like her.</p>

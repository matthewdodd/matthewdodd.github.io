               <p>I am servant to the prosecutor; on the 26th of February there was some company in the parlour; my young mistress gave me a tankard to fill, the prisoner was at the bar for a quartern of gin, she drank it, and had another to take home with her, she used the house; I filled the tankard with porter, and set it on the bar; in about five minutes after, Betsy called for the tankard, it was missing, and the prisoner was gone; we went after her, and saw her about ten yards off, with the gin in one hand, and the tankard in the other; we took the tankard from her, and she threw the beer over us, and used a great many rash expressions; she was very much in liquor, she afterwards swore she had never been in the house, and had never seen the tankard at all.</p>
               <p>(The tankard was produced in Court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>I was very much in liquor, I had a quartern of gin, and I called for a pot of beer; the servant brought the tankard, and set it on the bar; I thought it was my beer, I took it in the one hand, and the gin in the other, and the servant opened the door and let me out, and then she came after me and said, I had stole the tankard; I was so exasperated at it, I threw the gin into the beer, and would have thrown it at them,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270087"></xptr>but could not; I know no more of it than the God in heaven; I am a good customer to the prosecutor, she pushed me into the kennel and tore my gown; for God's sake, consider my life is now at stake.</p>

               <p>How do you get your livelihood? - I have a child, and the father of my child supports me; the prisoner has my child to nurse; I was with her on the 26th of February, I sent her to Mr. Swinnerton's for some beer and gin, she gave her the money; she was very much in liquor, she could hardly stand, I was going to dinner, and had nobody else to send for it; she had used that house eight or nine months.</p>
               <p>What has been her character? - Very good; she came back without either beer, gin, or money; I asked her what she had done with it; she said she had been swimming in it.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner called five other witnesses, who gave her a good character.)</p>

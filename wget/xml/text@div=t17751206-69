               <p>I was in America last February; they insisted at Virginia upon my taking up arms against the Regulars at Boston; I told them I would not fight against my king and country; they said what was the reason I would not, as they had dealt so hard with me, as to send me to that part of the country as a slave? I said I did not think I was hard done by; they insisted upon it I should fight, and provided me arms, and put on me a coat with Death or Liberty upon one side of it: as we were on a march I made my escape from them to a place called Norfolk, in Virginia; when I had settled there they insisted upon it I should fight: I made my escape from thence to a sea port town and took shipping and came to London: I had leave to come on shore, and as I was going to return from Darkhouse-lane I was taken.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>). The barge was stolen 25th June—it was entrusted to him May 30th, but he got into bad weather and she was repaired June 25th—I ordered the repairs—we did not complain of the barge not being back till July, but from 25th June the time she was re<lb></lb>paired—he had my orders to come back.</p>

We shall not unload before Thursday or Friday. We have met with bad weather and cannot come to London before she is repaired. There is only one boat holding it on. I had to employ four men to pump and to keep her afloat or she would have sunk. The agree<lb></lb>ment for the four men is 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. You had better come down and advise what to do, &amp;c.") I wrote this reply, dated June 4th, "I am very surprised at your bad seamanship. I thought you were capable of managing a barge in rough weather. You knew that it was stormy on Sunday. Why did you not go in the bay and lay till the wind had abated and make for the beach on Monday or Tuesday, instead of placing the barge in immediate danger. However, you keep in harbour till 1 come down or send." I went down to Southend and instructed the shipwright to repair her—she was finished on 25th June—the prisoner had my instructions to come to London again for a freight—I did not see the barge again till July 26th—he was using her for his own profit after 25th June.</p>

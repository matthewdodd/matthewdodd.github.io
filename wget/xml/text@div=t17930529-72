            ; I know nothing about the prisoner, I never saw her with my eyes before she came to my place; I saw her on Saturday at my own door, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, she came to the door, I buys and sells old brokering things; she came to my door, and asked me if I had got an old blanket? I told her no; she would have no denial but forced herself into the place; she would force discourse to me; she asked me what country woman was I? I told her I was Stafford; she said, I am you countrywoman; I said, you are a Yorkshire woman; she said if she was, she was bread and born in Stafford; she took one of my little girls up in her arms, and she wanted some drink, and I gave her a tea cup with two spoons in it, a silver one and a metal one, and went down to get some water; and left her in the room, and I pulled my gown off my back before her face, and she set there; the milkman came with the milk, and I took in a farthingworth of milk, and I left her again; when I came back she had my other little girl in her lap, and then she asked to go down the yard; I let her go.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you lose your things? - The 24th of March, a quarter of an hour after she was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss all the articles in this indictment? - Yes, every one.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen them since? - No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you find her afterwards? - Three weeks afterwards; my little boy saw her in the street, and told me of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed when you took her up? - She said she never saw me with her eyes, nor I her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The day she says, I went into her house to sell some old iron, and she said after I had sold the old iron, that I had robbed her, and that I sent for two half pints of gin to treat her with; good woman, says I, you never saw me, nor I you.</p>

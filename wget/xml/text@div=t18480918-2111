                  </hi>. I am a labourer. On Monday, 21st Aug., I was at Mr. Holford's beer-shop, and saw the prisoner there—he abused Mrs. Holford very much—I interfered, caught hold of him, and put him down on the settle—he asked me what I had to do with it, and abused me—I said I had very little to do with it, but he might as well be quiet—he asked me to strike him—I then struck him with my hand, I think, on the chin, not a very hard blow—he stood up a little while, and then sat down, and continued sitting ten minutes—he then jumped up, pulled his jacket off, went to the table, and took a knife—I did not see him take it—he then came to me, and stuck the knife in my arm—I thought he was going to hit me, and put my arm up to save the blow, and received the knife—he said afterwards he wished he had killed me—it was a very severe wound—I fell down, and a surgeon was sent for—the prisoner had had some beer, but was not drunk.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Ruislip. I was at Mr. Holford's when the quarrel was going on between the prisoner and Mrs. Holford—the prisoner was stopping to hit the landlady, and Payne put him down on the settle, and said, <hi rend="italic">"Joe</hi>, you ought to be ashamed of yourself to call a woman like that"—he had called her a b—y whore—the prisoner told Payne it was no busi<lb></lb>ness of his, and he said he would make business with him; he should not kick up a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> there—after that, Payne hit him, but not to hurt him—it scratched the skin off his upper lip—the prisoner then sat down for ten minutes I suppose—he then got up, caught a knife up off the table, went across the room, and stabbed Payne with it in his left arm—not a word had passed between them after Payne had struck him—the prisoner carried the knife back-handed, and struck the blow downwards—it was a hog-killing knife.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the beer-shop. On 21st Aug. my wife retust the prisoner for a pot of beer—he said he thought he could be trusted, as he had paid her a good deal of money the week before for eating and drinking, and he called her a liar—Payne said, "You have no business to abuse this woman; you take and sit down, or else I shall sit you Gown, and pushed him down—he got up again directly—Payne told him to be quiet, or he would hit him—they had a few words, and Payne struck him</p>

                  </hi>. I am a student of medicine. I saw Payne on 21st Aug., and found an incised wound on the upper part of his left arm, about three inches in length, and the same in depth—a portion of the muscle, and a small branch of the artery had been divided, and blood was flowing from there—he fainted three times from loss of blood—it was not a dangerous wound—it was such as would be inflicted with a knife like this—I only saw his that night and the next morning—he has been under Mr. Rayner's care sins,</p>

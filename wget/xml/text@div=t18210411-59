He said he had kept company with a woman for a considerable time, who was since dead - that he had bought her a shawl and scarf, and as she died he pawned them, and meant to sell the duplicates, and offered them to me for 6 s., which I gave him for them, and went with him to Price's, the pawnbroker, to see one of the shawls. I sent my sister to redeem them.</p>

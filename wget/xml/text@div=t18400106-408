At eleven o'clock at night, on the 13th of December, the prisoner passed me in Rochester-row—I followed and stopped him in Vauxhall-road—he was carrying a basket—I asked him what he had got—he said, "Tools"—I asked him where he was at work—he said he was out of employ, and he had brought the tools from his brother's—I looked in the basket, and found it contained brass and a few pieces of copper, but no tools at all—he then said he had been down to Manchester, and bad just returned, and he should answer no more questions—I took him to the station-house, and there he said he bought the brass, down at Deptford, of a man in the street, but he did not know who—I am quite sure he told me there were tools in the basket—I went to a lodging the following morning, and found this hammer—here is 20 1/2 lbs. of brass and copper found in the basket.</p>

                  </hi>I am foreman to the engineers of the London and South Western Railway Company. The prisoner was in their employ till June last, as a copper-smith's labourer, when he was discharged—I can recognise almost all this metal as the property of the Company, with the exception of these tubes—we have plenty of tubes, but I cannot exactly swear to these—no other company uses such brass-work at this to engines—I have brought some corresponding parts with me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q</hi>. Do you mean they are of the same kind of metal? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Yes, all the railways have not the same sort exactly—here are some parts I can swear to—they were cut off some engine—I ordered them to be cut off—I have no mark on them—they are like some we use—the pri<lb></lb>soner has had nothing to do with the railway since he was discharged.</p>

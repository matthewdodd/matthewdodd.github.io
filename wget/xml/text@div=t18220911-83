On the 22d of July, he came to work - I gave him the key of the shop, and in an hour and a half I went into the shop, and he was gone, and these things also. I found the shop door locked. I owed him 2 s. 6 d., which he never applied for. I found him nine days after in bed, in Shoe-lane, and asked if he would come and work out the things he had stolen. I did that to get him to the shop - he said he would, and was very willing to come; he came, and I gave him in charge - his brother brought me some duplicates and the key on the night of the robbery, which led me to the pawnbroker's; nobody but him had access to the shop.</p>

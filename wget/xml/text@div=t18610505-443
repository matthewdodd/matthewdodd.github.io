                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer, of Gunpowder-alley—I have been a customer of the landlord of the Haunch of Venison, Bell-yard—I have known him seven or eight months—I have seen the prisoner there acting as waiter each time I have been there—on 15th April, about half-past 6 in the morning, in consequence of some remark from the landlord, Mr. Pell, I placed myself behind the second cask from the door, in the wine and spirit cellar, about three feet from the door—Mr. Pell locked the door and took the key away—the first thing I heard was the shutter being taken down, and ten minutes afterwards I heard a person coming downstairs, and heard a key</p>

               <p>unlocking the door—there was a light outside the door which, as soon as the door was opened, threw a light into the furthest end of the cellar, and on a cask which had been pointed out to me containing gin—when the door was opened the prisoner came in—he had a measure in his hand and was drawing spirit from the cask; I distinctly heard it running into the measure—he was not there above a minute before I attempted to get to him, but directly I went towards him he went out and closed the door on me—I had an opportunity by means of the light of seeing his face, and am certain the prisoner is the person—the door locks with a catch, it does not require to be locked—I attempted to get out, and made as much noise as I possibly could till Mr. Pell unlocked the door and let me out—the gas was then burning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Haunch of Venison—the prisoner has been in my employ some weeks—on 15th April, about half-past 6, for certain reasons, I placed Perrett in the spirit-cellar—imagine this to be the beer-cellar, the spirit-cellar would be here; it is entered by a small door; about two feet before which is a gas-jet which would throw light into the spirit-cellar from one end to the other—the cellars are approached from the house by a flight of wooden stairs, and footsteps going up and down them are audible all over the house—I did not point anything out to Perrett when I placed him in the cellar; I locked the door and took the keys up into my bed-room—outside the door at the top of the stairs is a tub filled with water to wash the glasses—there is no sink—the dirty measures are kept just outside there, and there was a quart-pot on one of the shelves turned upside down—I afterwards heard a knocking, put on my trousers, came downstairs, saw the prisoner, and asked him to give me a light to go down into the cellar with—I found the gas lighted—it was not according to the rule of the establishment that the gas should be lighted at that time—the jet was in such a position that it would not be observable by a stranger before it was lighted if he did not know the premises—I unlocked the door and let Perrett out—he gave me some information, and I immediately went upstairs to the prisoner and accused him of being a thief—he denied having been down into the spirit-cellar; and I gave him in custody—the keys were usually kept inside the bar-parlour, but I had taken them up that morning—I have never seen the prisoner carrying any keys.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you light the gas that morning? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>, I did not—the cellar is quite dark without the gas—I did not expect Perrett to see in the dark—he could not see without a light—he did not light the gas in the beer-cellar that I am aware of—it was not lighted when I locked him into the spirit-cellar—I will undertake to swear that it had not been burning all night—I go down the last thing every night—it was burning in the morning about twice the size of this candle.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barman to Mr. Pell, and sleep in the house—on the morning of 15th April, I came down at ten minutes to 7—the prisoner was the waiter—he did not sleep in the house—he came to his work about ten minutes or a quarter past 7 in the morning—he opened the front shutters first—about ten minutes after that I heard a knocking in the cellar—after getting up I had opened the shutters of the bar, and afterwards the front door—the prisoner came in while I was engaged washing glasses in the bar—from the time I came down to the time I heard this knocking, nobody had come to the premises except the prisoner; not even a customer—when I heard the knocking, the prisoner said, H There is some person knocking in the cellar"—he was then two or three yards from the cellar stair door, at the end of the bar, which leads down to the cellar—he said that he would go and fetch a policeman—he went directly, and I stood against the door while he went for one—he came back with one in two or three minutes, and as they came in Mr. Pell came downstairs, asked for a light, unlocked the cellar door, and when he had seen Perrett he gave the prisoner in custody—I once saw the prisoner with a bunch of keys in his possession.</p>

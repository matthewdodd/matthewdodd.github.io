                  </hi>. I am wife of Henry Colvin, who keeps the Brass-found<lb></lb>ers' Arms, Whitechapel. The prisoners were in the skittle-ground on 3rd Nov., playing—I had a glass in the parlour safe at about a quarter-past nine—my husband came in at a quarter past ten, and it was gone—the prisoners had left about a quarter of an hour before—I just saw their shoulders as they went—the bar is very high—a person could have taken it and gone away without my seeing, but not unless they laid on their hands and knees—King returned for his jacket which he had left in the corner of the bar—a woman came into the house; I served her—she did not go to the skittle-ground or anywhere else—the prisoners came to the skittle-ground next evening and were taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of the last witness, and live in the house. Just before the glass was missed I saw both of the prisoners—Jones <hi rend="italic">hustled</hi> me by the handkerchief in the skittle-ground—I did not see King then—I saw him go out of the skittle-ground—Jones left about a quarter of an hour afterwards—I saw him go through the house and out at the door—I saw the jacket on the corner of the bar—the glass was missed about three-quarters of an hour after they were gone—I did not see any one leave the house during that time—persons might have left without my seeing them.</p>

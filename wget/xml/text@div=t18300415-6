            . I am an inspector of the Police-division, No. 3. Cusden gave me information on the 27th of March; I found the prisoner at the watch-house on the night of the 31st, and asked what she had done with the money she had taken from Mr. Hobley; she said it was all gone - that she took it from between the bed and mattress, and spent it all in different articles of wearing apparel; I found 5s. 8d. on her.</p>

            . I am a constable of the night. I was in the watch-house when the prisoner was brought there; I was going to discharge her - she gave the address of her parents at Brompton; information came about this robbery, and I detained her - she then said she had robbed her master of fifteen sovereigns, and that his name was Hobley, residing near Leicester-square; she fell down on her knees, said she was very sorry for what she had done, and was very much affected indeed - she said she and another girl had been buying some clothes, and had spent very nearly all the money; I fetched her master to the watch-house - she said she had taken the money and box from under the mattress, and thrown the box away; the housekeeper came - she stated the same to her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A girl came to me a week beofre I did it, and told me she had robbed her master and mistress of two rings and a brooch - she said my mistress had so much money laying about, I might often take some - I said I would not; she came to me again, and I would not do it - she came again the morning I went to the mangle; I told her I had taken the box, and went to her mother's in a coach - I gave her a sovereign, and she gave her father 4s. 6d.; she went and bought something in Holborn.</p>

The prisoner was in my service for five years, and left me on the 26th of November. In consequence of information I and my solicitor set off for Swaffham, by the coach, on the 2d of December; the prisoner bailed the coach at the Cherry Tree public-house, Kingsland-road; I was on the top - I got down, and put my hand on his shoulder while he was taking a glass of gin; I sent for Armstrong, the officer, who took him into custody. I saw this box and its contents, which was taken by Mr. Johnson, on the 10th of December - it contains the articles stated in the indicted - they are mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. What time was it that you went? A. On the 2d of December; I was on the top of the coach, but it was dark - I heard his voice, and then saw him. I had dismissed him on a Saturday night, and received information on the Monday following. I saw this box on the 10th of December, six or seven days afterwards. I prosecuted his brother last Session, for having some leather of mine, but he was acquitted.</p>

I know this pair of boots - I have worn them once; they pinched me in the toe, and I gave them to the prisoner to stretch for me; I asked him some time after where they were, and he said he did not know; I did not see them again till I saw them in this box - I cannot swear to these pieces of leather, but I can to the paper they are in. Those others have my mark on them</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are not these marks common to all curriers? A. Yes. I believe a man of the name of Nelson made the boots, but I cannot be positive, as several persons work for me.</p>
               <p>Mr. ALLEY. Q. Have you any doubt of their being made for you? A. No; I took them out of a lot; I can swear I had worn them, and gave them to the prisoner to stretch.</p>

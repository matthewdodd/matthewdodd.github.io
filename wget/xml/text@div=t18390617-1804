                  </hi>. I am a livery-stable-keeper, in South-place, Finsbury-square. I first knew the prisoner on the 28th of March—on the 13th of April he came to me, and said he wanted a horse and chaise for the purpose of business, calling on the bakers round London, being a miller—I asked him for what time he wanted it—he said he would take it for twenty-eight days certain; and if I was satisfied with him, and his busi<lb></lb>ness answered, he probably might want it longer—I let it him for twenty-eight days certain, at two guineas a week, and a guinea a week for its keep at my place—he took away the horse, chaise, and harness on the 17th of April—he gave me a card of his residence at the time of hiring—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)—"William German, Miller, Pier Steam-mill, 18, Union-street, Deptford"—I saw the prisoner on the 3rd of May, at the Castle Tavern, Mark-lane—I said to him, "Mr. German, I want to have a few words with you—I am not quite satisfied with you, a man ought always to be found where he gives his address"—he asked me what I meant—I said, "You do not reside, according to the name you gave me, at Union-street, Deptford," and I asked him for his proper address—he would not give me his address, but said, "Mr. Biggs, whenever you have a claim on me, when my month is up, I shall satisfy you, I shall pay your account"—I said, "I am not satisfied; where is my horse and chaise?"—he said, down at Reading, and it would be returned to my place in three or four days—a few days after I met him again in Bell-alley, near Finsbury-square—I asked him again where my horse and chaise was—he said it was then at Chelmfsord, and in three or four days it should be returned to me—I saw him after<lb></lb>wards, on the 21st of May, and gave him into custody—I found my horse and chaise at Mr. Miller's, in Blackfriars-road—I never gave the prisoner any power of lending or disposing of it in any way—there was no trading or negotiation between us from which he could fancy he had any right to dispose of it—the only thing between us was this, I was apprehensive, from what I found of the man, that I should not get my account for the horse, he having had another horse from my place, and put it into the pos<lb></lb>session of a pawnbroker—I saw him on my premises on the 29th of April—I said to him, "Mr. German, you millers are generally in the coal-trade, and we are in want of some coals"—he said, "I am not in the coal-trade, but I do sell coals occasionally, and I can send you some"—I said, "You may send me five tons"—he said, "No, I will send you four—that will be just a waggon-load"—I asked him when he would send them—he said, "The day after next"—they did not come, but, about nine o'clock in the evening, a quarter of a ton came in a truck—in consequence of that I went down to Deptford to find him—I went to No. 18, Union-street, but could not find him there, nor anywhere in Deptford.</p>

               <p>he took it away altogether on the 17th—he was to pay roe for the hire at the end of the month—I let it him for twenty-eight days certain from the 13th of April.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not let it to him for three months? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, certainly not for three months certain—I gave him a ticket for eighty-four days, which is customary in our business—if he had paid me for twenty-eight days, and I was satisfied with him, he would have gone on regularly—we pay no duty to the Stamp-office for twenty-eight days, and that was the reason I let it for that time—eighty-four days was stated on the ticket, but he was not bound to keep it that time—I saw the prisoner on the 3rd of May, in Mark-lane, and spoke to him about only sending me a quarter of a ton of coals, and next day he sent me four more tons—my object was to set that off against the hire of the horse and chaise—he did not tell me, when he gave me his card, that he was in the habit of having his corn ground at that mill, nothing of the kind—I met him on the 21st of May, in Mark-lane, close to my place of business—I asked him to walk with me before the Lord Mayor, and said I should give him into custody if he did not go—he wanted to get away, but a friend went with me to prevent him—I had so policeman—he was remanded, to give him an opportunity of returning the property, to which I consented, but he did not, and was committed—the officer has the horse and chaise.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer, in Blackfriars-road. On the 18th of April the prisoner called at my office there, with a person named Solomons, and applied to me for a loan of 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and offered to lodge this horse and chaise, which he drove up in, as security—our negotiation was taken down in writing—this is it—he signed it—the horse and chaise were delivered to me—I gave him 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that day, and he gave me this pro<lb></lb>missory note for £23—the horse and chaise were taken from me on the 27th, I think—I sold the horse to Mr. Seal, a coal-merchant, in Black-friars-road, for sixteen guineas, on the morning of the day on which Mr. Whityear and the prosecutor applied to me, three or four days after the note became due—I believe it was on the 24th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you sell it after you received notice from Mr. Biggs that it was his property? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not—I had not received any notice at the time I sold it—I sold it to Seal about ten o'clock in the morning—I had partly sold it to him the day before—he had offered me the money for it, but I expected the prisoner to call for it, and put it off as long as I could—I used the horse and chaise while it was in my pos<lb></lb>session—I went all over London with it, and passed the prosecutor's yard several times—I have had many transactions with Mr. Seal before—he is a sheriff's officer, and holds a farm in Surrey—I sell for the sheriff of Surrey—I consider sixteen guineas as much as the horse was worth—Seal paid me for the horse, I think on the same morning as I sold it, in my own counting-house—my foreman, Graves, was present—I gave him a receipt for it—the horse was standing in my own stable—it had been occasionally at a livery stable opposite—Seal has a small stable at the back of his own house—he sent for the horse on Friday, the 24th, I believe—it only came back to my stable to be given up to the authorities—at the time the pri<lb></lb>soner applied to me he said he was only in want of a temporary loan, and he should in all probability redeem it in two or three days.</p>

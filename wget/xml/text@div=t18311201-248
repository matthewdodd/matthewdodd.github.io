On the 21st of October I had a sovereign, which was a part of my pension-money; I went to the public-house where I lodge- I was quite capable of taking care of myself; the two prisoners were sitting by me - I took my sovereign out of my pocket; it was in the corner of my handkerchief - I was going to get it changed; Alberdine took it from me - she gave it to Upchurch, and he went away immediately - Alberdine staid a little time, and I argued with her about the money; they had been sitting by my side, but I took no notice of them - I had not known them before; I did not follow Upchurch, because I had a bad leg - I cried out, and threatened Alberdine; I have never seen the sovereign since.</p>
               <p>GEORGE FARLEY. I am a labourer, and a pensioner. I was at the public-house where I lodge - I saw Upchurch, and three of his comrades with him; he went out for half an hour, and then returned with a shilling - the prosecutor was drinking there, and Upchurch said, "I will show as much money as you;" the prosecutor said, "If you will show a shilling, I will show a sovereign" - the prosecutor then showed the sovereign from his handkerchief; Alberdine took it and gave it to Upchurch, who started with it- I ran to the bar; the landlord was not at home - I told his daughter; she said, "What can I do? I can't stop him"- Alberdine then got up to go out; the prosecutor held her for a minute or two, but she got away; they were taken the next morning.</p>
               <p>Upchurch. Q. Why did not you accuse me of it? A. I did, and tried to stop you; I had heard you say in the morning where you lodged, and I gave information.</p>

            . I am pay-serjeant of the company in which Upchurch is a private in the Scotch Guards. The last money I paid him was 2s. 6d. on the 18th of October - I paid him that for three days, he was under stoppages, and must have been very short of money; I have known him fifteen years in the regiment, his character has been irregular, but I know no dishonesty of him.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took Alberdine being informed by the landlord of the Three Crowns, that a sovereign had been lost in his house; when I took her, I asked her if she knew any thing about a soldier? she said No - a little boy, who was there, said, "Yes, he lives at the Royal Oak, at Knightsbridge;" I went there, and found he had been absent two days - I afterwards took him in the guard-room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist, and live in Princes-street, Rat<lb></lb>cliffe-highway. On the 30th of Dec., about two o'clock in the morning, I was going home—the prisoner passed me, and I felt my coat pocket touched—I accused her of taking my handkerchief—she showed me where it was on the ground—I stooped to take it up, and while I did so the prisoner put her hand into my pocket, and took out two sixpences—I spoke to her—she took me by the arm, and said, "You are going home with me, my dear"—I walked with her till we came to the first officer, and gave her in charge—I am sure she took the sixpences.</p>

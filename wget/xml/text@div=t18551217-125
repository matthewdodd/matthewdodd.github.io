                  </hi>. I am a trimming seller and general mer-chant, of No. 54, Old Compton-street, Soho. I know May; he came to me on 14th Nov., about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, and asked me to purchase a parcel of sewing silk—I looked at it, and recognised it as Messrs. Sleigh and Woolley's manufacture—he asked 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per lb., but shortly afterwards said that he would take 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said that the party to whom it belonged had brokers in his house, and wanted the money—I said that there were some unsaleable colours among it, and asked him if they would take 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per lb.—he left, and returned in a few minutes saying that the parties would take that price—I said that I was very busy, and asked him to call again—he said that he would call again in half an hour—I then left, and went to Sleigh and Woolley's; I returned in three quarters of an hour, and May was then in the shop—I told him to look in again in five minutes—he did so, and I weighed the silk, and gave him a cheque for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was at the rate of 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per lb.—I asked him if there was any more silk—he said that he believed there was—I told him I could buy any quantity of black, within reason—he said that he thought there was some black—I said that if he called on the following day, in the forenoon, probably I would buy it—he left the shop, returned in a few minutes, and wished me to give him cash instead of the cheque—I told him that it was not convenient to do so,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185512170066"></xptr>
               <p>but if he would bring it next day with the other silk I would then give him cash for it—he said that he must have cash then, as the money had to be paid to two parties—he gave me back the cheque, and I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver, and he left the shop—about 3 o'clock on the follow<lb></lb>ing afternoon, he came again with another parcel of coloured silk—it was weighed, and there were 6 1/2 lbs.; he said, "You can have this for 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per lb., as before"—I asked him why he had not brought the black—he said that it was in pawn, and he would bring it perhaps in a day or so—I gave him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for what he brought, I got no receipt—I gave the two parcels of silk to Bull and Packman—on Thursday morning I had a policeman in the counting house, and after May had received the money, I pointed him out—he had some braid in his hand, and asked me if I would buy it—I said that it would not suit me—the market value of the goods I bought of May is 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per lb.</p>

I am agent and manager to Sleigh and Woolley, silk merchants, of Staffordshire—they have a warehouse in Aldermanbury—I manage their London department, it is in the parish of St. Mary-the<lb></lb>Virgin, Aldermanbury—they pay the rent. On Saturday afternoon, 29th Sept., I left for the night, having ascertained that all the doors and windows were fast—no one sleeps on the premises—on Monday morning I went to the warehouse about 9 o'clock, and found that an entry had been made by cutting out a panel, and the whole of the goods of this description had been removed to the value of about 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have seen these parcels of silk and iden<lb></lb>tify them an Messrs. Sleigh and Woolley's property—I know that they were there on 29th Sept—for the greater bulk of it the lowest value is 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per pound—some portion of it is not worth so much—I was present when these nine skeins of sewing silk were taken out of a box in Walker's house, and can swear to them particularly, and I saw the papers containing them when I left the warehouse on 29th Sept.—in consequence of a communication made to me by Mr. Normand I went to his establishment on Wednesday or Thursday afternoon, and was in the counting house when May came into the shop—when he went out I went out at the side door and saw him go over to Walker and hand him a cheque, he looked at it by the gaslight and returned it to May, who returned to the shop with it—I was present when they were taken the next afternoon—I saw May taken first, and then Walker came into the public house, and was taken.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>). On Thursday, 15th Nov., I was with Bull and Packman, and saw May in Mr. Normand's shop—I did not see him come in, but I came down from the upper warehouse and walked out at the front door—I remained in sight of the shop, and in a few minutes saw Walker come up to the front of the shop, and walk to and fro for a short time on the opposite side, and stand looking, and after that he walked away out of my sight—I stood a short time longer and May came out, and Bull and I followed him into a public house, at the corner of Greek-street and Church-street, thirty or forty yards from Mr. Normand's—when he came out and was coming away we stopped him, and one of us asked him where he got the silk he had just sold to Mr. Normand, over the way—he said, "Silk, silk, I have not sold any silk"—Bull said, "Yes you have; it is no use fencing with us, we are police officers, and we know what you have sold"—we asked him who he had sold it for—he said, "For a person at Bethnal-green"—afterwards he said that the person's name was Walker, and he lived, I believe he said, at No. 6, Peter-street, Bethnal<lb></lb>green—I asked him if he did not expect to meet that person here—he said that he did not, he was going on to his place—Bull then said, "Do not you really expect to meet him here?"—he said, "Well, I do; I have been inside, and I suppose he has flown"—we took him back to the public house to a little place partitioned off, at the farther end of the bar, and Walker came in at the front door—he was coming across to May, but seeing me he stopped suddenly about the centre of the bar—I said to May, "Is that Walker?"—he said, in an under tone which Walker could not hear, "Yes"—Bull and Packman walked up to Walker, and said, "May has just sold a great quantity of silk over the way which he says he has sold for you, how do you account for the possession of it?"—Walker said, "He sold no silk for me; I gave him some braid to sell, and that is it which you have got in your hand"—I had a small portion of braid in my hand—Bull and Pack-man then came up and went with Walker into the bar parlour—I gave the handful of braid to Bull or Packman, and remained outside for a short time—I then went in and Packman was taking some silk from May's pocket—it was loose, not in paper—Packman said, "Where did you get this silk, May?—he said, "I had it from him," pointing to Walker, who was sitting down at the end of the table—Bull or Packman then said, "I</p>

            . I was at the Cape of Good-Hope public house, Titchfield-street, on the 4th of this month - I had eleven shillings and eight sixpences in a purse. The prisoner came in and sat by me. I had a bad cold, and she asked me what was the matter, and said if I would go with her she would get me some stuff that would do me good in twenty-four hours - we went out to another public-house - I took out my purse, and it had a hole in it - she said</p>
               <p>"Give me your purse and I will stick a pin in it" - she took it, and I turned round and said</p>
               <p>"I have lost a bundle from my side" she then took up my money, and put two shillings and two sixpences into the purse - wrapped it up, and said</p>
               <p>"There is your purse, take care of it," we went out, and she said</p>
               <p>"We will find the bundle in two minutes;" I lost sight of her in about one minute.</p>

            . My father keeps the Anchor public house, in Oxford-market. The prisoner and prosecutor were there together - he said he had lost a bundle - the prisoner said she would go and look for.

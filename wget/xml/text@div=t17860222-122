On Monday morning I went to Sir Sampson's; these men were unknown to me before, but Sir Sampson thought proper to commit them to Newgate. Previous to my going to the play-house, I took out my purse; I had a friend or two with me, I took twelve guineas out of my pocket, and delivered them to my friend, telling him I was going to the play-house; then I looked at two guineas and a half, two shillings, and a bad sixpence, which I know as well as I do myself, and a rupee, and a pair of sleeve-buttons.</p>
               <p>Was the rupee in the purse? - No.</p>
               <p>Were the sleeve-buttons? - No, nor my purse; the purse that was found on the prisoner, was not my purse.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing found on the other prisoner? - Nothing.</p>
               <p>One of the half guineas and the sixpence you know? - Perfectly so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester, Prisoner's Counsel. It was at half price you were going to the play? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Many other people were there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There are three doors going into the gallery? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many of those doors did you attempt to go in at? - Only one.</p>
               <p>When you came out, you was opposed by persons going in? - They were in the gallery as well as myself.</p>
               <p>Was you further in than they? - I was on the inside of them.</p>
               <p>They stood between you and the door? - John laid his hand on my shoulder; I thought that rather rude behaviour.</p>
               <p>By the box-keeper you mention, you mean the gallery-keeper? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Your direction was to take the two men behind the door? - Yes; I told them they had picked my pocket of money.</p>
               <p>How much money? - I cannot recollect whether I said the quantity of money.</p>

               <p>You did not say five guineas? - I had not five guineas in my pocket.</p>
               <p>That may be; a man says he has money in his pocket, when he has not; did you say so? - I will not say that I did.</p>
               <p>These men were taken to one of the beer houses, and there they were examined? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What sort of a purse was your's? - A mouse-colour purse, and the buttons were at one end, and the money and rupee at the other.</p>
               <p>None of these were found, but in this man's purse were found some guineas? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many guineas? - Seven, eight, or nine.</p>
               <p>You did not know the guineas again? - Some of them may be mine.</p>
               <p>Now as to the half-guinea, was there any mark upon that? - There was a sufficient mark upon it that I know it, it has a cast upon it.</p>
               <p>What do you mean, did it squint? - A bend it has got; it is a very fresh half-guinea.</p>
               <p>What year was it coined in? - That I will not pretend to say.</p>
               <p>Do you know what King? - It was King George.</p>
               <p>Was it George the Second? - That I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Was it George the First? - I believe not; I know it when I see it, and I swear to it.</p>
               <p>That is right. Did you ever see a bent half-guinea before in your life? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now, as for your bad sixpence, what is the mark upon that? - Mark upon it! I cannot say the mark; there is a scratch, it is an extreme bad one, an old traveller of mine, I know him perfectly well.</p>
               <p>You must know all its faults, because you know it as well as you know yourself; is there any particular mark, besides it's being bad? - I cannot tell; there is no mark upon it in particular, but I know it when I see it, it travelled with me all the way from York, I had it in town too.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220172"></xptr>How long had you been out of the gallery before you took this man up? - I never went out of the gallery at all; I took them instantly, I considered a little.</p>
               <p>Court. On the Saturday evening, when this purse was taken, and the gold was produced, did you, when the money was turned out of it, express to the officer your knowledge of these pieces? - I said immediately to the constable, I will swear to the half-guinea; says I, take charge of him this moment, then I said about the sixpence.</p>
               <p>When the prisoners were brought out of the gallery, had you a recollection of their persons as the men you saw before? - I cannot possibly swear that.</p>
               <p>For instance, if you had not seen them again for a day or two after, should you have known them? - I cannot say that.</p>

               <p>(The Money handed to the Court.)</p>
               <p>Court. Had you ever observed in what part of the coin your half-guinea was bent? - I do not so far recollect it.</p>
               <p>Suppose any gentleman here had a new half-guinea that was bent, by what means could you distinguish them? - The sixpence and half-guinea are so strong in my mind, that they have made a very great impression.</p>

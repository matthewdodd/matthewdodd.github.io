                  </hi>. I am a lighterman in the employ of Messrs. Young and Raymond—on Thursday, 26th July, I completed the loading of the barge <hi rend="italic">Cliarlotte</hi>—there were 500 quarters of oats; 165 in sacks, and the rest in bulk—two sacks make a quarter—the sacks were branded, some "Brown and Young," some, "Young and Raymond," and some "Raymond and Son"—Mr. Young's name is Thomas Brown Young—he is in partnership with Mr. Raymond—the corn belonged to them—when I had completed loading I covered the sacks with a tarpaulin and left them in the Commercial Dock—on Friday evening I saw the <hi rend="italic">Charlotte</hi> at the prosecutor's wharf, at about half-past 6 or 7—I found then, on examination, a deficiency in the bulk to the extent of eleven quarters; twenty-two sacks—the deficiency was in the oats that were in the sacks.</p>

I live at 45, Salisbury-square, Bermondsey—on Thurs<lb></lb>day, 26th July, I brought up the barge <hi rend="italic">Charlotte</hi> from the Commercial Docks Rotherhithe, to Messrs.

Young and Raymond's pre<lb></lb>mises—Wickers' barge was next to it; I believe it is called the <hi rend="italic">George</hi>—I left Wickers there—he was there when I took the barge in—we gave him orders to shift out to let the other barge in, and I then moored the barge next to his, inside—Moss and Messenger assisted me to moor the <hi rend="italic">Charlotte</hi>—they were in Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am waterman to Mr. Bond—he has the adjoining wharf to Messrs. Young and Raymond—our wharf is separated by the Five Foot Way and the Green Man—on Thursday 26th July, I saw Moss and Messenger in the Five Foot Way between 9 and 10, talking to one another—Moss left Messenger and went out towards the street, and Messenger went aboard the barge—I did not see any more of them after that—when I saw them talking they were just on the top of the steps, near where the <hi rend="italic">Charlotte</hi> was lying; about a dozen yards from her—I was alongside of them—I passed them at that time—I saw two other men, on board the <hi rend="italic">Charlotte</hi>; I knew one of them; it was Jupp—I have not seen him since—I did not know the other man—they seemed to be standing on the barge—they did not seem to be doing anything—I saw a barge with flour in it alongside the <hi rend="italic">Charlotte</hi>—I do not know whether it was Wickers' barge—there was no one in that barge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the Thames police—on 26th July, at a quarter to 10 I was in the police galley—I saw the barge called the <hi rend="italic">George</hi>; four persons were in it; Wickers, Bates, Moss, and Jupp, who has absconded—Wickers' name was on the barge—they were coming from Young and Raymond's premises, Bermondsey-wall—they were about twenty yards from there, coming out into the stream—I hailed them and shortly after went on board—I found 11 quarters of oats and 110 barrels of flour—I had spoken to Wickers and he said he had got 10 quarters of oats and 110 barrels of flour, and on counting them I found 11 quarters—I then asked for their orders—two orders were given to me; these are the documents (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Wickers produced them—one is for 110 barrels of flour and the other for 10 quarters of oats from S. and H. Bowyer—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>)—this is not signed—one ia an order for 110 barrels of flour from Messrs. Young and Raymond—when I saw the order was for ten quarters I said, "You have got eleven quarters; how do you account for the one quarter, or two sacks?"—Wickers said, "They have been put in, they have been given over"—I then said, "The sacks are marked 'Brown and Young"—Wickers said, "They are all over the world"—I said, "This is all wrong, I shall have to take you into custody"—the tide was going down and we had to make across the water to Wapping—the barge was made fast at New Crane—Wickers then pulled me on one side and said, "Won't 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., settle it?"—I said, "No, not a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>"—Moss and Bates were tken in the head sheets of the barge—they could hear; we were all close together—I afterwards showed these sacks to Messrs. Young's foreman—none of the sacks were marked S. and H. Bowyer.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186008130116"></xptr>
               <p>because I thought four men was too many to navigate a barge of that description, but I could not stop Jupp because I had no proof—I went ashore, but I did not follow him any distance—I hailed him aud he bolted—I have never seen him since—I first saw the <hi rend="italic">George</hi> about a quarter to 10—I believe I stated before the Magistrate that Wickers said that the sacks were all over the world—with regard to the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Wickers did not say to me that he would rather have given a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note than that those oats should have been found in his barge; I am quite sure that was not what he said—there was no conversation going on at that time—the twenty-two sacks would make what we call a broken tier on the barge—when I first went on board the barge the other men said they were assisting Wickers over the water—Wickers was then in the head sheets of the barge—this was not said in a low voice—I believe I have told you all that Wickers told me at the station—he said he did not know how the corn came into the barge—it might have been at the station that the others mentioned about the assistance—I did not know at the time who Wickers was working for—I thought by his name being on the barge it belonged to him—I believe the barge belongs to Mr. Ticer; he made an application for it—there is no charge about the 110 barrels—that was correct—they were for Messrs. Young aud Raymond—he was properly there as to those—he received them from that wharf.</p>

I am one of the partners in the firm of Yonng and Raymond—I saw Wickers' barge on 26th July, about a quarter to 10 in the morning—it was then moored alongside the warehouse at the water<lb></lb>side door—I went down there and Wickers was standing in his barge by the water-side door—I said, "What are you for?"—he said, "110 barrels of flour"—the barge was quite empty then, not a sack of corn in it—I am quite sure there was not twenty-two sacks of oats in it at that time—our sacks are not allowed to be used by other people—I have seen these twenty<lb></lb>two sacks produced—they are our property—these are two of them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—some are marked "John Raymond and Son," some "Brown and Young," and some "Young and Raymond," our present firm—I and my son and Mr. Young succeeded to the late firm.</p>

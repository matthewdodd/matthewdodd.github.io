             came to me on the 31st of March, betwixt 10 and 11, and asked me if I would buy a watch; he produced this, (a silver watch produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.) He asked me two guineas for it: I said how came you by it; he said his wife has had it in her custody this half year for money. I knew neither he nor his wife, as he called her, (which is the other prisoner) were worth a farthing; I said I must stop it and you too; I said, who had you the watch of; he said the woman was over the way, waiting for him to bring the money. I sent a messenger over to her, to tell her the watch was sold, and for her to come to have a glass of wine out of the bargain; the woman came, then I stopped her also. I carried them to the Tower goal, from thence to the bench of Justices in the morning; the prosecutor came and swore to his watch, and they were both committed. The prosecutor told me the marks of the watch before he saw it.</p>

               <p>The man had but six-pence about him; he desired me to send for a dram, then he said he would send his watch to pawn for half a guinea, and stay in the room with me all night. I went, and when I came again he was gone, and I sent the watch to Mr. Smith in the morning.</p>

               <p>This woman desired me either to pawn or dispose of this watch, I carried it to Mr. Smith; had I known it dishonestly came by, I should never have gone to a headborough's house with it.</p>

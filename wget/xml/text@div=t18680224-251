                  </hi>. I am a book-keeper in the service of Mr. Simmonds, veterinary surgeon, of the Minories—I left there on 9th January, about 8 o'clock—I was perfectly sober, and was walking towards Finsbury Square—there is a covered entrance near Broad Street Railway Station—and as I passed there four men rushed out on me, one came on each side, and each took one of my arms—the other two stood immediately in front of me—a gas-light at my back threw a strong light on their faces—the prisoner is one of them—the glare was so strong that he turned his face away that I should not recognize him—he undid my chain, unbuttoned my waistcoat, detached my watch from the swivel, and passed it to one on his left, and they ran down the passage—I followed but could not overtake them—my watch was picked up and returned to me on the spot—I gave it to the police—I received information a few days afterwards, saw the prisoner at the Mansion House, and recognized him immediately—I had mentioned his height and description to the police—I was not struck.</p>

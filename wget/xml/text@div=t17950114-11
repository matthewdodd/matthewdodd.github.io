               <p>I am an officer belonging to Worship-street. On Monday the 29th of December I was standing at the office door, a gentleman came up to me and says, there is something going wrong in that waggon, which then was past our office almost.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was driving the waggon? - The waggon was then stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the care of the waggon? - Both the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you observe? - I saw Watkins take a sack of coals out of the waggon by the assistance of Russell, I see Watkins take them into Brockwell's house; I followed him in, and instantly I got in there was a little closet that was behind the door on the right hand, in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140022"></xptr>stantly he got in he shot them into that closet, I laid hold of him and I said, I think you are doing that that is not right; he makes answer and says, I know nothing at all about it, Russell is my employer; I am ordered to do what I do by Russell. I took him into custody; I apprehended Watkins first. I sent over for one of the other officers to take him into custody, and went then with Russell to the place where the coals were going to be delivered at Hoxton. Watkins delivered me the ticket of the coals, I asked him for it, and he very readily gave it me out of his pocket; I saw that they should be thirty-five sacks to be delivered to the place where they were going to, and when I got there I was particular in seeing to the number of sacks taken out of the waggon, and when done so, there were thirty-four sacks in the waggon that was taken out of the waggon, I am positive of it, and as such, then finding it was wrong, I took him into custody, and brought him to the office, then being with his waggon and horses I then proceeded over to his master at Bank-side with him, and see him deliver his horses and waggon safe, and then I took him into custody and brought him back again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Well, Mr. Officer, this was in the day time, was it not? - No, it was not, it was between six and seven in the evening; it was quite dusk, I will not be particular to the hour.</p>
               <p>Q. In what place was this? - In Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Q. That is pretty near in the way to Hoxton? - Oh, it is certainly.</p>

               <p>I keep a chandler's shop, and am in the coal trade, in Gloucester-street, Hoxton. I was to have thirty-five sacks of Mr. Bee, delivered. I was the person that bought the coals, and there were only thirty-four delivered.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp to Bee. These coals that you have described, you have seen, I take it for granted? - I see them when they went away from the wharf.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had seen them afterwards, would you have taken upon yourself to swear to them? - Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't mean to swear that they are your property? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them put into the cart? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how they were fastened? - With a tail rope quite fast.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Russell. I did not load my waggon with the coals, neither did I tie it in. I offered to pay for the coals when the tail rope broke off my waggon.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Watkins called two witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

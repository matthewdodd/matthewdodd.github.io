            . On the 25th of Dec. about 2 o'Clock in the Morning, I went into a House in an Alley in <placeName id="t17410116-40-crimeloc206">St. Giles's</placeName>

I am positive I had my Money when I went into the House, and was in no other Company, and when I came to look for it about six o'Clock it was gone. When I came out of this House it was 3 o'Clock, and I did not meet any Body that could take it from me, to the best of my Knowledge. I had the Prisoners taken up, and Brown returned 20 s. of my Money back into the Justices Hands .</p>
               <p>Rhodes . Ask him how he came into our Company?</p>
               <p>Plummer . I went into the House to call for a Pint of Beer, and they forced me into their Company.</p>
               <p>Brown . Did you ask us, or we you?</p>
               <p>Plummer . They ask'd me to the best of my Knowledge.</p>
               <p>Brown . Where did you carry us to?</p>
               <p>Plummer . I carry you; - I never was in the House before in my Life.</p>
               <p>Brown . Heark'e Master, did you not send for Bread and Cheese, and some Beer? - there was a Man with you, with a Minc'd Pye in his Hand, he gave me the Money to fetch some Bread and Cheese , and when I came back he was gone.</p>
               <p>Rhodes . I have nothing to say, but we had some Bread and Cheese, and he went about his Business. I was not near him all the Time, and before Brown came back with the Beer, he went away. Both <rs id="t17410116-40-verdict207" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. I live at Liverpool—I am a spirit agent and distiller—we receive consignments from large distilling houses in Scotland and Ireland—Oldfield and Co. were our agents. In May last we advertised for some other person to sell amongst houses in town—shortly afterwards we received a letter from Mr. Rikey—this is it—I have acquired a knowledge of his writing since; it is his writing—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated May 13, 1858, offering his services as agent: stating that he had had considerable experience in the trade, and could give satisfactory reference and security.</hi>) In about four weeks after the receipt of the first letter I saw Rikey at a hotel in Fleet-street—he then told me he had been with Sealey and Mordan in Mark-lane for twelve years, and he was in the habit of meeting the principal wine-merchants on 'Change, and he could do a very large business—I asked him to name some, and he mentioned a great many that I knew by name to be very respectable—I asked what security he could give, and he said a security of a life interest that he and his wife had in some property—he said he had the title deeds with him, and he produced some parchments—on 19th July, I received another letter from him—I think I did not see Rikey again before I sent up any whiskey—it was partly in consequence of the conversation I had with him and the subsequent letter I sent the quarter cask—I received another letter, but it contained so much nonsense that I destroyed it—I afterwards received other letters from him. (<hi rend="italic">A number of letters from Rikey were here put in and read in part:—in one dated July 19th, he stated that the security he had to offer was a reversionary life interest in freehold property, producing 270 l. per annum, but as no money would pass through his hands, he submitted that no security would be necessary. In other letters he referred to Thurgood as a person who had given orders for whiskey, and stated that he was a person of property, and respectability, and to be trusted. He also stated in other letters that he had been introduced to a Mr. Mead, a partner in one of the New York banks, who would buy largely, and whose agents were the Union Bank of London.</hi>)</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you, beside the quarter cask of whiskey, send anything else? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I sent nineteen hogsheads and one puncheon—they came by bond to London—I sent them in consequence of these letters—I did not quite believe the representations—I think I wrote the day before the whiskey was checked, the nineteen hogsheads; and I came up to London myself before they got out of bond—I sent the quarter cask certainly in consequence of my belief in the representations made to me—having sent the nineteen hogsheads, I came to town a day or two afterwards—I saw both the prisoners—it was on 24th September that I met Rikey—he brought a person he called Mead with him—I saw them at Mr. Oldfield's, 29, Mark-lane—I asked him why he had not brought the third one—he said he expected he would come about 12 o'clock—he did not come—I asked him to give me the address of various persons that I might go and make inquiries—I asked him about Thurgood and he said he was possessed of about 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in money to his knowledge—I asked him if he was married; he said, Yes—I asked him to whom—he said, To Mr. Howlett's daughter; that her father had kept the Marquis of Camden public-house in Camden-town; that he had sold it about three months ago for 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he said Thurgood would get about 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from him—I asked him if Thurgood did not live with his wife; he said, No, Mr. Howlett had a fancy for his servant, and she was living with her father to prevent his making over any of his property—he said Mead was a New York banker—he said, This is Mr. Mead of the Atlantic Bank,</p>

               <p>New York; and the Union Bank were the agents for his bank in London; and I should get a bill from his bank, and this bank would accept the bill for the forty-five hogsheads of whiskey—I asked him to remain while I sent to the Union Bank to inquire—a person of the name of Smith went there and made inquiry—he came back and made a statement to me—I went to 2, Albert-terrace—I found there a dwelling-house with four or five rooms—there was no appearance of business or any warehouse—on the following Monday, the 27th September, I saw Thurgood and Rikey together at 26, Philpot-lane; that was the first time I had seen Thurgood—Rikey met me at Philpot-lane, and then Thurgood came in and Rikey said, "That is Mr. Thurgood," and then he wanted to know why I would not allow the delivery of the nineteen hogsheads and the puncheon of whiskey—I said that I would not part with it till I had got undoubted security for the money—he said he could give me security and he wanted me to meet him at 2 o'clock at another place—I met him at 2 o'clock at Mr. Wells' office in Moorgate-street—I went there and saw Thurgood—Rikey went with me—I saw the person that I suppose to be Mr. Wells, and he said Mr. Thurgood was very respectable and possessed a good deal of property—he said Thurgood was perfectly good for the delivery of the whiskey, and I might take his bill—I had some officers outside, and gave them in custody—I saw Mead once more, I met him in the street on the day that Thurgood and Rikey were committed—I think I had not seen him again before—Rikey said that Mead had so much confidence in Thurgood, that he would guarantee the debt for a small sum.</p>

Dear Sir Christie—Mr. Mead will inform you what passed in his presence; I after put on the big pot only as far as is consistent with truth. Will you please make an appointment to see him on Monday morning, where you please, and should you be kind enough so to do, I will call for it to-morrow and post it in the locale post in—Street, and he will have it when he gets to Oldfield's, 26, Philpot-lane. This day have a letter from a second quarter, stating the money can be obtained—the notice to repay six months, not three months; so now matters can go ahead. Rose was in such a devil of a hurry he would not give me time to go and see into this, and you know how I have been enga ed the last three days. Please put my name down for five copies of the sublime work you are going to publish. C. is most anxious about the export order; he named it five or six times. I said forty-five to fifty puncheons, and all depends on his and your arrangement on Monday. I will call on you on Monday morning about 1/4 to 9, as I am to meet C. at O. &amp; O. &amp; Co.'s at 10 A.M. In haste—Yours truly. John Rikey.")</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Webster; we are pawnbrokers, and live in Great Charlotte-street, Blackfriars. On Saturday night, the 4th of Oct., the prisoner was brought into my shop on a charge, and this pair of shoes was produced—they are mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I went to buy a pair, and tried them on; I had one shoe on my foot when the policeman came and took me away; the young man who was going to have the money for them did not come to the Magistrate's on the following Monday; I did not see the prosecutor at the shop.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable L</hi> 52.) I watched on the prosecutor's premises. I saw the prisoner come up to the front of the shop, take up a pair of shoos, and look round her—she then placed them in her lap—she went past the young man, who was serving a customer with an umbrella—I, thinking she was going off with them, took her, and said, "Where are you going with these shoes?"—she kicked off her shoe and said, "To try them on"—she had got two or three yards from the shop, going away, and had turned away from the shop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I had the money in my hand to pay for them; I was trying them on, when the policeman came and took me, before I knew the price; the policeman said I was two yards from the door, which, is false; I was holding my foot up for the young man to put the shoe on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No—she had 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and some pence screwed up in a paper—she came up with some vegetables and other things in her lap—she placed a cabbage by the side of a post, took the shoes, then took the cabbage up, and was walking clear off—she drew the shoes from her lap, threw them down before her, kicked her shoe off, and commenced fumbling, trying to work her foot into one of the shoes.</p>

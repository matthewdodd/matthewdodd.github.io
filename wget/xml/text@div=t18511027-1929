                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, G</hi> 101). In consequence of information I received, on 28th Sept., about half-past 10 o'clock at night, I went with Elston to the roof of a skittle-ground adjoining the White Horse, Baldwin's-gardens, and looked through a tile which was broken, and saw the three pri<lb></lb>soners, and another, not in custody, in the skittle-ground—Riley had a lighted candle in his hand, and so had the one not in custody, neither of the candles were in candlesticks—I saw them go from there into the open yard adjoining, and from there they got through the tap-room window which was down—it is on a swing, a pivot goes through the centre—I am quite sure it was down before they pushed it open, they all four went in, and in about a minute they came out of a passage into the skittle-ground again—I attempted to get down from the roof to apprehend them, but in doing so I made a noise and they blew the candles out, and commenced getting over into the adjoin<lb></lb>ing yard—I pursued them over the walls of two yards, and took Riley in the yard of the second house, the other three escaped—I took Riley to the station, the inspector told him the charge—he said, "I was over there," and said <hi rend="italic">Bluey</hi> Hawkins and <hi rend="italic">Fred</hi> were with him, and they should not have got over, only they heard a woman screaming and got over to get her out—no one was screaming when I was on the roof—I had only been there a minute or two—I was fetched by Maria Matthews, from Baldwin's-gardens—I examined the premises of the White Hart about two in the morning, and fetched Mr. Morriss, the landlord; he did not sleep there, no one but a girl slept there—I found</p>

               <p>all the back-doors open, three brass taps (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were lying on the floor of the wash-house, and this knife I found in the tap-room—I took Hawkins on the morning of 27th, and told him I wanted him for being con<lb></lb>cerned with three others in getting into the White Horse—he said he was in there, he was very sorry, and he should not have got in if it had not been for the others, and it was a very bad job.</p>

At this time I was proprietor of the White Hart, Bald<lb></lb>win's-gardens, but I had let the house that night and abut it up, and the person who was coming had not taken possession—I left a servant, Elizabeth M'Donald, sleeping in the house—I left her there for the present landlord; she was at the police-court, but is not here—I have not seen her since—I knew Riley about the place, and have employed him to clean pots; he knew the premises—I left the house safe about a quarter past 9 o'clock—the tap-room window swings on a centre pivot, and always shuts by falling to—about a quarter-past two I was called by a policeman, and went with him to the house—I found the water-butt upset, and a piece of piping and three taps on the ground, which were on an empty ale-barrel when I turned the gas off at a quarter-past nine—they had been removed up a flight of stairs into the washhouse—the pipe had supplied the water-butt—I had left it nailed to the wall in the yard—the servant was up when I left, she was not drunk then.</p>

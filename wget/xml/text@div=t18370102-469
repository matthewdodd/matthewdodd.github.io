                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Mattison, and live in Hogg-lane, Greenwich. I employed the prisoner to do jobs about the house—I missed the handkerchief first, and then the scissors—I asked her if she knew any thing about them—she said she did not—I missed the quilt on the 15th of December, the prisoner was at work at my place—I went to the pawnbroker's to make inquiry, and then sent for the prisoner, but she did not come—I sent two or three times—she came at last, and I asked if she knew any thing about the quilt—she said I had not lost it—that she had got it at home at her place drying—I said, "How can you have it drying, when it has not been washed—I have found it pawned at Williams's for 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—she then said she did not intend to keep it.</p>

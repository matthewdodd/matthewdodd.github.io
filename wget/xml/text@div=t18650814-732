               <p>next office—she counted the notes over and said that they were right—she had been in the habit of paying money in for me before and of signing bills for me because I could not see to do it myself—when she returned I asked her whether she had paid it in and she said, "Yes"—I never gave her per<lb></lb>mission to use any portion of the money for herself—next morning she got up at four o'clock and said that she would have a drop of brandy and take a walk, I said, "It would be much better for you if you would do that every morning"—I got up about half-past six, she was not in, but she came in while I was having my breakfast—I asked her whether she had paid the money into the bank and she said, "Yes"—I said I wanted one of the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—she said, "You cannot have it unless you draw a cheque"—she and her sister then sent me out to Mr. Cubitt's as an excuse while they robbed the house—when I returned they were both gone, and I missed table cloths, curtains, silver spoons, lustres, and two sets of china tea services.</p>

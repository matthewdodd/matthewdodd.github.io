                  </hi> I am the son of William Leigh Wood, a coal-merchant, of Putney; the prisoner has been five years in his employ. On the afternoon of 26th Feb., I sent him with three tons of coals—he was to take one ton to Mr. Grant and two tons to Mr. Clark—I gave him tickets for the delivery of them—I saw thirty sacks in the wagon—I told him, after he had shot the ton at Mr. Grant's, to come back and take some sand with him—he came back and left the wagon outside the gate while he came down for the sand—while the wagon was there, I took the ten sacks out of the wagon which he had shot—he then went away with Mr. Clark's two tons of coals—he came back in the evening—about two hours afterwards the constable came, and the prisoner was taken into custody—I spoke to the prisoner about a sack of coals—he said he had it given to him, and had given it away—I went with the officer and the weighing-machine to Mr. Clark's—I weighed the coals there, and there were nineteen sacks.</p>

                  </hi>. I am taking care of some premises at Putney for my nephew—I recollect the two tons of coals coming—I counted twenty sacks in the wagon—they were emptied into the shoot—there were no coals in the cellar when they came—after about three sacks had been emptied, the prisoner brought one sack and laid it on the gravel—he then took it away—when he had shot the coals, I looked and saw as I thought that the wagon was empty, but that sack laid at the tail of the wagon—Mr. Wood and the policeman came and weighed the coals—there were nineteen sacks—none of them had been removed in the meantime. <hi rend="smallCaps">

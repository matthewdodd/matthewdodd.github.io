I know 28, Cliff Street, New North Road—Bearfield lives there—I had been watching that house, and on 19th March a cab drove up, some parcels were placed in it, and Keegan, I believe, got on the box, and the cab drove away, and Bearfield walked from there with a man not in custody, carrying a parcel under his arm—they went to 36, Peerless Street, City Road, which I believe to be the residence of Mead—he remained there a minute or two, and came out without the parcel—they then went into Bath Street, where Mead and Smith were standing outside a public-house—they had some conversation, and I left them there, and on the 20th I went with Halse to 36, Peerless Street, and in a front room on the ground floor I saw Mead, Smith, and another man—I said "We have come to search your place"—Mead said "All right, Mr. Downs"—I said "You will have to go with us for some peeple to see you"—I took Smith, and proceeded to Old Street, where he said "I am not going any further, "and ran away—I pursued him, and, with assistance, conveyed him to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Red Lion-street, Spitalfields. I have a farm at Barking, in Essex—the prisoner has been in my employ nine or ten years—on Saturday morning, the 20th of May, I met him on the road, four or five</p>

               <p>miles from London—he had a load and half of straw—my son, who lives on my farm, had ordered him to bring some straw to London—he should have had fifty-four trusses—it looked a very handsome bright load, but I thought it was bigger than it ought to be—I then went on to my barn, and thought there was more gone than there ought to be—on the morning of the 24th of May I saw some trusses of straw at the police-yard—it was mine—it was very handsome and bright, and not so long as some persons is—it was white wheat straw, and looked as if it had been bleached with brimstone—I looked for some of the ears of corn in it, and they exactly corresponded with what had been threshed out at my barn—I have no difficulty in swearing that it belonged to me—I have been used to the farming business—I had noticed every load on the road, and there was no other corresponded with that.</p>

On the 20th of May, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner was on the road with a cart and two horses—I was up stairs, and was called down by my wife—I looked out at the window, and saw the prisoner in the act of unloading the straw, and there was another helping him—I afterwards came down, and the cart was gone—I found three trusses of straw left at my place—they were afterwards delivered to the po<lb></lb>lice-constable—they had not been touched, or done anything to, in the mean time—I had purchased straw of the prisoner before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the morning of the 20th of May, I saw the prisoner drive a cart with two horses from opposite Mr. Mence's door—I watched him—he went as far as the George—there was another cart just before him—he and the driver of that cart went into the George—I took the names that were on the carts—I afterwards found some straw at Mr. Mence's, and took it to the station—I afterwards apprehended the prisoner—he said the straw he sold to the cheeesemonger he had bought on the road, and he could bring twenty people to prove it.</p>

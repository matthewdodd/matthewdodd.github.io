I know George Fuller, who became a bankrupt—he is a connexion of my wife's—I advanced about 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to him, for which I received a warrant of attorney—I employed one Hoad to go into the premises—Fuller became a bankrupt about the latter end of April I believe—Had was put in two or three days after that to take charge of the property in the house—I know the prisoner—I had seen him frequently during these proceedings—I do not know of the snuffers and tray being at the house—I did not give authority to Hoad to deliver any thing of that kind to the prisoner, nor authorize the prisoner to take articles of that kind from the house—I did not order him to bring any thing to me—I or<lb></lb>dered him to send some articles I had there belonging to me for the use of the man I had in possession—it was not anything belonging to the bank<lb></lb>rupt—I have not received any snuffers or tray from the prisoner belonging to the bankrupt.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe you married a lady who has daughters? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—one of the daughters married Fuller—I know one Lawrence, of Hammersmith—he is not an old acquaintance—I became acquainted with him in May or the latter end of April, about eighteen months ago—Jones introduced me to him—I believe the prisoner is articled clerk to a solicitor—he offered his advice to me gratuitously, being a barrister—I believed that—I am ignorant of the ways of the world—he acted in the course of this affair—I believe Fuller was seven or eight months in business before he became embarrassed—my money was gone, and he was in difficulties—it was my wife's property—about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and odd of it was my own—I had a warrant of attorney to secure 1600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I entered up judgment, and took possession <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the property under that—an assign<lb></lb>ment of the property was made by a bill of sale from the Sheriff—a fiat of bankruptcy was afterwards issued, at the instance of Fuller's father, I believe—a second fiat was issued at the instance of Mr. Saunders—after the sale from the Sheriff I believe the assignees withdrew their claim, but I do not understand it—I am totally ignorant of business—I employed Messrs. Capes and Steward—I was in London—I did not go backward and forward to the premises—I directed the sale to take place—it took place under Mr. Bingham—the messenger under the fiat came in on the day of sale, and the delivery of the goods was stopped—this (<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>) is the bill of sale I believe—it is dated the 29th of April, 1841—under this I became the purchaser of all the property of Fuller which could be found <hi rend="italic">on</hi> the premises—I authorised Mr. Bingham to sell them by auction—the fiat issued by Fuller's father stopped the delivery of the goods—after an interval I proceeded to sell, the claim of each fiat being withdrawn</p>

               <p>—Bingham sold on the second occasion about June—I directed the pri<lb></lb>soner to give instructions to Bingham with respect to the tale—I did not tell him he might buy any lots he thought fit for himself—I did not know be wanted any—I have heard since that he did—the goods were sold, ex<lb></lb>cept the shop furniture—I advised with the prisoner to have the shop fur<lb></lb>niture kept there till I could get a customer for the lease—it was by his advice; I instructed him to tell Bingham so—the lease was put up for sale—there were no bidders, and then there was a tale of the shop furniture—that was done through the instrumentality of the prisoner—I authorised him to receive the amount, and I believe he did—after the tale there was a clearance of things left, things the man had to sleep on, and so on—I de<lb></lb>sired the prisoner to go and have the articles belonging to me packed up and sent away—at the latter end of September, after the tale of the lease, he said I should have to pay a quarter's rent if I remained longer in possession—I authorised him to pay the rent which was due before that—I generally gave him money to pay Hoad's wages—the snuffers are worth about 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you see the snuffers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In Fuller's house, before the bankruptcy—I had brought them to him—I taw them some weeks or perhaps a month, before the bankruptcy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you first know these snuffers bad got into the prisoner's possession? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At the Court, at Kensington, for the first time—I can<lb></lb>not remember that I heard of them before—I should not like to swear it—I was not at the Bankruptcy Court when he pas examined—I did not see Hoad after he left possession, not for weeks—some months—not for a quarter of a year, I should think.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ask him what had become of the things in the place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had received a mattress—I was not aware of anything being there—he said nothing to me about the snuffers, nor I to him—to the best of my belief, it was at the Court, at Kensington, I first heard of them—I was asked if I had received them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you go to the Court for the purpose of charging him, among other things, with having obtained a pair of snuffers and tray from the house in Regent-street by false pretences? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yet—I had heard from the bankrupt that he had had them—I have no idea How long before—I charged him with obtaining a pair of snuffers and tray, a piece of marble, and blacking-brushes, by false pretences.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you indicted him for obtaining the marble and blacking-brushes and things by false pretences? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I suppose so, by the indictment—Jones has taken proceedings against me—he brought an action against me in December—I owe him nothing—the trial was fixed to come on on the 23rd of June last, by a Special Jury—he was before the Magistrate the day before that action was to be tried—I had no warrant to search hit house——I heard it had been searched—I did not ask for another search-warrant on the 22nd—I believe it was asked for in my presence—I cannot say whether the Magistrate refused it, and do not know whether he granted it—I had nothing to do with searching his house—I know Fuller has been indicted for perjury, at the instance of Jones, before this charge was pre<lb></lb>ferred—Fuller was out of the country before this—he came back just</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When the action was pending, I believe Fuller and you became very friendly? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We became friendly the week before Christmas—I believe that was soon after the action was brought—I swear I never saw the snuffers after that time—I was in the habit of being at Lawrence's house, at Hammersmith, about the time the snuffers were stolen—I swear Jones did not come there one evening when I was drinking tea, and pro<lb></lb>duce the snuffers in my presence, and give them to me—(he was always there when I have been there)—I did not thank him for doing 30—I never saw them—he did not produce them from his pocket, wrapped in a brown paper—I never had such a thing in my possession, nor any brown paper parcel, at that time—I was not pursuing any business before I married—I was a gentleman—I was not in any business at any time—I lived with my mother, at Lincoln—she was not in business—I had no property of my own when I married—I lent about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of this money—I acquired money after my marriage—I followed no business when I was married—I never followed any business or employment—I have not been employed at a linen-draper's shop—I have been in a linendraper's shop—I was an as<lb></lb>sistant, at Spalding, for about twelve months.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have sworn you were in no trade or employ at any time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not when I was married—I was a gentleman when I was married—I was not a draper before I was married—I did not receive any wages at Spal<lb></lb>ding—it was seven or eight years before my marriage—I was supported at the linen-draper's—I bad food and lodging—I was not employed anywhere else—I occasionally used to be employed in a shop at Lincoln, at a dra<lb></lb>per's—I merely went on a market-day—I was paid for that—it continued a few months, not a year—I do not recollect any other employment—I have been fond of attending the theatre as one of the audience—I never acted in my life, that I swear—the lady I married is forty-seven or forty<lb></lb>eight—I am thirty-six—I have been married seven years—I have a sister on the stage.</p>

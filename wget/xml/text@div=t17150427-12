            </rs> The Evidence depos'd, That the Warehouse having been 3 times broke open, and Goods stoln away, two Watchmen were put in to lie in wait for the Thieves if they came again; and that accordingly, about 5 a Clock in the Morning of the Day aforesaid, they heard a Noise, and saw the Stock-lock of the Warehouse Door unlock'd, and soon after the Padlock was wrench'd off, and the Prisoner enter'd. As soon as he came in, one of the Watchmen struck at him; but missing him, he ran away as far as Rood-lane-end, where he was taken; and upon Search, the Padlock, with several Picklock-Keys, and a Tobacco-Box, with Tinder and Matches in it, were found in his Pocket.

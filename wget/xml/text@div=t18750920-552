                  </hi>. I live at 18, Collingwood Street, Blackfriars Road—I am the wife of Robert Cutting—I went to the defendant's shop on Mon day morning, the 31st May, with Ellen Gerrard, a friend of mine—I saw a dark young man at the shop—I went there to buy a chest of drawers—he picked out a chest which were very dark in colour, rather thick at the top and the knobs were turned ones—there was a ticket on the drawers with 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. marked upon it—the young man took off the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and said I should have them for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account to a dark young man, he gave me a piece of paper dated 30th May (Mrs. Cutting. Chest of drawers, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. Paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.)—I did not see any one else in the shop—on the follow ing Monday I went there again and made another payment on the drawers—the young man tore up the piece of paper and gave me another piece with the two payments made upon it—this is the piece (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) he gave me on the second occasion—I saw him make the entry, I suppose from his memory—he told me it was a proper bill—he got the price from the other piece of paper, I saw him copy it—the first paper bore the date of the 30th May, which was a Sunday—I went regularly every week and paid install<lb></lb>ments for the drawers—it was on a Monday, I believe, the 23rd August, I last went to the shop to pay three half-crowns and requested the drawers to be sent home—another pair was sent in the place of the ones I bought and I told the boy to take them back—I went to the shop and asked the pri<lb></lb>soner what he meant by swindling me out of my drawers, and he said "You"—I asked him for the bill and he told me he would not give it—I asked him where were the drawers I purchased and he stated that he had sold them to another customer and if I did not like to take the ones sent I should have nothing at all; he had my money and he would swindle me out of the lot—I asked several times for the bill, which he refused to give me—I then fetched a policeman who asked prisoner for the bill and he threw it at me—I saw the 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was not put down on the bill, he eventually put it down and I had the bill—I afterwards went to the Magistrate.</p>

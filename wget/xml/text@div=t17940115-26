It was on the 17th of December, I was robbed by this man, I believe it was on a Tuesday, about six o'clock in the evening, as I was crossing over this hither side of <placeName id="t17940115-26-crimeloc135">Piccadilly</placeName>

And two, one held me by one arm, and the other, by the other arm, and there were others. behind me, and others before me, and I was pressed very much, and had no liberty to move; one seized me by the right arm, and the other, by the left arm; and I was turned round by them, with my back towards the people; and the person who had hold of my left arm, who was the prisoner at the bar. I believe, it is the same person. I am pretty sure it is; he stooped down, and in an instant almost, he took my watch out of my pocket. I saw him stoop, I did not see his face then; I felt him pull it out.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that he was the man that pulled the watch out, or did you only feel it pulled out? - The man that had hold of my left arm pulled the watch out, and I believe, it was the prisoner; the man that had hold of my right arm, he confined me, and held me; I cried out, stop thief! instantly, I had no other remedy the moment, and he ran, he fled immediately, I had a view of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his face at any time? - I did not, he concealed his face, and stooped down, when he robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his face when he ran? - He ran from me to the eastward, and I only see his hinder parts; and I had a view of him, till he was stopped by the patrole; his companions fled to the westward, if he had taken the same road, I had not seen him. I saw him stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. How came that man to stop him? - I cried out, stop thief! The man was brought to a Hosier's shop, the corner of Bond-street, and there he said, his name was Foster, and that he was a coach-maker by trade, and then worked for a master in Queen-street, near Lincoln's-inn-fields; after that, he was taken away by the patrole, and I saw no more of him; and I was ordered to attend at Bow-street on the morrow.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner searched? - I don't know, whether he was, or not. But no watch was produced, I believe. I did not see him searched.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen your watch since? - I have never heard of it, nor seen it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a silver watch, and a steel chain? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a metal watch key? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150071"></xptr>Q. Whether you are perfectly sure, when the prisoner made away from you, that you never lost sight of him, till he was taken by another man? - There was not a great croud about me, only six, I believe, them to be all of a gang; but when I cried, stop thief! they all dispersed immediately, and this man, he sled by himself; I took particular notice of him; he left his companions; had he fled with his companions, I should not have discovered him. I am sure, that the man that fled by himself was the man that was taken. I believe on my conscience, that he took the watch, and I believe on my conscience, that, that man before robbed me of a watch chain. When he came into the stocking shop, I said, I was sure, he was the man, though he concealed his face. I had no doubt at that time, nor have I any now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I was taken into custody, he said, it was a shorter person than what I am, that robbed him of his watch? - No, I did not say any such thing, I am certain of it, I said he robbed me, and I was certain of it.</p>
               <p>Q. There were several people at the time, when he said, that a shorter man than me robbed him? - I insist on the contrary.</p>
               <p>Q. The gentleman says that I never was out of his fight till such times as I was taken, I was taken about ten minutes after this robbery was committed, I was brought into the shop where this gentleman was, and he said he could not swear to any body at all? - I believe it might be ten minutes when he came, but I saw him stopt at the corner of Duke-street, but they could not take him till he run a little further from thence, as I understand.</p>
               <p>Court. You was robbed near Bond-street? - Yes, on the further side of Piccadilly, on the foot way.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you mean on the foot way? - I mean the cross way; I see him run to the eastward, towards St. James's Church, and I see him stopt at Duke-street, but I understand he was not taken there.</p>

            What distance might you be from Duke-street, where he was stopped? - About two hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he run or walk? - He ran very swift all the way, I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you see him run in Duke-street, Duke-street is at the right? - I was not at the taking of him, I never lost sight of him till he was at the corner of Duke-street, but he ran farther before he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Then during that interval from Duke-street to where he was taken, did you lose sight of him? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. I understood you before, that you saw him taken, that makes a deal of difference? - I see him as far as Duke-street, from the place where I stopped, and he was stopped there, but he ran further, and he was brought back to the hosier's shop, a very short time after he robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I must again put the question to you, and ask you this, as you did not see the man's face, and he was out of your sight for some little time, will you venture to swear positively that the man that was brought back, was the man that robbed you? - Yes, because I took such particular notice of his binder parts.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember what his hair was? - His hair to my remembrance was locks.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember whether it was powdered or plain? - It was not powdered.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it a great coat or a common coat that he had on? - It was a light coloured coat.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150072"></xptr>Q. Do you remember whether he had boots on? - No, he had no boots on, for his legs were very taper, and his stockings were not so light as his coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who stopped him at the corner of Duke-street? - It was one of the patroles.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they lay their hands on him? - I don't know, I saw him run down Duke-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us before, half a dozen times over, that he was stopped at the corner of Duke-street? - I saw him stopped at the corner of Duke-street, but he went on again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any man lay his hands on him at the corner of Duke-street? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you will not swear that he was stopped, and you did not stop him? - I saw him stopped at the corner of Duke-street, and he went on again; it was an elderly man that stopped him, and he then took another course.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that you saw an elderly man stop him, at the corner of Duke-street? - I do, but not one of these men that are here.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I was brought into the shop I was searched, the gentleman said that he could not swear to my person at the time, that it was a shorter person than me that robbed him? - I said I did not see his face, when he robbed me, and I could not swear to his face but I certainly thought he was the man from the view that I had of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the patrole tell you that you must swear to me? - No, the patrole said nothing to me.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you always insist on this, that you believed him to be the man? - I did not only believe, but I was certain that he was the man that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. When he ran had he any hat on? - Yes, he had a hat, I think it was a cocked hat, but I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said that he did believe me to be the person, and he wished the people to let me go? - I never said so.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a patrole. Please your lordship and gentlemen of the jury, on the 17th of December we were walking along on the right hand side of Piccadilly just as we got near Bond-street, I heard the word, stop thief! stop thief! Rivett's and Skeates were with me, we were just past Duke-street, a few yards on the right hand side, towards the corner of Bond-street, and that side of the way; momentarily I said to my partner that was behind me, look out, for there is somebody coming, as soon as we saw him coming we made over the way, and endeavoured to stop him just at the corner of Duke-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you see before you got over the way? - I see him run as fast as ever he could, on the left hand side coming towards Duke-street, on the opposite side to what I was, we crossed over very fast after him, just as we came to the corner of Duke-street I was very nigh to him, but I had not hold of him, by the reason of the buckle of my shoe flew out of my shoe, and I could not make the speed to overtake him, by that, one of my fellow servants followed him, and when he got down into Jermyn-street there he was stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. You see a man in Piccadilly, you then see him in Jermyn-street, did you lose sight of him till he was taken? - I never lost sight of him, from the first time I saw him in Piccadilly till he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you took him, or see him taken? - We found we could not make speed to catch him, we hallooed out stop thief and he was stopped, and we took hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you one of the men that stopped him in Jermyn-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did you stop him? - We stopped him in the street, and brought him back, Rivett's, and I, and my partner, Skeates, we took him to the corner of Bond-street, to the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find out the person? - We were told by people that called out.</p>
               <p>

            You did not see him near the prosecutor at the time of the running? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the prosecutor? - In the shop, he was at the corner, brought in, and he said when the prisoner came in, that he was the man that took his watch, that was in the hearing of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he always insist on that, that he was the man that robbed him? - He said, he had no doubt at all but he was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the prisoner dressed? - In a light coloured coat, he had a pair of dark coloured stockings on, I did not observe any thing particular else.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he searched? - He was, in the shop, there was nothing found on him, I asked him his name when I searched him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the watch ever found? - Never as I heard of, all that I have to say, I asked him what he was? I knew his features, though I did not know his name, he said his name was John Foster, and he worked in Queen-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish to ask the person standing there, whether he did not tell the magistrate that his buckle flew out of his shoe, and that he was obliged to stop, and never came nigh me till such times as I was taken? - I told the magi<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150074"></xptr>strate I could not catch him at the corner of Duke-street, because my buckle fell out of my shoe, but I followed him, and he never was out of my sight.</p>

               <p>I am a patrole belonging to Bow-street; I was at the cry of stop thief, on Tuesday, the 17th of December, about six o'clock in the evening, we were walking up the right hand side of Piccadilly, I heard the words of stop him! stop him! stop thief!</p>
               <p>Q. How far might you be from crossing over from Bond-street? - About an hundred yards of this side of Bond-street. Chapman said there is somebody coming, look sharp, I stopped momentarily I heard the word stop thief, presently I saw the prisoner on the foot pavement, running very swift, he was running the left hand side, the opposite side, I did not see the prosecutor there.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts might the prisoner be, from the turning of Duke-street, when you first see him? - When I see him he might be fifty yards of the other side of Duke-street.</p>

            Supposing you was to cross over to the other side of Piccadilly, how far was the prisoner from Bond-street, I don't want you to allow for crossing over of the street? - He might be a hundred yards, I followed him down Duke-street, and he ran in Jermyn-street, and there I came up to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever lose sight of him from the first time you saw him running? - No, I came up to him in Jermyn-street, I did not stop him, a man ran before him, and I was up that instant, and had hold of his right arm, that man gave him a check, and that moment I went up and took him into the stocking shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I was first taken a master butcher and a gentleman's servant took me, I knew nothing about this man at all, and he knows nothing at all about me, this man came up afterwards, and they took me into custody.</p>
               <p>Court to Chapman. Were not Rivett's and skeates the men that in fact laid hold of him? - No, my lord, Skeates was not up, Rivett's and I took him, we were the first that had hold of him to bring him back.</p>
               <p>Q. The question I ask you now is who was it laid hold of this man in Jermyn-street first? - Rivett's was the man that had hold of him first.</p>

               <p>Q. I asked you over and over again who stopped him, and you insisted on it that you stopped him, now it comes out Rivett's stopped him.</p>
               <p>Rivetts. I detained him, I had hold of his right arm.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Neither of these men were nigh me for ten minutes, a master butcher and a gentleman's servant in livery, were the first that had hold of me.</p>

               <p>I am a patrole, I see him run across the street, the corner of the street taking the the other side of the way.</p>

               <p>Q. I want to know exactly the spot which side of the way was it? - I saw him running across the street, I was the foremost man, he run across the way, and turned down Duke-street, I did not see him after he turned Duke-street, I lost sight of him, but they being behind me were first up.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the man that you saw in the care of the other man was the same you saw running in Piccadilly? - I cannot positively say, I believe him to be the same man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his face? - I saw the man running.</p>
               <p>Q. Cannot you answer whether you saw his face or not? - I did not see his face.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing else besides? - Likewise dark stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing else? - Nothing particular.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the description of the man that was afterwards taken in Jermyn-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him afterwards did you believe him to be the same man, you saw running in the street? - I did believe it was the same man, I have not a doubt but it is the same man, I searched him afterwards in the shop, the prisoner is the man I searched, and that is the man that I believe was the man that was running, there was nothing found on him at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I cannot say no more than that I know nothing about this business what I am charged with now; I come out of the country only of the Monday, at Paddington I dined on Tuesday, I got myself into employ and work, and I was took as I was coming along, it was quite totally different to what they tell you, I was taken by a master butcher and a gentleman's servant; none of these people were nigh the place at the time when I went into the shop, the gentleman said it was a shorter person than me that robbed him, I am as innocent as a child unborn of the affair that I am challenged with now, I had a master here yesterday, that I worked for in Oxford-road, but he is not here now.</p>
               <p>Court to Barrobee. Were the lamps alight at this time? - Yes, I had the benefits of the lamps, because there was a coach standing at the end of Bond-street, which darted the light.</p>

On the 30th of October, I lost some shoes from my window; I saw them about eight o'clock in the evening. A pane of glass had been mended with putty three weeks before, but was quite secure. I shut up at nine o'clock in the evening, and observed nothing. My lamp had been lighted two hours - it was quite dark. I went to bed at half-past nine o'clock, and in the morning about seven opened my shutters, and found the glass pushed in, and missed the shoes. In about half an hour Timbrell's daughter brought me some shoes, which were mine, and at the watch-house two odd shoes were produced.</p>

            . I am a watchman of the Almonry. On the 30th of October, I was calling ten o'clock - the prisoner stood about three or four yards from my box, with a small bundle under his arm. I asked what it was; he said a pair of shoes, I found there was more than one pair, and took him to the watch-house. I found he had four shoes in a handkerchief, which I afterwards delivered to Timbrell.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was at the watch-house - the prisoner was brought in with two pair of shoes in a handkerchief; he said he bought them of a jew in the Borough, for 3 s. 6 d. It was a wet night. I examined his shoes, and found them very dry - I took them off, and found they were two odd ones. Myler claimed them. I sent my daughter with the two pair of shoes to Myler, she returned me the same I gave her.</p>

The two found on his feet are also mine, and appeared to have been worn about an hour. I only rent the shop and parlour - the house is let out in tenements, the landlord does not live in it.</p>

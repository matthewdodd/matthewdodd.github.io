                  </hi>. I am a clerk, and live at 65, Pigott Street, Lime-house—about 12 o'clock on Saturday night, 3rd February, I was in Flower and Dean street—I turned up Wilson Place, when I was surrounded by about a dozen thieves, who commenced to strike me—they pulled me by the hair, and knocked me down, and took the property mentioned from my pockets—I shouted as well as I could, and got from them—I saw some of them run to a house near where I was robbed—I ran out of the street, and met a policeman about fifty yards off, and returned with him—I found my</p>

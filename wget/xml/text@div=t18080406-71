               <p>Q. When you had performed that work which you were employed to do, did you deliver him the bill. - A. When I mended the windows.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver him the bill. - A. I do not know that I delivered it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make out that bill. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it delivered to him. - A. It was delivered to him, when the work was done.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. When was that work done. - A. When it mentions there, November 6th, 1805.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that a receipt on it. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that your hand writing. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the bill and receipt in the same state now as it was when it was delivered. - A. It appears to me not to be so.</p>
               <p>Q. Have the goodness to state what is the alteration - A. It appears to me to be an alteration in the twelve.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180804060050"></xptr>Q. That is twelve sash squares, sixteen shillings. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Twenty six squares, what alteration does there appear to be in that. - A. The alteration appears to be in the twelve sash squares.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the alteration in the twelve, is there more figures there than it was originally. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the alteration. In the one's, which makes it twelve, and which makes it sixteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. By adding a one it makes twelve, it was before a two. - A. It appears so, and here is a one before the six, which appears to be in my figures; it cannot be.</p>
               <p>Q. You believe that two ones are added to it. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. What other alteration do you observe. A. I do not see any other.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18080406-71-person681">Q. </persName>
            Is there any alteration in the sum total. - A. There appears to be a one before the twelve in the sum total.</p>
               <p>Q. It was twelve shillings and sixpence, and by putting a one before the twelve - it is now one pound twelve shillings and sixpence. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Twenty six lead squares, that has not been altered. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The sum total appears to have been altered by the one being put before the twelve shillings and sixpence. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp Then the number of squares have not been altered but in the sum total. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. What do you charge for the twenty-six squares in lead. - A. According to my account it is three pence a square.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Look at that and recollect whether these figures are yours or his. - A. I do not think it is mine, I said so before.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, you do not think it is yours so that there is an alteration in the number of the figures. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. In the first article there is twelve square, you think there is an addition of one to the article and to the price. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And with regard to the twenty six squares in lead there is an addition of one to the price, is that right. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What should that be. - A. Three pence a square.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. That would be six shillings and sixpence. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there is one pound added. - A. Yes, it appears so.</p>
               <p>Q. Now recollect what sum it was you received. - A. No, I cannot recollect no more than I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that you did not receive the one pound twelve shillings and sixpence. - A. I never recollect any thing at all about it; I never think of them things; when I receive it I mark it off and do not mind it.</p>
               <p>Court. Do not you keep a book. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Have you got your book here. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you do not recollect whether you received the one pound more than you ought to have done. A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Do you recollect at this moment whether you ought to have received twelve shillings and sixpence or one pound twelve shillings and sixpence. - A. I have not kept it in my memory.</p>
               <p>Q. Your book is not here. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Without your book have you any recollection upon the subject at all. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Without your book do you know whether it would be six shillings for the sash squares, or sixteen shillings for the sash squares. - A. Not without my book.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether it should be twelve or two, from your own recollection do you recollect it. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Or whether it should be six shillings or sixteen shillings you do not recollect. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. No more can you tell me whether the sum this receipt was uttered for, was twelve shillings and sixpence, or one pound twelve shillings and sixpence. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now the twenty six squares of lead, are not these figures yours. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They are both yours. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court The twenty six lead squares should be six shilling and sixpence. - A. Yes,</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Can you swear that the one before the figure is not yours. - A. Yes, I can; you mean in the first article, that is not my figure.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you be sure of it. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the one before the two - now can you recollect positively that that is not your hand writing. - It appears very much like my writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, Mr. Beecher, you say that the one before the two is very much like one of your figures - does not the one before the six look very much like one of your figures. - A. Yes; both these one's look very much like my figures.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you venture to swear positively that they are not your figures. - A. No, I would not positively swear that.</p>
               <p>Q. No, you would not - I dare say you would not - could you venture to swear that either the one before the two and the one before the six is not your hand writing - you told me the first one looked very much like your hand writing - can you venture to swear that either of these ones is not your hand writing. - A. Both the ones look like my figures.</p>
               <p>Q. And the one in the sum total does that look very much like it. - A. Yes, both of them do.</p>
               <p>Q. And you would not venture to swear positively considering the life of a fellow creature is at stake upon your evidence that they are not your figures. A. I would not.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have already told me that you do not know from your own recollection whether the sum you received was twelve shillings and sixpence, or one pound twelve shillings and sixpence. - A. I do not recollect any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Does the one to the sum one pound twelve shillings and sixpence appear to have been an alteration since or not. - A. I do not know, it is like the other ones, and they are very much like my hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. What would be the price of the twenty six squares of lead. - A. It entirely depends upon the size.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Do you recollect the size. - A. No, there are several different sizes in the chapel; my man brings the size home to me, and I put it on the slate. I take it from that short, I have hardly any recollection about it.</p>
               <p>Court. These two sash squares, what would be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180804060051"></xptr>the price of them. - A. I do not know the size of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. You know the size of them at the chapel. - A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Are they as big as these (pointing to the windows behind the bench.) - A. Some is and some not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you cannot tell me what the price of these two sash squares should be. - A. No more than I can tell you when I am going to die. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Now the twenty six squares of lead, what would be the price of that. - A. They vary much in size.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no recollection what the real value of them is. - A. Some of them would be nine pence, some sixpence, and some fourpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if I understand you right the twenty six squares in lead might come to sixteen shilling and sixpence. - A. They might come to more.</p>
               <p>Q. And the one's you believe them to be yours. - A. I believe them to be mine.</p>

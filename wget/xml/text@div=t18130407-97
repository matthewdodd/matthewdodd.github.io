            , the prisoner; I am positive he was the man; he asked me how far it was to Bow. I told him two miles.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark - A. It was a fine evening, but the moon did not shine; there was a number of shops open with lights in them. I observed his person; he was conversing with me full ten minutes. He said it was a long way, was I going so far, he wished to have company. I told him I was not going there. I did not want to converse with him. I wished to avoid him.</p>
               <p>Q. About what part of the town did he begin conversing with you - A. About the beginning of Aldgate.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did he keep walking by the side of you, addressing you - A. For about half a mile beyond Whitechapel church. I had no idea that he was a thief, or anything of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not pay particular attention to his person and features - A. I did not, still I am confident that he was the man that was walking so far with me. When I turned out of Whitechapel-road to go into Union-street I was going direct home from Whitechapel, down a street on the right.</p>
               <p>Q. That would be your regular way home - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If he was going to Bow, there you must part - A. Yes; I walked up the street some time; I looked behind me and saw him following me there, I then was alarmed.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had you gone down this street before you observed that he was behind you - A. Not more than eight or ten yards, and I was then nearly within a few doors of my home. It is a narrow pavement there, on account of some iron rails. He pressed upon me very close there. I conceived as if he wanted to get by; I then felt his hand in my breeches pocket. I turned round and seized him instantly; at the instant I seized him I felt a blow. He took his hand out; I saw no person near me but the prisoner. I was kicked behind or struck; I had a blow on my belly also.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that no other person acted with the prisoner - A. I can't tell; I saw other person. If there had been any no other person, I think I must have seen him; as I fell he got my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. You fell by that blow, did you - A. I fell on my knees and my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that the watch was not taken<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070064"></xptr>until you received the blow on your person - A. I felt the watch go as I received the blow on my person. I felt the watch go from my person; I immediately gave the alarm of stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the prisoner - A. He ran off, and I pursued him.</p>
               <p>Q. As he ran off, you had an opportunity of seeing whether there was any other person - A. There was no other person. He was taken within fifty or sixty yards of the place.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever lost sight of him - A. No, I do not think I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your watch recovered again - A. No, nothing but some papers and receipts. I never saw the watch again; some papers of mine were found in the street. My watch had been in my fob, and my papers in my right hand breeches pocket, where I felt his hand. There was a boy that saw the prisoner throw the papers away; after the papers were found they were given to Mr. Nalder; Mr. Nalder gave them to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who stopped the prisoner - A. A young man that was passing by; at the moment a police officer came up. I gave charge of the prisoner to him for robbing me of my watch; the prisoner said nothing. The prisoner was searched; there was nothing found upon him. I have never seen my watch from that time to this.</p>
               <p>THOMAS EDWARDS. I am an officer of the Thames police. On this night, I was at the sign of the Prince of Hesse; about sixty yards from Greenfield-street. I heard a noise; I went out; the prisoner was then just stopped; the prosecutor came up and gave him into my charge for robbing him of a watch, chain, and seals.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. What watch was it - A. A gilt watch, two gold seals, a gold key, two gold rings, and a gilt metal chain; worth nine guineas altogether.</p>
               <p>Edwards. I then took the prisoner into a public-house and searched him; I found nothing upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the person that had hold of him when you first came up - 
               <persName id="t18130407-97-person884">A. James Tweed</persName>
            ; he is here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any papers upon the pavement - A. They were given to me by the prosecutor, which were found, as I understand, by a boy, which boy is here.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner's person before - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a cabinet-maker. I live at No. 11, Chamber-street, Goodman's-fields. On the 23d of February, I was going up Plummers-row, near Greenfield-street. I heard the cry of stop thief, and seeing the prisoner running, I run to him and stopped him. He said he was no thief and no murderer. Mr. Pennington came up about a minute. He told me to hold him fast, that he had robbed him. I then conveyed him to a public-house. Edwards came up, I delivered him up to Edwards.</p>
               <p>ROBERT BAILEY. I am a watchman; my beat is in Greenfield-street. I heard Mr. Pennington call watch, and stop thief. The prisoner was running at that time. I sprang my rattle, and immediately followed the prisoner; I saw the prisoner stopped. I was within an hundred yards of him.</p>

               <p>Q. When he was stopped was there any other person running at the cry of stop thief - A. No. At the time Mr. Pennington cried stop thief, I saw the prisoner strike him with his fist; he staggered, he did not fall. I was as near him, as I am to you.</p>

               <p>Q. Then, as you were as near to him as you are to me, you can tell me whether there were any other person on the spot except the prisoner and the prosecutor - A. I saw another person near him when he struck the prosecutor. I do not know who he was nor which way he went. I followed up the prisoner until he was stopped. I never lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>HENRY MUMFORD. I live at 88, Greenfield-street. I was eleven years old last November. I knew Mr. Pennington before this happened. I saw Mr. Pennington on his knee, and I saw a man run away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what occasioned him to be on his knee - A. No. The man that ran away ran round the corner of Fieldgate-street. He saw the watchman, and then turned back, I saw him stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner the man that was stopped - A. I do not know. The man that was running was stopped. I saw the man drop the papers, and I picked them up I gave them to Mr. Nalder.</p>
               <p>MR. NALDER. These are the papers that were delivered to me by the last witness. I marked them, and returned them to Mr. Pennington. One is a bill of exchange for twenty-five pounds; the others are receipts.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I had these papers about me at the time I was assaulted. I know them to be my papers.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was standing in Greenfield-street, about twenty yards from a public-house door. I was talking to 
               <persName id="t18130407-97-person886">

            . There was a cry of stop thief; four or five people passed me. The young man stopped me, and as soon as I was taken to the public-house the prosecutor said, that is the man that robbed me. In about half an hour they handcuffed me, and took me to the Thames police office. In the morning three young men came up. They would not let them speak. Mr. Nalder said he would send them on board the Tender.</p>

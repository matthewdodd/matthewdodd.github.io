                  </hi>. I am a farmer, of Sudbury. I purchased a red heifer of Mr. Wilson—I missed it on 11th Nov.; I had last seen it safe on the 9th, on Mr. Wilson's premises—I informed the police, and on 21st Dec., saw it in Mr. Vickers's field, at Kingsbury—I saw Tomkins that day—Kench, who was with me, said, "Mr. Gibson has found his heifer, and I want to know where my bull is"—Tomkins said, "I shall not tell you"—he afterwards said, "I had the heifer, and Missenden had the bull, and it has gone down home"—we took him to Edgware, and he said that he would not tell us any more; he said, "You cannot make me, and I shall not tell you"—I gave him into custody—I may have asked him about their being fetched out of the paddock; I think he said that Mr. Missenden told him to fetch them out of the paddock—the heifer was taken possession of by the police.</p>

               <p>----<hi rend="smallCaps">BEAUCHAMP</hi>. I am a dairyman, of Hampton-wick, and have a field into which cattle are turned. Before 11th Nov., I met Tomkins on King<lb></lb>ston-bridge—two or three days before that I met Missenden, and he agreed for turning more beasts into the meadow, but he did not turn in the quan<lb></lb>tity that he agreed to—that was all that took place; and on 11th Nov., Tomkins came with a lot of cattle; I asked him if they were Mr. Missen<lb></lb>den's <hi rend="italic">things</hi>, and he said, "Yes"—I told him he was to take the bulls to Kingston, and leave the heifers behind, and put them in the paddock—he had thirty-four heifers with him; one of which was the one which was left with the bull by Missenden—on 13th Nov., I saw the two prisoners in the field together—I had more cattle in that field on 13th Nov., as near as I can recollect, 143—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a memorandum which I made on the day the beasts were turned in—they took away 141, leaving two behind, a bull and the heifer, which I have since seen in the possession of the police—Missen<lb></lb>den would not take the heifer to the fair that day, because, he said, it was not fit to go, as it had taken the bull the night before—that was true—I could tell that from the appearance of the heifer—nothing was said about leaving the bull, but the bull was left—after that I met Mr. Smith, who was anxious to buy a couple of heifers; I took him to the meadow, and said, "That is Mr. Missenden, and that is the heifer"—I did not hear what he said to Missenden, but I saw them speaking together; they went one way up the meadow, and I the other—on 14th Nov., I saw Missenden in the fair field, and agreed with him that whatever beasts he left behind he was to pay 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week for, and if he did not send the same man that put them in, he would send a note, and the money—the man who put them in came on 9th Dec.; he said that he came for the bill and heifer for Mr. Missenden; I told him to go up the meadow, and I would overtake him; I made the bill out, overtook him, and gave him the bill, and he paid me the money, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I receipted</p>

               <p>the bill, this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—my sister made it out, and I signed it—he took the two beasts away—I saw the heifer again on 24th Dec.—I was at the first examination, and on the second I swore to the heifer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer. On 24th Dec. I was at the Crane public house, at Edgware—I saw a heifer in the yard behind the house—I saw Missenden in the yard on that occasion, and the witness James Barton—I did not see Missenden look at the heifer—it was in the stable—I went into the stable twice—I was talking to Barton—Mr. Missenden joined in with Barton, and in the course of conversation Barton said to him, "Why, you told me on Friday last, in Smithfield market, that the heifer belonged to you"—he said, "I know I did, but you must not say <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> about that"—Barton directly said, "I shall," and he said to me, "What would you do?"—I said, "Of course, tell the truth, and get yourself into no further bother whatever"—in the course of conversation Missenden said that he bought the heifer of some one, but the name I cannot be certain of.</p>

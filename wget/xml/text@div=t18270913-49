I ran and hallooed Stop thief! and he was immediately stopped by a witness - I ran up stairs and found the prisoner's boots standing at master's bed room door; I ran back, and said "Hold him, for he has got master's boots on:" we found them on him - he begged for mercy. I said,"You rascal, you shall have the law;" he said, "Let me go back, and I will give you every thing I have got, to let me go;" I said, "No; I will have an officer, and you shall be taken; I insist upon it." I went with him to the watch-house, and delivered him safe there; my master's boots were taken off his feet, at the watch-house - I took off his hat, and found a new shirt of master's in it; the officer searched him at the watch-house, and found the soap, cheese, and spurs on him - I said they were master's; he said, "You liar, the cheese is not yours;" I went home, and found our cheese was gone - and missed a piece of soap and a loaf; the property had all been in the bed room before.</p>

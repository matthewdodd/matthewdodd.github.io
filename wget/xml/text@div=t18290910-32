               <p>Prisoner Defence. I had been to two or three public-houses and had something to drink; when I came home my wife sent me for a small quantity of gin - I went to the prosecutor's for it - I stood a minute or two, and the young woman said she missed a glass; I said I knew nothing about it - this young man came and searched my pocket; I said I did not know how it came there-these four glasses were given me by a young man who is gone to America with Mr. Edward Hall.</p>

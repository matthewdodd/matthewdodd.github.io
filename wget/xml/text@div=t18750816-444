I am managing clerk to Mr. Henry Aird, the soli<lb></lb>citor to the estate of the defendant, and one of the committee of inspection, and from the commencement I have practically had the management of the affairs—in consequence of the last witness coming to me with instructions, I issued a writ against the defendant, but first wrote a letter—I have given notice to produce that letter, I have a copy here, and there was no reply—the writ was issued the same day and not served until two days afterwards—with these exceptional cases I ask them if there is any reply, and he said he should hand it to his solicitor—I also issued a debtor's summons against him on the 2nd January—there was no conversation between us then, simply that it might be attended to—I do not recollect on the occasion of serving the summons that anything was stated between myself and the bankrupt—the horse and cart were standing at the door on the 2nd January, he said to the boy something about binding up the vein in the horse's <hi rend="italic">leg</hi>; he stated at that time that he had sold them—I saw the horse and cart there, and I waited a little way off and watched where they were taken to; they were taken to the livery stables—I said nothing to him about it—on the 12th January I went to Fulham Road, for the purpose of serving the</p>

Court—I made inquiries about the removal of the furniture—I was not there when it was removed—I only found out where it had been removed to, I found the second lot not the first—I did not speak of that being the best lot, the second lot I think I said—it was not moved by a couple of men named Ellis and Roberts—one of the men was named Roberts and the other Steer, both will be here—I believe the name of the defendant's mother-in-law is Mary Smith—I believe at present she has not the lease of the house No. 299, Fulham Road, because the shop is in the possession of a man named Derwin; she produced it to me and said she had lent the prisoner the money—I fancy she said he owed her more than 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., she said she had not proved her debt—I am quite positive she did not offer to hand the lease over to me, on the contrary—I did not decline it, we could make some money of it if we got it—I have heard of Mr. Broom as a creditor in other cases—he is the principal creditor in this case, he has proved his debt, 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—that is larger than Mr. Brown's debt—I never was in Mr. Broom's shop to ask him to join in this prosecution, I never saw Mr. Broom—I don't recollect seeing anybody, I. have seen a clerk in other cases—Mr. Broom sent his proxy to our office—I know what goes on in Mr. Aird's office, in this case I know more than Mr. Aird—no suggestion has been made to Mr. Broom from our office to join in this prosecution—I know who you mean by a man named Gray, I saw him when I went to take Mr. Sergeant's evidence—I saw him in the presence of Mr. Sergeant for a few moments, he brought a candle into the room and went out into the next room—I did not say to him in the presence of Mr. Sergeant that I had a good case in this prosecution—I did not say to him I could make a better thing out of it than out of a bankruptcy, I am satisfied of that—Sergeant and Gray were both in the Northcote Arms—I asked Sergeant if he would have anything to drink the object of my visit was to ask Ser<lb></lb>geant if he would be a witness—I deny most emphatically that I used the words "I could make a better thing out of it," &amp;c., as a matter of fact I</p>

                  </hi>. I am the proprietor of 299, Fulham Road, of which the defendant had a lease for seven years, it had three years to run from last June; the rent was 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—the last payment was made on the 2nd January, up to September last—after Christmas he owed me for two quarters—it was paid up to September—there were some fixtures on the premises belonging to him—I reckoned the value of them to be about from 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I should think the value of them to a person purchasing the shop to carry on business, would be about about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—to an incoming tenant they would be worth that—I have not seized the fixtures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I think Mr. Richardson has been my tenant about sixteen years I have known him the whole of that time—I do not suppose the fixtures would be worth more than 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to me to take them out—why I said 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was in consideration of their condition now—he paid his rent very regularly except the last two years, and then I have been obliged to take it as I could get it—he paid me 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. shortly before Christmas, and the day after Christmas day he paid me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on the 2nd January he settled the account—he is in possession of the house now—Mr. Derwin is my tenant—the lease was returned to me by Mrs. Smith—the clauses were broken in several instances.</p>

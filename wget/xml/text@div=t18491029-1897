                  <hi rend="smallCaps">DANIEL MAY</hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 357.) On 7th Oct. I saw the two pri<lb></lb>soners in Fleet-street, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning—I followed them up Ludgate-hill, where they saw a truck drawn up the Old Bailey—they followed it till it came to Newgate-street; both of them watched it and the man who was drawing it—it turned down King Edward-street; they both followed it, first one going to look at it and then the other—it was loaded with parcels—as it came to the corner of Angel-street, Simpson went and took this parcel out of the truck, Jones being with him—Simpson ran away and Jones followed him; after Jones had got a few yards he ran against a police-man—I called "Stop thief!" and Simpson stopped and gave the parcel to me—the truck had come out of Horse-shoe-court, Ludgate-hill—it turned down the Old Bailey, then Newgate-street, and then King Edward-street, and then Angel-street, but before it got to the Old Bailey the prisoners stopped and spoke to each other—they turned back and went after the truck, or else it appeared as if they were going towards St. Paul's churchyard. <hi rend="italic">Jones. Q.</hi> Was 1 not some yards from the truck when Simpson took the parcel? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, you were not above a yard or two from him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter to Richard Abercrombie, in Horse-shoe-court, Ludgate-hill—I went from his house on that morning with a truck with four parcels in it; this is one of them—two were to be delivered at the Bull and Mouth, and two at the Blossoms Inn—I missed this parcel when I was delivering the two at the Bull and Mouth—I went to the corner of Newgate-street, and King Edward-street, and Angel-street—my back was towards the truck, having a heavy load I was bending forward—there was a large parcel in front to balance the other three which were behind.</p>

               <p>On the 28th of June, about half past ten, or wanting twenty minutes to eleven o'clock at night, I was coming with my wife from South-street, Grosvenor-square. Going down <placeName id="t17810711-53-crimeloc272">Lower Grosvenor-street</placeName>

             a knife, put it near my breast, and said, God b - st your eyes, your life or your money! I was not so much alarmed as I think I should be if such a thing should happen again: my wife had hold of my right arm; I snatched my arm from her, and immediately pushed him; he went from the cart into the coach-way. The first words I said, I believe, was, You murderous villain, you! and I immediately halloo'd out, Watch! Murder! or whatever I thought of in that situation. He still fronted me; I struck at him, which was very imprudent, for it was only with this light cane, and hit him: when he found my weapon could not hurt him, he immediately pointed the knife at me again: I still kept hallooing as before. Then I saw him look up towards Grosvenor-square, and down the street; and then he took to his heels. I pursued him as fast as I could, crying out Stop thief! he ran down Davis-street, and into a mews which is called Brooks's-mews; the most favourable means for an escape that could be. I still halloo'd; and, by this time, somebody attempted to stop him; however he could not: he then got into the mews; I still pursued him: there happened to be a person at the bottom of the mews, who heard the cries, and saw him run; he laid hold of him: I might, at this time, be thirty yards from him, for he could run faster than me: there he was secured.</p>



               <p>Was he ever out of your sight, from the time he stopped you till he was secured? - He turned two corners.</p>

               <p>Are you certain he is the man? - I am very sure he is.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178107110141"></xptr>When you turned the corners after him, and got sight of him again, how far had he ran? - About thirty yards. After he was secured, I went up to him, and took him to the watch-house. When I got there, I said to the constable of the night, You will please to observe this; I will give you two distances, and between those distances you may find a knife, if you will let your watchman go by day-light. The watchman found a knife, as I understood, the next morning.</p>

               <p>What were the distances you gave him? - I fancy it might be from Lord Boston's door, to the mews at the back of Lord Hertford's: the ground is about 300 yards.</p>

               <p>You gave him the whole length, to look for the knife? - Yes, as near as I could guess. I have to make one remark, which I hope your Lordship will consider in favour of the prisoner: all this time he never put the knife to my wife, or attempted to hurt her; which I would wish to be considered as a favourable circumstance.</p>

               <p>Jury. Had he the same clothes on then that he has now? - I do not think it is the same coat: I am certain to his face and size.</p>

               <p>I am the wife of the prosecutor. On the 28th of June last, as my husband and I were coming through Grosvenor-street, the prisoner came up to my husband, and demanded his life or his money. My husband pushed him off the pavement upon the cross-way, and made a stroke at him with a little cane he has in his hand. As soon as the man found the weight of the cane, he made a push to my husband again with the knife. He ran away. My husband cried, Murder! and thieves! and pursued him.</p>

               <p>Are you certain he is the person? - It was under two lamps, and it was a remarkable light night: I am certain he is the man.</p>

               <p>I am servant to the Hon. Capt. Wyndham. My master was out of town. I came to town upon business. Going to bed, at the bottom of Brook's-mews, I heard the cry of Stop thief! I saw the prisoner running, with another person behind him, about twenty yards off: Mr. Johnson, I suppose, might be between thirty and forty yards off. I put my hand upon the man's collar; he said, I have done no harm; I have no knife about me.</p>

               <p>Who was the person that was running immediately after him? - Mr. Smith.</p>

               <p>Was any body else running besides the prisoner, Johnson, and Smith? - Yes; there were, I believe, about half-a-dozen behind them. There was nobody between the prisoner and Johnson but Smith. We found the sheath of a butcher's knife in the prisoner's pocket, in the watch-house.</p>

The gentleman was agreeable to let me go for a soldier: I told him I was a soldier. Then the justice committed me to Bridewell.</p>

               <p>(The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a very good character.)</p>

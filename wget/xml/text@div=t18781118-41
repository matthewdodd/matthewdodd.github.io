                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi> 145 <hi rend="italic">E</hi>). On Sunday, 27th October, I was on duty at Mabledon Place, Euston Read, at 1.10 a.m.—I heard a man groan<lb></lb>ing and a cry of "Police" and "Thief"—I saw a man lying on the ground and two persons leaving him, they ran very fast, and when I was 20 yards from the spot, I saw the prisoner strike the man on the side of his head, he was 15 yards behind the other two and was the last to leave—he ran in the same direction—I kept him in sight for 400 yards, and caught hold of him in Dicker's Road—he was very flurried and out of breath, and his shirt front was torn—I said to him "I shall take you in custody for robbing a man in Mabledon Place"—he said "You have made a mistake, I have only 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. search me if you like"—Mr. White came to the station and complained of being robbed—I put the prisoner with nine or ten others, some of whom were in custody, and others volunteered, and White said in a moment, "That is the <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> that struck me"—the prisoner said he knew nothing of it</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. He said again at the station, "You have made a mistake," and again at the police-court—that has been his defence from the beginning—<hi rend="italic">E</hi> 69 was about four yards behind me—I laid hold of the prisoner first—White had had a good deal to drink; I should consider him drunk, but he was not incapable—when the prisoner said that he had only a shilling he held it up to me—I searched him and found no more—I will swear there were nine persons put with him—he was remanded till the following Saturday, and admitted to bail—I did not see White at Bow Street on the Monday, I saw him on the Tuesday—he did not tell me that the man he saw get out of the police van was not the person, but he told the Magistrate so.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">E</hi> 69). I was with Buttell—I heard a groan and a cry of "Police"—I ran to the spot and saw two men struggling together,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187811180064"></xptr>
               <p>and saw the prisoner strike White in the face—I was about 20 yards from them, and about a yard from Buttell—we both ran after the prisoner, Buttell caught him—I lost sight of him for a second, turning a corner—he was out of breath and his shirt was pulled out from his waistcoat in front—eight or nine men were fetched in at the station, and White picked the prisoner out immediately, and said "That is the <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> who struck Me."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. There were about six policemen in the charge room<lb></lb>White had been drinking, but he knew perfectly well what he was about—he was nearer drunkenness than sober—he might have managed to get home—I saw him outside the police-court on the Monday before the case came on—he was told to come at 10 o'clock—the prisoner was not brought from the House of Detention—he was detained at the station, and had not then been before the Magistrate—I did not hear White say anything about him, he only said that he felt very ill and could hardly breathe, and he did not give his evidence—we two constables gave our evidence—I was examined again on the Saturday—the prisoner ran 40 yards up Crescent Mews, and then turned into Draper's Place, that is a sharp turn, but wide enough for me to see round it, and when I came up he was in Buttell's hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. The prisoner was kept at the station during the night and taken before the Magistrate in the morning—I saw White in the morning—he told me he felt ill—I placed him in the Court, and saw no more of him—the prisoner was admitted to bail—I saw White on the Tuesday night in bed—I saw him again before the Magistrate on the Saturday, he had been summoned to attend.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 25, South Crescent Mews—on the morning of 26th October, about 12.20, I was very drunk—I had 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my right<lb></lb>hand pocket—I went into a turning out of Euston Road—a party came behind me—I cannot tell exactly who he was, but I was <hi rend="italic">turned fair</hi> into the gutter on my face and hands—there were three men—I felt a hand in my pocket and saw the man's face—I tried to hold his hand—the others had then gone away, I could only see their backs—I halloaed out and received a kick in the stomach—the men got away—after some time I went to the police-station and was shown three persons—I am quite sure there were only three, they were standing in a corner—I was asked to point out which of those three men took my money, and I said "I think that is the man"—that was the prisoner—I was then told to go up and touch him, but I did not—the prisoner is not the man who robbed me—I cannot tell you whether he was one of the three, but he is the man that I identified—I said that he was the man, but when I went on the Monday to prosecute him I found that he was the wrong man, and I went away—being drunk overnight I thought I should be better able to recognise the man the next morning—the prisoner is not the man that I caught hold of.</p>

Nobody helped me up—I called "Police," but nobody came, then I staggered along to the station—it took me some time to get there—I was there 10 minutes or a quarter of an hour before I was taken in to identify anybody—I do not remember how many constables were there or what they said to me—there were not 10 men there, only three—I went home by myself—I saw the prisoner next morning coming out of the police<lb></lb>van at Bow Street, and recognised that he was not the man—I then returned to my work—Nutkins said, "Where are you going," I said "To my work"—he said, "Why," I said, "It is the wrong man altogether."</p>

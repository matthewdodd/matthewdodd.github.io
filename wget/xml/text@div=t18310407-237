On the night of the 16th of March I was on duty in Praed-street, Paddington - I saw Beckenham coming down with a sack of corn, and he asked me if I could tell him which was No. 137; I said I thought he knew as well as I did, it was not at that end of the street; I then asked what he had in the sack - he said a bushel of corn which he was going to take from Mr. Meredith's wharf to Mr. Whitmore's, and if I went with him there I should find it was all right; I went with him, and Mr. Whitmore denied all knowledge of it - I then took him to the station, and in going down the street he said, "The whole of it is, it is stolen corn, and I had it from

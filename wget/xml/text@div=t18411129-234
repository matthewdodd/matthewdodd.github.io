                  </hi>. I am sixteen years old. In October last I was in the employ of Mr. Saltmer—I have been with him little more than three months—my father is also in his service, and has been so for about two years. On the 18th of November I went to Mr. Coronel's, No. 1, Holywell-street—about a week before that I had been to No. 17, which is the prisoner's—my attention was first attracted there by seeing a board outside, stating that they bought goods—I had nothing with me when I first noticed that board—I spoke to the prisoner on that occasion—he was at the door—I asked him if he would buy some figured satins—he said, "Yes"—I went there next evening with four pieces of black quiltings, and three lengths of figured satin, about nine yards in, each length—these are the black quilt<lb></lb>ings I took—(looking at four pieces)——took the satins and quiltings from my master's stock—I have since pointed out to my master the patterns in the warehouse of the silks I so took—I wrapped them up in a brown paper</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184111290203"></xptr>
               <p>parcel—I got to the prisoner's house about half-past five o'clock—he was at the door—I went in and said I had brought the satins—I opened the parcel, and he said, "Oh, these are not satins"—the quiltings were at the top—I said, "No, but the satins are underneath"—he looked at them, and then asked me what price for the whole—I did not say any price—I asked him to give as much as he could—he said he would give 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the whole lot—I said that was very little—he said he did not wish to give more, and I took it—he paid me—no one else was in the shop at the time—I believe this was on Friday evening—there was a light in the shop—the shutters were up—nothing more passed—the day after I went to Mr. Coronel's I was taken into custody at my master's warehouse—I did not upon that make a statement of my conduct in the transaction—I afterwards disclosed what I knew of these robberies—in consequence of which I was taken to Holywell-street by inspector M'Lean, and Evans the warehouse-man—a parcel was made up like the one I had carried to the prisoner—Evans carried it—I saw Evans go into the prisoner's house—I went in first—the prisoner was not in—he came in shortly after, and I pointed him out to Mr. Evans—I was in the shop—I said, "This is the person I sold them to"—I did not hear the prisoner make any observation—I never said in the prisoner's presence what I had sold to him—he was taken in custody—I come from Newgate to give this account to-day.</p>

               <p>that night—I called at Mr. Ferguson's for a bag—I had some velvets with me—I did not intend to sell them—it was not the velvet I offered to Coronel—I had brought them from a Mr. Freeman's, opposite Mr. Ferguson's, to put into the bag—I kept Coronel waiting for me at three houses—I did not tell him I was going to sell things—I told him I went to take a parcel to the master of the shop—I had three parcels with me—I had those par<lb></lb>cels with my master's knowledge—I had three shops to call at with my master's knowledge—I bad three parcels in all—I had not all three with my master's knowledge—I had two with his knowledge—I never gave a false address to any body—I did not tell Coronel that I lived in Bread-street—I swear that—I never mentioned Bread-street to him—the prisoner's door was open when I went in—the shop was shut—any body could have gone in and seen me there, and what I was about—I was in the shop when the parcel of quiltings was found which I had sold to him about a week before—it was lying on the back counter—there were plenty of places of concealment in the shop—it was found tied up in the brown-paper parcel in which I had sold it—the prisoner did not ask me my address—I swear that—I did not give him "Bread-street"—I had no object in deceiving the prisoner—I deceived Coronel because he wanted to know how I got them—I did not tell Coronel where I lived—he asked me—I did not tell him "Bread-street," or anywhere—I made him no answer—he then put on his hat, and came after me—I swear I never mentioned Bread-street to him—I never gave my address as "Bread-street" to any one—always the true one—I could have given Coronel a false address, but I did not—I did not like to tell an untruth—I did not deceive Mr. Coronel—I have dealt with Jones at Newington—I am a witness against him—it was out of sorrow for my sins that I turned witness, no other reason—I do not exactly under<lb></lb>stand you—I wished Mr. Saltmer to have his property back—I told of this before I was threatened to be prosecuted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your solemn oath, did you tell one word until you were promised not to be prosecuted yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I did—Cuthbert told me that my master would not prosecute me if I told—I answered you before without thinking—my memory came back after seeing Cuthbert—I was not afraid he would contradict me—I said it quite in mistake—I understand the question—I do not know that it was to get off myself that I told the story—Cuthbert told me, over and over again, that I should be prosecuted unless I gave evidence—it was after that I told the story against the prisoner—I did not tell Cuthbert a word till he told me I should not be prosecuted—it is to save myself that I have come to give evidence, and also from sorrow for my sins, both—I do not think about being safe—I should not have told any thing unless I had thought I should be safe—I believe I should have done so now, because I am very sorry for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you care how many you convict, provided you get off yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not wish them to be hurt—I do not wish them to be convicted—if the Jury do not believe me, I think I should run the risk of being pro<lb></lb>secuted—I wish to convict the prisoner that I may save myself—whether I am prosecuted or not depends very much upon whether he is convicted; and the same with respect to Jones, if the Jury do not convict, I think I run the risk of being tried myself.</p>

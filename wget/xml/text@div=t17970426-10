               <p>Q. Do you know exactly which seized you, and knocked you down? - A. I cannot exactly say, but Smith was one of them; they wrenched the stick out of my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did they strike you? - A. In the side; they made off; I then pursued them down Brook-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you strike either of them? - A. Yes; I Struck Smith on the side of the head, so as to occasion a great deal of blood; I then pursued them, they ran different ways, I never lost sight of the two prisoners at all till they were taken by a watchman; when I came up, there was the blood upon his face occasioned by my striking him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.When did you first observe the prisoner Dyke, after they ran away? - A. At the corner of the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe Dyke, as well as Smith, at the time you were knocked down? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. This was a little after twelve at night? - A. Between twelve and one.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand you to speak only to the unfortunate deaf and dumb prisoner? - A. I never lost sight of them.</p>
               <p>Q. But the person you struck was Smith? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.I take it as to the persons of the others you could not speak positively to them? - A. I never lost sight of these two.</p>
               <p>Q. But I dare say other persons ran; the watchmen ran, did not they? - A. Yes; I was very near them at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it you must have been a great deal agitated and confused? - A. Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore you will not swear, when the life of the man is concerned, that Dyke, was one of the persons that struck you? - A. Yes; to the best of knowledge he is.</p>
               <p>Q.What sort of a night was this? - A.Rather moon-light.</p>

               <p>Q. I don't mean to be offensive, but you had been in company, I suppose? - A.- Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.You were returning home from dinner? - A. Yes; I had drank about a bottle of wine, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. A bottle of wine, now and then, makes a man a little merry? - A. I was perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that Dyke was particularly active? - A. He and the other persons talked together.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean to say that the prisoner Smith made any signs, or any thing of that sort, to the other prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Before you were knocked down you were hustled? - A. Yes; and then I was knocked down by the whole party together.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const.</p>
               <p>I am a watchman of St. James's parish; Between twelve and one o'clock I heard the rattles go from St. George's parish, I was sitting upon a bench in my box, in Cork-street, nobody could see me; I heard a cry of stop thief, and Dyke came running up, and I met him and laid hold of him; he came up Vigo-lane from out of Bond-street, and so turned into Cork-street, and there I stopped him; Captain Askew and the St. George's watchman came up almost immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had Dyke in custody, how soon after did you see Smith? - A. In about three minutes after; as we were going to the watch-house with Dyke, Smith came up between Vigo-lane and Cork-street, just at the corner; he came up and made some signs to Dyke, he put his hand up to his head, I suppose, to tell him he had been hurt; when we were going to the watch-house, says Dyke, d-n my eyes if it was me that struck the gentleman, or took his hat off, for it was the deaf and dumb man.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you very correct in what you now say? - A. Yes, I am very sure of it, as we were conveying him to the watch-house; I naturally thought that we had got this deaf and dumb man in custody, and I desired him to be taken into custody immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whereabouts O'Donnell found the hat? - A. Yes, I was witness to it; it was down an area in Cork-street.</p>
               <p>Q.Must he have passed it in order to get to where you saw him? - A. Yes; the deaf and dumb man made signs to the captain, as if it was the captain that had hurt him, and he pointed to Dyke likewise.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.This poor unfortunate foolish deaf and dumb man walked up to you when you were all together as if nothing was the matter? - A. Yes, he met us.</p>
               <p>Q. The poor man, as if he did not know what he was about, came up to you, and walked with, you? - A. Yes; he endeavoured to make his escape, and so did Dyke, till the patrol took out his cutlass.</p>
               <p>GEORGE HALLIDAY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. Q. When Dyke was in custody, and going to the watch-house, do you remember his saying any thing? - A. I went up to Cork-street and secured him by the collar; in coming along, he seemed very obstinate, and wanted to make some resistance; I took out my cutlass, and told him I would lay his head open, and then he went very quietly; he said it was not him, that it was the deaf and dumb man that knocked the gentleman down.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you are correct in that? - A. Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where the hat was found? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Must they have passed that spot? - A. Yes, they must.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.You took these two men into custody and do not know which way the other two men went? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore they might have gone this way and thrown the hat there for any thing you know? - A. They might.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Were you at the watch-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Had they each a hat on at the watch-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. (To Captain Askew.) Q. Look at that hat; is that the one you lost? - A. It is, I am perfectly sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Dyke's defence. I had been at a public-house in Green-street, and stopped there and had my supper, till half past eleven o'clock; I was going along Oxford-street and Smith overtook me, and was going the same way as me, and we past that gentleman; I believe that gentleman was drunk, he tumbled against us, and the dumb man turned round to look at him, and then he struck him with his stick; the dumb man did not offer to hit him again, but he called the watch, and I made off then.</p>
               <p>Smith's defence. (Interpreted by his brother.) I went to get between two people, and one of them struck me upon the head; the gentleman tumbled down, and I saw the hat but I do not know whose it was, I kicked it before me; the other man and I were walking along together; the gentleman struck me with a stick several times.</p>
               <p>For Dyke.</p>
               <p>HENRY THORNGATE sworn. - I keep the Pelham-Arms, in George-street, Grosvenor-square: He was a lodger of mine for three years when I kept the Roe-buck; he always paid me very honestly, and was very seldom out after eleven; he has not lodged with me since I have been in this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179704260016"></xptr>house; the night that this happened he supped at my house, in the bar, along with me and my wife, and another gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the other prisoner in company with him? - A. No, there was nobody with him; I perceived he was in liquor, and my wife wished him to stop all night, but he could not think of sleeping from home.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. What time did he go away? - A. At half past eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw any thing of him afterwards? - A. No; he is as worthy a fellow as ever lived, he was very much intoxicated.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Dyke called three other witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Three witnesses were called for Smith, who gave him a good character.</p>

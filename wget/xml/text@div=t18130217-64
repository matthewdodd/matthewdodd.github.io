I lost my pocket-book on the 4th of this month, about one o'clock in the morning. I had been to Covent Garden play-house. I was quite a stranger to that part of London. I was lost; and I asked the watchman to put me into the road to Holborn. I took him into a house, and treated him with a pot of beer.

I fell asleep in the public-house. I felt my pocket-book; it was safe in my under coat. I buttoned my great coat over it, in order that it might be safe. I dozed or sleeped about twenty minutes, and when I awaked it was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What did it contain - A. One Bank of England note, dated January 8, 1813. When I got up out of my seat, I told the landlord I had lost my pocketbook, and what was in it. He said, he was very sorry; he saw nothing of it. I went out of the house, and into the street, and two girls directed me to Bow-street-office. I went to Bow-street office, and staid all night.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the prisoners - A. I think I saw the prisoner with the light coat on; I am not certain.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Martin's. On Thursday, the 4th of this month, I was called up by one of the patrols of Bow-street to go to the Duke's Head, in St. Martin's-street, Liecester-fields. I went there, and as I was going along I had some information give me. I went into the house. I searched the prisoner, Watson, and in Watson's right hand breeches pocket I found a one-pound bank note. I asked him where he got this note. He told me, that he had given change for it to a fare that he had carried. This was about a quarter to three in the morning. I found some silver. I took that away from him. I then asked the landlord, where was the man that came in along with Chaffy; meaning Watson. Watson goes by the name of Chaffy. Breze was pointed out to me. I went to Breze; he was sitting seemingly asleep, by himself; and on searching Breze I found this pocket-book in his pocket. I then said to Lewis, search the remaining part. Breze said he got that pocket-book from Chaffy.</p>

The landlord of the Granby's head gave the description of the men that had been there. Edwards and I traced them to a house in St. Martin's-street. Edwards went for Donaldson. We all three went, and Watson was sitting by the fire. Breze was asleep in another box.

            . I keep the Granby's head watering-house. Mr. Tipler came into my house and called for a pot of porter, about one o'clock. He had two watchman with him. Breze the prisoner was there, and Watson came in soon after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Tipler fall asleep - A. I did not. When I had an opportunity I awoke Tipler. He said, he had lost his pocket-book. I said you cannot have lost it here. He said, he was sure he had it in his pocket before he fell asleep; he had lost it there. I directly sent to Bow-street office for an officer. Lewis came. I stated the case to him that Tipler had lost his pocket-book in my house. I said, if you go to a house in St. Martin's-street it is very likely you will find them. They went there and found the two prisoners and the property.</p>

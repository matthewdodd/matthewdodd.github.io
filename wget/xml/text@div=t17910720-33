I have found nothing since but a chalk-line, and one of the punches; the prisoner had worked with me about ten days: he robbed me on the Wednesday, and was taken on the Sunday, and the chalk-line and punch found on him.</p>

               <p>I was at work at a gentleman's house in Hampstead, I could not do without a wrench of this kind; I never borrowed one of Mr. Wright, or of the boy. I always worked by myself; that very Wednesday, as he says he lost the tools, I could have had three witnesses where I slept that night; I have a wife that I expected lived along with Counsellor Kent, and I know Squire Kent; I had not seen her for a long time, I had occasion to go down that night to look for her, I slept at the Nag's-head; I did not know when my trial came on; on the Sunday following in the morning, I came to this Hampstead, on purpose to meet this wife of mine there; which if I had stolen these tools, would any gentleman reasonably think I should go there back again; I went to the house, my master challenged me, and I went with him into his yard; I was greatly surprised, these gentlemen all said that they had a very plain proof and witness that I took them. When the watchman came he said that he did not know me, that he could not swear to me; no man can swear to the wrench, I have had the wrench above a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. By what circumstance do you know that wrench to be your's? - By having the fellow to it; they were both made out of one file; I am sure it was in the basket that evening.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. No man can swear to the wrench.</p>

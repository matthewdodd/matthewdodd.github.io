                  </hi>. I am twelve years old, and live at 4, Kennington Oval—on 10th May, about half-past 9 or 10 at night, I was standing at my mother's door, and the prisoner called me over and asked me whether I would fetch her half a quartern of gin—I said I would go and call my mother—she said, "Very well, then, and I will give you a halfpenny, when you come back"—she gave me a bottle and a half-crown, and told me to go to the Clayton Arms, Mr. Silbourne's—I went there and asked for the gin—Mr. Silbourne said the half-crown was bad—I came out with him, and we went up the street to look for the prisoner, but could not see her—I was taken to the police-station about 1 o'clock in the night and saw her there; she is the same person.</p>

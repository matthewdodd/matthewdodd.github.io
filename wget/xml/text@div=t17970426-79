               <p>Q. Had you time to observe the faces of these men when they robbed you? - A. No, I could not; because they knocked my hat over my eyes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe their clothes? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say with certainty, when the constable brought that one back, whether it was one of the men or not? - A. Yes; because it was the size, and the colour of the coat.</p>
               <p>Q. When the other man came to the watch-house, how came you to know him? - A. By his clothes; he had a white great coat on.</p>

               <p>Q. The day was pretty near shut in; it was getting dark? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you could not see quite so well as if it had been day-light? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never had an opportunity of seeing the person's faces at all? - A. No; I saw them run.</p>
               <p>Q.Even, when you did see them afterwards, when the constable led the one in, and the other came voluntarily into the watch-house, you could only speak to them from their clothes and their size? - A. I knew their clothes and their size.</p>
               <p>Q. You have, perhaps, in the course of your life, seen just such a coat as that before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The other man you know by the size; you have seen a great many men about the same size? - A. Yes, to be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. You never had an opportunity of seeing the faces of either of them, because they put your hat immediately over your face? - A. Yes.</p>

On the morning of 29th April, about twenty minutes to 2 o'clock, I saw the prisoners in High-street, Woolwich, loitering about—I went over and asked them where they came from—Williams and Hill said that they came from Northampton, and were shoe<lb></lb>makers—Johnson said he was a tailor—another constable came up, and we followed them into George-street—I stopped them, and found these house<lb></lb>breaking implements (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on Hill, and a candle and matches—we took them in custody, searched them, and found 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on Williams, 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on Johnson, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on Hill—I afterwards met the prosecutor—he was terribly injured and covered with bloods I took him to the station, and showed the prisoners to him with three others placed with them, and he picked these three out of the six—he said that they knocked him down and kicked him, and he begged they would not kill him—they denied it—he said he had lost a half-sovereign, two florins, a sixpence, and a 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece—I have seen him since in St. Bartholomew's Hospital yesterday afternoon, with a broken arm in two places—he has been knocked down by an omnibus, and is confined to his bed in the accident ward—I was present when he was examined before the Magistrate in the prisoners' presence—they had the opportunity of cross-examining him—(<hi rend="italic">The deposition of William Butler was here read as follows</hi>; "I live at 2, Hog-lane, Woolwich, and am a labourer.

My face was covered with blood from the injuries I received while down. I went to the station-house with him, and he brought out six men I identified the three prisoners who were amongst them as the three that had ill-used me. There was a gas-light about half a dozen yards from where they attacked me, and I had an opportunity of seeing their features. I was not drunk. I had been drinking, but knew well what I was about.

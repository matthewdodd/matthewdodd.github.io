The prisoner was porter in the employ of myself and my partner up to the time of his being taken into cus<lb></lb>tody—I have not missed a horse-cloth—I cannot say that we have lost one—here is a horse-cloth which I believe to be ours—it is of the same pat<lb></lb>tern and kind that we usually keep in our stock—they are not very un<lb></lb>common in the trade—we are saddlers' ironmongers.</p>

                  </hi>. I have known the prisoner about six months—on the 31st of March be came to me at the White Bear with this horse-cloth in this paper—he asked me to have half a pint of beer—I thanked him—he wrote upon this paper, and told me to take it, and if be did not come back presently, I was to walk about the Minories—he did not come, and I did walk the Minories.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable. I was called to take charge of the prisoner—I went to his house in Talbot-court, Gracechurch-street—he came home at twelve o'clock—I asked him where he got that parcel from—he said from his master's warehouse—I was talking about this rug—I then asked what he was going to do with it—his first answer was, that it was going where it was directed.</p>

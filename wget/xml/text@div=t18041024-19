               <p>Q. What was the money of the draft? - A. Thirteen pounds seventeen shillings and sixpence; I had no change to give him the difference; I do not know whether he gave me the draft, or somebody else; I asked him if he would wait till I ran to Drummonds' and Co. and get the change; I told him I should not be gone long; he said he would call in the evening for the difference; he offered to leave the goods; I told him, no, there was no occasion for that; I was going to the West end of the town that night, I called at Drummond's, and offered that draft, and it was refused.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take him up? - A. I do not exactly recollect the day.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find him at home? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the price of the wig? - A.Five guineas.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180410240011"></xptr>Q. Should you know the draft again if you saw it? - A. I should not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. He had been at your house before? - A. Yes, I had seen him several times before; he was a remarkable person.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not want to take the wig away? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He offered to leave the wig; you telling him you would go to Messrs. Drummonds'? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This was about the distance of two miles and a half; Messrs. Drummonds' is at Charing-cross? - A. Yes, I told him he might take the wig.</p>
               <p>Q. And you took the check to Messrs. Drummonds', and it was refused; how soon after that did you part with that draft? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take it away from Messrs. Drummonds'? - A. O yes, I took it away, and I gave it to my father, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the draft again? - A. I cannot say exactly; about six weeks after I saw it at the office, when the prisoner was taken up.</p>
               <p>- READ sworn. - I am cashier to Messrs. Drummonds' bank, at Charing-cross.</p>
               <p>Q.What are the partners' names? - A.

             sworn. I am a constable belonging to the office in Worship-street, on the 14th of August I apprehended the prisoner at the outside door of this court with a city constable, he was inside of the court and I called him out, and he came out, I was not certain of the prisoner's person; I asked him his name; he told me his name was Rippingham; I asked him if his father lived in Ratcliff highway; he said, yes: I then told him that there was an information lodged against him at Worship street office, on suspicion of having committed a forgery on Mr. Ross, in Bishopsgate-street; his answer was, that he had sent a friend to Mr. Ross to compromise that business, and that Mr. Ross had promised his friend that he would not proceed any farther for the present; he was then taken before the Lord Mayor, and there he was ordered to be taken before the Magistrate in Worship-street; this check I received from Mr. Ross, the elder; it was marked on the back by Mr. Ross.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. When you apprehended him his observation was, that he had sent a friend to compromise the business with Mr. Ross; was not that the expression; and he thought it was settled? - A. No, it was not.</p>
               <p>ALEXANDER ROSS, sen. sworn. - Q. You are the father of the first witness? - A. Yes. My lord, I am in that situation in life, that I should be sorry for any person to think I should compromise this business.</p>
               <p>Court. A thousand things may be said behind your back, that does not attach upon you.</p>
               <p>Q. From whom did you receive this check? - A. Mrs. Ross brought up the check to me, and asked if I would give the difference; I said, I will not give any change; the check was given to my clerk, and it was in my possession some time; I thought it might be a fraud, and I sent two or three people after him; and I went after him myself to his father; I said, you are the father of him; tell him to come and take the check; I had no idea of it being a forgery.</p>
               <p>Q. The check which the officer Vickery has produced to day, and was produced before the Magistrate, you swear you had it from your clerk, and who he had it from, you yourself do not know personally? - A. I do not.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing about the draft? - A. Very little.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see that draft before? (The draft handed to him.) - A. I have seen it before in my master's clerks hands, and in Mr. and Mrs. Ross's hands; I am not positive whether I had it in my own hands or not.</p>
               <p>Q. If you did not have it in your own hands, how do you know it is the same draft? - A. Because I have seen Mrs. Ross and several people reading of it; I cannot swear to it.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Ross, jun.) You look at that draft, is that the same draft you received from the prisoner? - A. I cannot swear positively to that, because it was not in my possession.</p>
               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to character.</p>

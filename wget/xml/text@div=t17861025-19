               <p>I am one of the horse patrol on the New Road; I was on horseback that evening between eight and nine; I saw the prisoner near the Reservoir about six o'clock with some lead on his shoulders; I met him between the Angel at Islington, and Penton-street; I asked him what he had got; he said he had wood, and that he had found it; I carried the man to the Angel at Islington, and I have kept the lead ever since; in the Saturday morning, when we came to the Rotation, I told the workman if he cut off a piece, where this came from, if it was the same it must match; as such he brought a piece which matches with this piece; it is like indenture; they do not cut it strait.</p>
               <p>Did it appear newly cut? - I did not examine it more than I do now, but at the Rotation office I examined it, and it appeared to be lead that had been newly cut; we only opened it at one end to match it to the piece that we had got.</p>
               <p>Did you go to the building to match it? - No, the man's name is White; he is here; the piece that White brought to me matched with the lead. When I first saw the man with lead, he might be about two hundred yards from the building; I searched him, and found a knife upon him.</p>

On the 7th of October I went to work; our tools lay up at the top of the house; and when we came up, we found the rain had beat in, and the roof had been stripped of the lead; there were about eight or nine feet in length missing; one piece lays over the other, not joined; I was out on the roof, on the Friday, and saw it all safe; on the Saturday morning, Cox the patrol came to enquire if any lead had been lost; then we examined the house, and found some missing, and we went down to the Angel, and there was the lead; the patrol shewed me the lead, and to prove it, I cut off a piece from the roof, and found it matched with this lead.</p>

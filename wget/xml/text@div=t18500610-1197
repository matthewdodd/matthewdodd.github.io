                  </hi>. I am a solicitor. On 29th May, I was return<lb></lb>ing from the Derby—I saw the prisoner, who was acting as guard to one of the coaches—I asked him for two places for myself and a friend—he spoke to some persons, and we were allowed to get on the box, but it was agreed that if a passenger returned, one should get on the roof—it was not agreed then what I should pay the prisoner, but on the road home it was, and I paid him 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., that was 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a piece for myself and friend before I arrived in town—Church was the coachman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Charles Edward Matson—on the Derby-day I was at Epsom—I drove the coach to which the prisoner was acting as guard—I did not know of any extra passengers—I did not see Mr. Gale taken on the coach—I did not receive any money from him—I received a sovereign from the prisoner previous to going in the morn<lb></lb>ing—I did not receive any money for passengers taken at Epsom—if he took any money be did not pay it me.</p>

            . I live near McMin. I saw several boys running with the calico; I believe the prisoner was one of them; I did not think so at first (I saw a bigger boy tie it in his handkerchief) but when I looked at the prisoner minutely, I knew him - they dropped the calico - I took it back - I lost sight of them for ten minutes.</p>

            . I am a weaver, and live in Tabernacle-walk. I went in pursuit of the prisoner, and met Venicomb at the end of York-place - she said, "There they are;" and I saw the prisoner close to a bigger boy, who dropped the bundle, which she took up - the prisoner crossed the road, and I took him.</p>

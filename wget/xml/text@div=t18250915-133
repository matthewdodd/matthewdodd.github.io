               <p>JAMES GARBETT re-examined. Q. Did you give her any money? A. Yes - I gave her 6 s. or 7 s. before she went to bed. I had more money taken from my purse, and the purse was found under the mattress.</p>
               <p>Prisoner SMITH. He mentioned at the Office that he had given me the watch; he was very drunk, and I did not wish to take it, but he said he had rather I had it than the landlady.</p>
               <p>PROSECUTOR. I have said nothing but the truth - I did not give her the watch. I believe I had been with another girl in the house, and met Smith as I was coming out. I saw the watch, snuff-box, and money safe when I went to bed.</p>

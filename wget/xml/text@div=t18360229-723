                  </hi>. I am fourteen years old. I am the prisoner's son, and the boy who is dead was my brother—my mother sells fruit in the street—I remember one sunday, (I cannot tell how long ago,) my mo<lb></lb>ther went out to sell fruit—she is a window—she left me and my bro<lb></lb>ther Edward at home—she said she would be at home about four or five o'clock, and she told me to light a fire about four o'clock, and boil a bit of meal—I did not do so—I had just lighted the fire, when she came home—I had not put on the meat, she was very angry at it—I asked if I should take the basket off her head, she said, "No, why did you not light the fire before?"—I was saucy, I am apt to be so—I was very such to her that night—she is obliged to <hi rend="italic">strap</hi> me sometimes—I do not know what she was going to do then, but she was very angry, and I outside the door—my brother was in the room when I went out—it was dark, there was no light there—my mother did mot speak to my brother when she came in—I do not know whether she saw him—he was four years and eight months old—I staid outside the door—I did not go down stairs—I said I was glad I had not lighted the fire, and then ran out of the room—I had not been out a minute, before I heard my brother <hi rend="italic">sing</hi> out, "Oh, <hi rend="italic">mammy, mammy</hi>"—I came back to the room about eight or nine o'clock, and slept with my brother—I did not see that anything was the matter with him—he was not asleep when I came home—my mother said, "You are a nice boy, see how I have bit the child on the head"—we all slept together in one bed—she said she had hit him on the head with the poker—I do not know on what day he was taken to the hospital—my mother ap<lb></lb>peared very sorry when she heard how ill he was.</p>

                  </hi>. I live on Holborn-hill. The prisoner lived on Saffron-hill—I remember her bringing a child, about four or five years old, to me one Sunday evening—I do not remember the date—it had a per<lb></lb>forated wound on the forehead—I could not discover any part of the brain—it was not deep enough—I advised her to take it to the hospital—I have not seen the poker—I advised some simple application for the present—I do not remember that I saw the child again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a house surgeon at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. I remember the child being brought to the hospital by the prisoner, who seemed in great distress—it was early in the November—I do not remember the day of the month—I found a small fracture right through the skull, in the upper part of the left side of the forehead—I did not ask her how it happened, nor did she tell me—I saw a poker at the Inquest—that was exactly such an instrument as night have produced a wound an the head the child died on the 11th of February—I believe it lived exactly three months, to a day the head was opened after death—the child had a of the brain, and a great deal of fluid chused into the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sister of St. Bartholomew's Hospital. I remember the child being brought here—the prisoner came afterwards to see it, and always appeared in great distress—when she brought the child in I was very busy, and did not hear what she said; but a few days afterwards she said she had been out all day selling fruit, and came home at night expecting her supper ready—she was very angry with the boy because he had not got it, and he was very saucy to her—that she took the poker, in<lb></lb>tending to frighten him, but he went out of the room, and the little boy who she did not see came in, and it bit him—she said she had thrown the poker.</p>

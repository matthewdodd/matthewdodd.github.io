                  </hi>. I am a detective-officer of the City police—about 4 o'clock on the afternoon of 23d December, I was in Leadenhall-street, and saw the prisoner—I saw him put his hand into the prosecutrix's pocket, and shortly after withdraw it closed, with a piece of paper in it—I saw the piece of paper—he tore it up, and threw the pieces on the pavement—I then spoke to the lady, and from what she said to me I picked up the pieces of paper—these are the pieces, pasted together—the prisoner left Leadenhall-street—I remained about there a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, and then saw him again—I took him into custody, and told him it was for picking a lady's pocket of 2 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a piece of paper in Leadenhall-street a short time previously—he said, "You are mistaken; I never did such a thing in my life"—I took him to the police-station, and searched him; nothing was found on him—he gave a name and address, at which, when I made inquiries, he was not known—I am not mistaken in him; I had an opportunity of observing him about twenty minutes or half an hour—I had seen him twelve or fourteen times.</p>

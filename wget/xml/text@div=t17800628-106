               <p>I belong to the Rotation-office in Litchfield-street; I was at Lord Mansfield's house with the magistrates a little before four o'clock on the Wednesday morning on which the house was destroyed; at about half after four I had an information that some of Lord Mansfield's property was at the house of the prisoner. I went to the house, and told the prisoner I was come to look for some things which came from Lord Mansfield's. While I turned my back to look in the lower room she went to the stair-case; I followed her immediately up stairs.</p>
               <p>Who gave you the information? - I took two people who used to lodge in the house with some of the property on them; they gave me an information that there were more things in the house. I saw the prisoner put this gown under the head of the bed; I laid hold of her and the gown together. She said that was all she had; she said it was given her by a man she did not know at Lord Mansfield's house. This is the gown (producing it.)</p>

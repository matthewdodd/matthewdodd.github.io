             gave an Account , that he was at his Door, and saw a Croud of People coming along from the Show; that a lame Boy was knocked down by somebody ; but he does not apprehend there was any Robbery; for if they were grand Thieves (and he does not take them to be Thieves) it was very unlikely a Robbery should be committed at that Time; and that he never heard any Ill of the Prisoners .</p>

            . Tuesday in Christmas Week, about Eight in the Evening , I was coming over this broad Place, and saw a Man come up to this lame Man, and knock him down - It was the Day after Boxing Day - It was a black, well-set Man, in his own Hair, [This Description did not suit either of the Prisoners ] that knocked him down, and then he took him by the Collar; with that he cried out, You will throttle me. I saw him take a Stock off his Neck, and put it into his Pocket, and then I heard him say, He has took my Stock, my Clasp, and my Money . - I saw five Persons in all, no more.</p>

               <p>Counc. How came you to come here to give Evidence?</p>

               <p>Buckle . Because I heard the Lad had received Damage by being robbed.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you hear that the Lad had been robbed?</p>


               <p>Buckle . I heard it one Day last Week.</p>

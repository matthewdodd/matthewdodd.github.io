             the prisoner came up to me, and without any thing previous passing, he accosted me in this way, d - mn you, you informer, are you alive?</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been a witness or an informer - A. None whatever. I asked him what he meaned by what he said? He said, I should know some day what he was, and then the other prisoner, Green, came up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any thing of either the prisoners - A. I had seen both the prisoners some time before in Oxford-street, but I did not know their names. When Green came up, he put his fist in my face, and challenged me to fight. I said, I did not get my bread by fighting, but by hard labour; but I thought I was as good a man as them. Green then left me; he came back again, and put his fist in my face. I tried to prevent him from hitting of me, but he knocked me down, and when he knocked me down the third time, I fell upon my hands and knees. Green then got hold of me by the waistband of my breeches. I then lost six one pound notes out of my pocket. I then cried out, that I was robbed, while Green was taking them out of my pocket I afterwards got into the Green Man. Green followed me in. I got away from Green, and got into the street again. I then saw the prisoner Kenyon; in about three minutes after, and at this time Leigh had the money in his hands.</p>
               <p>Q. This was in Oxford-street, a crowded thoroughfare - A. At the time I was first accosted, there were very few people there at that time, if any passing. I do not know of any persons but the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you quarrelled with them, or done any thing so as to cause them to have any malice against you - A. No, neither of them had any cause to have any spite against me. The notes were in my left breeches pocket.</p>

            . At this time I was in Oxford-street. I heard the prosecutor, Amos, insulted by Kenyon, who charged him with being an informer. Amos asked him what he meant by saying that he was an informer. Kenyon said, he would tell him some time. Green came up and said he would serve him out. He said, you bloody b - r, I will beat your brains out; and after saying that he left Amos, and then Kenyon came up; he put his fist in his face, and said he would serve him out. Kenyon called to Green, Green came up again to Amos, and said d - mn your eyes, I will do it, or something of that sort, and the moment he said that, he struck Amos very severely. Amos said he would not fight and endeavoured to get away; and after being knocked down the third time, Amos endeavoured to get into the coffee house, he cried out he was robbed of six pound notes, and directly a roll of paper fell to the ground. I heard Amos hollow out that he was robbed. I likewise saw de Labertauche pick it up. Kenyon said to De Labertauche they were his partner's. De Labertauche refused to give them up, saying, they were not his, they were the butcher's; then Kenyon by force wrestled them from De Labertauche's hand, d - n your eyes, I will have the money, and if you say another word I will poke your bloody eyes out with the umbrella; pointing the umbrella to his eyes. A crowd was collected at that time. Kenyon got out of the crowd, I followed him. Kenyon crossed Oxford-street; and went up Bolsover-street, and then turned to the left, and went up Portland-street. I then perceived Kenyon go quicker. I ran after him, and asked him if he had not got notes that were not his own; he said, yes here they are. I received them in my left hand. I told Kenyon he must come back; and that I would not put the notes in my pocket until I had counted them; accordingly I counted them in the public-house, the sign of the Cock, but before I counted them, I gave Kenyon in the charge of an officer. The notes consisted of six one pound bank notes, the number of notes that Amos complained of being robbed. We came down to Marlborough-street; the magistrate was not sitting. The constable locked Kenyon up, and I went into a room and marked the notes, in the presence of two officers.</p>
               <p>Q. You were sure they were the same notes that you received of the prisoner Kenyon - A. Yes, I kept them in my possession. I put them in a sheet of paper and sealed them up in the presence of Alexander and Petherick; and on Tuesday, I delivered them into the prosecutor's hands. This happened on Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass in conversation between you and Amos - A. I never saw any of the parties before that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner refuse being taken in custody - A. He offered me a one pound note, and a bottle of wine, if I would let him go.</p>

George Green came back and struck Amos violently, and went away; and when he came back again, he knocked him down violently, three or four times.

            . I was passing the end of Swallow-street. I was going to Mr. Obey's in Oxford-street. I saw a mob, and I saw the prisoners, Kenyon and Green, accusing Amos of something; I do not know what. Green asked him to fight. He said he did not want to fight. Green knocked Amos down three or four times; then Kenyon came up and said he would serve him out. He called Green back; Green came, and knocked Amos down. Amos then went to crawl into the Green Man, and Green hauled him out by the waistband of his breeches. I saw some paper fall, it looked like tissue paper, or note paper; it fell from Amos's pocket, or somewhere that way. It fell when Green and Amos were together. De Labertauche picked it up, and said he would keep it for the butcher, it was his money. Kenyon said, it was his partner's, and if he did not give it up he would knock his eye out with the umbrella. Kenyon laid hold of his hand, and by wrenching it about, got it out of his hands. Kenyon, when he had got the money, rushed out of the mob; with violence he wrenched it out of his hands, the boy would hardly part with it. Mr. Leigh followed Kenyon and laid hold of him. Leigh told him, he had got some money that did not belong to him, and took it from him, and went into a public-house, and counted six notes. I went with him and saw it counted, and I went with him to Marlborough-street. I never had Kenyon out of my sight, until he was taken to Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Green did not go with Kenyon - A. I do not know where Green was; I was engaged in the pursuit of Kenyon.</p>
               <p>Q. to Amos. Have you got the notes - A. No, I have not. I had the notes of Mr. Leigh. I paid them away; they were marked R. L.</p>
               <p>Kenyon's Defence. The prosecutor and Leigh have received 3 l. of my wife, and the butcher received 2 l. over and above the money extorted from my wife.</p>
               <p>Green's Defence. I was the man that was fighting with Amos, and that by his own wish. We had some words; he stopped Kenyon, and he had some words. I ran back again; we fought, and while we were fighting he dropped this money. I followed him into the Green Man; from there I followed them to Marlborough-street office; and from there I went home to Pimlico. I never had any intention of robbing him, nor did I know that Kenyon took any of his money. If I had picked up an hundred pound of his money, I should have taken it into the Green Man and Still, and gave it to the gentleman there.</p>

               <p>Green called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

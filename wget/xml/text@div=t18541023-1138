                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Thomas Harvey, of No. 4. Grove Road, Hackney. On 28th Sept., about 8 o'clock in the, evening, I was in the kitchen, ironing, and heard a noise at the top of the house—I went up into the parlour, and not seeing anything, I went down again; still I kept hearing the noise that I first heard—I went up stairs again, and in passing along the hall, I heard footstep over my head; I then quietly walked to the street door, took down the key, and locked the door after me—after I got out of the gate, I locked it after me, and on looking up, I saw a light on the second floor—I went to the police station, which is about ten minutes' walk, gave information, and eight or nine police constables went back with me—I unlocked the door, and went up stairs with them—I found the top attic window Open, also the drawers pushed from the window to the side of the bed—previous to my hearing the noise, that window had been shut; I had shut it, and fastened it at 7 o'clock in the evening.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the window fastened? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I had fastened it myself—I looked at the drawers in the next room, and found a drawer broken open in the front attic—nothing at all, that I am aware, of, was taken out of that drawer—I found a great coat removed from the door on to the bed; that was on the door at 7 o'clock that evening—I had shut and locked the next room door, and had the key in my pocket; I found the door broken open—there was a box in that room shut, but there was a box containing linen, open; I found the things in that box scattered about on the top of the box.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, M</hi> 228). Mr. Thomas Harvey's house is in the parish of St. John's, Hackney. At 8 o'clock on 28th Sept., I was on duty in Hackney Grove—the last witness came to me—I went to the back of the house, No. 4; another constable took the front—after being there two minutes, I saw the prisoner, James, escape out of No. 4, which is Mr. Harvey's house—I saw him run along the parapet, and go into No. 3, which is an unoccupied house—he placed himself against the back door—I had not remained there above ten minutes, before the assistance of another constable came, Charles Knight, when both the prisoners made their appearance at the back parlour window—James spoke first; he said, "It is a settled case with us, we cannot get away, and the best b—y man you have got, come in and take us"—I did not hear Turner say anything—I saw James come out of the attic window, No. 4, run along the parapet, and go into No. 3; I placed myself against the back door, and waited till the constable, Charles Knight, entered the house, and took James—I followed after, and took Turner into custody—we took them to the station house—I searched Turner, and found a pocket book, three half pence, and seven lucifers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I also found a pair of snuffers.</p>

            . I am a drover, in the employ of Mr. Gay, who lives in Norfolk. I came up with these sheep, and assisted to put them into the lair - I went on Monday morning, at two o'clock, to take them; I found them in a different lair to the one I left them in: I counted them out of the gate, and there were but one hundred and twenty-seven - I should have had one hundred and twenty-eight; there were fifty-nine which I had from Mr. Barrell, marked with what is called a bounce mark on the shoulder, and forty-four or forty-five marked with an old brand-mark on each side, and three or four with an old mark, that we could not say what it was; they were put altogether on the Sunday evening; when I got them out of the lair I missed one; I was going up Mile-end-road, and met two of Conder's men coming back for another flock; they told me they had got one of mine at Smithfield; this was about half-past two o'clock, while I was driving the sheep to market; I got to Smithfield about four o'clock; I met Mr. Lee in Long-lane, and said to him, "I am one sheep short - I do not know whether it is one of yours;" Conder then told me the sheep was in Mr. French's pens in Smithfield; I parted Mr. Lee's sheep from the others, and found it was one of his that was missing; whether it was branded over, or whether it was the old brand-mark, I cannot say; I did not go to Mr. French's pens, for Mr. Lee said if the sheep was there he would let it be till it was day-light, as it was safe enough - I then went away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Are you sure it was one hundred and twenty-eight sheep you had in the whole on the overnight? A. Yes; they were put in the lair about five o'clock; I saw there were forty-four or forty-five with the brand-mark.</p>

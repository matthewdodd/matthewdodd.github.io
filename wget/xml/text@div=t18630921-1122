                  </hi>. I reside at South Mimms, near Minhall Farm—on 17th September I was going to Potter's Bar station, and saw the prisoner coming out of a field in the occupation of Mr. William Geddes; he was about twenty yards from a stack of stubble which had been just set on fire—there was nobody else there—I called to him, and asked him who had been setting the stack on fire; he said, "It is not on fire"—I said, "There is nobody here but you, you must have done it"—he said that he did not—a person came up, and I sent a message to Mr. Geddes—the prisoner said that he saw a man coming across the field with a straw hat on, in the direction in which I had come; I had seen no one with a straw hat—there is no footpath in the field.</p>

               <p>prisoner in the Hatfield-road—I told him that the rick was on fire, and I suspected him of being in the field—he said that he knew nothing about it—I said, "Yes, you must, because you have been telling people as you came along of the occurrence"—a little while afterwards he said, "It was not me, it was a man with a straw hat and a flannel jacket"—I took him to the station, and after he was remanded I pressed him very closely to describe the man with the straw hat and flannel jacket; he made a stop, and said, "Well, there was no man, I had but one match and I lit it with that match; I was so very hungry I did not know what to do."</p>

Ye Bitch you, says I, you're mistaken in your Man; I'm not for your Turn. I had hardly spoke, when another Woman took hold of me, and cry'd, Hip! when immediately the Prisoner came up, with a Stick in his Hand, and holding it over me, God damn your Blood, says he, if you offer to resist, or speak a Word, I'll knock you down. With that the 2d Woman began to rifle me, and took 2 Half-Guineas out of my Pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. O you wicked Man! how can you swear so falsly? I am above 60 Years of Age, and never did an ill Thing in my Life.</p>
               <p>Saxon. I swear nothing but the Truth: He stood over me with a Stick all the while the Woman was searching my Pockets. At last I thought I might as well lose my Life as my Money, and seeing a little Light at a Distance, I called Watch! Watch! Upon which, the Prisoner and the 2 Women endeavour'd to make off, but the Watch coming up, they were all taken and carried to the Watch-house. I know not how it came about, but the Watchmen let him go. I happen'd to see him again next Day, by the Waterside: He presently took Boat, and I took another, but he got among the Ships, and so I lost Sight of him at that Time. About a Fortnight after, as I was drinking at an Alehouse, a Man came and told me that the Prisoner was at the Compter-Gate ; upon which I got a Constable, and seized him a second Time, and so he was committed to the Compter. But some how or other he found Means<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173204190008"></xptr> to get out again; whether by precuring common Bail, or by what other Means I know not. But a Fortnight ago, I heard where his Lodging was, and took him a third Time.</p>
               <p>Court. Will you ask this Witness any Questions?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I overtook my Wife and another Woman with the Prosecutor in Leadenball-street, and he ask'd her to do so and so - but I don't know what it was; they had been at the Pewter Pot together, but -</p>
               <p>Court. You are not now to go upon your Defence, you shall have Opportunity for that when the other Witnesses against you have given their Evidence; but if you have any Questions to ask this Witness, you may now propose them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Pray my Lord, ask him if I offer'd to strike him?</p>
               <p>Saxon. Yes; you threatned to knock me down if I made any Resistance.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You are a wicked forsworn Wretch, I am 60 Years of Age.</p>

A Fortnight ago, as I sat in the Warehouse, the Prosecutor and 2 Men came in between 10 and 11 at Night, and desir'd some Assistance to search for the Prisoner, who they had heard was some where in the Neighbourhood. I sent 2 Watchmen, and they went and brought him in. He staid in the Watch-house all Night, and next Morning he was carried before the Justice, and charged with the Robbery. He said, If Saxon swears this against me I shall be a dead Man; but I will make away with myself before I'll be hang'd.</p>

My Lord, I'll tell you the whole Truth as I hope to be saved ; I had been at Chelsea, and coming home between 9 and 10 at Night, in Leadenball street, I saw a Watchman with the Prosecutor and my Wife, and another Woman. I had got a great Cold, and was coughing as I came towards them. My Wife knew my Cough, and said, Here's my Husband. What's the Matter? says I, Why, says she, this Man charges me with picking his Pocket of 2 Half-Guineas. Upon that, as soon as ever the Prosecutor sees me, he catches hold of my Arm, and says, I charge you too. And so we all were taken to the Watch-house, and there the Constable ask'd him who it was that pick'd his Pocket? and he said, it was that other Woman. And then says the Constable, Why do you charge this Man and his Wife? I can't swear nothing against them, says he. Why then, says the Constable, they may go about their Business. With all my Heart, says he; and so we were discharged. The Prosecutor met me afterwards, as I was going on Board an India-man, and followed me a little Way, but then he turned back again. After that he met my Wife and the other Woman, and took them before Sir

She was in the Compter six Weeks, and when I went to see her there, he heard of it, and had me taken up. I am sixty Years of Age and better, and if any Man will say that I have committed the least Crime in all my Life, I desire to dye; and if I have ever committed any Crime, may I never be received into the Kingdom of Heaven.

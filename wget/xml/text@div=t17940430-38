On the 28th of February last, about nine o'clock I went into my own cellar, and his morning clothes hung up in the cellar, having some suspicion of him I had the curiosity to feel his pockets, and in his waistcoat pocket I found a little parcel, three slips of cambrick in this piece of paper, this was fast day, Friday; the Wednesday before I saw the piece that these came from, and had it in my hand, it was a remnant, two yards three eights; I saw it in my own shop; on looking at it I thought it was my cambrick. These that I have got in my hand are all slips cut off from that piece, the marked end and the fag end.</p>
               <p>Q. What appears on them? - On one of them is my private mark, on the other is two yards three eights, and the third slip<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300055"></xptr>has nothing at all; it is obvious for what they were cut off. I am perfectly satisfied it is my cambrick, I could swear to it see it any where; when I looked at it I thought it was my piece, and I took my stock book and found I had this piece, two yards and a half, we do not take the eighth; I sent for the constable and he was not in the way, I then sent to Mr. Kirby, and he sent me a couple of officers, and I gave him in charge; when he was taken in charge he said he found these pieces in the shop.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I believe you had his house searched where he lived? - I had, where he said he lived.</p>
               <p>Q. It was where his wife lived? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You found nothing there? - Because it was too late.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search his box? - He had nothing in his box, his box was at our house, there was nothing there.</p>
               <p>Q. This man was out at the time that you found this in his waistcoat pocket, he had leave to go that day? - He took leave and went out.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no employment for him, and he went out, he left this openly in the cellar? - He certainly did to be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. This was not wrapped up in any thing to conceal it? - It was secured up in a bit of paper very tight.</p>
               <p>Q. There are not many yards? - He has taken care of the other part.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that he has taken care of the rest? - There is no doubt of it, it strikes me so.</p>
               <p>Q. Who sells in your shop besides yourself? - Only my son.</p>
               <p>Q. If any body had bought a bit they might have dropped it in the shop? - There was none of it cut.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that, though your son is not here? - I will.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search the coat? was there any thing found there that you claimed? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search the breeches? - There were none.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you had this man of Mr. Gedge in Oxford-street? - No, I had him of Mr. Moon or Mr. Maul, in Bishopsgate-street.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you go to Mr. Gedge for his character? - I did, and he gave him a good one, and he had a very good one of his last master.</p>
               <p>Q. How came your son not to be here? - There was no occasion for him to be here.</p>
               <p>- ROBERTS sworn.</p>
               <p>I was sent for to apprehend this man, I did not search him, I searched his boxes, he gave me the key himself at the watch-house, I found, I believe, a waistcoat or two of his own, and their was a pair of ruffles found, but nothing that belonged to Mr. Webb.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>

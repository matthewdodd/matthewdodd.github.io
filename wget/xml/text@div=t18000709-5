               <p>Court. Q. Where was it? - A. In my parlour; I read an anonymous letter to him, I told I had found that a son of a Mr. Davis had got a blue coat made with my cloth; and likewise a coat and waistcoat for one Griffiths, a butcher, made of my cloth; and a black coat for Mr. Stafford; I told him there was likewise a coat, waistcoat, and small clothes, for the servant girl's father.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you made him any promise of forgiveness? - A. No; he said, the cloth that the coat was made at for Mr. Davis's son, he had had by him for twelve years; then he wished to speak to me alone; he asked forgiveness, and confest he had taken silks, and velvets, and trimmings, to a great amount; I told him I could not forgive him, the law must take its course; I then went with him to his lodgings in Market-lane, St. James's, where we found nintey-nine duplicates of coats, waistcoats, and cloths.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Mr. Davis, or Mr. Griffiths, before? - A. No; I saw the coats at Bow-street; I have no doubt but they were coats made out of cloth taken from my warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q.What was the value of the cloth for Davis's coat? - A. A guinea and a half.</p>
               <p>Q.What was Griffiths's cloth worth? - A.Thirty-six shillings, and the other worth two guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. What would the cloth cost you that Davis's coat was made of? - A. Sixteen shillings a yard: I suppose there was about a yard and a half; the black coat would take two yards, at sixteen shillings<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180007090006"></xptr>a yard, and the other, two yards, at sixteen shillings a yard; the buttons cost about six shillings; I pat it rather under than over.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. These coats were made for different persons, and, of course, the cloth must have been taken at different times? - A.I should think they were taken at different times.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you know any thing about it? - A. No; I missed the cloth very fast, and I missed the ticket; the prisoner said, he dare to say it was unstaid, and he should find it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Have you any partner in your business? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. (Produces a blue coat). The prisoner at the bar made it for my son, somewhere about April last; he solicited my son for an order to make some clothes for him; I gave him the order to make a blue coat, it was brought home by Pursey, and I paid him two pounds ten shillings for it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Vaughan. (Produces a piece of cloth). I brought this from the same piece of cloth that this coat was made from; I have no doubt but it is the cloth that came out of my warehouse; and here is the same pattern button exactly.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. (Produces a blue coat). I had this coat from the prisoner at the bar the latter end of March, or the begining of April, I cannot say which; I served the prisoner with meat, he owed me some money, and offered to make me a coat and waistcoat; I had a waistcoat of him, which he charged me one pound four shilling for, here it is; then I ordered a coat of him, and he said I must give him a guinea towards buying the cloth, he could not make it without; I gave him a guinea, and he made me the coat.</p>
               <p>Vaughan. I can positively swear to the waistcaoat, for it is my own quilting; but that is not in the indictment; I believe this coat to be made of the same cloth; it is the same colour, and the same quality.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. At the time that he made that confession, did he not tell you he had bills and receipts for cloth from Mr. Hardisty? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.Is Lord Berwick a customer of your's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>RICHARD DAVIS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a tailor, I was employed by the prisoner to make this coat for Lord Berwick; I am sure this is the coat; I have worked for Mr. 
               <persName id="t18000709-5-person82">Vaughan</persName>
             these four years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect at what time you made that coat? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. As to Davis's coat, I told Mr. 
               <persName id="t18000709-5-person83">Vaughan</persName>
             I had had the cloth by me for twelve months, not twelve years; it was a remnant of cloth that I had left from a coat that I made for my brother, who belonged to a guineaman; the cloth of Mr. Stafford's coat I purchased of Mr. Hardisty, and likewise I had a guinea from him towards buying it; I never made any collection to Mr. Vaughan at all.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>CHARLES HARDISTY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Beville. Q. Look at that bill? - A. This is the handwriting of one of my clerks; I recollect two or three times that he has bought cloths within six or twelve months, I cannot say particularly to the time; mine is a very extensive trade; I remember seeing him there but I cannot say when.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Look at that blue cloth? - A. It is impossible for any draper to know his own cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that coat, and look at the piece of cloth, and tell us if they are the same cloth? - A. I think it is not the same cloth; I think that which is made up is a stouter cloth; the colour is nearly the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the other coat; are those two coats, do you think, made of the same cloth? - A. I think they are nearly so.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the piece of cloth, with that coat that you last took up? - A. The colour is not the same; but that may be occasioned by the one having a gloss on, and the other off; and it appears to me to be stouter, but that may be occasioned by the gloss being taken off, damping may have made that difference; it is possible they may be of the same cloth.</p>

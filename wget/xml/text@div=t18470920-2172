                  </hi> I am a sailor, and live in Meetinghouse-alley. On the 15th of Sept. I went to the Cock and Neptune public-house—the prisoner was there—she said, "Halloa!"—I turned round—she took the handkerchief out of my pocket, and put both her hands behind her with the handkerchief in them—she had a shawl on—I asked her several times for the handkerchief—she gave me her own—I took it, and walked out—when I got to the light I found it was not mine—it was torn very nearly in two, and bad two holes in it—I went and found the prisoner in the tap-room—I fetched a policeman—I had never seen her before—the handkerchief I got from the prisoner is rather lighter than mine—they were both red.</p>

I was called into the Cock and Neptune—Santo said to the prisoner, "Now you had better give it up before it goes any further"—the prisoner said, "I have not got it"—he said, "You know you have got it. and I will give you in charge"—on the way to the station the prisoner said she knew nothing of this handkerchief which Santo says she gave him—the following day, on the way to the police-court, she said, "That is my handkerchief, but he snatched it out of my hand,"</p>

I am a cabi<lb></lb>net-maker and upholsterer, and live in Charles-street, Middlesex Hospital; I occupy a shop at the bottom of the house, and have a room to live in at the top; the prisoner was in my employ as a journeyman. About eight o'clock on Friday evening last, I told him to fetch some. beer and some milk—we were both in the shop at the time—he went out with two jugs, and did not return—about a quarter of an hour afterwards I missed from my waist—coat pocket the key of my room up stairs—I went up and found the door open, and the key in it—on going into the room, I found my trunk broken open—there were three locks broken—I went down, called a friend, re<lb></lb>turned with him, afterwards had a policeman in, and then missed my gold watch from the top of the trunk, and a mosaic chain attached to it—I missed all the articles stated from the trunk—I had seen the watch safe at nine that morning, and my trunk was then locked—I afterwards west with a friend to Mr. Brown, in the City, and gave information of the robbery.</p>

On Saturday morning, about a quarter-past ten o'clock, the prisoner was given into my custody by Mr. Brown, in Gravel-lane—he said something in French, which I did not understand—Mr. Brown said to me that the watch and chain was on his neck—he was then about to make off—Mr. Brown spoke to him in French—I saw the guard on his neck—it looked like gold—on our way to the station he managed to take the guard from his neck—I searched him at the station, and found on him a red silk purse containing 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a duplicate for four waistcoats, one jacket, a scarf, and a neckerchief—not finding the watch on him, I immediately returned to see whether he had thrown it away—he effected his escape from me at the station, and ran down Bishops<lb></lb>gate-street and Liverpool-street—I pursued him—he ran into a place where there is an infant-school, and into an out-place, which was dark—I lost sight of him for a moment, and then saw him in a room, lying on his back—I took him again—this chain, which was found with the watch by the sergeant, is exactly like that which I had seen round his neck.</p>

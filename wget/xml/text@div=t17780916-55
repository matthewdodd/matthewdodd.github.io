               <p>I have a warehouse at Brentford, and deal in coals. On the 7th of this month the prosecutor purchased two chaldron of coals, I sent them to his house at Uxbridge in a waggon; the prisoner drove the waggon; I myself happened to be going that way from Uxbridge to Brentford; at <placeName id="t17780916-55-crimeloc281">Hamdell-heath</placeName>

I asked him how many coals he had loaded, he said two chaldron; I asked him where he had got that sack which he brought into the house; he said at Mr. Clark's, at the same place; I asked him how many sacks he had left; he said two at the Arrow. It is the practice in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177809160036"></xptr> the country to load the coals lose in the carriage, and put two or three sacks at the tail of the carriage for the purpose of keeping the coals in; the two chaldron were all put loose except two sacks.</p>

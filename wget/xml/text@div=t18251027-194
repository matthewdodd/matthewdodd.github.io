            . I am an officer. I executed the search warrant at the prisoner's lodgings - I found this bonnet wrapped up in the skirt of a gown, in a trunk which I ordered her to open - she hid it behind the trunk, but I ordered her to take it up again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the trunk open? A. Yes.</p>

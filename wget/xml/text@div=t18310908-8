               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. What is your business? A. I do hired work for gentlemen, whatever they want me to do, respecting horses and carts; I live at Peckham-rye; I have no partner - my father-in-law had the pony before I did; I took his business, and the horse with it; I did not know Chapman before this - I was here yesterday, and this morning, but by mistake went into the other Court; I am a stranger, and did not know but it was the right Court; I have not received any money from Chapman.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when any money was paid to Chapman? A. No; I saw 14s. 6d. tied up in a woman's shawl - I cannot say she gave it to Chapman.</p>

            . On Friday, the 8th of July, I was in Smithfield, and had a pony, there; I asked William Cogan to hold the pony - I had bought it of Johnson about half-past nine o'clock that morning; I was coming down Charles-street, Drury-lane, where I live - Carter came up to me, and told me he had a pony to sell me, which would pay me a few shillings, if I would buy it -I went with him to Johnson, who was standing at the bottom of Newton-street, Holborn, with the pony in between the shafts of a cart; I asked Johnson what he wanted for it - he asked me 6l., to the best of my recollection; I gave him 3l. for it - there was a good deal said about it; I had not the money to pay him, and they both went with me to Parker's, in James-street, Paddington, and waited there till I came out - Parker lent me three sovereigns, which I paid Johnson; Carter was present - we took the pony out of the harness: some people collected, and bought the cart of him; I took the pony away in about ten minutes - I put it into the stable, then brought it to Smithfield, and gave it to Cogan to hold; it was the same pony as I bought of Johnson.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you acquainted with Carter before? A. I had seen him before, and spoken to him; he lived with a horse-dealer - I had never been to his place; I had known him about two years, but was not intimate - I never saw Johnson before; I did not take a receipt for the money - I cannot write myself; Mr. Parker saw me buy it - he keeps a green-grocer's shop, and is a friend of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he received 14s. for you, that you might stay away? A. No, that promise was never made; the woman said she knew it was a great loss to me, and she would make the 3l. up to me, but I got nothing; Parker, who lent me the money, had it, I believe, but I was not present, for I was taken with the horse, and was locked up in the Compter all night.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to tell the Jury that you gave 3l. for a horse which you were asked 6l. for, by a person you never saw before? A. I knew Carter before, having lived with a horse-dealer; I deal in horses a little - when the horse was claimed I ran up, and said, "That is my horse, I bought it;" Reed said, "It is mine - it has been stolen from me this morning;" I said it was mine, and the officer came up, and took me to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing about who you got it from till you were charged with stealing it? A.When the man said it was his I told him who I bought it of immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say a word about it till you were before the Magistrate? A. Yes, I said so to my friends about me; I believe Parker and Reed knows that - I said I believed I could find the man; I have not received any money to stay away - I believe Parker has received 14s. of the money; Johnson's wife gave my wife 2l. 1s., which my wife gave to Parker, as I had borrowed the money of him to pay for the horse; it was given to her to give to Parker - I was never at Peckham-rye in my life; I have never received any of the money myself - I told the Justice that Parker had received 2l. 15s.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did you not say no further proceedings should be taken, and that you would not appear if you could get enough to pay Parker? A. I never said such a word; I was in custody at the time Parker received it - I do not know whether Reed referred the person to Parker to pay the money, for it happened outside Guildhall, and I was in custody at the time; I suppose Reed must have shown the woman to Mr. Parker, because I understand she wanted Reed to take it; I cannot say whether the Magistrate asked what I had done with the money - I told him my wife had 2l. 1s., and Parker 14s.; I told him what had become of it without his asking me - I will not swear it was before he asked me about it; the woman went and complained that I had promised to acquit her husband if she paid the money and I went to explain it; I do not know of any warrant being issued against me - none was served; I mentioned my wife's having had the money before any complaint was made.</p>

               <p>ROBERT PARKER. I live in James-street, Lisson-green. On the 8th of July Chapman and the two prisoners came to me with a pony; Chapman came into my house - the prisoners were outside; I lent him 3l. to buy the pony - I went out of the house with him, and saw him give the money to Johnson: Carter said it was a good pony, and he had had it some time - that is all I recollect; they then went into a public-house - the cart stood at the door, and while they were there a man came in, and asked the prisoners if they would sell the cart; they both went outside with the young man, and sold him the cart - the pony was taken away, and I went home to breakfast; Carter was outside the public-house when he said he had had the pony some time, Johnson was close to him, and could hear what he said.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is the man who bought the cart here? A. Not that I know of - I know him, he lives near me; I never saw the prisoners before - the cart was sold directly, and then Chapman took away the pony; there did not appear any thing unusual in the transaction to me - I have seen such things done before, when people have been wanting carts and had no further use for them; I never lent money before for that purpose - I took no receipt from Chapman: I have lent him money before - I keep a potato-warehouse and green-grocer's; I have lived there eight months - I have known Chapman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080011"></xptr>about three years; I have received 2l. 15s. of the money back again - a woman brought me back 14s. of it.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did you not receive it on the express condition to forswear your evidence? A. No, the woman asked me if I would keep away if I received the money, and not appear - I said, "I cannot help appearing - I must appear;" I received the 14s. from Carter's wife, or Johnson's wife, I believe she calls herself; Chapman's wife brought me 2l. 1s. - she did not tell me where it came from, nor did Chapman; the women themselves told me outside that they were sorry they had found the money for me now; I had told them I should appear to clear Chapman, as I had seen him pay for the pony - I had a right to receive the money, as I had lent it; I had no business to ask Chapman's wife where she got it; I did not tell the Magistrate that Carter said he had had the pony for some time - I was not asked the question.</p>
               <p>Carter's Defence. I did not say the pony belonged to me, and that I had had it a long time - on Friday morning, the 8th of July, I met Johnson at the foot of Westminster-bridge; he asked if I had any thing to do- I said No; he asked if I knew any body wanted to buy a pony - I said I knew a man who might buy it; he asked me to go with him to the man - I went and recommended the man to buy the pony, and after it was sold I went to Johnson's house, and stopped all night with him.</p>

On the 16th of April, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my husband's shop and purchased 2d. worth of plum-cakes - she took the cakes off the plate, and gave me a sixpence into my hand - I immediately saw it was a very bad one, and gave it her back; I saw Wakeling, and I suppose he was at the door, for as she was going out with the sixpence in her hand he apprehended her - it was between nine and ten o'clock, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What makes you say it was a bad sixpence? A. I knew it to be bad, and gave it her back -I had not given any information to the officer; he knew her before.</p>
               <p>FRANCES WILDBORN. I am a widow, and live at the Seven Stars, Rosemary-lane - my father keeps the house. I know the prisoner - I saw her at my father's house on the 16th of April, between nine and ten o'clock at night, to the best of my knowledge - she came with a man and woman, at least I saw her at the counter with them - they were decidedly in company; they called for a pint of porter - I cannot say which it was; a sixpence was offered me in payment - I have every reason to believe it was the prisoner gave it me, as I directed my conversation immediately to her, and she stood immediately before me.</p>
               <p>Q.What was the conversation? A. On looking at the sixpence I observed it to be bad, and told the prisoner so- she was the person immediately before me; I said,"This is a bad sixpence: this is the second bad coin offered me within these ten minutes;" she immediately snatched up the sixpence, and ran away with it - I am sure it was her who santched it up; she ran to the door, and called to some woman inside to follow her - she called her by a Christian name; the other two persons went out in about two minutes - they seemed to wish to engage my attention to them; I gave information of this - the porter was not paid for, nor drank.</p>
               <p>ELEANOR PARKER. I am a widow, and keep the Blue Anchor public-house, Rosemary-lane. On Saturday, the 16th of April. between nine and ten o'clock, the prisoner came to my house for a pint of porter - she had a child in her arms; nobody else was with her - I served her; she put a bad sixpence on the counter - I took it up, tried it, found it bad, and returned it to her - the Policeman came in at the time, and took it out of her hand.</p>
               <p>PIERCE DRISCOLL. I am a Police-officer. On the 16th of April, about ten o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner go into the Blue Anchor public-house, Rosemary-lane, kept by Parker - I had my eyes on her before, in consequence of information; I stood at the door, and saw her offer the sixpence - I saw Parker try it on the counter, and return it to her; she had put it into Mrs. Parker's hand, and she put it on the counter, bent it, and returned it to her - I took it out of the prisoner's hand, as the landlady returned it to her - I have it now, and have had it ever since eleven o'clock the next day; I took her to the station-house, searched her myself, and found 2s. 3d. in copper, and a good sixpence in her pocket - she was discharged by serjeant Norman; I gave him the counterfeit sixpence - he returned it to me next day about eleven o'clock; I had marked it before I had parted with it, and knew it to be the same, as far as I could judge - I produce it; here is the mark which I put on it - it is a triangle, and it is bent at the edge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He told the landlady I had given her a bad sixpence - they searched the till, and took it out of a cup in the till. Witness. I did not go near the till; I took it out of the prisoner's hand.</p>

            . I am a Police-serjeant. I was at the station-house, in Denmark-street, on the 16th of April, at half-past ten o'clock, when the prisoner was brought in by Driscoll - I saw him find a good sixpence and 1s. 5d. in copper on her; she had no counterfeit money but the sixpence he produced - I cautioned her, and discharged her; I instructed a Policeman to follow and watch her - Driscoll gave me the counterfeit sixpence: I returned it to him next morning - I put a mark on the reverse side of it, and know this to be the same: she was brought in again at eleven o'clock the same night by Wakeling, for uttering a counterfeit sixpence to Mrs. Ward - Wakeling gave me the counterfeit sixpence; I returned it to him next morning - he charged her, in her presence, with uttering it.</p>
               <p>JAMES COOK. I am a Policeman. I was at the station-house, and the prisoner was discharged on the 16th of April, about a quarter or ten minutes after ten o'clock- I then followed her up Denmark-street into the New-road, where I saw her meet another woman; she was in conversation with her; I was about a stone's throw from them - I cannot say what the other woman was doing: I merely saw them, and saw something pass between the two: the prisoner put her hand out to the other woman- they both put their hands out together; the prisoner saw me after this took place, and they directly parted, one went one way, and the other another; I followed the prisoner to the corner of Cannon-street, where I met Wakeling - I told him to watch her, and I went back to look for the woman who had parted from her, but could not find her; I saw the prisoner brought to the station-house, in Denmark-street, in about two minutes - I searched her, and found one counterfeit sixpence, and 1s. 5d. in copper on her - I gave Wakeling the counterfeit sixpence.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL WAKELING. I am a Policeman.

               <p>JOHN FIELD. I am an inspector of counterfeit coin to the Mint. This sixpence (produced by Driscoll) is counterfeit - it is made of white metal, known by the name of Britannia metal; it is not washed, but white all through - it was not made at the Mint; this sixpence (produced by Wakeling) is also counterfeit, and is made of white metal.</p>

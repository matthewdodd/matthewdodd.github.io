I was on duty in Albert Street, Shad well, on the morning of 16th July, a little after 4, and saw Clinton coming out of No. 11 with a bundle and a pair of boots—I said, "What have you got there?"—he said, "I have got an overcoat"—I said, "Let me look at it," and took the bundle from him, and saw it was a lady's waterproof cloak—I said, "How did you come by it?"—he said, "A man came to me at Silvertown, and asked me to change coats, which I did; I didn't know but what it was an overcoat till I got into London"—I then saw these boots, and said, "How came you in possession of the boots?"—he said, "I bought them"—I said, "Where?"—he said, "At a bootmaker's"—I was not satisfied with his statement, and took him to the station, where two knives were found upon him—I said, "Where is the boot shop?"—he said, "I don't know."</p>

On the morning of 16th July I went to examine the last witness's house—I found no fastening to the shutters, the window-sash loose, and the window would separate so that one could put anything between without leaving marks—the window-catch in the centre was unfastened, and was pointed out to me just as it was found.—the passage door, which fastened with a chain, was open—Albert Street is 300 or 400 yards from Harris Terrace.</p>

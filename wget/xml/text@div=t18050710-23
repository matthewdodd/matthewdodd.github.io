            ? - A. No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know respecting the prisoner at the bar - when did you apprehended him? - A. We apprehended him outside of the Court here one day.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with you? - A. Ray was with me.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was it? - A. I have got a memorandum made on the same day; it was on the 3d of June, last month; we apprehended him just outside of the Court.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he doing of at that time? - A. He came out from that door (pointing to the door that the prisoners are brought in,) from that side of the Court.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. He was discharged in consequence of a bill being thrown out against him, and these officers were waiting to take him after the discharge.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you ever see him before that time since he was ordered to be transported? - A. I saw him at the Office in Worship-street, he was taken up for stealing some unfinished mahogany goods.</p>
               <p>Q. The bill was thrown out against him - how long before the 3d of June was it that he was taken up? - A. I think a fortnight; some time in May I think it was.</p>

               <p>Q. You knew nothing of him before that time? - A. Nothing at all before that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100033"></xptr>Q. You are certain this is the same man? - A. This is the same man I saw brought to the Office by Ray.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Vickery, the Gentlemen of the Jury have heard that the prisoner was taken up upon a charge of stealing some mahogany, and that afterwards the bill was preferred against him, and upon that charge the Grand Jury threw out the bill? - A. I certainly understood it so at the door of the Court.</p>
               <p>Q. When this man was about to be discharged on the regular call over day of the Sessions, you were waiting to take him up upon this charge? - A. Yes, upon information that we received.</p>
               <p>Q. And that was of being at large - he coming out of this Court to go into the yard to be discharged, you took him? - A. That was all certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon this conviction perhaps you know there is a twenty pounds reward? - A. Certainly I do.</p>
               <p>Q. You know you will be entitled to a share, if the Jury should be of opinion that the man was convicted? - A. Certainly I do.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Ray.) Q. You know nothing more of this business than you were with Vickery at the time he apprehended this man? - A. I apprehended him on Saturday, the 18th of May, first; I found him then in Banner-street, St. Luke's.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to apprehend him then? - A. For robbing his master; he was imprisoned and discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his master's name? - A. Darge, a cabinet-maker.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought the charge against him? - A. Darge.</p>
               <p>Q. Darge lived in Banner-street, did he? - A. He did, and does now I believe.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you know where the prisoner lodged at that time? - A. I did not till I apprehended him, I went in company with his master.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find his lodging to be - what was he? - A. He kept a chandler's shop in Old-street-road; I took him from his master's house.</p>
               <p>Q. And then he shewed you the place where he lived? - A. Yes, and there he attempted to make his escape; I followed him about two hundred yards, and then I took him again.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. What is that paper you have got in your hand? - A. The clerk of the Assizes Calendar, merely to refresh my memory.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you conduct him to the Court when he was tried? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when he was tried? - A. Yes, I certainly was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he convicted or acquitted? - A. He was convicted of sheep stealing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take him back after he had been convicted? - A. I did, into my goal.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of him after that? - A. He was reprieved, and ordered to be transported for life, and under an order from the Secretary of State, he was put on board the prison-ship, at Portsmouth-harbour, on the 5th of May following, I delivered him myself in execution of the sentence.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you know nothing what became of him after that of your own knowledge - Did you ever see him before the 18th of May? - A. I did not see him before I was sent for by the Magistrate at Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Who was the Judge before whom the prisoner was tried? - A. It is there stated in the calendar.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect yourself? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect Lord Ellenborough being there? - A. I do not recollect the Judge, there is the conviction there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not he a young man? - A. He was a young accomplice in the hands of old ones, I think he was upwards of twenty-one when he was tried, from information I then received.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a native of Suffolk? - A. He came from a place called Mildenhall, I believe him to be a native of Suffolk; it is a distance of twelve miles.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, but called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

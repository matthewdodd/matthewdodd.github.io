                  </hi>. On the 2nd of December I was at the Dun Horse pub<lb></lb>lic-house, in the Borough, and saw the prisoner and James Redman there with some friends—they were all drinking together—the rest went away about half-past seven o'clock, leaving the prisoner and Redman alone—there was no quarrelling before that, but they were very comfortable together—both the prisoner and Redman were drunk—they went out about half an hour after their friends, then returned to the bar, and the prisoner quarrelled with Redman, and knocked him down in the corner of the room—he hit him on the side of the head before the bar, quite at the door, in the doorway—I only saw one blow struck—Redman did not make any blow at all, but laid his head down, and covered his head with his hands—the prisoner did not strike or kick him while on the ground—not inside the house—the land-lord came from behind the bar, and caught hold of the prisoner, and with my assistance, put him outside, and kept Redman inside—the prisoner, when he was outside, said, "I will wait for him till he comes out, if it is two hours, but what I will have my revenge," using bad language—I stopped there till about half-past ten, which might be an hour and a half—Redman went away about half an hour after we turned the prisoner out—he went out by himself, and I saw no more of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a corkcutter, and live in the Borough. The prisoner was in my service for about eight months, and at the time in question—I was passing the end of Kent-street, towards the Borough, about nine o'clock on this evening, and saw a great many persons collected—I recognised the prisoner—he was intoxicated, but he knew me—I saw a man lying on the ground, and asked Betts who it was—he looked round at me, and immediately replied, "It is Redman, Mr. Clark"—Redman was also in my employ—I said, "Why, Betts, you have made a bad job of this, you had better been at work"—he said, "Yes, we have, Mr. Clark"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184012140115"></xptr>
               <p>—he then stooped down to lift Redman up, and the people finding I knew him, several said, "This is the man, (referring to the prisoner,) who has knocked him down, and been stamping upon him"—he did not deny it, but put himself in a fighting posture, and said to one of them, "Are you go<lb></lb>ing to take it up?"—I told him to be quiet, or we should put him in the watch-house—he replied, "Oh! I shall not flinch"—at that moment the policeman said the man's leg was broken, and I saw it was so—I told him to take care of Betts—Redman was taken to Guy's Hospital on a stretcher.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoe salesman, and live in Southwark. About ten minutes or a quarter after nine o'clock, on the evening of the 2nd of December, I was shutting up my shop, and saw a man lying on the ground right opposite my door—the prisoner was standing over him, beating him about the head with his fists, as he lay on the ground on his back, saying, at the same time, "You call me deceitful, you——"—I called out, "You cowardly rascal, don't strike the man on the ground"—he took no notice of it—I ran and pulled him off him, lifted the man from the road, and got him, quite on the pavement—he was lying on the pavement—he could not stand—I kept the prisoner away from him with great difficulty—Redman was lying on his back quite exhausted—he called out as well as be could, "Murder, police"—MR. Clark came up directly after, and his evidence is, correct—I went with the policeman to the station with the prisoner—I am sure the prisoner is the man who was beating him—he appeared in liquor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dresser at Guy's Hospital. The deceased was brought there—he had a broken leg—there were no other injuries about his person—the leg was set, but it went on unfavourably, which I attribute to a broken-down constitution—he was thirty-eight years old—he died on Sunday the 13th of mortification of the leg—I attended him all that time, every care was taken of him—I examined his body after death—I examined the head, there was no bruise there—I am clearly of opinion that he died of the fracture of the leg, and the mortification which ensued.</p>

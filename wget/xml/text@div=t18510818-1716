I know the prisoners—they all live in Chelsea—I play with them sometimes—I know Mrs. Hooper's shop in College-place—on Sunday, 13th July, I was at the other end of the street, about a dozen yards from Mrs. Hooper's—I saw Peavor and Robert Hetherington go into Mrs. Hooper's with a key—Albert Hetherington had the key, and he unlocked the door—they both went in, and Peavor brought out a bundle of square pencils, and Robert Hetherington brought some round ones—I was at the end of the street when they came out—Brown, Henry Hetherington, and Rees were with me—I ran to get out of the way when they were taking the things—Rees, Brown, and Henry Hetherington ran round the other turning to me—we all met up in the brickfields, and Brown divided the sherbet and the sweets—Robert Hetherington gave me two round pencils, and Peavor gave me a square one—Robert Hetherington had a bundle of squibs and an empty ginger-beer bottle—I saw a top, and Peavor had a little necklace in his hand—I did not see any whipcord—after</p>

               <p>we had been in the brickfield, I and a little boy, who is not here, went home, and the others went after us—James Hetherington was not with me when they went into the house, but he was waiting in the brickfield for them to come.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in College-place, Chelsea. I occupy the whole house; there are only two rooms—I keep a toy-shop, and sell sweets, and Stationery, and hooks-and-eyes—on 13th July I went out at a little before 7 o'clock in the evening to attend on a sick relative—I returned about a quarter after 11—I found the front-door ajar—it was locked, but the lock had not caught—I got a light, and found the shop all upset; the sweet-stuff and cakes were thrown all about—the tobacco and cigars were broken, and were all about the counter—I called the policeman in—I missed from the window some fireworks and sweet-stuff, some cakes and whipcord, black-lead pencils, and shawl-pins; a bottle of ginger-beer was taken out of the water near the door, a bottle of sherbet off the shelves—the value of the articles I missed was about 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Clements's mother brought this packet of hooks-and-eyes to my house on the Monday morning.</p>

               <p>I am a constable, belonging to the police office. Queen's-square. On the 15th of June, Monday John Wilson, the prosecutor, called and told me he had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010092"></xptr>been robbed of a watch, and that the woman that had been seen with the watch, was then in Westminster. I went down to Frith's gardens, near the Horse Ferry road, where she was sitting at work, and took her into custody; I told her that she was accused of robbing John Wilson of a watch; I told her that she must come with me before the magistrate; coming along I told her that the magistrate was then sitting that committed her for the former offence, on that she told me that she was not guilty of the former offence, but she was of this.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell her what the charge was? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention the prosecutor's name? - I did, I asked where the duplicate was? she said she had not pledged it, she had sold it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make her any promise? - No; she wished to speak to Wilson; I told her I would speak to the magistrate, that she should speak to him before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not recommend her to do it? - I did not, her friend did that was in the house, but I did not say any more than what I tell your lordship.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand that this conversation with you, was as you was going along? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what the person said, that it would be better to confess, was after? - No, it was before, in the place where I apprehended her, but I did not say any thing to her then.</p>

On the 17th of September I left my box in my room-it was locked and corded, and contained the articles stated in the indictment; they were worth 13l. 1ls. There was also 7l. in bank notes, in a little box, which was in my trunk. I left my room, as I had got a situation. On the 20th I called, and went to my box, every thing was then safe; I locked and corded it again-Tucker used to sleep in the room. On the 27th I went to fetch my box away, found it had been robbed-it was forced open. On the Sunday following I saw one of my shirts, a pair of boot-garters, and one glove, which were with the other things.</p>

            , who rents the house, which is in the parish of St. Ethelberga. On the 20th of September the prisoner came to lodge in my house, and slept in the same room where the prosecutor's box was. Tucker also slept there. The prisoner remained there from the Monday until Sunday morning; on the Friday he came to ask for Tucker, and said he wanted him to go to Seven Oaks with some horses. Tucker went on Saturday morning, the 26th-the prisoner was then the only person sleeping in the room. The next morning the prosecutor came, and discovered the robbery-the prisoner was in the room when Tucker went away, and left that day without giving me notice, or paying me. When he first came he said he was out of a situation. Another man, named Day, slept in the room, he went out at five o'clock in the morning, and returned at night. He left about a fortnight ago. I knew he was going to leave.</p>
               <p>JOHN TUCKER. I lodged in the same room, with Day and the prosecutor - the prisoner lodged there after the prosecutor left. On the Saturday he desired me to go to the Leaping Bar, public-house, Blackfriars-road, to take two pair of horses to Seven Oaks, for Mr. Harris; I found there were none to go-when I returned he was gone. I never saw him again until he was taken. Next morning the prosecutor came, and missed his property.</p>

            . I live in Peahen-court; my mother is a mangler. On Saturday morning, about half-past six o'clock, I saw the prisoner go out of Mrs. Wilmot's house with a bundle, as I was at our window.</p>
               <p>ELEANOR HRATT. I live in Hosier-lane, with my mother. On Saturday three weeks, the day the prisoner was taken, he asked me to wash a shirt and a pair of stockings for him; I only knew him a few days before this. He took a lodging in our front garrel, said he was short of money, and asked me to pledge the shirt for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you live with him - A. Yes, in Drury-lane, not at my mother's. I pledged the shirt at Turner's, in Catherine-street; they knew me, and put it down in my name; I gave him the duplicate and money, he left the duplicate in the room where we lived - I had not lived a week with him; he was taken up the same day.</p>
               <p>CHARLES BOND. I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner in St. Paul's Church-yard, on Saturday night; I said, "Bull, how do you do?'. He said, "Is there anything against me, Bond?" I said, "Yes, you must go with me;" which he did. He said he lodged in Drurylane, and told me to ask for Eleanor Hiatt - I found her there, in bed. I also found a pair of boot-garters, a glove, and the duplicate of the shirt, in a small box. The prisoner told me himself, that he sold all the things to a man, spent the money; and that he lost 4l. in one night.</p>
               <p>JOHN CREFFIELD re-examined. The shirt, glove, and garters are mine.</p>
               <p>The prisoner made no defence.</p>

                  </hi>., I am a widow, and live at No. 84, Borough—road. I occupy the parlours—I had three pictures hanging up in my front parlour—I left the room at a quarter past 5 o'clock, and went into the kitchen—the window was left unfastened, but closed—it was about a yard high from the street—I returned to the room about twenty minutes to 6 o'clock—I then found the windows wide open, and the pictures gone—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">policeman, M</hi> 53). From information I received, I went to the prisoner's house, on 30th Dec.—he lives in York—street, London-road—he was sitting at a table with a woman that he lives with, in the front room up stairs—I asked him what had become of the pictures that had been hanging over the mantel piece——I had not been at his room before—he said, "There have been none hanging there, no more than there is now"—I said, "Had yon not a picture there of a little kitten playing with a ball of cotton, in a small frame?"—he said, "No; I never saw such a thing"—I searched about the room—he said I should not find anything there—I went to the cupboard, and asked him to open it—he pulled at it two or three times spitefully, and said, "There, I cannot open it; there is nothing there," or some such words—I said to a constable who was with me, "You pull it"—he pulled it and opened it, and there were the paint<lb></lb>ings inside—I showed him this one of the kitten—he did not speak for the minute, but the woman said, "Oh, a young man left them here that he has been teaching the concertina to"—he said, "Oh, I forgot, so he did; some young man left them here."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose you were in uniform? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he was at dinner when I entered—I believe I mentioned before the Magistrate the difficulty in opening the door—it might have stuck—he looked very much confused when I asked him about the pictures, and, after they were found, he said he could eat no meat—it was not before the cupboard door was opened that the female said the young man bad left them there, it was a minute or two afterwards—I put this picture on the table, and held it up and showed it them, and then the remark was made—it was constable 82 that opened the door—he is not here—the prisoner was admitted to bail, and has surrendered—he did not mention the name of the young man that left the pictures, I asked him that particularly.</p>

                  </hi>., I am a wood turner, and live in Market-street, Borough-road. I know the prisoner—he is a teacher of music, he has taught me—I went to his residence in York—street two or three times a week for lessons—I recollect going there about three weeks ago, on a Sunday evening, between 6 and 7 o'clock—I do not recollect the day of the month—it was two or three Sundays ago—while I was there a person came in with a parcel—I did not notice what it was in—he said they were pictures—he asked whether he might leave them there—the prisoner said, yes, he might put them in the cupboard—I saw him put them in the cupboard—I did not stop long after I heard this—I was about to go when he came in—he remained—I did not see any preparation for teaching—when he</p>

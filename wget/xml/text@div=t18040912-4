            ; in consequence of his information, I suspected the two prisoners at the bar; I went and enquired at their father's first, if they were there, and there I was told by John's wife that they were at a house in Buckingham-street; I went there, and found both the prisoners. Coming along, I asked John if he had been changing a five-pound note that morning; he told me he had not; I took them to Mr. Prince's house, and asked Mr. Prince if either of these two men had changed a five-pound note with him; he told me that the prisoner John had changed one; I took him to Bow-street with Isaac; I searched him, and found in this purse four one-pound notes, a half-guinea, half-a-crown, and six-pence, and in his waistcoat pocket I found a quantity of halfpence; I asked him how he came by it; he said, it was the change of the five-pound note he had changed with Mr. Prince; I asked him how he came by the five-pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him it would be better for him if he would confess? - A. No; he said he had it of his brother Isaac on Saturday evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Isaac present at that time? - A. No. he was in another room. In another pocket I found a half-guinea and four seven-shilling pieces; I asked him how he came by that, and he said he received it from his brother Isaac. Not finding any duplicates upon either of the prisoners, I then went to John's lodgings; I searched the apartments, and found nothing; I then went in search of a woman of the name of Stephens, who lived with the prisoner Isaac; I met her in Covent-garden; I desired her to go along with me to Isaac's lodgings; she went with me to the lodgings, and I searched some time; she told me it was of no use my searching; she said, there is nothing here; she said, if I would go with her to Russell-court, to Mrs. Cole's, there I should find the four spoons; I went with her, and she knocked at the door, and asked for the spoons that she had left: Mrs. Cole gave them to Stephens, and Stephens gave them to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she give them to you immediately? - A. Yes, before I went down stairs; she is not here, I could not find her; these are the spoons that I received from her; I have had them in my custody under lock ever since, and this is the five-pound note I received from Mr. Prince at Bow-street; I have had it in my custody ever since, (produces the spoons and the note); I have John's confession before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it taken in writing? - A. I do not think it was; here is another officer here that he mentioned it to first, and then he went and mentioned it to the Magistrate afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at North-street, Whitechapel I was married to the prisoner last Dec., at St. Peter's, Stepney—I had frequently asked him, before and after our marriage, and he said that he was a single man—a fear would sometimes arise in my mind, being a stranger—I had the engaged ring before one voyage, and was married when he came home—the voyage was between London and Sunderland—I ceased to live with him about six months ago—the owners of the vessel gave me some information, and I went to Suadedand to find if it was the truth; he had just arrived, and I found him at his own house lying before the kitchen fire—I saw a woman there—I asked the prisoner if it was possible that he had done this—he never answered, but put his hands up to his face—I said that if I was not called upon on the following day, I knew what I should do—I then left, took a lodging there, and remained a fortnight—after that I returned to London, with the promise that he never would abandon me, but would treat me as a sister; but he has broken his promise, and left me in a starving state for six months—I have been dependent on my own acquaintances—it is about six months ago that I went to Sunderland; it was two months after our marriage—he gave me a trifle at Sunderland to buy a little furniture, for I had broken up my home to go and see after him—I cannot say how much he gave me, perhaps 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I heard from him the following day, and got the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from him—after a fortnight I came to London, and he saw me again, but only gave me a trifle; I think it was two sovereigns—since that he has given me nothing more than a couple of sovereigns, that paid a little rent and washing—lie has not called on me in London—I saw him sometimes in the street, and sometimes on board the ship—he did not send for me on board the ship, I went to him, because he neglected me—he gave me the two sovereigns in the Exchange.</p>

               <p>to prepare his sea clothes for the voyage—I did know him, but I required a little employment, and could see by his appearance that he was the master of a ship—he did not go home with me, but I gave him my address—a voyage of perhaps three weeks intervened, and on his return he called on me—after I had seen him for a day or two, I passed a night in the same house with him—I am not bound to answer whether I slept with him—it was with the promise of marriage—it was at my house in Hamp<lb></lb>shire-place, Whitechapel—I object to answer on how many occasions I spent the night with him—I have been married before, perhaps six or seven years ago—my husband is dead; I was present when he was ill, and he died in Liverpool—I have not been married since, but I unfortunately bad a child in travelling—I will answer you no more questions—I nave bad an illegitimate child—the first voyage, after we were married, be put five sove<lb></lb>reigns into my hand when he left—I have not received 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from him altogether, nor 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; what I have received I spent on him and myself, and I have two little children, one by my first husband, and one illegitimate—one is a grown up daughter, she is married—I had a few things of my own, but the prisoner left me short purposnly, that I should not go to Sunderland—I had told him that the owner said that he was married, and he denied it, and told me that it was his siater—I shall not answer whether this is the first captain of a vessel that I have accosted in the street—I shall see you here some other day, when I have money, and then I shall be able to bring up things against you—I shall not answer the question whether I know Mr. Robert Field—I lodged with Rebecca Winter—I shall not answer whether, during that time, I was not passing the evening with other gen<lb></lb>tlemen.</p>

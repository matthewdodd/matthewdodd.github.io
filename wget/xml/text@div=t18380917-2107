                  </hi>. I live in Falcon-square. On Saturday, the 25th of August, I was walking up Aldersgate-street with a friend—he was accosted by the prisoner, and stood talking with her for a minute—I walked on and went back—I was standing by her side a minutes and felt something at my pocket—I saw her hand going from my pocket—I took hold of her hand, and was about to <hi rend="italic">blow</hi> her up, when the watchman crossed over and said, "You are up to your old tricks again"—and in her hand were three half-crowns and one sixpence—they were in my pocket before she took them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Shaftesbury, and practise as an attorney there, and did so in April last. On the 17th of April, the prisoner called on me at my office—I never did any business for him before—I knew him by sight, but did not know his name—he told me his name was Cornish, that he had a little matter of business to be done—I asked him what it was—he said he had money in the funds, and wished to sell out 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked him in what stock it was—he said he had a document in his posses<lb></lb>sion which would show what stock it was in—I asked him to show it to me—this is the document he showed me—(<hi rend="italic">looking at an account</hi>)—he told me it was 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and said, "You will find it in that account"—he said it was an account between Mr. Alner and his wife before his marriage—the account is now exactly in the same state as when he produced it—I observed that Mr. Alner charged himself with what he received on account of his wife, and on the other side he discharged himself—I took means to obtain a power of attorney, but it turned out that there was no such stock, and as such, nothing came of that—the instructions for the power were returned to me, and the prisoner was persuaded that nothing could be done with it—I told him that there was no such stock—some letters passed between me and him about it—I communicated the information to him by letter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you, in the course of any conversation with him, tell him there was no such stock as that in the name of Miss Wallridge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did when I saw him on the 2nd of May last year at my office—he told me he had seen Mr. Robert Alner, and he had told him if the money was not in his wife's name it must be either in his (Alner's) name alone, or else in the names of Mr. William Bridge and himself, and that Mr. Alner had desired him to get him a power of attorney now for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and to bring it to him and he would execute it—I then went to the bank of Brodie and Co., and de<lb></lb>sired them to send up for a power of attorney to sell out 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. standing in the name of Robert Alner, or Robert Alner and Mr. Bridges, part of 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner always confined himself to the 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this power was after<lb></lb>wards delivered to me unexecuted by the clerk of Brodie and Co. on the morning of the 4th of May—I had given directions for it on the 2nd of May—I then put it into a letter, and sent it to the prisoner by a messenger—I saw the prisoner about it afterwards—he brought it back to me on Saturday the 13th of May, to my office, in the same state as it is now, apparently ex<lb></lb>ecuted and attested, except the word "Dorset"—he told me that Mr. Ro<lb></lb>bert Alner had been over to his house at Piddletown, and executed it there—one of the attesting witnesses lived at Has elbury, and the other at another place—I made an observation on that, and he said Mr. Alner came over to his house and executed it there, and said he was sorry he should have had so much trouble about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> There is a paper annexed to the front of it—did you write that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi>

               <p>Part of it, and part was written by my clerk—it is an authority to Brodie and Co., dated May 10th, and signed "Robert Alner"—it merely says, "Pay proceeds of£300 Stock, 3 per Cent Annuities, (for which I have exe<lb></lb>cuted a power,) to William Cornish and Mary Elizabeth, his wife; or either of them."—(Signed)—"Robert Alner"—he brought me that authority with the power of attorney—there was a blank left for the date—it had been sent up in blank, but it was returned to me filled up and signed—underneath this is in my handwriting, a direction to Brodie to pay the above to George Chitty—this was signed by the prisoner in the presence of my clerk, who has witnessed it—it is dated "13th of May"—in pur<lb></lb>suance of that order I received the money—I had credit for it in my ac<lb></lb>count, on the 18th of May—the prisoner called on me that day, and asked if the money was sold out—I told him it was—he then said he would call next morning, and said he should require£200—he called next morning, and I sent my cheque to the Bank, payable to him—my clerk brought back twenty£10 notes of the Shaftsbury Bank—I gave them to the pri<lb></lb>soner, and he gave me this receipt for it, which I have in my ledger—(<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—I made a statement of the account between him, and hit wife, and myself, to show what he would be entitled to after paying my bill—here is the account—(<hi rend="italic">reading</hi>)—"Bill£6 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—cash at different times, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," on the credit side is "Amount of proceeds of stock, 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., part of 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3 per Cents Reduced"—after deducting brokerage and power of attorney, 269<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—deduct power of attorney, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., net 267<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the balance due to them, 259<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—underneath the balance it brought down, "Cash on account, 19th May, 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and he has signed his name—I then drew out a receipt on a 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. stamp, which I desired him to get signed by himself and his wife, for the whole proceeds, and delivered it to him, but he never brought it back—I delivered to him this paper—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—as a copy of the account I have just read—it is in my own handwriting—I delivered it to him at the time the transac<lb></lb>tion took place—it corresponds with my ledger exactly.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why not pay it to the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did not come—he was to have come in the evening, when I was to arrange it, but he did not come till next morning—he then said he should only require 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I sent to the bankers' and got it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Well now, then, was not your balance overdrawn at the time you received the prisoner's money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—at the time the money was put to my account I did not owe them any thing—I did not know this was car<lb></lb>ried to my account at all till afterwards—here is the account the prisoner gave <hi rend="italic">me—(producing it</hi>)—I did not find him a very intelligent man—I found him rather deficient—I did not consider him illiterate.</p>

               <p>when I am on business—the prisoner told me he was out of business, and wanted this to go into business—he at first produced the account to me, and said that would explain it; and I considered, by the account, that it was in his wife's name—I considered at first that he was aware the stock was in his wife's name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But afterwards, when he said it might be in Mr. Alner's or two other names, did not you think he did not know where it was? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said that was what Mr. Alner had told him—I never asked the prisoner to lend me 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not apply to him for the loan of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I will tell you what I did—I did not apply to him—he proposed it—he came to me about the second power, and said, "I have seen Mr. Alner; he has con<lb></lb>sented for us to have the remainder of the 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 1 shall want about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; will you keep the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in your hands till we want it?" and I said I had no objection—I know that money in the funds pays interest—he said he should not require the money, would I keep it in my hands till he wanted it—I said I had no objection—I paid him interest for the balance in my hands when the balance was struck.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Here is a piece of paper pasted into your ledger, and which I see "On 26th November, Mr. George Chitty paid me 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which settles all account between us?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—that happened on a Sunday—I was passing an inn where he was—he said, "I shall be obliged to you to pay me the balance"—I said, "Certainly"—I had not the money, but I went and got it—I returned to the inn where he was, paid it to him, and took that memorandum; and next morning I got my clerk to paste it into the book—I do not keep any cash-book—this is my ledger—I always enter it into the ledger at once.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you were first examined before the Magistrate, was it on oath or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Without oath—I have been in the habit of practising in Criminal Courts—I considered I was being examined as a witness, though not on oath; and after I had made my statement, and gone through the account, the prisoner said every word I had stated was true—Mr. Fresh<lb></lb>field was present, and other witnesses.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you not know you yourself were under charge and under exa<lb></lb>mination, and told you might say any thing if you liked, but were not obliged to state any thing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was not told so—I was not cautioned by the Magistrate that I need not say any thing unless I liked—he said, "Mr.</p>

               <p>Chitty, will you explain it?" and I said, "With pleasure"—I believe the Magistrate's words were, that I need not say any thing unless I liked, but I might make an explanation if I pleased—I have heard that put to pri<lb></lb>soners before—I believe it was two or three days after I made my state<lb></lb>ment that I was examined on oath.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When parties come to you to represent they want stock sold, and you find it in the hands of trustees, are you in the habit of doing it without consulting the trustees? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have nothing to do with it—I give it to the bankers, and give them instructions—I have not had an instance of being applied to for a power of attorney for years—if a party say they are sent by the trustees, I do not think it. my duty to apply to them—I certainly see now that if I had written to the trustees, it would have saved all this—I knew Mr. Alner to be a gentleman of respectability and station in Dor<lb></lb>setshire—I certainly considered, on looking at the power and the state<lb></lb>ment of the account produced by the prisoner, that it was the handwriting of Mr. Alner, and the bankers considered the same—the bankers were not glad to get it to settle their account, for it was not to be placed to my ac<lb></lb>count—the signature to the power is not placed far from the right place—it is not so near to the seal as I should put it, but that is a matter of opinion—I think it is sufficiently near—I should say it is executed in the right place—I see no objection to it—I cannot tell who drew this line from the word "Alner" down to the seal—I will swear that—I will swear it was not done by me, nor in my presence, that I know of—I have no knowledge of it at all—I will certainly swear it was not done in my presence—I have not the least knowledge of it—I will swear, to the best of my knowledge, it was not—I will swear positively it was not.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are not the two first witnesses names opposite the seal, instead of the person purporting to execute the power? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That will appear by the thing itself—they appear opposite the seal certainly—that is a very unusual thing—it is bad writing—I thought it was oddly done, and mentioned it to the bankers—I noticed the distance of "Robert Alner" from the seal, but the bankers said, as long as it was signed by Robert Alner, they thought it would do—I looked at the account, and said, "It is Robert Alner's writing"—I said it was very odd for the persons demanding to act to witness up there, for I thought it oddly done—I did not think it my duty to inquire of Mr. Alner, as I considered it was Mr. Alner's handwriting—I have not received any money from the prisoner besides the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—I paid him over all the proceeds of the money except that.</p>

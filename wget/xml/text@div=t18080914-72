When I came home with the deals I told him they were mine, he said they were not; I sent for a constable, he said he could send for a man that he gave a shilling to for planing them over; he sent his mate for this man, and when this man come I told him to speak like an honest man, and not to take the part a thief; he said that he never planed any over for him at all. I said to the prisoner, I think now I can convince you that these are my deals; I found three deals in my yard these three deals were cut off, the knots ent through each of them; I can swear to two of them. He then said he had made a mistake, he had taken them instead of other people's deals; I said that could be the case, there was not a planed deal in the ho out mine; they are my deals, I can swear to them two</p>

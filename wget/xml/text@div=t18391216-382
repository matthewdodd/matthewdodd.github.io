                  </hi>. I am a beadle of Cheap ward, City. I know the prisoner by the name of Thomas Jackson. On the 1st of March, 1837, he was in my custody, charged with a burglary in the house of Heath and Co., No. 31, Old Jury—he was remanded twice by the Lord Mayor, and at last committed to Newgate for trial—I was present at his trial in this Court, before Mr. Justice Littledale—he was convicted, and transported for life—I have a certificate of his conviction, which 1 obtained from Mr. Clark, whom I saw sign it—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—I have not a doubt of his being the man—I know him by his walk—when he was remanded I had to take him back<lb></lb>wards and forwards three or four times, and he had a limp in hit walk, having had an accident, and I know hit features—I received him in custody from Meagle.</p>

I was going home, between twelve and one o'clock at night: the prisoner spoke to me, and asked me to go home with her; she took my watch, and gold seal from me; I did not perceive it until I saw it in her hand; I was trying to take my watch out of her hand, another girl came by, she held her hand out and gave the watch to her; the other girl took the watch out of her hand; I then took the prisoner to the watchhouse.</p>

I was coming along Liecester-fields, I saw that gentleman, he had hold of two girls, and a great many men were about him; he said he had lost his watch; he was very much in liquor; I went to the watchhouse, there was nothing found on me: he took another girl to the watchhouse, she was discharged. I am as innocent as a child unborn.</p>

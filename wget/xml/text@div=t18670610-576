                  </hi>. I am a cab-driver, and live at 19, Gower Place, Euston Road—in April, 1866, I was a cab proprietor—the prisoner was in my employment as horse-keeper, at my stables, Capel Mews North—he ab<lb></lb>sconded on the 27th—after he had gone I missed two mares, one black and one brown, two whips, a great coat, a rug, &amp;c, altogether worth about 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—one of the mares I found between one and two the next morning at Miss Winkley's, over the water.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 1, Nelson Yard, Old Kent Road—I collect old horses for Miss Winkley for slaughtering—about 2 p.m. on 27th April I bought a black mare from the prisoner, at the entrance of the Cattle Market, Islington—I believe he is the man; I was only in his presence about five or ten minutes, and I could not positively swear to him, but I firmly believe he is the man—I gave him 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for her, which was a good price—early next morning the prosecutor came to Miss Winkley's and identified the mare as his—about an hour after I had the mare I saw the prisoner with another man, and they had a dark brown mare, a smaller one than the other—he asked me to buy that—I said I did not want it; it was too good for my job—I did not ask him the price, but she was worth about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a veterinary surgeon, living at No. 22, Upper Sheeny's Mews—on 27th April, 1866, a little brown mare was brought to my shop—I knew it belonged to Mr. Allum, as we had shod her before—I believe the prisoner came with her, and about three hours after he came and fetched her away—he was with another man, driving a four-wheeled cab—the mare was tied on to the cross bars of the cab—I noticed that she was not taken in the direction of the prosecutor's.</p>

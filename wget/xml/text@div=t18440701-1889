                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live in Smith-street, Camberwell New Road—the prisoner is my wife. Last Monday evening, the 10th of June, about a quarter past six o'clock, we were at home, and had a little quarrel—we were both the worse for liquor—I was rather worse than her—there were some flower-pots there—I was going to take them away to my brother-in-law's eldest son—she did not like that, I think—I took them up—I do not know that I should have taken them if I had not been the worse for liquor—I went out of the house and across the road with them—when I got a short distance from the house, she came behind me and broke the flowers, and I tumbled down in the road—my foot might have caught against a stone-the pots were broken—I think she came behind me and pushed me down—I fol<lb></lb>lowed her home, and went up stairs—I believe she got hold of a knife when she got up stairs—she struck me on the arm with the knife—there were two marks in my jacket, but only one on my arm, where the knife entered—I do not think she struck me more than once—I struck her again—I did not see the knife in her hand—I <hi rend="italic">sung out</hi> for help—a young man came up and took the knife from her—I could not get from her—she had got hold of me round my waist—some persons came and took me down stairs—the blow on my eye was done with a poker—I was very drunk—I do not exactly know what happened—I had a great deal of blood on my face—the policeman was obliged to hold me up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer. On Monday evening I saw the pro<lb></lb>secutor and his wife up stairs—I saw some pots of geraniums in the prose<lb></lb>cutor's arm, as he ran out of the beer-shop—I did not see the pots knocked out of his hand—he went up stairs to his own house—I heard a man's voice call for help, and found the prisoner with the knife in her hand, trying to <hi rend="italic">job</hi> it into his arms—he was trying to keep her off as well as he could—she only struck him once—she made two or three attempts—I took the knife from her—it was a long white-handled kitchen knife—I tried to get him out of the room, but she took up the poker, and struck him once with it across the head—it was not a very hard blow, but it was just across his eyebrow, which made a little mark, and bled—she then got hold of a pair of scissors, but I knocked them out of her hand under the bed, got him down stairs, and took him to the doctor's—he was very faint.</p>

I was in company with Powney—I heard, a cry for help, in a man's voice—I went up stairs to the room—the prisoner had the knife in her hand, struggling behind the door with her husband—Powney had hold of her wrist, and I took the knife out of her hand—she got the poker, and knocked her husband down by a blow on the temple, and made a deep cut in his temple—we got him down stairs at last—she took up the scissors.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Foley-road, Camberwell. On Monday evening I saw Adams—he had a wound just over the corner of the eye—the skin was broken—it was produced by some blunt instrument—this poker might have done it—his elbow had an incised ragged wound on it, caused by a blunt cutting instrument, such as a blunt knife—he had several bruises about the head, and over the left eye.</p>

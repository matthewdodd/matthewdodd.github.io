            ; on Thursday the 27th of July the prisoner came into the shop, between two and three, and asked for some black lace; I took down a box and shewed her some, and she took up one piece; there was another person in the shop, that was serving another customer; she is here as a witness; I shewed her a piece of black lace, and asked her two shillings and tenpence, but told her I would take two shillings and nine-pence; she bid me measure it, and there was nine yards; she asked what it came to, I turned round and took a pen and cast it up, and it came to one pound four shillings and nine pence.</p>
               <p>Did you turn from her? - Yes, and the mean while I turned, she took a piece of lace; I was obliged to turn my back to her to get the pen; she then said, she would not give me any more than a guinea for; I then looked in my box, and missed a piece of black silk lace.</p>
               <p>How much might there be in this piece? - Twelve yards; the prisoner said, she would give no more than a guinea; so missing the pice of lace, I said, if you will stop, I will see if there is any thing here that will do for you; I looked in one box, and then in another; she went away and got two doors from us; I went after her, and said, you have taken a piece of lace, and she said, she had no such thing about her, and while

               <p>Did you ever examine to see if the other was missing? - I did after we had been at the Justice's; the second card of lace was in the shop that morning before the prisoner came, and we had sold none that day; we sell it for three shillings and four-pence; it costs us two shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Was it an old house keeper? - I fancy we have had it about a twelvemonth; the other was twelve yards, valued at twenty-pence per yard.</p>

               <p>Nor in the shop? - No, not at all.</p>
               <p>Was she so long in the shop as twenty minutes before you followed her? - I dare say she was.</p>
               <p>Yours is a pretty large shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many people were backwards and forwards in the shop? - There were two people, but they were gone, besides Bartlet and South; the customers were gone before I shewed her the lace.</p>

               <p>From which side do you suppose this lace to have fallen? - The right hand pocket; I was standing at her right hand side.</p>
               <p>As soon as she went out of the shop you overtook her, before she got two doors from the shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then of course you went out almost immediately after? - Certainly, Sir.</p>
               <p>Now I wish you to swear positively, if you chuse it, and recollect that the life of that woman depends on your answer perhaps; will you venture to swear that the lace did not fall from the counter? - Yes, I will.</p>
               <p>Did you see it drop? - No, I heard it drop, and that is sufficient.</p>
               <p>A pretty common lace for a cloak is it not? - It is not a common ordinary cloak lace.</p>
               <p>Is not it a very usual cloak lace? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now how many thousand yards like that do you think I could purchase in the street where you live? - I cannot say to that pattern.</p>
               <p>Court. Are they both common laces? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Are not they both remnants? - We do not look upon it as a remnant; there are different lengths.</p>
               <p>How much is there in a piece? - There were thirty-three yards of this originally; now there are twelve yards, a proper quantity for a cloak.</p>
               <p>Do you take this to be a whole piece? - Sometimes we have them in twelve yards.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath do not you know it is not a whole piece, look at it, has there been none cut from it? - It may be cut.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath has it not been cut? - I am not sure, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath has it not been cut, and do not you know it has? - I have not cut it myself.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath are not you sure it has been cut? - I told you I cannot tell nothing at all about it; I cannot take my oath to it.</p>
               <p>Do not you know it has been cut by the inspection of it? - It may have been cut.</p>

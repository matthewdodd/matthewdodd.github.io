We did, in a reces in the shop we discovered a paper under the bed, containing some pieces of silver, and two silver tea spoons; and on the bed labels of vials that contained spirits; the whole of which property we had taken about a week since in our business. On the 30th of January I went for Donaldson, he produced the boy the things found under the bed, and asked him if he knew any thing about them; the boy replied he did not; Donaldson then searched his person, and found in his pocket some keys. that would open a drawer in a pembroke table, in which my mother keeps her keys; the key of a wine celler a key of a cask of home made wine; I brought his box out of the kitchen, Donaldson searched it, we found the duplicate of a broach that he had pawned for three shillings, this he acknowledged to be his, and said he had found the broach, this broach I believe to be my fathers, I found a black jewellers case, that case contained several small pieces of silver; among them a silver pipe-tip belonging to my father.</p>

               <p>Southwark. Last Wednesday morning I was in John-street, going home between four and five o'clock—I had been to my sister's, who is very poorly—the prisoner and another man came to me—the prisoner asked me if I would have anything to drink—I said, no; I did not want anything—I walked on; he followed me, and the other man followed us a little behind—I got towards Weatherly-street—I saw a roan going along, and I said to him—"If you please, will you tell me the time?"—I ran towards my house, in King's Bench-walk, and the prisoner came up to me—he was in liquor; he threw me down, and took my clothes up—I had a bundle on my arm—the prisoner got it—I struggled and screamed, and my husband heard me—I had two shillings, two sixpences, and one 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-piece loose in my pocket—I missed it directly I got to the top of the street—I cannot swear whether it got out of my pocket when my clothes were up—I was so confused that I did not look on the ground for it—the prisoner was fumbling my pocket, and my clothes were over my head—I had the money the day before, when I went to my sister's—the prisoner took my bundle off my arm, and took it from me—it contained a pair of old trowsers and a gown—the trowsers belonged to my little boy—they were wrapped in a handkerchief; the gown was mine—I valued it at sixpence—when I screamed the prisoner ran away—I ran after him—I had taken his cap, and had it in my hand—he ran away towards Gravel-lane, and I lost him—I kept his cap; this is it—I did not see him caught.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, M</hi> 61). On the morning of 14th May, about half-past four o'clock, I saw the prisoner and his brother, and the pro<lb></lb>secutrix, standing at the corner of Union-street, Gravel-lane; the prosecutrix and the prisoner went on, and his brother followed behind—I saw no more till about twenty minutes after, when I saw the prisoner ran down a street, and go into his house without his cap—when I first saw him he had a cap on similar to this one produced—his house is in Ewer-street, Gravel-lane, but he came through an adjoining court; he did not come along Gravel-lane.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, M</hi> 53). I was in that neighbourhood about half-past four o'clock that morning—I saw the prisoner and his brother (I knew them) talking to the prosecutrix—they passed by me, and the prose<lb></lb>cutrix in company with them—the prosecutrix was first, then the prisoner, and then his brother—I saw the prisoner and the prosecutrix turn up Wel<lb></lb>lington-street—the prosecutrix came back and turned up Surrey-row, and I saw the prisoner follow her up that way—I then lost sight of them—in about ten minutes I saw the prisoner come down Orange-street, and he went into Princes-row—he was then without a cap; he went into a court—I was walk<lb></lb>ing towards the court, and I looked up Orange-street, and saw the prosecu<lb></lb>trix standing by a wall without a bonnet—she had this cap in her hand, and her hair was hanging down her back—from the statement she made to me I went to No. 9, Ewer-street, and knocked; a man came to the door—I asked for John Ryan, and I found the prisoner in bed—I took him into custody; that was a few minutes before five—he said he was not the person—I am quite sure I had seen him with the woman, talking to her, and he then had this cap on, with the ears over his head—the bundle has not been found.</p>

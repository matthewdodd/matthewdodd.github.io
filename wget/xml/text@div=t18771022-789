                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman E</hi> 121). I was in Gray's Inn Road on 28th September at about 2.15 a.m., about four yards from No. 347, and saw the prisoner chuck the grating back and come up out of it, and run away—I was near enough for him to see me—I was in uniform—I followed him, and came up with him in about 100 yards, and laid hold of him—he struck me with a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> across the helmet, got out of my hands, and tried to get over a fence of the Great Northern Railway—I never lost sight of him—I got him down, and he bit my arm—I took the <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> from him, and placed it in my coat pocket—I could not have mistaken a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> for an umbrella—I have not the jemmy now—I called out for assistance, and two porters and two or three other men came up—he said he had been quarrelling with, a young woman, that she hit him in the mouth, and he hit her and then ran away—I found on him 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., some bronze, a key, a knife, a silver match-box, and an almanac.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was standing on the kerb when I saw the man get out of the grating on the same side of the road, about four yards off—the pavement is quite four yards wide—it was rather a misty night—a cab<lb></lb>man was outside on the pavement, close to the place where the prisoner came out—he is not here, he gave no evidence at Bow Street—I think he was nearer the prisoner than I—another man was standing farther off, but in the road—the cabman was trying to get into his own house—I believe he saw the prisoner—I have been to the place again, and find It is not more than 100 yards that I ran—I kept him in sight all the time, in spite of the mist—I might have seen farther than ten yards—I think I should have seen him fifteen yards off—I was never as much as fifteen yards from him—I am positive it was a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> he hit me with, because</p>

               <p>I bad it in my hand, and put it in my pocket, and what became of it I don't know—he did not say "What are you stopping me for?"—the key is not such as you generally find on persons breaking into a house.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 18, College Street, Camden Town, and am a signalman on the Metropolitan Railway—I was at the corner of St. Pancras Road—a constable called for assistance—he was struggling with the prisoner over a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>—I know what a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> is—the constable put it in his pocket—my mate came up at that time—somebody eke came up as if to assist the police, and the prisoner handed him something, and he asked the prisoner if he had got the hammer and chisel—I cannot say what became of the <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> after the constable took it—the man came behind the constable, I am certain—at the station I heard the prisoner say that he had been quarrelling with a young woman, and she hit him, and he hit him, and had run away.</p>

I am a grocer, of 347, Gray's Inn Road—I was called up about a quarter past two on the morning of the 28th—I went down, examined the house, and found the top lock of the shop door picked, and the bottom lock forced—it could have been forced by a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>—the top lock had to be repaired—everything was in disorder—a cab-mau's carriage candle was on the counter, warm, just having been put out—the till was picked to pieces—my desk was forced open, and 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. Taken from it, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in bronze, and a gold pencil case—the grating is ordinarily fastened by a chain from the inside-a person getting in at the door could come out at the grating.</p>

                  </hi> I issued this order for green carpet—the word "green" has been altered since to "blue," in the prisoner's writing—neither blue or green has been received—I have found carpet for every carriage according to the invoice, except this—I have seen carriages away since July, but none with green carpet—I find n 25th Sept. three yards of blue carpet ordered—I gave an order for that, but this was had on 13th Aug.—I used no carpet in Aug.</p>

                  </hi> The prisoner presented this order to me, altered as it is now, and had three yards of carpet for it and three for the other—it being dated July did not strike me, knowing that he was in the habit of getting orders, and using them as he wanted them.</p>

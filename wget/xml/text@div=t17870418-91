               <p>I am a lodger in the next room to the prisoner, and have been four or five months; my husband lives with me, he is a gilder; I saw the man prisoner put whiting into this wooden thing, and then he fastened it in with a knife, as fast as he could, and after that he squeezed it on each side; I saw him take a farthing and put it in, and squeeze it on both sides; afterwards he shook the farthing out.</p>
               <p>Was it wet chalk? - It was dry chalk that I saw; then he melted some lead in a pipe, and he put that in; and when they were done, he field them off, and put them in his hand, and rubbed some blue stuff on them, which gave them the colour of copper; I saw the woman do nothing particular; but I have seen her at times hold a farthing over a candle, and put some tallow to it, that made it look blackish like; I had two farthings and a halfpenny of the money; I had it of my child; I saw the woman prisoner give it my child, who is between nine and ten, to go for a halfpenny worth of snuff.</p>
               <p>Are the prisoners man and wife? - Yes, my waistcoat is full of holes, and I peeped through.</p>
               <p>How came you to have this curiosity? - They were so very noisy, quarrelling and fighting, I was afraid of fire; she was very careless of the fire; I myself have picked the woman out of the fire twice; she was in liquor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Peter. They used to get drunk together; this is only a piece of spight.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Rachael. The woman used to make me get drunk, and pawn my husband's things.</p>

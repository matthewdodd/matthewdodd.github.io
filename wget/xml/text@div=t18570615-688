I am the wife of George Blackstone, who keeps the Rose Tavern, No. 96, Jermyn Street On Saturday, 16th May, the prisoner came, about 2 o'clock in the afternoon; he asked for a half pint of porter—it came to a penny—he gave me in payment a shilling—I looked at it, and thought it was not good—I took it into the bar parlour, and showed it to my husband, and he passed it to a friend, who looked at it, but it was not out of my sight—I got it back—I gave it to the prisoner, and said that it was a bad shilling—he said, "Is it?" and he gave me a good one—he bit the bad shilling several times, and disfigured it very much—he went away.</p>

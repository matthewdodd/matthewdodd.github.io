               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. There was a crowd of people about you? - A. The same as in general in such a public street as that.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the prisoner behind you? - A. I did not take any notice of having seen him before; I applied my hand to my pocket, and missed my book, and he was then a yard and a half, or two yards from me.</p>

               <p>Q. He gave it you the moment you asked him for it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who gave you that book? - A. When the other clerk went away he left the book and I took it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not usual for the master to give the books to his clerks when they have done? - A. I believe not.(The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel, and called seven witnesses who gave him a good character).</p>

The Prisoner seeing me there, and not knowing me, she held the Money (which was 6 Guineas) in her Hand. and said softly to Fitzpatrick, Shall I pay ye? and at same time gave her a cautious look, as if she doubted whether or no, it was safe to pay the Money before me, who was a Stranger. Fitzpatrick satisfied her, by telling her that I was one of the Women, and then she paid the Money.</p>

Indeed, says the Maid, there's no such Person lives here. We have but one Gentlewoman that lives above, and her Name is Long. We concluded that she was the Person, and that she had taken up a new Name, to prevent discovery, and so we desir'd to speak with Mrs. Long. The Maid went up, and brought us back word, that she would wait upon us, but she not coming, we sent the Maid up again, and she then brought us word, that she had mistaken her Message before, for Mrs. Long was very busy, and pray'd us to call another time.

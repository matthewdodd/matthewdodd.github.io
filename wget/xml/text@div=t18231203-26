I was stopped by a crowd of people, and could not proceed, and in less than a minute there was as great a crowd behind as before me. My daughter, who was with me, called out, and thinking to keep the crowd from her, I turned round, and almost immediately somebody called out to her, "Don't faint!" I could not turn about the pressure was so great. I put my arms up, and about two yards off I saw the prisoner's face to my face; he was pressing with great violence, calling out something which I could not distinguish. I said, "For God's sake don't press!" and the more I begged him, the more he pressed. I suspected nothing, but the moment he came up to me his hand was at my pocket. I felt my watch go, and saw his arm go from me. I directly caught hold of his jacket, and said, "You have stolen my watch." He said, "Don't tear my clothes." I held him till the constable took him; and have not found my watch. Somebody said in his hearing, he has given it into another hand.</p>

            . I am a constable. I had seen the prisoner with four or five others near the prosecutor. He was behind a man who was next to Mr. Drewell. I saw his hand go by that man towards Mr. Drewell's breeches pocket, as I thought, and at that moment a strong crowd carried me fifty yards away, and in half an hour I found him in custody. Several gentlemen said in his presence that they saw it pass from his hand to another.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to the public-office, Shadwell: Brown came to me, and I went with him to Whitechapel, to the prisoner's lodgings; the prisoner was not at home, we learned that he was at work in the cellar at the Plough and Hat; we went there, and the prisoner was at work; we brought him to the light, and I searched his pocket, and found one two-penny piece, one penny-piece, and four pennyworth of halfpence; I asked the prisoner for his coat; he said, there it is; it was upon one of the butts in the cellar; I took the coat, and in his coat, between the first and second button-hole, I found a seven-shilling piece and one shilling, sewed in; I made further search, and at the bottom of his coat I found another seven-shilling piece and one shilling, sewed in, that was about ten o'clock; I then tied his hands, and went to his lodgings with him; we found nothing in his room, but the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180001150007"></xptr>woman of the house said he had been into the cellar, to the privy, a little after seven o'clock; I and Brown went into the cellar, he looked down the vault with a candle, and said, here is the top of my sugar canister; he took it out, and in the cellar we found the facings of the tea-chest, it was so much destroyed we did not think proper to take it away, and we left it; I told Mr. Brown to look at the money; and he said, these two halfpence he could swear to.

               <p>Prosecutor.

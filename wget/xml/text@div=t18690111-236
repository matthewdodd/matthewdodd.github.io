                  </hi>. I live at Wells Street, Sydenham, and am a dust contractor for the Sydenham and Forest Hill district and Lewisham parish—I know the six prisoners—I knew a lad of the name of Henry Kemp, who is since dead—about 8 o'clock on the morning of the 13th December I was standing near the Swiss Cottage, in Stanstead Lane, Sydenham—I saw all the prisoners there with Kemp, the lad who is dead, and two men who are not apprehended—there were nine altogether left their carts—there were two or three in a cart—they all came round me—I had summoned Patter-son, Kemp <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> Holmes, and Larkin, because they were making free—they came round me and wanted to know why I had summoned them, at the same time telling me that they should collect as much dust as they liked—I said if they did I should be compelled to summon them, for I could not allow them to take it—Patterson caught hold of me and commenced punching me—I believe Larkin struck me next—they were round me in such a cluster, they nearly had me down on the ground—Lewis struck me—all of them struck me—they were all on the ground to get me down—I tried to resist as much as I could—Holmes <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> Kemp said, when we were on the ground, "Let us take his b—swear-by"—I never hoard the word before—after he had said that, Larkin held me down and Holmes put his hand into my pocket—I had a purse there, containing four half-sovereigns and a sixpence—the prisoners were all round me when Holmes put his hand into my pocket—Larkin and Holmes held me down—my purse was taken away—I felt Holmes draw his hand and shut it—when he took it out of my pocket I caught hold of him by the hand, and he struck me between the eyes with his clenched fist—the other prisoners were close round at that time—they all got up then, got into their carts, and drove off—I am quite sure when the prisoners came up my purse was safe in my pocket—I have known them a long while—I had not got a knife in my possession.</p>

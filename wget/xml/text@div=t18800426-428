I am a laundress, and a single woman—I have removed from 91, Cromwell Road, Redhill, to 101—I have known the prisoner, who is a widow, for some time, and had worked with her four months—she was a laundress, and lived in the Croydon Road, Reigate, and she had four children, the youngest of whom, the deceased, was, I think, 16 months old—as far as I saw, she was always a kind, affectionate mother to them—on Saturday, 31st January, I was at work for her and saw her—I did not see anything in her condition that attracted my notice—on the Monday I went to her house again at 8 a.m.—she was down in the kitchen, and the deceased was playing with his brother—we all had breakfast, and she asked me to go out and take some clothes home for her that had been washed—I returned to the house and went out again to take out her weekly books—when I came back about 10.30 she asked me to sweep up the kitchen—we had some lunch and she told me that she had seen the child's father, a man named Jenkins, and that he would not support the child—she also said if she could not have the child's father she would not have any one, and would make off with herself—she</p>

               <p>employed there as a washerwoman—I was not living with her, I was living in Cromwell Road, about a mile from the prisoner—I had seen Jenkins in the police force, but I did not know him to speak to—he told me himself that he was the father of the child—I can't tell when he told me that—the prisoner told me that Jenkins went with the girl on the Redhill Asylum fete day—I was not at work with her when she told me that, it was after I went to work there—it was after that that Jenkins told me that he was the father of the child—it was at Mrs. Knight's, where he was lodging—the prisoner appeared to be in great trouble about keeping this child—she told me that she had had words with Jenkins because he said he would not keep the child—she told me that he had promised to marry her, that he had put it off for 12 months, and had not paid a penny towards the child, and then he took up with this other girl—as far as I know, the neighbours had treated her very kindly—she was in great trouble about the child from the first month that I was there, and also about the man being faithless to her in not marrying her—I cannot read or write—she has oftentimes said she would make away with herself—she used to say to me and the other girl who worked there, "Good-bye, you won't see me any more"—it was a common expression for her to say that—she said she could not keep the child if Jenkins did not pay something for it, that she had a hard matter to support herself and the other children—the eldest of the others is about 14 years old, and was at work at Mr. Keasley's; the other two went to school—I knew Dr. Walters had attended the prisoner during the time I was employed there, off and on the whole time—she worked at the wash<lb></lb>ing herself—I used to go there sometimes about half-past six, and work there till late, and go home by train at 15 minutes past 9—I had to work wry hard, because she had a deal of work—she used to work standing at the tub washing—Dr. Walters was attending her for loss of blood, some complaint of the womb—she told me that Dr. Walters said she would never get well without she gave up work—she told me that one Sunday after he had been there—I think it was on the Sunday but one before she done the murder—she said, "How can I give up work and let my children go in the workhouse?"—she was in a very dreadful state of health at that tune—she told me that she had been to Mr. Reece, the town clerk, about getting an order from the Magistrates for Jenkins to pay something; and she found that, as he had not paid anything for 12 months, she could not get any summons—I did not go to the Magistrates with her—I went to Reigate, and asked Mr. Small if she could not bring a breach of promise against him—her despondency increased—she kept on getting worse about keeping this child, and said she would never marry any one without she had Jenkins—she used to say she could not sleep of a night, and two or three nights that I slept with her she was awake the best part of the night—she was very often irritable and petulant, as if her trouble was too much for her—when she could forget her trouble she was not at all desponding, she was as nice and cheerful a woman as I ever worked with—she used to complain of her head very much at times—she had got a sick-headache—at those times she used to say that her trouble was too much for her to bear—she was very fond of the deceased child, and always treated it kindly—I tried to cheer her up all I could—she asked me when I left the house to bring back some soap and soda from Mr. Smith's, in the Elmsdale Road—I think it was since</p>

                  </hi>. I am a B. A. of the University of London, a M.R.C.S. of London, and a M.D. of London University—I have been in practice at Reigate nearly 16 years—I did not attend the prisoner when she was confined of this illegitimate child—the first I remember of her was when attending her late husband in his illness some four years ago—I have no recollection of attending her in the interval—until this unfortunate conuection with the man Jenkins she bore a most exemplary character—I believe it is with regard to Jenkins only that her character was in any way altered—in February, 1879, I began to attend her in her illness; thai must have been about four months after her confinement—she was then suffering from disease of the womb; the complaint consisted of what we call sub-involution of the uterus; that consists essentially of an enlarge<lb></lb>ment of the womb, it not having recovered its natural size since her confinement—incident to that disease she suffered from profuse periodical lost of blood, in fact it was almost constant—I have no doubt that arose from or was aggravated by neglect after her confinement, by the anxiety to get about too soon—I made her wean her child, and I urged upon her then and subsequently the necessity of rest, that the treatment would not have its proper effect unless she could lay up and give herself rest—she was anxious to get well in order, as she said, to be married to some man, who I understood was Jenkins, the father of the child—she constantly spoke of that—she was not then in a fit state to be married—I attended the child in the spring of 1879 for inflammation of the lungs, a very severe attack—no mother could have been more careful or attentive to</p>

               <p>her child than she was—she was moat anxious about it, and most solici<lb></lb>tous to do everything she possibly could for its benefit—it recovered—I should say that in her station of life no one could have taken more care, of a child, or been more anxious about it, or give more indications of fondness—I saw her constantly at short intervals, on and off, till the actual commission of the crime—she was very weak, in a low state of health, caused by the disease from which she suffered; she complained of great headache and restlessness at night; she was very pale and blood<lb></lb>less; she also complained of palpitation of the heart upon any exertion—a week or two before the commission of the crime I noticed that she was distressed in mind, especially the very day before; I could see nothing indicating insanity, but she was in a state of great mental distress—I perceived those symptoms from my own observations; her friends had not informed me of her threats to commit suicide, or of the state<lb></lb>ments she had made; I did not know of them till subsequently—the condition of the uterus was somewhat better, but still she was in a very weak, depressed state of health; she had not had time or opportunity, to recover—insanity is in many cases hereditary—it arises most frequently in females where there is some uterine disease; in this case you have not only the predisposing tendency to insanity, but you have the debilitating disease of the womb, also tending to produce insanity; I attribute import<lb></lb>ance to the conjunction of these two causes, one would intensify the other—in my experience with persons affected with mania, arising from puerperal affection or from derangement of the womb, there is generally a tendency to suicide or child murder, sometimes one, sometimes the other—in some persons it will take the form of suicidal tendency, in others homicidal tendency—I have listened attentively to the facts and circum<lb></lb>stances of this case, and I have no doubt that this act was one of homi<lb></lb>cidal mania—I believe she would not know the nature of the act she was doing at the time—the evidence I have heard rather tends to strengthen that conclusion—I believe she would not know she was doing a wrong thing.</p>
               <p>

               <p>I was at the house; I did occasionally—as far as I know she was equally affectionate and devoted to them, but she always struck me as being par<lb></lb>ticularly fond of this child, more so than I should have expected consider<lb></lb>ing the parentage and the birth of it—it struck me as a remarkable circumstance that, the child being illegitimate, she should show so much attachment to it—until just before the commission of the crime I did not know who her lover was—whoever he was she was undoubtedly very fond of him—I should say undoubtedly from her condition of health, from her previous family history of insanity, that this was the act of an unsound mind—it is well known that persons suffering from this form of insanity will attack the child they are most attached to—she did not attack her lover, as a sane person would probably have done; she had a spite against him, and had every cause to be offended with him; but she does not attack him, she attacks her dearly-loved child: it is not the act of a sane person to do that—apart from the act itself, there is her state of depression, her state of restlessness, her bad state of health; and disappointment by her lover refusing to marry her or support her child, that might produce a similar condition of restlessness, but not so bad; it would greatly depend upon the strength of affec<lb></lb>tion of the particular woman—I should look on the act itself as an act of insanity—apart from the act itself there may be no special symptom—the threat of suicide would be an additional proof of in<lb></lb>sanity—some medical men believe that the mere act of suicide is evidence of insanity—I have not formed any decided opinion about that; it would be an additional proof of insanity I take it—the attempt at suicide would be very strong presumptive evidence of insanity, but not actual positive proof—I should say it is a very rare occurrence that a person who is not insane should commit suicide—there is frequently an entire absence of motive in cases of insanity, or a motive founded upon some delusion—there may be some motive in the mind of the person which we are unable to trace.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. Many persons may be distressed, restless, and excitable without being insane—I think it would be impossible in many cases to distinguish between sane and insane persons having those symptoms; in the absence of delusion I can point to no positive distinction—except the fact of killing the child I can point out no one symptom as a positive indication of insanity; I look on the act as a symptom of insanity—in certain cases you may have these symptoms without any actual insanity, or with it, and you may have an outbreak—I should take the frequent speaking of suicide to be a symptom of insanity; I should not expect a sane person to do it—in cases of homicidal mania you may have no definite symptoms of insanity before the commission of the act, or after the act, yet the act itself may be an insane act—supposing the person who commits the act is in such a state of bodily health and mental distress, and there is a previous history of hereditary insanity as will tend to lead to the commission of such an act, then if you have those factors I think you may safely say the act is one of insanity.</p>

               <p>under my care who have been suffering from disturbance of the uterus—on my first seeing the prisoner my attention was not particularly directed to that; I observed that she was in a very weak and gloomy condition, and I have seen her every day since—I have likewise seen her when she has not seen me, and I have remarked that peculiar gloom of expression which I would venture to say if she was among any number of others she would be singled out by any person not of medical mind, as a person suffering from mental trouble, perhaps mental disease—I am quite sure of it, her expression was so marked—I have seen her in the yard when taking exercise and when she has not seen me—moreover I may state that she has had what I think might fairly be called some delusions, she believes that every one is against her, that every one despises her, and that people are looking at her—I heard the matron speak of correcting someone in chapel the other Sunday, and the prisoner thought the woman had been referring to her—I have been present during the trial and have heard the evidence of Mr. Walters—I think there is nothing in the case at all inconsistent with the opinion which he has formed—if I may venture to express an opinion I may say there seem to me to be four factors in the case: first, proof of hereditary insanity; secondly, proof that she has suffered from a very exhausting disease; thirdly, that she has undergone extreme work, working up till 1 o'clock in the morning, and getting up at 5 o'clock, without sufficient rest; and then, fourthly, there is the mental trouble under which she has suffered; I think all those would conduce immensely to the breaking up of the mind.</p>

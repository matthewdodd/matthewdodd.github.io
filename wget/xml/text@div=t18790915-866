                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live in the Lower Road, Deptford—on 9th August, about 12 o'clock, I was in Napier Terrace near the Plough Road in company with my young woman's mother, Mary Ann Pressland; I had just parted with my young woman—I heard a scream at the top of the road, I ran up to see what was the matter and saw two men catching hold of Franklin's young woman, Miss Mayne, and pulling her into the road, they seemed to be foreigners; when I got up they ran away—my young woman came out of doors and the four of us went on to the bridge, that is my young woman and Franklin and his young woman—we were turning round to oome back home and we met three other men, foreigners—they caught hold of my young woman round the neck and pulled her off the path; I went up to the prisoner who was one of them, and pushed him away; he then struck me in the left hand and arm—one of his comrades made a run towards me and the prisoner struck him in the side—the man called out, "Oh John, no," or something like that, put his hand to his side and ran away over the bridge—I felt my hand numbed and my finger doubled up—I went back to Napier Terrace and my hand was bathed, blood was running down my arm, my coat was cut through—I was taken to the police surgeon about an hour after, and he dressed my wound—I first went to Dr. Kelly, of Plough Road, he would not look at my arm—I had given no provocation to the prisoner, only pushed him away—there was sufficient light to enable me to see him; I have no doubt about his being the man that struck me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw no knife in anybody's hands—I saw that my hand was covered with blood—I did not see a man named Adolphe there. I saw him afterwards at the police-court; I did not recognise him as one of the three foreigners; I could not say whether he was the man the prisoner struck, it was one of the two—he was coming towards me in a fighting attitude when the prisoner struck him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single and live in Napier Terrace, Plough Road, Rotherhithe—on the night of 8th August, a little after 12 o'clock, I was in company with James Miller; he left me indoors and went up the street with my mother—I heard a man scream and ran up to the top of the street and saw five foreigners pulling Franklin's young woman in the road—Miller went up and the men ran over the bridge—Franklin's young woman ran down home with mother, and Franklin, me, and Miller went up on the bridge—we met three foreigners; the prisoner put his arms round my neck and Miller pushed him away and the prisoner pulled out his knife and stabbed him twice—I saw it glitter, I was close to him—then Adolphe, one of his friends, ran in between Miller, and he caught a blow in his side from the prisoner—I then returned with Miller to Napier Terrace; Franklin tame home too, but he did not stop indoors—Miller's arm was all open and the joints of the fingers of his left hand were cut and bleeding—his wounds were bathed—he had done nothing to the prisoner but push him away when he had his arm round my neck.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer at Deptford—on 8th August I was in company with my young woman in Ploughbridge, Rotherhithe—I saw five foreigners come along, one or more of them interfered with my young woman, after a bit of a scuffle I ran over the bridge—while I was standing there I saw Miller and Pressland on the bridge with three foreigners, the prisoner was one of them—I did not see him do anything—I saw Miller after he had been home and come back again—I did not see anything the matter with his hand or arm—about half an hour afterwards I saw his father-in-law take him to the doctor's; he had his arm bound up.</p>

Shortly after 1 o'clock in the morning of 9th August I saw Miller at the station—he showed me his hand and arm—there was a wound on the left arm above the elbow, and one on the back of the left hand, both bleeding—I sent for the divisional surgeon, who dressed his wounds—he gave a description of the person who had wounded him, in consequence of which I went in search of the prisoner—I met him coming along with a constable—he answered the description given—he was placed with several others in the charge room, seven or eight, some of his own countrymen, and Miller picked him out at once—he war charged with cutting and wounding Miller—I afterwards went to Plough-bridge and saw a large quantity of blood on the pavement from there down to the entrance of the docks, about 300 yards—that was not in the direction in which Miller went, but the direction in which the other Italians had gone—the prisoner had no hat on when I met him—I saw the other man who was wounded at the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. I live at Rotherhithe—I am divisional surgeon to the police—on 9th August, between 1 and 2 in the morning, I was called to the Rotherhithe Police-station to examine Miller—he was. bleeding from two incised wounds, one on the left knuckle of the little finger, the other at the back of the same arm, below the shoulder—that was nearly four inches long; it was not very deep; it had exposed the muscle both wounds were bleeding very much—I dressed them—he was perfectly sober.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw a knife afterwards at the police-court—such a knife as this (<hi rend="italic">produoed</hi>) would produce the wounds, but it would also produce much more severe wounds—from such a formidable weapon as this I should expect to find more severe wounds—I never saw a foreign sailor carry such a knife as this.</p>

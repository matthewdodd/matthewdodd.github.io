I reside at Blackstol, Kent—on 21st April between two and four o'clock in the afternoon I was in Gracechurch-street, endeavouring to get through a crowd—I saw the prisoner near me—I felt him close by my side and then felt a twitch, and saw my chain hanging down—the prisoner bolted across the road and I followed him—the chain was through my waistcoat, it was not broken, but the watch was twisted off the ring,—I did not see the prisoner caught, but I was close on bis heels—this is the watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

On the afternoon of 21st April, I was on duty at the corner of Fenchurch-street, I saw the prisoner running between the traffic, he crossed and re-crossed the road—I stepped on to the footway and caught him in my arms and asked him what he was funning for—he said, "Nothing, it is all rightn—the prosecutor came up and said, "That is the man who has taken my watch,"—the prisoner made no reply—on on rway to the station in Tower-street by Mincing-lane he tried to get away, and in the scuffle we got to the other side of the way; I was there surrounded by a lot of thieves—I saw something shining in the prisoner's hand which he was trying to pass—I took hold of his hand and at the same time I saw this watch pass from his hand into a wine-cellar—it was picked up and handed to me.</p>

I do not think I had seen it for three or four weeks before it was missed, as I went into mourning. I had given him warning to leave on Monday - but he left me on Saturday, the 17th of February; he had told my wife two days before, that he should go on Saturday. I did not pay him on Saturday, but desired him to come on Monday; he he came on Monday, about nine o'clock at night, and in consequence of what I heard, I accused him of having taken my coat - he denied it at first, I said</p>
               <p>"James you know, I know you to be a thief, and I will send for the watchman;" he then burst out crying, and said he had taken it, and if I sent the cook to his lodgings, she would have it. I went with the watchman by his direction to a house in Upper Norton-street, and found the coat. I found it so altered I could not swear to it, but he told me he had taken it to a tailor, and had a velvet collar put on and other buttons - I never gave him the coat.</p>

            . I am a tailor; the prisoner brought me the coat about the 8th or the 9th of February; it had been very little worn - he was then living with Mr. Young. I put new buttons to it, and a velvet collar; the buttons on it before were plain gilt, I put the same sort on, and altered it to fit him - he said he bought it for about 30 s. but did not say of whom - I saw the coat at Marlborough-street - it is the same.</p>

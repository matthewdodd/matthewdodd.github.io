            . On the 28th of August, in the morning about eight o'clock, two men from the police office in Marlborough-street, came to enquire whether there was any lead missing from the premises? at the same time they had a man in custody that appeared like a brewer's servant, that had stole some lead; I went to the office and saw the prisoner at the bar in custody there; from thence I went to Mr. Rawlins, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110095"></xptr>plumber, to beg him to look at the lead; we found that some lead had been cut down on Tuesday by the carpenters.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know that lead? - I went to the brewhouse of Mr. Sharp, and surveyed the upper part of the brewhouse, and I found there was some lead took off on Tuesday morning, and among it there was one gutter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you carry the lead to Mr. Sharp's? - Not that day, but the day following I did, that was on Thursday.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find the lead there corresponded at all with the lead wanting on the brewery? - There was a piece of lead missing, and had been took out from the upper part of the gutter, and this lead that we took answered to that place as to length and breadth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear newly cut? - It was not cut at all; it was a new piece.</p>

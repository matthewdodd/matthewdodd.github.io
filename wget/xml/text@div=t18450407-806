                  </hi>. I am turned twelve years of age, and live with my father, William Bateman—he occupies the first floor—there are lodgers in the house—my father is the landlord—it is in the parish of Christ Church, Spitalfields—on Monday, 3rd March, I went out on an errand after twelve o'clock in the day—I locked the room-door and took the key with me—I left nobody in the room—there was a clock of my father's hanging on a nail against the wall in the front room—I returned in about ten minutes, and met the prisoner coming down stairs with something under her cloak—I looked up the stairs and saw the door of my father's room open, which I had locked—she asked me if I lived in the house—I said yes—she said, "Go up stairs, there is a man in the front room; he gave me this clock, look here; here, take it," and she threw it down directly out of her hand, and broke it—she ran away—I ran after her, and called out "Stop thief!"—I saw her stopped by Harris—I had lost sight of her for about half a minute in turning the cor<lb></lb>ner, but I saw Harris catch her, and know her to be the same woman—I at first thought the key that was picked up belonged to me—when I was running after her I dropped my key and thought this might be mine—it is very much like it.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in White's-row, Spitalfields, between twelve and one o'clock on the 1st of March, and heard the screams of a child proceeding from the prosecutor's house—I saw the prisoner come out of the house, and the girl fast hold of her cloak—the prisoner got away from the girl and ran away—I ran after her—the girl screamed out, "Stop her, stop thief!"—I ran after her about twenty yards, and called to a young man to stop her—he did not stop her—I ran after her again about 100 yards and overtook her—she said she had done nothing, I had no occasion to stop her—in bringing her baa she said if there was any damage done she would make a recompense—I gave her into custody of a constable.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter. I was coming down Fashion-street, and saw the prisoner running—I asked her what was the matter—she said, "Nothing"—she continued to run, and had her cloak tucked under her arm—I did not exactly see her stopped by Harris, but hearing the children crying "Stop thief" I ran up, and as she was coming back I saw her drop the key—I picked it up and gave it to Harris, and he gave it to the policeman.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He never saw me drop it, for I never had it; he said at the station-house he knew nothing about it, and would not sign his name till the policeman made him; he said, "I only picked up the key; I do not know whether she dropped it or not." <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I never said any such thing—I said I did not want any bother, but the inspector said I had better go along with the policeman to Worship-street.</p>

On Tuesday, the 2nd of August, I went into the Rose public-house, the corner of Wimpole-street and Wigmore-street, to have a glass of porter; which I drank in the parlour. I came out, and left the three halfpence upon the bar door. A person called Mr. Callaghan, how do you do; that was by a man of the name of Allen; Riley gets up, and called me out of the tap-room into the street.</p>
               <p>COURT. This man you charge with a highway robbery, called you out into the street - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before - A. Yes; I dare say I had known him five or six years before. I knew him in place as a gentleman's servant, when I kept a public-house in Grosvenor-street; I had not known him in any other situation than as a gentleman's servant, in and out of place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know him as a Custom House officer - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor Excise officer - A. No; he was chiefly out of place. He called me out of the house into the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the street - A. Yes; we went into the street, and then he laid hold of my bundle; it was then five o'clock, in broad day-light, at the door of the Rose in Wimpole-street, and the corner of Wigmore-street. He said, I have been laying wait for you a great while, now I have got you, I hope I shall make my revenge of you.</p>
               <p>Q. What was there in this bundle - 
               <persName id="t18140914-171-person1456">A. </persName>
            Thirty-one piece of British lace, value twenty pounds and upwards; all British lace.</p>
               <p>Q. What revenge did he take - A. He laid hold of my bundle; I laid hold of it also. He took it away, and I took it away again; I had it best part away from him, with that, I laid hold of it again. He said, it is of no use; I am a Custom House officer, and I will show you my commission; I was too agitated to read it.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot say it was not a commission, can you; was it on parchment - A. I don't think it was; it was paper. I cannot be positive whether it was paper or parchment; I don't think it was parchment; I think it was paper; it was paper.</p>
               <p>Q. It was paper, was it - A. Yes, my lord.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the paper that he produced to you, did you satisfy yourself, and read it - A. I did not. I was too much agitated in mind to read it. He wrapped it up in a short time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you it in your possession - A. I saw nothing more in it than the name of a gentleman in Devonshire-place, and

            .</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know it was a commission or a letter - A. It was a letter in my opinion; he did not give it into my hands, he shewed it me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you an opportunity of finding out it was a commission - A. He had one part, and I the other; he pulled it away before I had time to read it all over. I thought if he was a Custom House officer, there was no danger of the goods; I thought Mr. Hughes goods would be in no danger, as they were not foreign.</p>
               <p>Q. We know British lace is near the foreign - A. He did not seize as a Custom House officer; I am certain he seized it to keep it. I called out, I was robbed, and called for assistance; I secured him so long, he did not get out of my sight, until he went to the Custom House; he did not go in; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181409140081"></xptr>believe he knew better. After he had hold of the bundle, I opened it to him; he said, he was not a judge. I said, bring it to any of these people in Holborn, or Oxford-street; I thought he was going into the lace-makers in Oxford-street. I said, why do not you go into here, that is a lace-makers. I told him at the time, all was of no avail. He took it to the Custom House, or at least unto it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then this man that committed the highway robbery upon you, takes you through all the streets in the face of the whole world; what became of the bundle - A. He had it on his arm all the time. When we went into Mincing-lane, he said to Allen, take care of this bundle until I come to you. I kept in sight of the bundle, and Riley came in ten or twelve minutes after; he said, he should go before a Peace officer. I took hold of the bundle, and walked after him; he went towards Whitechapel, near Aldgate-pump. I said, Riley, where are you going; what is the reason that you will not go to the Custom House; he said, he must go before a Peace officer.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of your bundle - A. He had hold of it all the while.</p>
               <p>Q. After going up Whitechapel, did he say he would lodge it any where - A. Yes; I brought him to lodge it in the Custom House.</p>
               <p>Q. You had the impudence to go before the Grand Jury, and swear this is a robbery - A. Why, sir, what do you call it.</p>
               <p>COURT. I will tell you what I call it; if the man applies for a copy of the indictment, I will grant him it.</p>

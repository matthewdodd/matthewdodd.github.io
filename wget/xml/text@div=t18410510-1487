                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Bennett Wood, a butcher, in New-street, Dorset-square—the prisoner was his journeyman on the 19th of April, and had been so for about five weeks—it was his duty to go out at nine o'clock in the morning, and he went out at that time on the 19th of April came to me at the desk and booked a shoulder of mutton to Mr.—he French, of Corn wall-terrace—I was at the counting-house window and I could see what took place in the shop—it was the prisoner's habit to cut his own meat—my master was at market that morning—after the prisoner booked one shoulder, he took two and put them in the tray, he put the one he did not book in the bottom of the tray, and the rest of his meat over it—it was his business to call the weight of his meat over to me after he booked it—he only gave me the weight of one shoulder of mutton—it was his duty to give me the weight of all the joints he took out—he gave me the weights of all except one shoulder—the weight of the one shoulder for Mr. French was 9 3/4 lbs. —I was there when he returned—he did not bring back any shoulder with him, or any meat of any kind—he did not account at any time for the second shoulder.</p>

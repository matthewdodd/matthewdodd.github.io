I am the wife of William Barker, a timber porter—previous to my marriage I had known the prisoner—I met him on 11th July, in Tavistock-place, about half-past 10 o'clock in the morning—I saw him again about half-past 8 o'clock in the evening, and two young girls came up and spoke to me—we all remained in company about five minutes—before we came to the public-house the prisoner asked me for 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to have a pint of beer—I offered him a penny—he declined to take that—we bad words, as we had in the day previously—he took my head under his left arm, and I felt myself stabbed, three times in the breast, once in the elbow, and once in my ribs—a great deal of blood came from the wounds—I felt myself wounded, and put my hand to my breast—I fell, and was insensible—I was taken to University College Hospital, and remained there a fortnight—I am quite well now—I have seen a knife like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) before—I should not like to swear it was this—some angry words had passed between me and the prisoner before—I wanted to go to a place, and he said I should not go—I said I would, and he pushed me, and I struck him—that was about 2 o'clock in the day—he went away, and I went to my place, and in the evening I met him again—I was with two friends when I saw him.</p>

The <hi rend="italic">Princess Victoria</hi> belonged to them—I have been in the habit of paying the prisoner on his producing vouchers for that purpose—I have paid him in that way ever since he was employed—on the 12th of October I paid him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he produced a certificate which I believed to be signed by the engineer—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it purports to be signed, "John Nicolson"—I paid him on the faith of that certificate, and on the 19th of October I paid him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on a similar certificate—they were both presented to me at the office.</p>

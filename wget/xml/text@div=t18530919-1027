                  </hi>. I am in the employment of the prosecutors, at the Stratford station. I am cattle man and goods porter—I unload the cattle that come up by the train—the prisoner was a smith, in the employment of the Company at Stratford; Mr. Gower is his foreman—on 19th Aug., about half past 7 or 8 o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner with a quantity of malt coming from a bullock truck which had a sheet over it like a roof, and bars, and a door at the side—I had seen that truck previously; it had come from the country—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185309190085"></xptr>
               <p>I bad seen ten quarters of malt in it, in twenty sacks, some of which had been moved before I saw the prisoner there—I walked up to the prisoner and asked him what he had got, he made me no answer—he had got half a peck of malt in a handkerchief—he was five or six yards from the truck, when I first saw him—there was no grain round the struck outside, but what he spilled when I went to him—I arrested him, and the clerk sent for a policeman—after I came from the station I went to the truck, and found one sack was lying down, and another was lying across it which had been untied—it was tied with a bow, and the others were tied in a knot—it could not hare come untied of itself, if it had fallen—it contained malt—I have Been in the service of the Company since 21st June, I am well acquainted with the rules—no one is allowed to take sweepings of grain away, without a written order—the prisoner had no business to be in the truck.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk at the Stratford station, in the goods department. I remember a truck, containing malt, being at the station on 19th Aug.; there were other trucks bolted to it—I saw the prisoner that evening jump off the platform next to the truck on to the ground, and saw Brown catch hold of him—I said, "You hold him tight while I fetch a policeman"—I saw the grain in his possession; there were holes in the handkerchief, and there was a little grain on the platform which had been spilled—I could not see a policeman, and went to the police station—as I returned with one I met the prisoner in the town, in custody—there were twenty sacks of malt in the truck—I found two of them lying down, one across the other, and at the mouth of one a small quantity of grain appeared to have been swept up—it was dark, as there was a sheet over the truck; I counted the sacks by feeling them—I afterwards opened one, and took out some malt, which I have compared with that found on the prisoner, and it corresponds.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You were not before the Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I was; but I did not give evidence—I have been subpoenaed here to-day—there are a great many depredations about the railway, and we are very anxious to catch the thief.</p>

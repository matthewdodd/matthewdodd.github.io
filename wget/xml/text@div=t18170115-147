I am the wife of the last witness, the prisoner was my servant; when I laid-in she went away for a fortnight, while I had another nurse; she was backwards and forwards during the time, and afterwards came to live with me again; the night before she went away, she said she should get up early to clean the kitchen, she did not say she was going.

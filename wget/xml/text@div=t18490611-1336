                  </hi>. I am a carman, of Holywell-row; Fletcher was in my service. In consequence of missing hay and clover, on 20th of May, I went into Wimpress's stable in my yard, which he rents of me, and found a truss of hay and a truss of clover belonging to me—next morning, Monday, I went again, and asked him where he got it—he said it was his, and that he bought it—I said it belonged to me, and I could swear to it—he said, "If it belongs to you you must have put it there"—he afterwards said he bought it if a man in Tottenham Court-road, and he would go up with me in two hours' time—I said I would go up, and if he could satisfy me I would be satis<lb></lb>fied—he said he could not go for two hours (there was plenty of time for him to go there in the two hours)—I went with him in about two hours to a person named Coust, and asked if he knew the prisoner—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Are you in the habit of selling him hay and clover, because I have been robbed?"—he said he had sold or lent him a truss of hay and a truss of clover on Saturday—I said it was not his clover, I could swear it belonged to me—I afterwards went again to Wimpress' stable I could not find the two trusses, but found hay and clover resembling mine mixed with some rubbish and hay-bands—I had given Fletcher into custody in the mean time—Wimpress keeps a horse.</p>

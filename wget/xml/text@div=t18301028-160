               <p>ABRAHAM GREEN. I live in Middlesex-street, Whitechapel. The prisoner has been about sixteen years in my service; I gave him two sovereigns, ten shillings, and a sixpence, to fetch some olives which I had bought of Mr. Josephs, No. 2, Maiden-lane - I gave him the money at the <placeName id="t18301028-160-crimeloc889">Bell, in Middlesex-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe be behaved well to you? A. Yes; he wanted to speak to me, but I was hasty; it was cold weather, and I had given him some drink that morning-I would take him into my employ again.</p>

I am foreman in the proof department at the arsenal, at Woolwich; it is where they prove all the cannon—the prisoner was em<lb></lb>ployed in the same department for above twelve months I think—this lead is very much like that which is used at the arsenal; it is used to put on the vents of the guns when it is wet weather; I have a piece with me—the pri<lb></lb>soner could go at all times to the place where it is kept, at any time there is a proof—to the best of my belief this is lead which was in the proof department at the arsenal shortly prior to 6th Dec.</p>

               <p>on Small Arms, in the proof departments—during my employment in the arsenal, from the middle of March last to Aug., there was a brass top of a telescope stand that was used in rifle practice under my charge in the armoury, and I believe it has been since missing—it was of the shape of this piece of brass (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—these pieces all formed one article—it was marked with the broad arrow in four places—I believe these pieces of brass to have formed that telescope stand—this piece has been marked in four places; two of the marks have been obliterated by a hammer, the other two are partially obliterated, but a sufficiency of the broad arrow remains for me to identify it—this round piece is a composition of brass, afterwards bronzed; it formed the swivel top which the telescope fitted into—the broad arrow is the Government mark—these screws were marked with a small arrow, but they have been hammered; there is no mark that I can swear to—to the best of my belief, this round piece is the property of the Crown, and these other pieces I believe to have formed a portion of the same article—I do not swear that they did, but they are similar—the telescope stand was in my care until I left the employment in the middle of August, and I then delivered it over safe to Bombardier M'Cullum, the non-com<lb></lb>missioned officer that remained in charge—he was employed with me in the small armoury where the small arms were kept—I left this telescope in the small armoury, in a press or cupboard.</p>

Q.</hi> Was this used while you were there, from March till August? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; it was not put by with old materials, it was put for safety in a cupboard, where select rifles were kept—I have handled it almost daily; in taking out rifles it was generally on the shelf at the back, and I always had to take hold of it to prevent it from falling, and latterly I placed it in the bottom part of the cupboard for safety, and to give no trouble—there was only that one instrument of that description in the establishment—I have not seen any other of that make in the whole arsenal—it is by the marks that I swear it is Government property—I did not know the prisoner before March last—he has borne a high character in the regiment to my knowledge for that period—he has four stripes; they are marks of good conduct—if he had not behaved well, he would not have got them—I do not know that he would now have been entitled to another stripe from length of service—I am not aware of his length of service.</p>

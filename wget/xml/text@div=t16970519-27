The first Evidence being a little Boy, who was going through the Market, said, That he did hear the Woman cry out, Mother, Mother, your Son has kill'd me! And he saw the Prisoner take her up in his Arms, and say, Lord, Lord, what have I done! Another Evidence said, That he saw the Prisoner and his Wife together, and saw him lift his left Hand up to his Shoulder, but did not see him run the Knife at her; and whilst he was talking with some People, the Prisoner's Mother stood by him, and on a sudden the Woman cried out, That her Son had killed her; and when her Mother came she could not speak but clapt her hand upon her Wound; and his Mother said to him, You Rogue what have you done? And he said I have kill'd her, what do you think I have done? And she fell down between them; then he took hold of him by the Collar; and he told him, That he had killed her, and he had better end her Days then she did his, and now she has done both, as it falls out. There was some swore they saw the Knife sticking in her Cloaths, and the Blood running from her. He confest before the Justice that he had been out two days before in ill Company, and threw the Knife at her twice. The Prisoner said upon his Tryal, that he was very sorry for what was done, saying, That he had been out to look for Money, but could get none, and his Wife gave him ill Words, with that he took his Knife and threw it upon the Stall in a Passion, but did not think to hurt her; and said, That he had better have kill'd himself than killed her, and how the Wound came he knew not; for when he had the Knife he held it with the point in his Hand when he threw it. He called divers People to prove that his Wife was a grievous Scold, and one that would never suffer him to be at quiet, let him do what he could for her; but that did not avail him, the Jury found him <rs id="t16970519-27-verdict156" type="verdictDescription">

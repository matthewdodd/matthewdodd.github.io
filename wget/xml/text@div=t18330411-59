I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110033"></xptr>down to Finchley, and examined the house, on the 26th; I found it had been broken into, and found some marks of a very large shoe or ancle-boot, with nails, in front of the front parlour window; I apprehended the prisoner, and it was very much like the shoe he had on - I have examined the prisoner's shoe since; I thought it resembled the mark - I did not compare it; it had very large nails in it; the house had been entered at the back kitchen window - the lower sash was thrown up, and the bottom hinge wrenched off the shutter; on the 3rd of March the Magistrate sent for me to apprehend Stacey and the prisoner - I went to their house, but neither of them were at home; I searched the house, and found property belonging to Mrs. Claridge - it was in Stacey's house, where the prisoner lodged; Stacey has never been apprehended yet - he lives at Finchley; I know the prisoner lodged there, from information which I received - I apprehended the prisoner the same night, near the Saracen's Head Inn, at Finchley; he never acknowledged that he lodged at Stacey's - I found in Stacey's house a centre-bit and other articles; I took the prisoner before a Magistrate - he was remanded for a week; I found eleven duplicates in the house, in Mrs. Stacey's pocket.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. I was required by the Magistrate to attend the officer to look for the property; on the 4th of March I found property, which I knew to belong to Mrs. Claridge, at Castle's, the pawnbroker's, in Camden-town, and more at Mr. Wells', Hampstead-road, and at Griffiths', Ossulton-street, and at Blackburn's, Skinner-street; when I returned home with the officer, I went to Mrs. Stacey's, at Finchley - Mrs. Stacey was in custody at the time, by order of the Magistrate; Stacey and his wife have absconded - I know the prisoner was acquainted with Stacey and his wife; the prisoner was making his escape when he was apprehended, for he was two miles from home - he held out some threats to us, and I said it was a pity he should hold out threats, when he had robbed so many people as he had - he said he did not care a b-r about it; I stated before the Magistate (Mr. Ray), in his presence, that Mrs. Stacey had informed me, when we returned from town, that Gaywood and her husband had furnished her with the property which she had pawned - that they had given it to her to pledge for them - and she also said she wished her husband would come forward and clear her; the prisoner made no reply to it.</p>

             re-examined. I know the prisoner lodged at Stacey's; I have seen him at the house daily, at Finchley - I saw them together on the morning after Mrs. Claridge's robbery, standing at Stacey's door (him and Stacey). I was only passing, and saw them standing there; I am in the habit of frequently passing Stacey's in my business, and I know he lodges at Stacey's - this was the day after the robbery, on the 26th of February, and on the 28th I saw him and Stacey, and Stacey's wife, and a person named Smith and his wife, passing my house, (as if coming from London), going towards Stacey's house; Smith and his wife had only been discharged for a case of burglary, the Session before.</p>
               <p>MRS. CLARIDGE. This pepper castor, and book, was found in Mrs. Stacey's pocket - these housebreaking implements were found in Stacey's house, and on the evening I found the petticoat on Stacey's child, I went with the men to search the house, and this property of mine was found in it - here are a bolster, two tablecloths, a flannel-petticoat, and a napkin, which were safe in my house on the night of Monday, the 25th; I found them the Sunday after that, and the petticoat was on the child - Stacey has absconded.</p>

            .

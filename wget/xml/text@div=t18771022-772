                  </hi>. I am a widow, and occupy the front top room at 15, St. Helena Place, Clerkenwell—the prisoner occupied the back room on the same floor with Eliza Tripp—they were cohabiting as man and wife—on the morning of 11th September I was awoke between three and four o'clock by a noise in their room, and heard the woman say "You are killing me, Jack, don't hit me again"—I went to the door, knocked three times, and called to him to leave the girl alone, but no one answered—a policeman then came up and knocked at the door two or three times—there was no answer—the woman cried for help, and said, "You are killing me," and he burst the door open—I heard the word "murder" in a female voice, and the prosecutrix, entirely naked, ran under the policeman's arms into my room—she was covered with blood, and I saw a wound in her throat—I remained in the room about half an hour, and she was bleeding more or less the whole of that time—a doctor was fetched, and came directly—she was removed into her own room, where the prisoner was getting ready to go away with the constable, but he only remained a few minutes.</p>

About 8.15 in the morning I heard cries of murder and police in a female's voice; went up to the top floor of the house and heard blows, and a female crying, "Jack, don't kill me"—the door was locked, and I forced it open with my truncheon, and saw the prisoner, with a female laid across two chairs in front of the fireplace holding her by the throat with both hands—I pulled him off of her, and then saw that she had a wound in her throat—she was naked, and covered with blood—she rushed into the next room, saying in the prisoner's presence that he had cut her throat with a knife—he made no</p>

On 11th September about a quarter to four o'clock I was called to the prisoner's room, and found it all over blood—the prosecutrix was in the next room—I took the prisoner to the station, and on the way he said, "I have made a pretty job of it now, but she aggravated me to it. I came home at 11 o'clock, and she did not get home till 2; the child was very cross, and I could not keep it quiet; she would not get into bed, and this is what it has come to"—he also said that he supposed she had taken a little too much whisky—the girl had nothing on, and was covered with blood, and he only had on a bit of his shirt sleeve—he put his wife's shift on to go to the station—the child was in bed in Mrs. Cooper's room—I found these tongs by the fireplace covered with fresh blood, and on some rags in a wooden chest under the bed this table-knife with blood running from it—the lid had been lifted up and the knife dropped under.</p>

Last September I was living with the prisoner as his wife—on 11th September I came home between 1.30 and 2 in the morn<lb></lb>ing, and found the prisoner going to bed—I had had a drop too much drink, but he had had nothing at all—he asked where I had been—I told him I would not tell him, he must find out—he went to bed—I did not undress myself—he said that if I told him where I had been he would not touch me—I told him he could do what he liked, I should not tell him—I then went to bed too, and he asked me again, but I would not tell him, so he got out of bed, and hit me on the head with the tongs—I was not in bed then; I jumped out at the same time that he did, and after he hit me I got a knife—I always run to the knife when I am in a temper—I got out of bed because I knew he was going to hit me—I tried to stab him for hitting me—I never cried out, I only said, "Oh, Jack, don't hit me"—I never used the word "murder" all the time we were quarrelling, but I believe people in the nest room called out "murder" when they heard I was being knocked about—the prisoner tried to pull the knife out of my hand, and my thumb got cut in the struggle—I tried to stab him with it on the back of his neck, when he put his head down and I bit him, and we fell on the floor together, and he got the knife from me, and cut my thumb in getting it—he had struck me two blows on the head with the tongs, but not heavy blows—I did not feel them much at the time—I believe he got the knife from me, but I do not know anything more till the policeman came in—I was not lying on any chairs, there was not room for them where we were—he has only hit me once before, but I have stabbed him twice—I ran out of the room with my petticoat round me—I do not remember how my throat was cut—I was not taken to Mrs. Cooper's room; I went there.</p>

                  </hi>, M. R. C. S. I live at 1, Wilmington Square, Clerk<lb></lb>enwell—I was called to St. Helena Place, and found the prosecutrix in the front room, crouched on the floor, and covered with blood from head to foot—she Lad a flannel petticoat round her, but not on—I removed her to the next room, and found on the front of her head a contused wound about an inch long, not very deep, and immediately behind that a star-shaped wound, under which was a dent in the bone, that was from a more severe blow—I do not think they were done with the knob at the end of these tongs, but with the centre knob—a blow from this end would make a much broader cut—there was also a small contused wound one third of an inch deep, at the back of her head, which might have been produced by striking against something—there were scratches of a knife on her hands, and on her throat a wound about three inches long, going from right to left, and jagged at one end—it went down to the wind<lb></lb>pipe and touched the cartilages and muscles, but it did not open the windpipe—it could be done with this knife—it was jagged, showing that the knife had been drawn across two or three times, and had grazed the skin, but the knife need not have been taken from the original wound to do that—it was only serious from the loss of blood—injury to the windpipe might have led to inflammation of the lungs, but the cut would have had to go considerably deeper than it did, to touch any of the main vessels—there was also a cut between her left thumb and forefinger three-quarters of an inch long, and rather deep, and a cor<lb></lb>responding cut on the finger, as if she had had the knife thus—it was as you would expect to find when one person was wresting a knife from another—there were a great many small cuts on both hands—she went into the hospital the next day as there was no one to nurse her.</p>

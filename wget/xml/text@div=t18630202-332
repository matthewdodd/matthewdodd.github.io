I am a carman, and live with my father at 5, Daven<lb></lb>port-street, Commercial-road, East—the prisoner is my brother—on the night of 22d January, I fastened up the house, all the doors and windows—I and my wife were the last up—I went to bed some time after 10—I came down in the morning as usual about 8—I found the shutters of the kitchen-window had been forced open, the nails drawn from the bolt which fastened the shutter, and the window had been opened, though it was shut when I down—the shutter being forced, the window could be opened so as to</p>

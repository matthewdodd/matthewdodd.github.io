                  </hi>. I carry on business at 84, Strand, with Mr. Harrison Frodsham as watch manufacturers—my predecessor was Charles Frodsham, and he used a particular trade mark "Charles Frodsham, 84, Strand, London"—upon succeeding to that business I purchased it and the right to put his name on the watches—that license was in writing from the trustees—in purchasing the business I purchased the license—we now use the name Charles Frodsham and put it on all our watches—we sell watches besides those of our own manufacture, but we put "Examined by Charles Frodsham"—we do not put the name on any watches that we have not either made ourselves or examined, and we also put "84, Strand, London"—in the beginning of March last Mr. Ford of the Poultry brought a watch to be repaired—I produce that watch—it is marked "Charles Frodsham, 84, Strand, London, 14881"—there was no name on the face—it had had a name but it was rubbed off—it is the custom to mark the principal parts of the watch inside, and that should correspond with the number on the watch—the number on the case is 438, and the number on the watch is 75438—I took the watch to pieces when it was brought to me to be repaired—I made that watch for Mr. Lloyd in November, 1865—I never saw it from that time until I saw it in the Strand—when I made it I was carry<lb></lb>ing on business in St. John Street Road—I have the book here relative to that watch—the manufacturing number which I stamped on the works of that watch when I made it was 75438—the date is November 10th, 1865—at that time I was not a member of the firm of Frodsham—I have only been so three years—I put the name on that watch of "W. J. Lloyd, London"—there is a slight mark on this plate of the beginning of the letter "N" for the word "number," that is all, the other has been filed and taken out—my employer was Mr. Lloyd—the number I engraved for him was 5438 instead of 75438, leaving out the 7—when I manufacture for a small maker I put on a smaller number—it is not a consecutive number in Mr. Lloyd's books—I am able to say positively that was the identical watch that I made—Lloyd is a watchmaker, and inasmuch as it would have looked suspicious for Lloyd's number to have been 75438 I left out the 7—throughout the works the number 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 75438, but the number that is seen is 5438—I had dealings with Mr. Frodsham before I went into his business, when he put his name upon a watch which he had not made himself, after the watch was completed he would spend 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more in timing it and examining it—he would not even trust to me to finish them.</p>
               <p>

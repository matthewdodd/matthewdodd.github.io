            . About a fortnight ago I met with the prisoner at the bar in <placeName id="t17591024-19-crimeloc94">Nightingale-Lane</placeName>

The prisoner said there were three shillings and six pence when I was in the house with her. She fastened me in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body else in the house?</p>
               <p>Hudson. I saw no body else in the house but the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day did you go into the house?</p>
               <p>Hudson. I went in about nine or ten at night, and sat in a chair and slept, with my head on a table, 'till about two in the morning. When I awaked I could not get out 'till day-light; she was gone, and I was left alone.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get the door open?</p>
               <p>Hudson. I got that open with my knife. I miss'd my money.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss that?</p>
               <p>Hudson. I miss'd that about two o'clock, purse and all.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the door fastened?</p>
               <p>Husdon. It was hasped to, and I put it off the staple with my knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you meet with the prisoner afterwards?</p>
               <p>Hudson. I took her up at Wapping New, Stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. When?</p>
               <p>Hudson. The next day. She had my purse in her hand when I first saw her; I said that was my purse; she said it was, and she delivered it to a waterman; and I am very sure he put nothing into it, and took nothing out, and he gave it to me; there was in it six guineas and a half, and one 36 s. piece. I took her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175910240029"></xptr> before Justice Scott, there she was examined; she told the Justice that she took it out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know she took it out of your pocket?</p>
               <p>Hudson. I only know it by what she confessed afterwards. If I had found her at taking it out of my pocket I would not have let her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take her from Wapping-Stairs immediately before the Justice?</p>
               <p>Hudson. No; I took her first to the house where I was with her, and kept her there 'till I got a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you how much money she took out of your pocket?</p>
               <p>Hudson. No; I ask'd her where the rest of the money was; and she said, she had given that to one of her companions.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you what the rest of the money was?</p>
               <p>Hudson. No; I did not ask her; she had made away with seven guineas and two 36 s. pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give her any money that night?</p>
               <p>Hudson. No; I did not; she took enough, I had no occasion to give her any.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you given her some money before she took your purse?</p>
               <p>Hudson. No; not a farthing.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you go into that house for?</p>
               <p>Hudson. To see her bed; but it was so dirty and nasty I would not lie in it. We had a pot of beer together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not she ask you to give her something?</p>
               <p>Hudson. No; not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Hudson. No; if I had been sober I should not have been there.</p>
               <p>The prisoner had nothing to say in her defence.</p>

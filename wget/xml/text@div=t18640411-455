                  </hi>, I am a lighterman, of 9, Thomas-place—on the after<lb></lb>noon of 2d March, about ten minutes to 6, I was in Ratcliff-highway, near Old Gravel-lane—the prisoner, Burgess, came behind me and put his hand in my right hand trousers' pocket—I looked over my shoulder, and said, "All right mate; I know you; you have picked my pocket"—I grasped his hand in my pocket, and tried to hold it—I lost that, and turned round and caught him by the collar—he up with his fist, and struck me on the right eye—I saw him when he struck me—it was this one with the light coat—he gives the name of Burgess—I called out, "Jack!" two or three times, and" Police!"—the other prisoner directly gave me a violent blow on the neck—that was the first time I had seen him—I was then surrounded by six or eight men</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186404110103"></xptr>
               <p>and women, and received several blows—Burgess turned down Little Gravel-lane, and I pursued him—John Platt was close to me—when it took place we were walking side by side—I was knocked down a second time in Old Gravel-lane by Buckley—Piatt came and released me when Buckley and another one had got me down in a corner close to the Dock-gates, and were ill using me—I got before them, and saw Burgess walking a little distance ahead, with his coat off and under his arm—I saw two policemen on the opposite side of the road—I then got close to Platt again, and saw Burgess walking on—we walked behind him—the police came up, and I gave him in custody—there is a bridge there—I lost sight of Buckley, but have no doubt of his identity—I was sober—I have been a teetotaller four years—I lost a half-crown and a florin.</p>

SHARPE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were had you been? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had just left the office in Tower-street—I did not pay away anything after that—I had not looked at my money—the first thing that called my attention was the man jumping on my back—I should say that his legs must have been off the ground by the way he was on my back—he had one arm round me, and one in my pocket—his legs were not round my waist—I had never seen Burgess before to my knowledge—I had on a pair of mole skin trousers; the same as these—the flap was not turned down—the men did not tumble against me—when I was examined before, I did not think Buckley was the first who struck me, I said that he was the second who hit me—Ratcliff-highway is straight down, and Gravel-lane is perpendicular to it—I had passed a few yards beyond Gravel-lane—I lost sight of Burgess for a second or two—they did not detain me more than a moment in the Highway before I got into Gravel-lane—Platt followed me—Burgess was walking twenty yards ahead of me in Gravel-lane—after I had been knocked down a second time I went towards him with Platt—I was attacked in a corner, where Platt came and pulled Buckley off me—I was engaged a minute or two in that corner; it was not three or four minutes—when that was over I went on with Platt straight down Gravel-lane, and saw the man. I say was Bur<lb></lb>gess, about fourteen yards off, with his coat under his arm—Platt seized him, and took him in custody—it was then about ten minutes past 6—I saw the time coming down the Highway, and it was not ten minutes past then—at the time Burgess jumped on my back Platt, was side by side with me.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. TAYLOR</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many policemen have you seen in this case? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Two of the K division, and a Thames policeman, who took Buckley—I have not spoken to any others—they said nothing about Mr. Smith, the solicitor—Mr. Smith did not take my evidence, but he came to my place, Thames-street, Poplar, a month ago, to ask me if I wanted a solicitor—I told him I would give him an answer up here on Monday—No. 303 K, brought a female to the Police-court next morning, but I could not identify her—she was dressed differently—I had not seen anybody before I was attacked from behind—I had this overcoat on—the man's left arm was round my neck—I cried out, <hi rend="italic">Jack! Jack!</hi> on missing my money—up to that time I had neither seen nor heard anything of Buckley—Pratt then said, "What is the matter?"—when Burgess jumped on my back, he said, "I know you mate," as I looked over my shoulder—I was rather angry at his jumping on my back in that way—I did not fall down then—we had a little scuffling, and he escaped, and went down Gravel-lane—I then saw Buckley in the Highway—there was a little crowd at the beginning of Gravel-lane—there were two or three women—there was fighting down the lane—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186404110104"></xptr>
               <p>when the police first appeared, the crowd halloed, "Down with them; keep them down," and" Boot them"—I do not think I heard the crowd cry, "Shame"—this happened on Wednesday evening, and I next saw Buckley on the following Monday night; five days afterwards—I believe I had seen him once before this night—when I spoke to the police about it, I did not hear them say, "Oh, we know the man"—as soon as I gave Burgess in charge, I made my way out of the crowd to avoid further violence, and walked to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lighterman, of 17, New-street, Poplar—I was with Cates on 2d March, walking down the Highway in conversation—I missed him, and saw him some distance away, singing out, <hi rend="italic">"Jack! Jack!</hi>"—I went back, and he pointed to Burgess, and said, "That man has picked my pocket my "—before he could say the words, one of the party struck him, and Burgess ran away—I went and caught him in the Highway—Cates came up, and we both caught hold of him—I saw Buckley in the Highway, and there were three women there—I cannot say where Buckley was then, because there were such a gang of them to get Burgess away, that we were over<lb></lb>powered—we then went down Old Gravel-lane—Burgess saw me following him, and turned round and made a strike at me, but I leaned on one side and struck at him—I looked round on my left, and saw Buckley and another of the gang with Cates down on the ground, in a corner, striking him—I pulled Buckley off him, and the other one got up and ran away—it was then a few minutes after 6—it was not dark; it was a little dusk—Buckley got away, but we pursued him, and just as we got to the bridge they made some bitter oaths how they would serve us if we pursued them over the bridge—the prisoners were among the gang—Burgess, hearing that there was a policeman over the bridge, pulled off his coat, put it under his arm, and walked steadily, like a man going home from his work—I ran after him, put my arms round his arms, and gave him in custody.</p>

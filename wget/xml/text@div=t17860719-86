             was just at the entrance of our yard, he stood there talking with some of our people, but I cannot tell particularly which; he was a dustman, and had just shot a load of dust; his cart was at the dust hole, a little way from him; the prisoner came over the way from the Coach and Horses, and spoke to

            , and says to him, why don't you come and speak to this man over the way; and Anderson says, it is of no use for me to go, for I have no money to pay him; and then the prisoner went up to him and said, you b - r I will make you go, and struck him at the same time.</p>
               <p>Did he go up to him in a threatening angry manner? - I am not positive; but by the manner it must; he then struck him immediately.</p>
               <p>Where did he strike him? - He struck him on the side of the head.</p>
               <p>What did the deceased do upon that? - He rather drew back from the blow, and rather smiled, but Jenkins followed him up, and gave him a blow with the same hand on the head, and at the same time his foot went crossways of his private parts.</p>
               <p>Do you think he meant to kick him there or did he only mean to trip up his heels, can you describe a little more particularly in what manner he kicked him? - His foot went crossways.</p>
               <p>Do not you think he meant to trip up his heels? - A man meaning to trip up a man's heels could never be so high as that I think.</p>
               <p>What was the consequence of the second blow? - He reeled round and fell backwards into a cart which stood with the tail to the ground.</p>
               <p>Was it his own cart? - No, it was another Cart; and the prisoner went to him and said, you b - r I could fight you with one hard, when he was laying in the cart; and the deceased answered, let me alone, for I am not able to stand against you, you have pretty well done for me already; the prisoner then pulled him out of the cart.</p>
               <p>Had it the appearance of lifting him out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190132"></xptr> the cart or dragging him out? - It had not much the appearance of lifting him up, it was more in the manner of pulling him out; after he pulled him out of the cart he set him on his legs and he fell down afterwards; after that he took him round the arms and drew him across the road, to the Coach and Horses, between twenty and thirty yards; I did not like to interfere in it; there were more present that might have interfered as well as me; he took him into the house.</p>
               <p>Did the man when he fell into the care seem very much hurt? - Yes, he did, he changed countenance, and put his hands across; he seemed to be very much hurt by the kick, I do not think he was much hurt by the blow; he fell from the kick into the cart.</p>
               <p>If he appeared to you at that time to be much hurt, why did not you interfere? - I did not like to interfere in it with such sort of people; they might have done me an i njury as well as another; there were others there might as well have interfered as me.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner say any thing at any time about his having hurt him, or not having hurt him? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Did the deceased strike the prisoner at all? - Not in the least.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner never said any thing about having hurt or not having hurt the deceased? - I did not hear him say a word.</p>
               <p>You have been examined before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was the account you gave then a true one? - Yes, as near as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner say any thing about Anderson? - Not that I ever heard, I never heard him say that he had hurt him or had not hurt him.</p>
               <p>Did any body join with the prisoner in this? - Yes, one Boulton was in the cart; when he was pulled out, one of them said, I cannot tell which, when he was set on his legs, the b - r was not hurt; that was when he was pulled out of the cart.</p>
               <p>Who was Boulton? - He was another dustman; they were all dustmen together.</p>
               <p>Did the deceased make use of any provoking language? - Not a word, which I was amazed at, as he was a very swearing man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Where was Boulton when I came out of the Coach and Horses? - I did not observe, you came out with a knife and a bone in your hand.</p>
               <p>Jury. When the prisoner came out with a knife in his hand, if he had been maliciously inclined, and had a mind to take away the man's life, he had an opportunity? - He had a knife when he came over; he put it out of his hand, he made no use of it against the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. I fancy you will find that he did not intend to take away the deceased's life; but there will be another question; murder may be committed without absolute and direct intention of taking away a life.</p>

               <p>I am a dustman; I was present when this unfortunate affair happened, I was standing at my shed door, on the right hand side, very near the deceased; the deceased had just been and shot a load of dust, then this prisoner came from the Coach and Horses, and asked the deceased the reason he did not come and settle a reckoning they had had before; Anderson said I have no money, it is of no use for me to go over; the prisoner then struck him on the side of the head, the deceased seemed to smile, then the prisoner up with his hand, and struck him again; then he gave him a kick.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner make any answer to the deceased when he said he had got no money? - No; he struck him without saying any thing.</p>
               <p>Upon that blow did either of them say any thing? - No; Anderson seemed to make a smile, upon which the prisoner struck him again directly, and as soon as ever struck him, he made a swinging kick at him, and kicked him in the private parts, and he turned round and fell into a cart; it was not a kick straight forwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190133"></xptr>Do you think he meant to trip up his heels? - It seemed like it.</p>
               <p>Court. Did it appear to you as if he aimed at his private parts, and meant to kick him there? - No, it did not.</p>
               <p>After the second blow and the kick what happened? - When he was in the tail of the cart the prisoner threatened to fight him with one hand, and the deceased said he was not able to stand, for he had done for him already.</p>
               <p>Did the deceased appear to you to fall backwards by the force of the blow and kick? - He reeled round and fell into the cart; then I went away to carry a bushel of cinders, and when I returned I met them drawing him across the road, that might be about three minutes, I did not go above thirty yards, the prisoner had the deceased under the arms, and was drawing him across the road.</p>
               <p>Describe as near as you can in what manner he was drawing him across the road? - He had him under the arms, and was drawing him along, he drew him against the steps.</p>

               <p>Take hold of that man that stands in the Court, and shew me how he dragged him? - He dashed him against the steps. I did not see him thrown down violently, but he let him slip down, he threw him down like upon the steps, he let him go, and down he dropped.</p>
               <p>Not as if he meant to do him a mischief, not like dashing him down? - No.</p>
               <p>After the deceased told him that he was not able to fight him, and that he had pretty well done for him already, did the prisoner offer to strike him after that? - No; he did not.</p>
               <p>Did you see any more? - No, not then; this was on the Thursday; on the Sunday following a woman came and begged of me to go and cut off the deceased's beard; I went, and found him in bed, and on the hind part of his head the hair was all cut off the back part of his head, and there was a very large bruise, as broad as the palm of my hand, and as black as could be; I saw no bruises any where else; he complained much of his head, and appeared light-headed; while I was shaving him, he said, gentlemen, pray do not squeeze me so hard; he said nothing to me about the hurt, nor I did not say any thing to him.</p>
               <p>Jury. You did not observe his head hitting against the stone, when he let him down on the steps? - No, I did not; I saw him on the Monday; I then saw the place again, and in the middle of the place there were three specks, like three drops of tallow.</p>

               <p>I saw the prisoner come across the road and speak to the deceased, and ask him to come across the way and settle the reckoning that they had, and the deceased said it was of no use to come, for he had no money.</p>
               <p>Then the prisoner had some concern in the reckoning? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it at all explained what that reckoning was? - No, Sir; it was an old reckoning; then the prisoner said no more to him, but up with his fist and hit him on the side of his head, and with that the deceased drew back, and made a smile, and he up with his fist and hit him again, and kicked him at the present time he hit him.</p>
               <p>Describe in what manner he kicked him? - He made a kick at him and kicked him right across here.</p>
               <p>Did he kick straight at him? - No; his foot came askew at him, he kicked above his heels, he kicked at his thigh; it did not seem to me to aim to trip up his heels, he did not kick straight at him, but askew.</p>
               <p>What was the consequence of that blow and kick? - He fell down into the tail of a cart with the vengeance of the blows and kick; then the prisoner Jenkins came up, and run his fist in his face, and called him a b - r, and said he would fight him with one of his hands.</p>
               <p>What did the deceased say to that? - He said he was not able to stand against<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190134"></xptr> him, for he had almost done for him already; then the prisoner took him out of the cart, and set him upon his legs, and he fell down, he could not stand with the violence of the kick; then he took him under the arms, and drew him all across the road, after he had drawn him all across the road, he let him drop on the steps.</p>
               <p>Describe as near as you can the manner in which he let him drop on the steps? - He did not fling him down with any force, he only let him drop with his own weight on the steps, he did not fling him down as I saw.</p>
               <p>Was you all brother workmen together? - I work for another man.</p>
               <p>When he tumbled backwards into the cart, did he fall with violence? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did his head hit against any thing then? - Yes; he fell with great force, and the back part of his head hit against the bottom of the cart.</p>

               <p>I was present when this happened, I saw the prisoner come up to Anderson, but I was not near enough to hear what he said, I saw him strike him.</p>
               <p>How often? - Once.</p>
               <p>What more did you see? - I saw him kick him on his private parts.</p>
               <p>In what manner? - I cannot tell how it was done, I was not so near him as the other witnesses.</p>
               <p>Did you see the deceased at the public-house afterwards? - Yes; he recovered after he came over.</p>
               <p>How long after? - I cannot say how long it was, it was the same day within about three quarters of an hour; there was me and the prisoner, and the deceased, and another man, we were drinking; the prisoner and I was playing for a pot of beer, and I won the pot of beer of him fairly, and the prisoner wanted to cheat me out of it, and it came to a quarrel, the prisoner struck me, and I struck him, and we went out to fight a battle, and a gentleman gave us some silver; after our battle was done, says he to the deceased, I will knock your head off with one hand, and the deceased said you have no occasion to take one hand for I will fight you with both.</p>
               <p>Did they fight? - Had it not been for the landlady of the public-house, and me taking him apart, they would have fought.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner sober at this time? - No, Sir, he was not, far from it.</p>
               <p>Was he sober at the time when he struck the prisoner? - No, Sir, far from it.</p>
               <p>He was considerably in liquor? - Yes; very much so; the deceased and me went out the next day for a load of dust.</p>
               <p>Court to Wilks. Did the prisoner appear drunk or sober when this happened? I do not know how he was, for I cannot tell many times when they are drunk, or when they are sober.</p>
               <p>Blake, senior. He was neither drunk nor sober, he was rather forward in liquor, not very drunk, but muddle headed.</p>

               <p>You are widow of this unfortunate man that was killed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What time did he come home in the evening after the accident? - About nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>What situation was he in that evening? - He said, when he came into the room, he was not well, and he sat down on the bed, he did not say any thing to me that night, only he was not well; he got up and went out the next morning, along with me, I work in the same yard.</p>
               <p>How long was you at work? - About three hours; he complained very much in the morning, and was very ill; I persuaded him not to go out.</p>
               <p>Did he say to you at any time how he got the hurt; what hurt did he complain of most? - When he came with the horse and cart into the yard, he supported himself up by the head of the horse, he appeared to be a dead man; the first complaint he made, was, that this man kicked him in his private parts.</p>
               <p>After that, when he grew worse, what did he complain of? - A violent pain in his head, he did not mention any part.</p>
               <p>Did he mention to you how he himself<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190135"></xptr> thought he had got the hurt in his head? - Not till the Sunday following; he desired me to look at the top of his head, which he said was much hurt; I cut the hair off the top of his head, and asked the other witness to shave him, and when the man shaved him, he asked him whether it was not the ill usage he received from the prisoner, and he said yes.</p>
               <p>Did he at any time describe to you in what particular manner he got the bruises at the back of his head? - Upon his death bed he told me that it was by his dragging him across the road, and dashing his head down against the edge of the stones; that was what he said about five hours before he died.</p>
               <p>When did he die? - On Sunday was three weeks.</p>
               <p>That was the Sunday se'night after the accident happened? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. HODGES sworn.</p>
               <p>I think I was sent for the 27th, to the Marybone infirmary, I think it was on the Tuesday, but I cannot particularly say.</p>
               <p>In what condition did you find this man? - I found one side of his head particularly very much bruised, his face, and head, and eyes were very much swelled; he had a great deal of fever about him at that time.</p>
               <p>Did you find any other particular bruise that attracted your attention? - Not particularly.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect, particularly, a large wound on the back of the head, near the top? - This was on the side towards the back, that was the principal bruise.</p>
               <p>Had he any delirium? - The nurse told me he appeared at times to be what she called wandering; when I first saw him he answered my questions perfectly sensible; the young gentlemen of the hospital had seen him before, I bled him, and attended him from Tuesday till the Sunday morning; I heard on Monday morning that he died on that night.</p>
               <p>How soon did you apprehend any thing like mortal symptoms coming on? - Why, Sir, from the first time I saw him I apprehended particular danger; in the first place the quickness of his pulse, and the next day I found him with a great degree of delirium, and an increase of fever.</p>
               <p>Did you apprehend a fracture? - I did apprehend that there was a fracture, and I made an opening down to the bone, and found no fracture.</p>
               <p>Was there any suppuration? - Yes; there was a large quantity of matter between the scull and the scalp.</p>
               <p>Was it on the fleshy scalp, or on the membrane that surrounds it? - It was exterior to the pericranium.</p>
               <p>Was the pericranium very much inflamed? - Considerably so.</p>
               <p>Did it terminate in a mortification? - Not absolutely so, but tending as much as could be.</p>
               <p>What did you in your judgement apprehend to be the immediate cause of his death? - I should suppose from the injury he had received from his head whatever it was; from the violence of the blow or bruise whatever they were.</p>
               <p>That was probably the primary cause, but what I mean is this; did you find any thing on the brain? - Yes, I did; I found the membrane that covers the brain very much inflamed.</p>
               <p>Any matter formed within? - No; but the vessels were filled very much with blood.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask the surgeon whether the man had not the venereal disease very bad? - I never heard of any complaint of that; the injury on his head was the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I and another man were drinking at the Coach and Horses, and we saw Anderson stand across the way, just by the water trough of the red-lion, says he, go and fetch him over to have some beer; I went and laid hold of his arm, says I, Billy come and have some beer, says he, I have no money, says I, never mind that, if I ask you to drink I do not ask you to pay, and I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190136"></xptr> took hold of him, and drew him along; then he hit me a knock on the head, then I hit him another, then he up with his foot, and gave me a kick over the shin.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Consider in making your defence that there were a number of people present, and unless you can call witnesses to prove your defence, you will not do your case any good.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. So far as hurt the man I did not mean to hurt him any more than my own brother; I was in liquor, I had been drinking all day.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any witnesses here that saw the affair? - Only the gentlewoman of the house.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I keep the Coach and Horses at Paddington; I did not see this affair happen out of doors, I only saw it after they came in; there was a fight, a quarrel arose, that was the first that I saw between a stranger and the prisoner; they fought; after they came in, the deceased and the prisoner would have fought; I would not let them.</p>
               <p>Was the deceased as willing to fight as the prisoner? - He was; I laid hold of his jacket to keep him from the other; he went away some time, and came again and drank out of the same pot, and he sat down and drank for some time; he called me out of the bar, and gave me a shilling; I took the pot of beer out of it, and I had a remarkable small six-pence, and he said that would do very well, and he said Nancy had been out all day a drinking, and had been drinking part of the week; the prisoner had been at our house about an hour; he was very much in liquor; the deceased had not been at our house for some time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The second day I went to see how the man was? he did not want any thing; I asked him to drink a glass of wine or any thing; a woman that lived in the house came up, and said his wife had been out all day, and had brought him bite or sup.</p>
               <p>Is that woman here? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Godly. How long have you known the prisoner? - Four months; he is as quiet as any that comes to the house; I never saw any other; I never heard that he was malicious.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. A day or two after I said to Boulton, if the poor fellow is so bad, I will put in a shilling on Saturday-night, and you put in what you like, and we will make a gathering for him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three other witnesses, who said he was a quiet peaceable man, not malicious nor revengeful.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, it seems to be necessary for me shortly to state to you the general outlines of the law on this subject: the killing of a man is always criminal, unless it is altogether involuntary or is in self-defence against a person who is doing an unlawful act: it is criminal in a vast variety of different degrees; the killing of another which amounts to felony, may be either felony or man-slaughter; a killing which is the result of deliberate malice, or what the law calls malice prepense, is in all cases murder; a killing short of that not justifiable, which is either done on a sudden provocation, or where there has been no provocation; where it is done in a manner that does not argue malice, is an offence of a lesser degree, under the denomination of manslaughter; however, by malice prepense the law does not necessarily imply a direct and deliberate intention to kill, for whereever that exists the case is put out of all doubt, and there is no difficulty in the consideration of it; but there are degrees of malice far short of that, which if death ensues, amount in the eye of the law to murder, as where a man kills another in the prosecution of an unlawful and felonious act; there, though he did not actually intend to kill the person he has killed, yet the felonious intention with which the act was accompanied supplies that malice which the law requires, and every killing with a felonious intention is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190137"></xptr> in the eye of the law murder; again, where a man either without provocation, or on a very slight provocation makes use of a weapon or an instrument which is likely to occasion the death of the person to whom it is used, to effect a purpose which was short of death; if it is done without provocation, or on a slight procation, and death ensues, it is murder: there is another violence that is murder, which is, where a person in consequence of a previous resentment which has a degree of malice in it, attacks another with the intention of doing him some personal injury short of death; that being in the prosecution of a deliberate intention to do him a personal injury, if death ensues, the party is answerable for it, and guilty of murder in strictness of law; because he was prosecuting unlawfully and maliciously a deliberate intention to do the person some mischief; and where a man on a slight provocation, or on the sudden without provocation, gets into a quarrel with another, and prosecutes it with such a degree of cruelty and violence as is likely to produce fatal consequences, in that case, though the first beginning of it is not so criminal, if it is prosecuted with that degree of cruelty and violence, and death ensues, it has been justly accounted murder; the case that you are now to try will come within one or other of the two last descriptions that I have stated to you; (Here the learned Judge summed up the evidence, and added) it is perfectly clear from the evidence, that this prisoner did not intend to kill the deceased; and the questions for your consideration are first, whether you think that at the time he came over to the deceased, he came over with a preconceived and deliberate purpose of doing him a bodily mischief short of death; for if you are of opinion that he came deliberately and coolly over to beat this man without sufficient cause, death ensuing that will make it, in my opinion, murder; or if you are of opinion that he did not come over with such intention, but are of opinion, that he dashed his head against the steps with intention of doing him a further mischief, I am of opinion, (if it arose from cool and deliberate malice on the part of the prisoner, though void of intention of prosecuting that malice to death) it will be murder; if you think there was no cool and deliberate malice of any kind from the prisoner to the deceased, but what happened was on the sudden, taken up in the moment, without using a deadly weapon, and without intention of of killing, then it is not murder.</p>
               <p>The Jury retired for some time, and returned with a verdict</p>

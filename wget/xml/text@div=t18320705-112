            . I live in Addle-street, and am a porter; my son Thomas was nearly six months old. On the 24th of May, at nine o'clock in the morning, I left him in his mother's care, in good health; I saw him at a quarter to eleven that morning, very much injured; he died the following night - my wife took the child every day to Vincent-court, where her mother lives; children used to play about there very much - it is a small court, and people used to dry their linen there; there is a wall nearly eight feet high opposite my mother-in-law's window; the prisoner lived on the second floor of the same house.</p>

My daughter brought the child to me about half-past nine o'clock in the morning; she had been hanging out linen, and I had the child in my arms about ten o'clock in the morning; I was just at the line the clothes hung on, which is about six yards from the house - I was walking across the court, from my door to the line; I heard no alarm from above, but a box came out of the second floor window, and knocked the child out of my arms to some distance - I went, and took it up; it appeared to be dead; I ran into the passage with it, and sat down on a step of the stairs; the prisoner came running down the stairs in less than a minute - I told her she had killed the child; she said nothing that I recollect, except, "Oh, dear! oh, dear!" or something, I do not recollect what, I was so agitated - I ran off to the doctor's with it; I do not recollect whether she made any other answer, for I did not stay a moment with her, but took the child to Mr. Davis', in Wood-street - I took it from there to Mr. Powell's; I never saw the prisoner again till about one o'clock - I then told her she had killed the child, but cannot tell whether she said any thing - she had lived in the court since January; she must have seen linen hanging there to dry, and children playing about - the child was struck on the back of the head; it was an empty box.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. She could not have had any quarrel with so young a child? A. No; I do not know whether she is near her confinement - she has told me she was in the family way; I do not know whether, when I told her she had killed the child, she said, "Oh, dear," or not - she said something; she pretended to be sorry, but whether she was I cannot say.</p>

            . I am twelve years old, and live in Vincent-court, and used to play with children in the court frequently; I went out to fasten the shutters, and saw Mrs. Fowler with the child in her arms - I saw nobody at the prisoner's window, but saw the box come out of it, it hit the baby on its head and knocked it out of Mrs. Fowler's arms - I did not hear any alarm given from the window - the prisoner came down a few minutes after Mrs. Fowler had gone to the doctor's; I had not seen her speak to Mrs. Fowler - I live next door; my mother came out, and sent me in - I was five or six yards from the box, when it fell; when the prisoner came down she was going up into Mrs. Morgan's room - she laid her hand on my shoulder and said, "Oh, my God, I have thrown the box on the child's head;" Fowler was then gone to the doctor's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not she seem to be sorry for it? A. Yes; Mrs. Fowler had gone away to the doctor's before the prisoner came down, I am quite sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you can tell whether, when the box fell on the child, there was any woman in the court, that could see any thing? A. No, there was not, I am sure, nor was there any standing at the doors.</p>

When the Prisoner was brought before me at the Watch-House, she had a Knife in her Hand, and said, the Prosecutor would have given her 6 d. to make Use of it in a very extraordinary Manner in the Alley. As I was carrying her to Newgate, she said, the Prosecutor was a perjur'd little Villain, and she did not steal his Watch, but the other Woman who ran away.</p>

I live at 35, Charles Street, Oakley Street, 'with my husband—about 2 o'clock on the morning of 11th July, I was passing through Victoria Street, it was raining very heavily—there was a coffee stall there, and several people standing there out of the rain—I went to have a cup, and as I was passing a lamp-post I took 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of my pocket and held it in my hand—the prisoner came up behind me and said "Let me have it"—he turned me right round and whilst he held me with his hand; he beat me in the face with the other like a hammer very cruelly; he cut me in the eye and blinded me with the blood and knocked a false tooth into my mouth—I clenched my hand tightly, but he succeeded in getting the shilling and then ran away down a little turning—I afterwards saw a policeman and gave a description to him and also at the station, and on my way back from the station I saw the prisoner in Peter Street, with a young woman without any bonnet or shawl on, just in the same direction as he had run—I pointed him out to a policeman and he was taken—I have not the least doubt of his being the man—I had never seen him before.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a beer-shop at West Ham. On 22nd Jan. I saw the two prisoners at my house, about half-past six o'clock in the evening—they asked for a pint of ale, which I supplied them with—they paid for it with a shilling—I gave the change to Cartwright, and put the shilling into my pocket—I had no other shilling there—after they were gone, my wife said something to me—I took the shilling out of my pocket, and found it was bad—I gave information to the police—I marked the shilling at the station, and gave it to the policeman—I cannot say which of them gave me the shilling—while I drew the ale it was laid on the counter—they came in together, and went out together.</p>

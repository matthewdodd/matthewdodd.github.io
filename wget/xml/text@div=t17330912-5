               <p>Court. Did you leave your Drawers lock'd?</p>
               <p>Mr. Dyer. Yes; that very Morning I took 10 s. out of one of the Drawers, and lock'd it, and saw all the rest were fast, but at my Return I found them all broke open. In one Drawer there was between 70 and 80 l. taken out, 500 Guineas from another, and the third was a little Drawer, in which my Wife had laid up several remarkable Pieces for my Children, Crowns, Half-crowns, Silver Groat, Three-pences, Two-Pences and Pennies, and these were all taken away. The Prisoner was taken in about five Hours after, with all the Money upon him, except 15 l. 4 s. which he had laid out in buying a great Coat, Whip, Boots, Sputs, a Trunk to put the Money on, and several other odd Things. I went in Pursu't of him towards Harwich, but he was taken in Kent by others who followed him in Dover Road. I did not see him till the Saturday following, and then he confess'd to me that he had broke open my Drawers, and taken my Money.</p>

            . Two Hours after the Robbery Mr. Brown and Mr. Sheppard sent for me, and told me the Prisoner had robbed his Master of 5 or 600 l. and desired me to go in Pursuit of him. It happen'd that I took Post horse at the same Inn as the Prisoner did; and at the second Stage, which was Dartford in Kent, I heard that such a Person as the Prisoner was but just gone out of the Inn, and could hardly he got 40 Yards off. I follow'd, and in about two Miles he was stopp'd by another Person who had got the Start of me, and brought him back, and we return'd to the Inn at Dartford. John, says I, how do ye do? - How do you do? says he again. God, says I, John, I am glad to see you; where is the Money? 'Tis in that Trank, says he I ask'd him how much there was? He said he had not told it yet, but had intended to tell it as soon as he came to Rochester. Upon searching I found there was 546 l. 3 s. 6 d. in the Trunk, besides other Money that he had about him. Then he gave me a Seal with which I scal'd up the Trunk He confess'd very readily, and was willing to come home with me, but we sat up there all Night. I ask'd him how he could serve his Master so, and what he had propos'd to do with the Money? He said, his Master was a good Master, and that he intended to make his Master Returns in Goods for the Money, designing to go directly to France, and so to Legborn, and from thence to send over Bermudas Hats to his Master. It seems there was some Money in his Clothes that were in the Trunk, which I did not see. He was afterwards sent to Maidstone Goal, from whence he was removed hither by a Habe Corpus.</p>

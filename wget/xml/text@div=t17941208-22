               <p>Q. Did the sash communicate with the street? - It opened into a court where there is no thoroughfare, the court belongs to us.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain, with respect to the time, what hour it was? - It was as near nine o'clock as possibly it could be when I left the room, as near as I can guess it was a quarter after when I returned.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all the things that you charge to be taken away in the room when you quitted it? - All of them.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came back again what did you observe? - I observed the sash pushed up, and the basket I left in the room, laying at a distance, and the things laying in a disorderly manner about the room, and foot marks in the room, and a great quantity of linen taken out of the basket, what is laid in the indictment.</p>

Seven sheets, three napkins, two missing but only one laid in the indictment, two common check pocket handkerchiefs, two muslin caps, a toilenet waistcoat, two pair of dimity pockets, a check apron, a muslin handkerchiefs, a muslin shawl, and a dimity petticoat. They were all taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do in consequence of this discovery? - The next morning I took one of our lodgers with me, and went to a number of different pawnbrokers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you discover any thing? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q.

My muslin shawl that is named in the indictment, was found in one of these women's beds, amongst their bed clothes.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any thing found on their persons? - Nothing at all, the last witness Rochford, informed me that she lodged at Mrs. Quinlan's, in Dyot-street, St. Giles's; and she informed me that some part of the things were left there in her room in St. Giles's, the prisoner informed me at the same time, that she had left a check apron with this Mrs. Quinlan, for her night's lodging; I went there and enquired of Mrs. Quinlan if she knew any thing of them? she told me she did not; I then went and searched the room where the prisoner lodged, and found nothing there, not the first time; I went the second time, and took

             with me, and under one of the beds in the room, I found this muslin shawl; there were three or four beds in the room; I afterwards found these few odd things at a chandler's shop (shews the things) in the neighbourhood; this apron at one chandler's shop, and these other things at another.</p>
               <p>Q. To Mrs. Horde. (The things shewn her.) Look at that shawl, was that one of the things you lost? - I know it from a pin hole on one side, and I have got the other half; the pockets are mine, they are patch work of my own doing.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went out of the parlour where you had been ironing to attend the company in the tap room, had you thrown up the window for air, or any thing else? - No, I had not, it was a dampish evening.</p>

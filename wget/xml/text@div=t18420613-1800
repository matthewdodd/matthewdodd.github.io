I said, "Indeed I do not"—he said, "You had better go to Mr. Lorimer, then"—I said, "I have nothing at all to do with Mr. Lorimer; I want to know whom you come from"—he said, "I think it would be better for you to go to Mr. Lorimer"—he did not say who Mr. Lorimer was, but I had re<lb></lb>ceived a letter from him—I said, "No, I shall not do any such thing"—he said, "It is rent for Mr. Harper"—I said, "Harper, I have nothing at all to do with Mr. Harper, I have had no dealings with him, I have not seen him for some time"—in the course of that day, I showed Allen and Baker my receipts for rent, in my rent-book, which was the way in which Mr. Ferns acknowledged receiving the rent—I told the prisoners so, and showed them the book—this is the book—I turned the prisoners out that day—I went to a solicitor in Hatton-garden, and stated the case to him—Baker</p>

               <p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife; I do not live at No. 3 Eagle-street; I was there on the 11th of April last. At half-past nine o'clock that evening a person outside asked for Eliza—I answered from the passage, without opening the door, that no such person lived there—the door was shut—the door was then burst open, and a set of men broke in—the two prisoners, West, and others, were among them—I asked to be allowed to fetch my husband—West said, in the prisoners' presence, if I would go out I should not come in again—Allen, Baker, and west were giving directions—they ran up stairs into the back-parlour—I expostulated with them, and told them we did not owe any rent, and that the man who called himself my landlord was no more my landlord than they were—they called for rent due to Harper—they had said so on the 5th, when they came—I saw Allen writing an inventory in the first floor back room—there were two cheval glasses on the premises that night—these now produced are them.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep auction-rooms in Southamptonrow, Russell-square. On the 11th of April a quantity of goods were brought to me by Baker, Allen, and others—I do not think West came when the goods came—they came after nine o'clock at night, and continued coming throughout the night until the morning—I think there were three van-loads, but not closely loaded—several cheval-glasses were among them, like those produced—they were brought there for the purpose of my selling them by auction—it was represented as a distress—between one and two o'clock next day the two prisoners came to my ware house, at least, Baker did; I am not quite clear of Allen; I think he was with him—they took away two cheval glasses like these, as I would not advance them any more money to pay their expenses, having received a notice from the other party not to do so—I am in the habit of advancing money on things intended for immediate sale, and we deduct the money when they are sold—they said they supposed I bad no objection to them taking the glasses away, as they had not enough to pay the men that brought the goods—ten or a dozen men were employed, or perhaps more—I never had goods brought to my auction-room all night long in this way before—they had applied to me in business hours—I held the property for Baker—he is a broker, I believe, at Somers'-town, I believe, but I do not know his address—I never saw his place—it was my first transaction with him—he represented that he had levied these goods—I advanced 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the goods, to pay the men—they would not work without their money—I had never done that before—I did not receive any papers from any of the parties when they brought the goods—I did receive a paper which I handed up at Clerkenwell—it was an indemnity, I tink, from Mr. Harper—I did not see Mr. Harper until afterwards—took nothing away but the two cheval glasses.</p>

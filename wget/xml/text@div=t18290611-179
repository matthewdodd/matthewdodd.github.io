On the 4th of May I sent one of my servants to the Hero public-house, at Maida-hill, to inquire for a person to carry a basket to a coach-office; the prisoner came to my gate, and I delivered him a basket, containing the articles stated, with a direction to take it to <placeName id="t18290611-179-crimeloc949">Charing-cross</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOWLING. Q. How do you know the prisoner had not sent it? A. Because I went by the same coach; this is the basket that I sent with him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. At what time did you arrive at Charing-cross? A. I believe about half-past nine o'clock, and I waited there till near ten - I detained the coachman, expecting every moment the basket would arrive: I ran to every coach-office about there to look for him.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, of Chapel-street, Edgware-road. On that Monday a witness and another young man came to my house; they had not got the basket- they brought some silk dresses, cotton dresses, shoes, and other things, and wanted 12s. for them; they said they belonged to a man named Wilson, who was outside the door- I went out and asked him whose it was; he at first said it was his own, and then that it belonged to Mr. Evans, No.11, Prospect-place: I said I should not advance any money until I had made inquiries - they said they would call again, and went away.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>GEORGE OBEY. I am learning to be a bricklayer. I was in Lisson-street; the prisoner called me and another young lad, and asked us to take these things to pawn for 12s. - he said they were his own, and that his name was Wilson.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you ever see him before?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110079"></xptr>A. No; I suspected it was not right, and told Mr. Trail of it - he was a little intoxicated; I believe he has a wife and child.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met that witness and two others tossing in the street; I was a little intoxicated, and set down the basket; he came and said, "What are you going to do with this, old chap - are you going to pawn it, or shall I;" I don't know what I said, but he took the property, which was not in the basket, and endeavoured to get 12s. on it - I do not know what happened between Mr. Trail and me; I returned to the witness - there was some conversation about selling it to a Jew; I was decoyed out of my road into a field - I sat myself down, and during the time the officer came and took me; I accidentally went to get a glass of gin, and the servant came into the public-house, to ask for a person to take the parcel - I met with those three idle chaps, and they decoyed me away.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM TRAIL re-examined. Q. Is your shop in the direct road to Charing-cross? A. No, it is down a street; he should have gone straight on.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

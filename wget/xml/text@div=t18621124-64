                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Examiner's-office at the Custom-house—on 1st November, between 7 and half-past, in the evening, I was in Fenchurch-street—a woman came up and made an observation, and I told her to be off—I did not notice whether she followed me, but a few yards further on I took out my purse where there was a light, as I wished to see for a coin I wanted—on attempting to return it to my pocket the same woman snatched it out of my hand, and ran down Church-row—I ran after her, calling "Stop thief"—having proceeded thirty or forty yards, I heard a whistle, and a man came in front of me from some small archway or door<lb></lb>way—that man was Hall—he pushed me in the chest, and said, "What is your game? where are you going?"—I said, "Stand aside; a woman has stolen a purse, and I am after her"—he said, "Oh, nonsense!" and stopped me effectually—I intended to go back again, but on turning round, I found two other men, who must have come down the court from Fenchurch-street, as there is no passage there which they could have come out of, and I did not observe any other passengers—one of those men was Leat and the third man escaped—one got me by my collar, and another by my left arm—I sprang away, and said, "I see what it is"—I swung my stick round, and it came in contact with the head of the man who has escaped—he then made off, and then I struck Hall on the back of the neck two or three times—I tried to strike Leat, but cannot say whether I did or not, but I kept hold of him—he is the man who took hold of me by the collar, and pressed me—this is the stick (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is a powerful one, and is loaded with lead—I kept following Leat, sometimes holding him, sometimes losing him, but never losing sight of him till I got to St. Mary Axe—he was never more than two or three yards from me—I was still struggling with him there when a constable came up with Hall in custody—I identified him, saying, "That is an accomplice"—I recognised him instantly—he made some remark to the constable, but I was perfectly exhausted, and did not hear it—the constable took Leat.</p>

I am a clerk in an insurance office—I was passing through St. Mary Axe, about half-past 7 o'clock, and saw a few persons congregated together—I walked towards them, and saw the constable Turner come up to the prosecutor with a man in custody—the prosecutor was then struggling with Leat, and was perfectly exhausted—I said, in the prisoner's hearing, "Hallo, Turner, what is the matter here?"—he said, "Please to assist me"—I said, "I will"—I had a parcel in my hand—Leat appealed to me, saying, "You hear what the prosecutor says; he says I am one of them"—I followed to the station, watching that they did not take anything from their pockets—the struggle I saw was when Leat was struggling to get away from the prosecutor—Leat had a loose-sleeve cape on, which the prosecutor had hold of.</p>

On Friday evening, 21st November, I was on duty in Great St. Helen's, and heard cries of "Stop thief!"—Hall came running down a dark passage, in Great St. Helen's, toward me—I caught him in my arms—he said, "What do you stop me fort?"—I said, "You must come back with me; we will see"—I took him into St. Mary Axe, and saw a crowd of persons surrounding the prosecutor, who was holding Leat—he said, "That is the man who held me by the back of the neck, while the woman robbed me"—Leat said to Mr. Fennell, "You hear what the prosecutor says; that I am one"—I immediately called on the bystanders, and Mr. Fennell followed to see that they did not drop anything—they both gave me their addresses, and I made inquiries about them.</p>

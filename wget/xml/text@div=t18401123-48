I have suspected him some time, and on the 28th of October I was in search of some pork, and found one piece secreted in the middle of a truss of hay in a loft over the stable—that part of the premises can only be entered through the house—I marked it in presence of my foreman, and replaced it—the prisoner asked to go home that day, and when he went out the policeman apprehended him in my presence—I saw the piece of pork taken from inside the waist<lb></lb>band of his trowsers—as he was going to the station-house be turned to me, and said, "Master, I hope you won't be hard with me."</p>

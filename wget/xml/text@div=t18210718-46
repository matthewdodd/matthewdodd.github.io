On the 22d of June, the prisoner came, and looked at the books outside the window. I saw him take a book down, and put it up again. He then came on the top of the steps, and looked inside, then went back, and took the same book down. I do not think he saw me. He at first put it on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182107180023"></xptr>the top of some more books, then took it up and put it under his arm, came into the shop with it, and asked if my master was at home. I said No. He asked if he would be at home in half an hour. I said perhaps he might, and he then walked away, with the book under his arm. I went to the stairs, and called my young master, he turned down Holborn four or five doors. I called Stop thief! he turned round. My young master had got close to him - he came back to the shop, and was asked about the book. He put it down on the bottom of the window, with a bundle of his own on the top of it, and was going away, I caught hold of his arm he then wanted to go in doors, as he was going up the steps, he wrenched from me, and ran across the road. I pursued but lost him.</p>
               <p>HENRY COXHEAD. Vale called me down. I went out, he had just turned round, and was standing where I got up to him. He asked if I had got the fellow volume, with the History of England, he kept walking backwards to the shop, and threw his bundle on the books, and a book under it, opened his bundle, and produced two or three other books, and was tying them up. I charged him with stealing a book, and he wanted to go into the shop; when he got on the steps he ran off - I followed, and caught him in a cutler's shop in Theobald's-road.</p>

When the Men met me, one of them ask'd me, what was a Clock? I said, I could not tell. You lye, damn you, says he. Don't damn me, says I. God damn it, says Headly, the Dog mutters, let's thump him. With that I took to my Heels, and they after me, and when I came near the Bason, Headly struck me with a Stick and fell'd me; then Chapman clapt one Hand to my Mouth; and the other to my Coat Pocket, while Headly took my Tye Wig, my Hat and my Cane, and the other Man rumaged my other Pockets. I lost a Shilling out of one of my Breeches Pockets, and 3 d. out of the other; but being on the Ground I could not see which of them took the Money. After that, they threw me into the Bason, and said, Now lye there and he damned, and so they made off; but a poor Man a Carpenter coming by, Aha! says he, what are you going to drown your self? and so he help'd me out; but for Blood and Dirt never was poor Creature so abused. I ask'd the Carpenter where he liv'd,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173210110019"></xptr> that I might send for him upon Occasion to be an Evidence. He told me in Wardour-street, or Water-lane, I forget which, but I could not find him again.</p>
               <p>Court. Could you see the Prisoners plain enough to know 'em again?</p>
               <p>Young. Yes; it was as light as it is now.</p>
               <p>Court. What betwixt 9 and 10 at Night?</p>
               <p>Young. It was light enough to diseern any Man living, and I am very certain to both the Prisoners.</p>

               <p>Young. No; it was a very windy Evening.</p>
               <p>A Juryman. Whither did you go after you got out of the Bason?</p>
               <p>Young. I went with the Carpenter to Scavenger [Cavendish] Squar, and there I left him, and went directly to Mr. Pain's the Distiller in Highstreet, St. Giles's, but he was gone out, and I saw only his Boy at home.</p>
               <p>Court. Is the Boy here?</p>
               <p>Young. No; I was in such a dirty Condition when I went in there, that I look'd more like a Blackguard than a Gentleman; and there are so many Blackguards go to that Shop, that when I went there afterwards the Boy did not remember me from the rest of his Master's Customers. No poor Creature was ever in such a Pickle. In short, I was asham'd to go along the Streets, but however, I made Shift to get home at last.</p>

I went with him, and he took one, and I took the other, near the New-Exchange.</p>
               <p>Court. Why did you not take them up before?</p>
               <p>G. Young. Because I did not love Trouble, and had not done it now, but that I met them accidentally, for I never hunted after them; tho' several of my Friends offer'd to go with me to Newgate, to enquire if no Body there knew such Persons, who committed such a Robbery; and they said, they did not doubt, but I might hear of them. However I never went; but it happen'd last Sunday Night, as I was going home from the King's-Head Tavern, the Corner of - I saw one of the Prisoners leaning against a Post, in the Strand, opposite to the New-Exchange, and the other standing by him, knocking his Link against the Heel of his Shoe. As I past by, I heard one of them Mutter to the other, Damn you, there's the Man we took the Hat and Wig from in Marybon-fields !</p>
               <p>Court. 'Tis very strange he should say so in your hearing.</p>
               <p>G. Young. So I seem'd to take no notice, but went on and call'd a Watchman directly; he was then, I think, crying past a 11, and going up a Court about a 100 Yards from where I met the Prisoners; I told him they were both standing together; but when we came back, one was on one side of the Way, and the other on t'other; Mr. Mand's House is opposite to the New-Exchange.</p>

            . I have known Headly 7 or 8 Years; he was 3 Years in the Stables. When we attended Princess Amelia to the Bath, he went with us, and was trusted in the Scullery. Then he went with us to Tunbridge, and after the Journeys were over he was discharged; he always behaved himself well, and I take him to be as honest a Lad as any upon Earth. He has been gone from us about 4 Years; he has lived in another Place since he left us, but for this 2 or 3 Years, he has been out of Service, and got his living by running of Errands, and cleaning of Shoes.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you drunk or sober? - A. Perfectly sober; I staid all night in her lodgings; I awaked in the morning about half past four, and found her absent, and all my money gone, it was in my breeches pocket, there were three guineas in gold, as to the silver I am not certain; to the best of my knowledge, there were fifteen shillings; I put my handkerchief<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179611300024"></xptr>in the crown of my hat in a chair by the bedside; I went to Bow-street, and informed

             I had been robbed, and described the person of the prisoner; and they brought her to the Black-boy in Long-acre, in an hour's time, and asked me if that was the person; I knew her directly.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was she brought to you? - A. Between eight and nine o'clock, I believe; I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no doubt she is the woman? - A. No; Mumford took money from her, but I could not swear to it; she was quite in liquor, and said little or nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had no money of him, but the half crown he gave me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I gave her half a crown, and eight or nine pennyworth of halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure you had the money in your pocket over night? - A. Yes; I saw it when I gave her something to drink.</p>
               <p>- TREADWAY sworn. - I apprehended the prisoner on the information of Mumford, and brought her to Long-acre; he charged her with robbing him of three guineas, some silver and a silk handkerchief; she said he left the handkerchief behind him; on searching her, I found a guinea, a half crown and two shillings, five pennyworth of halfpence, two farthings and a silk handkerchief in her pocket; he could not swear to the money, and the Magistrate ordered it to be returned to the prisoner. (The handkerchief produced).</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my handkerchief, I know it by the mark, it is marked with the letters L.V.I am sure it was gone in the morning, I could not find my cloaths, they were thrown about; I called the watchman up, and found all but my handkerchief; I am sure I left it in my that over night.</p>

             sworn. - I went with Treadway after this woman, and found her at the house where he said he was robbed; we searched her and found a guinea, half a crown, two shillings and sixpence, and some halfpence, we took a handkerchief out of her pocket; we met him as we were coming from the house with her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am certain the prosecutor gave me a half crown piece, he said he had no more money, I must treat him out of the half crown; I said, it was too hard to treat out of it; however, I consented, and we went to bed together; when I got up in the morning, I went to light my fire, the silk handkerchief was left on the pillow; I had no more money than the half crown.</p>

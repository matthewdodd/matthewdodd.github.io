            . I was a patient in the Westminster Hospital; the deceased was brought in there on the 22d of July, about eleven o'clock - I slept in the next bed to him; he died on Friday morning, the 27th, about a quarter past ten o'clock - about an hour and a quarter before he died, he called me to his bed-side, and said, "Martin, I am dying;" I asked why he thought so; he said he was sure of it, from the difference of the appearance in his flesh, that it was mortifying - I then asked if he knew who the party was that gave him the ill-usage; he made no answer then, and I asked him who the man and woman were who came to see him on the 24th, because I would send to let them know he was dying; he said he wished I would, that he lived at a china-shop, next door to a green-grocer's shop, in Strutton-ground, Westminster, and his name was Ward - I asked if he would tell me what was the reason of Ward's giving him the ill usage; he had said he was violently kicked and beat about in his back and left side by Ward; that he was first knocked down and violently kicked; I asked the cause of it; he said he had taken two baskets from Ward's premises that morning, but he did not know they belonged to Ward, or he should not have taken them: but he thought they belonged to the green-grocer next door; he said Ward came to his premises to know what he had stolen them for, that Ward was in a great passion, but he begged his pardon: that Ward went away, but came a second time, and ill-used him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You asked if you should inform the person who came to see him on the 24th? A. Yes; that was Ward; he did not bring him tea and sugar - some was sent on Monday - I do not know who by; a tea-pot, bason and spoon also came - I cannot say they were from Ward; he did not tell me; he had denied taking the basket, the first time Ward went to him; I never saw Ward at the hospital but once; he stopped about five minutes; he seemed very civil and quiet - I thought he was a friend of his; a young woman came with him - I do not know her name.</p>

            . One Sunday morning he had stolen two baskets, called shallows, from Ward - he came and offered them for sale to a person in Duck-yard - I was standing at the door of the Green Man public-house; he came and said, "Here are two shallows:" the man who was going to buy them, said to me, "I think they are stolen;" I said I knew nothing of them; they were taken to Ward's house; he was in bed; he got up, and went over to Mr. Hall's, and had something to drink with the man and me; he came down to Duck-lane, between seven and eight o'clock that morning, where the decased lodged; he knocked at the door, and asked if Mosland was at home, and was told No; he went a second time, and the deceased was at home; they both went to the door together - Ward asked if he was not a pretty sort of a man o take<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130027"></xptr>his shallows - Mosland said he was very sorry, but he did not know they belonged to him, and begged his pardon - Ward said, if they had been any body elses, he had no business to take them - Ward then struck him two or three times in the face, and then several blows on his side with his fist; he had no stick; the deceased fell, and said that was his death-blow; he bled at the mouth - Walker said,"Shall I take you to the infirmary?" - he said Yes, as he was very bad; they took him there - I went to see him a day or two afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you hear him say at the infirmary that he freely forgave Ward? A. He said he freely forgave him for what he had done, for he was in the wrong all along - he said Ward had been to see him; there were no kicks - he was led to the hospital.</p>

            . I am house-surgeon at the Westminster Hospital. Mosland was brought there on Sunday, the 22d of July; I saw him directly he came - he was in a dangerous state; I found very severe blows had been inflicted on his side, and inflammation was coming on; he died on the Friday - I opened him on the Saturday, and found a great deal of bloody fluid in the cavity of the abdomen, and a rupture of the spleen on the left side, just above the kidney. In my judgment it was occasioned by a violent blow - it doubtless caused his death - a violent blow on the side with the fist might have done it; the treatment described by Barnett was sufficient, in my judgment, to account for the appearances which caused his death.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that his brother's children's clothes had been stolen by some boys, whom the deceased was in the habit of fostering, and on losing his baskets he went there, hoping to hear of the clothes, when an altercation ensued, and the deceased said he knew where they were, but would not tell him, and, irritated by this, he struck him, but had he supposed him to be hurt, he would have procured him assistance - but when he left him he was standing up, and did not appear hurt; and that he had sent him what was in his power, to make him comfortable at the hospital, and on visiting him, the deceased said he could not blame him.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner five or six years; he sent me to take the deceased some tea, sugar, butter, a roll, and biscuits, but they would not admit the roll and biscuits at the gate; he said he was much better; and told me to tell the prisoner he should like to see him, for he freely forgave him - and he should have done the same himself. I accompanied the prisoner next day to see him - he appeared anxious about him, and went there again after he died.</p>

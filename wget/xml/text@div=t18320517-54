On the night of the 30th of April I left my shop to fetch some beer; I saw the prisoner and another in Bryanstone-square - I had known him from infancy; he asked how I did - I was in the public-house about two minutes; on my return, my wife told me the shoes were lost - the prisoner was described to me; I went to his mother's - she came with him to my shop; my wife gave him into custody.</p>

               <p>SOPHIA CHAMBERLAIN. I am the prosecutor's wife. On the 30th of April my husband went out, and I heard some voices near the shop; I saw the prisoner put his hand into the shop door, and take three shoes from the window - he put them under his coat, and went down the street as fast as he could; I could not follow him, as I had a child in my arms - I am sure he took them; it was one pair and an odd shoe.</p>

             (Police-constable, D. 131.) I was on duty in Cumberland-street. I took the prisoner - he said he knew nothing about the shoes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, denying that he had taken the shoes, and stating that hearing he was accused, he went to the shop to clear himself.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CHAMBERLAIN. He said so at the time I charged him with it; the shoes have never been found -I cannot tell who was with him.</p>

            . I was with the prisoner all that evening; he came to me at eight o'clock, when he left work; he said, "Will you take a walk?" we went to Crawford-street - it was then ten minutes past eight o'clock; he said to me, "There are two young fellows down Bryanstone-square, and they will have a pair of shoes;" I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170052"></xptr>said, "Never mind them, let us go on;" he then met the prosecutor, and spoke to him - I was with him till eleven o'clock, when he was taken; I can swear I saw the two persons near the shop, and one of them is James Baldwin - he has confessed he took the shoes; I spoke to an officer about it, but he said it was no use to take his own evidence.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CHAMBERLAIN re-examined. Q. What time did your wife tell you this? A.About nine o'clock, and I saw the prisoner about half-past eleven; this witness was then with him, but I cannot say whether he was with him at first.</p>

             re-examined. Q. It was an observation of the prisoner's that those persons would take the shoes? A. Yes, and I remained in the prisoner's company; he had no opportunity of taking them - we gave ourselves up, because his mother said that Mr. Chamberlain had been accusing William of taking three shoes; we went down together, and the prosecutor's wife said it was him - I said I would go too, and they said there was no occasion for that, as the man who was with him had a hat and a coat on, and it was not me, unless I had been home, and pulled a hat and a coat off.</p>

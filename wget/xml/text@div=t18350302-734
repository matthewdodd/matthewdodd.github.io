On the 6th of January, about five o'clock in the evening, I saw a man turn down Milton-street, with a hamper of wine on his back—I looked up Milton-street, and saw the prisoner on the other side the street—the man who had the basket, pitched it on a post—the prisoner came and took it on his back—it seemed heavy, and slipped off his back—he staggered into the road—I asked him where he was going with it—he said, "We are going to take it to the Wea<lb></lb>vers' Arms, in Milton-street"—the other said, "Do not be a b—y fool and break it, or we shall have to pay for it"—the prisoner got to the corner of Chapman-street—he then threw it down, and they both ran away—I am quite certain the prisoner is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 35, Baltic-street, St. Luke's. I was coming down Milton-street that evening, and saw the prisoner with a hamper on his shoulder—it appeared to be rather heavy, and he let it fall—I have no doubt he is the man.</p>

Q.</hi> What are you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A house-painter—I work for Mr. Adams—this took place on Twelfth-night, the 6th of January—I saw the prisoner about twenty yards down Milton-street—I did not see the basket on the post—the policeman came up when the basket laid in the road—the prisoner and the other man got away—I helped the policeman to carry the wine to the station-house—I there stated where I lived—the policeman called at my house on Tuesday week, in the evening—I was not at home—he called the next morning, and told me to come to Guildhall, which I did—we had a pot of beer, when it was all over, among four of us—I did not see who paid for it—I think we were not at the public-house above two minutes—we all went away together—I believe it was at the end of Golden-lane that I parted with the policeman—there are several public-houses about there—we went into one—it was in Barbican.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Should not you be surprised if the policeman should have sworn that after you left the office that day, he saw nothing more of you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the policeman was with me—I think it was some ale we had there—I suppose we must have been there half an hour—we had one pot of ale—the other two witnesses were with us—I went home when I left them—I did not see the policeman go into any other public-house.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Which public-house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The one in Barbican—I did not go into any other public-house—we had some porter, while we were waiting at Guildhall—we went to a public-house for that, where we staid about two minutes—I sometimes go with witnesses to public-houses, after they have been before the Magistrate—I do not know that it is improper, without it is done with a bad intent—I do not know that it is against our regulations—I have been in the police two years—we are not allowed to go into pub<lb></lb>lic-houses when on duty.</p>

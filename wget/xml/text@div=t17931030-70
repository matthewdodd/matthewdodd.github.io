               <p>I am a butcher at Lambeth.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know either of the men at the bar? - I had seen them both before.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see them? - The Monday before they were taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Now can you tell us on what occasion you saw them? - I was going home and they met me, Mills met me, it was about four o'clock in the afternoon; he told me that his friend had got some sheep to sell if I would buy them; I told him I had no objection; he took me down to a public house in houndsditch where Smareley was; and he said, will you buy any sheep? I told him I had no objection; he said he had none then, but he would have some in the course of a day or two; Mills was present at the time; about Wednesday, I think, he said he should have them; and where should he bring them to? I told him he must be the best judge where he might bring them to, there were plenty of places at Islington, where the other farmers put up. Mills came to me on the Monday following, he came to me and said, come along, come along, says he, here are the sheep; I said, where? he said, in Fore-street; so when we got to Fore-street, he said, he made a mistake it was Broad-street; when we came to Broad-street I did not see any sheep, but I saw a little man in a blue jacket, and Mills said, there is the man that has got them in care; I said that is a man that I know. Mills takes me down a coach yard where the sheep was; so I and Mills together counted them; I said there were only two and forty; he said, that is right, there is one run over.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to expect there were three and forty? - Mills told me there were three and forty; I told Nathan, the other man's name that had them in care, he is a Billingsgate porter I believe, says I to him, take these sheep to Mr. Shannon, and tell Mr. Shannon, to take particular care of them till he sees me; I did not agree for any thing, he asked me fifteen shillings a piece, but I did not settle it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who asked the fifteen shillings? - Mills. I then told him to go back with me to Smithfield; I had not cash enough about me to pay him for them; I went with him to the Half Moon, and told him to call for something to drink, and I went out and got a constable, and gave charge of him, because I suspected the sheep being stolen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see these sheep? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the sheep in the usual condition, in which sheep were brought into market? - They seemed to be no judge of the price, and then they did not appear to be fit for killing at all, they were scarcely worth any thing for killing.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had taken Mills what became of Smarely? - I did not see<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300106"></xptr>Smarely that morning at all, I had seen him the Monday before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Nathan, had you known these prisoners before? - Never before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Pether the witness? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they come to you in the day or night? - It was four o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they make any secret about it to you, that they had got sheep to sell? - They called on me in a public house.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see Smarely? did you see the prisoners both together? - Mills called me to Smarely, then Smarely seemed as if he was the person of whom I was to have the sheep.</p>

               <p>I am a porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of these sheep? - On the 30th of September, Monday morning, I was going to Billingsgate, I have worked there for these three and four and twenty years. I saw a drove of sheep, and a potatoe cart, in Fenchurch-street, and I saw three men driving them all of a row.</p>
               <p>Q. Look round and see if any of these men are here? - Two men are here at the bar; that was about a quarter after five in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure they are the men? - I am sure of it, they have on the same coats as they had on at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the sheep? - The way I got into the business was, one of the sheep was run over with a potatoe cart, so with that the prisoner at the bar he fetched up the driver of the cart, and says, you have run over one of my sheep; so I took the number of the cart, because he was going to knock him down, 39,397. After that the sheep was run over, one of them said, young man, have you any particular business to do? I said I was going down to Billingsgate, but if he would pay me I would go along with them; so I takes down one of my baskets and takes up the dead sheep in one of my baskets, and followed them to Houndsditch; I followed Mills and the other man to Houndsditch, then Mr. Mills said to me you must stay here for about a quarter of an hour, and he helped me down with the dead sheep, now, says he, you must follow me, Smarely was all the while behind; I followed, I went down Wormwood-street, and came just to Broad-street; says he, I must go to Smithfield, and you must stay here to take care of the sheep.</p>
               <p>Q. Who said that? - Mills; Smarely was up and down Broad-street, at the same time, says he, this is a bye street, you can drive them up here, I drove them up there, and while I was there the watchman came to me and said, this is a great nuisance, the inhabitants will be vexed with it, if they should look out, says he, there is a coach yard, you may drive them up, I drove them up the yard, and all this time Smarely and another gentleman was walking up and down all the time, that other gentleman's name is Pether I believe; sometimes they went round Old Bedlam.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of the man of the name of Nathan? - Nathan came to me along with Mr. Mills.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it that Mills brought Nathan? - About seven o'clock in the morning; I waited there a full hour; when Nathan came to me he said to me take these sheep, so and so, says I, who is to pay me for my trouble? Mills asked me what I wanted? I said I deserved half a crown; Nathan told me where to drive them, Smarely followed me all the way, and came full butt against me in Petticoat-lane; I delivered them to a butcher in Petticoat-lane, he goes by the name of one Mr. Shannon, according to the directions of Nathan, the prisoner Smarely followed me all the way from Fenchurch-street,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300107"></xptr>and paraded all the while up and down Broad-street, while I was there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Nathan, what are you? - I am a porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you employed by butchers? - I have worked at Billingsgate for this last twenty-three years.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a relation to the last witness? - No, no more than you.</p>
               <p>Q. This was early in the morning that you met them? - About a quarter after five.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know if these men are convicted that you will have part of a reward? - I like to be industrious.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know if they are convicted you will be entitled to part of a reward? - I never was in such a snare in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Since you have been about this court have you never heard that there is a reward on conviction of sheep stealing? - No, never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get the half crown? - Mills said he had no more than a shilling about him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get the remainder of the half crown? - A shilling is money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get the remainder of the half crown that they promised to give you? - If they had given me the half crown I had a right to it, I had earned it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get the half crown? - I was paid for my labour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get the remainder of the half crown that they promised to give you? - I had half a crown.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you get the half crown? - The same day after the gentleman paid me the shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid you the one shilling and six-pence? - Mr. Nathan.</p>
               <p>Q. You might have answered that question a long while ago, and you would have saved the time of the court, and the jury, you are an impudent fellow. What were the marks of these sheep? - All marked N. my name; that I could see in the dark.</p>
               <p>Court to Gibson. How were these sheep marked that you lost? - With an N.</p>

Smarely and I were close by the sheep when it was run over, this Nathan had them in his care while Nathan went somewhere else; then Smarely and I came to the Pit's Head in the Old Bailey, and Smarely went from me, and I never see him again till last night I see him in this court; I was taken up a week afterwards on suspicion.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Smarely. That Pether called me up about eleven o'clock on Sunday night, and tole me that he could wish if I could prefer him to a little money, I had none myself, I know, says he, of some sheep that are in a field adjoining a turnpike road; and he took these sheep out of the field to London-bridge, and drove them himself, then at London-bridge I went to Mr. Mills, for him to call Mr. Nathan that was to buy them, he said he did not mind stolen property, he had told me he did not care how they were come by, so as he could have them worth his money. Pether was the man that drove the sheep, he drove them all the way from Marden to London-bridge; I know no more of the sheep than that. I am quite destitute of any witness, I was quite unprepared for any thing of the kind.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Charles, a tailor, of Fleet-street; he lives opposite to Mr. Haynes. On the 22d of May, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I saw two men and a woman standing at Mr. Haynes's door; I was looking out of window, and saw Pugh standing with his hat off, and his hands behind him, outside the door, as if he was master of the house; I am certain of his person. I went down stairs, came up again, and saw them still there; about eight o'clock I stood looking out of the window, which was open, and I think they observed me. About a quarter past eight I saw Pugh beckon to a coach, which then drew up to Mr. Haynes's door, which was open all the time. - Some person then came and rang at our street door bells which took me from the window, and when I got to the door nobody was there; the coach was still at Mr. Haynes's door, but when I got up to the window again it had drawn off; I did not see any thing put into it, for the bell rang immediately it drew up; the persons I had seen there before were gone: the door appeared to be closed. Next morning I heard the shop had been robbed, and told what I had seen.</p>

            . I am street-keeper of St. Dunstan's. On the morning after the robbery I was called in, and examined Mr. Haynes's door - a picklock or false key must have been used. On the 31st of May, about six o'clock in the evening, Mr. Haynes sent for me; I found Pugh in his shop - Haynes said he had brought him in out of Roll's-buildings; he said he was innocent. I found a few shillings and a watch on him.</p>

            . I live at No. 5, New Finsbury-market, and am waiter at the Eagle tavern, City-road. I did not know Pugh was in custody till he wrote me a letter, addressed,</p>
               <p>"For James Robinson, a little man with a wig;" I think it was ten days or a fortnight after he was taken - it was sent to me from the Eagle.

They left my boxes, and went to where Edwards waits.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You never saw him before? A. Never - he was in company with two more, whom I have not seen since; I should know them again. We had a good deal of company.</p>
               <p>Q. What induced you to notice them particularly? A. When they left my box I asked them for a compliment for the waiter; they said they would take tea and return to my box: they had had some half and half, and pipes with me. I noticed them to see if they would return to my box, as they promised to give me something.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps then you can tell what time they left? A. No, I took no further notice after; I left them to the other waiter.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you could not be watching to see if they would return to your box? A. I did for a few minutes; it might be ten minutes; they went to the box, No. 1 or 2 - mine are 10 and 11 - they would not pass my boxes to go out; I did not notice how his companions were dressed - one was tall and the other rather short - Pugh was tallest, the others about one height: I should know their faces again - one was rather fair, and the other rather a dark complexion - two came in first, and the others joined them in about ten minutes; I did not inquire if they were gone, for if people do not give me money when I ask, I think<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182506300027"></xptr>very little of it afterwards: I have been a waiter at the London Tavern, and the London Coffee-house, and the Albion.</p>

            . On Whitsunday I was waiter at the Eagle. Pugh came into my box a few minutes after seven; the prisoner Edwards was with him and another man; they ordered tea for two, which they had; the other man sat by them, they had a pot of half-and-half, and three pipes, and remained there till after eight; there was a dispute at the bar with one of the waiters about the time they left; Pugh said a had overcharged them: Robinson desired me to attend before the Alderman, to state this; there was a letter sent to the Eagle; I do not think I should know the third man again, but the prisoner I know perfectly well; I explained to Pugh about what I charged him, and he was satisfied.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you a constant waiter there? A. No, only occasional; they were all three strangers to me; the other man was not quite so tall as Edwards: I do not remember whether Robinson complained of their behaving shabby to him: when Pugh called for tea two gentlemen sent me to see the time - it was a quarter past seven; I was delayed at the bar by a dispute, and looked at the clock when I came away; I know it was Whitsunday because I have not been engaged there since.</p>

On Whitsunday I was waiting at Mr. Lowther's, the Buffalo's head public-house, in the New-road, which is about a mile and a half from the Eagle, between half-past 8 and a quarter to 9 o'clock: the prisoner and another young man came in and staid till near ten o'clock - they were in the long room, and had a pot of malt liquor and a glass of gin and water: three particular circumstances make me remember it, for when they came in they called for malt liquor, and one asked me the way to the yard: I took them the beer, and Edwards called for gin and water, and tendered me a half-crown; I asked it I was to take for all - he said no, only for his share; and being strangers to me, I naturally watched to see if they left all right; I happened to see them going, and said</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen your segars and half-and-half are not paid for;" they looked at Edwards, and said they thought he had paid; Pugh wrote a letter to Mr. Lowther, requesting me to attend at Guildhall, which I did.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were there many persons there? A. Perhaps twenty or thirty - our room does not fill till ten o'clock; I think the third man was a good deal shorter than the prisoners: I took most notice of them as they spoke: I rather think Pugh took a penny out of the shilling which he paid on the stairs, which made me notice them; I know it was Whitsunday because it was the first Sunday we had draft cider, which they had.</p>

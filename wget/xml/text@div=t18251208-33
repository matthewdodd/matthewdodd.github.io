On the 17th of November, at half-past five o'clock, I saw thirteen sheep there; and at half-past seven that evening I missed eleven of them; the two remaining were lame. I and Cope went next morning to a stable in Sermon-lane, about three hundred yards off; we forced the door a little way open, and saw the sheep - I went to Mr. Young, who returned with me; we then forced it quite open, and I found the eleven sheep, and am sure they were the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Who did they belong to? A. They were under my master's care; I was to deliver them to the owner - there were others in the field, but not with these, nor marked in the same way; I left somebody to watch the stable while I fetched Young. I was not absent two minutes, and did not lose sight of the stable.</p>

            . I belong to the stable in Sermon-lane - I let it to the prisoner on the 25th of July; he said he was a butcher, and attended Newgate-market, to carry home carcases to the butcher's, and kept a cart and horse for that purpose. I had one key of the stable to put my barrow in, and he had another. On the 17th of November my barrow was fetched from my door, which is not ten yards from the stable, but I did not see it put into the stable. Next morning I went there with Walton and Cope - I put the key into the hole, and found the lock was off - the door was tied with a string. I found the sheep there. I had found my barrow before my door about eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were not in the habit of going to the stable? A. Only at times. I cannot say that he had not lent the stable to anybody.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you see anybody else go there? A. No. If my barrow had not been put at my door I should have gone to the stable for it. I seldom saw him there.</p>

            . I am street-keeper of Islington. I got to the stable at half-past nine o'clock in the morning, of the 18th of November - I watched at the stable for the prisoner to come till about one o'clock, then left Lock there. I was returning about a quarter past five o'clock, and met Lock, with the prisoner - I locked him up; he told me if I would go back and wait there, a tall man in a rough coat would come with a horse to fetch the cart and things away, and said, "Be particular about the horse." I waited, a man came, and was taken.</p>

            . I am an officer, and was left at the stable. The prisoner came there a little after four o'clock, with the key in his hand; I laid hold of him before he could put it to the door; he said there was no lock - he asked why I took him; I said, for sheep stealing; he wanted to stop there for an hour till this man came; I said I could not wait. He said a man would be there in an hour, but said no more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say the man who put the sheep there was coming in an hour? A. Not to me. That man has been tried at Chelmsford, for horse stealing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did not the prisoner say he knew nothing about the sheep? A. Yes, several times. I was present when the other man was taken.</p>

             re-examined. The cart found at the stables was not the one the prisoner used - I never saw it before that morning. The horse the other man came on was not Saunders'.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Two men, named Smith and Colburn came to me on Tuesday evening, and asked me to lend them the stable to put the horse and cart in - I said, Yes, if there would be room for mine as well; they said it would come on Thursday morning, and brought it; I said they must take it away, for there would not be room for mine; they said, if I could accommodate them till Friday they would pay me, and, as I worked for Colburn, I agreed to put my cart in a shed; I was to meet them at the Sportsman, public-house, in the City-road, to give them the key; I went and offered them the key - he said he did not want it, for he had taken the horse out, and left some things there, and had broken the lock off, and Colburn should pay me for it, and if I would meet him at five o'clock he would bring his horse and cart and fetch the things away. I am innocent of stealing the sheep.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wharfinger in the employ of the East and West India Dock Company. I was on duty at the south quay gate on the afternoon of the 1st January—I locked the shed No. 2 at four o'clock—the warehouse has a slated roof, and has battens all round it—I had only one bale of goods in that warehouse at that time—it was marked "A F N 1000," and was for exportation—I saw it safe that afternoon—I went next morning with the constable about about half-past eight o'clock, and found the bale had been cut open, part of the goods taken out, and a lot lying by the side as well, and there had been a batten cut—we sent information to Southgate's, and they fetched the bale away—all the battens of the warehouse were safe when I left at four o'clock.</p>

Mrs. Gibbons was going out, and I was coming in; she told me if I saw any one come in I was to give an answer; at the same time I was going into the yard I heard the prisoner come down stairs, she lived in the house; she went to Mrs. Gibbons' door and knocked twice; she got no answer; she went out of the street door. She came the second time to Mrs. Gibbons's door, unlatched it, and went in; she staid in the room about twenty minutes; I watched to see what she was doing. This gown laid upon the table behind the parlour door; she took the gown, put it under her apron, and walked up stairs with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you saw this woman go behind the door and take the gown. - A. Yes, I came past the door and saw her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you speak to her. - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>MRS. GIBBONS. Q. What do you know about this gown. - A The pawnbroker has got it; my lodger found the duplicate on the stairs.</p>

On Tuesday she told me she had lost a gown, and that it laid between me and the woman in the two pair of stairs, and that the pawnbroker knew the person; I told her I would go with her to the pawnbroker's or to any magistrate; she turned the woman out of doors, she said she did not think it was me. It was pawned in my sister in law's name; I know nothing of it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

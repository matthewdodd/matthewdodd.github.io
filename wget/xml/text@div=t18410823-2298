                  </hi>. On the 14th of August I was in the service of Mr. Daniel Birth, of Upper Tooting—in the course of Saturday afternoon, the 14th of August, I was in the hall—there is a coach-house adjoining the house, under the same roof, and a communication from the coach-house into the house by a side door—I observed that the side door was shut half an hour before, but the coach-house door was open—I beard a noise of the gingling of plate—the plate was kept in a pantry—my master does not keep a footman—the housemaid takes care of the plate—I had seen it in the pantry ten minutes before I heard the tinkling—on hear<lb></lb>ing it I ran down stairs, and saw two men running out at the coach-house door—I ran down stairs, and was close on them—I saw them through the side door—I hey had plate in their hands—the prisoner was one of them—had never seen him before, but I am quite certain he is the person—I ran after them, and called out "Thief"—they ran up a lane opposite the dwell<lb></lb>ing-house., and I after them, but lost sight of them—about four or five minutes after, I saw the prisoner brought back by Francis—he had nothing on him then—I went into the pantry, and missed the plate stated in the indictment—these four table-spoons, three dessert forks, and three German silver forks now produced are Mr. Bin's property.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a jobbing gardener, and work for Mr. Birth sometimes. On the 14th of August I heard Merritt shout out "Thief—she came up the lane, and gave an alarm that the house had been robbed of some plate—I and Benfield followed the prisoner into the garden of a woman named Cockett—Benfield said he thought he saw something un<lb></lb>derneath the beans—I went into the beans, and there found the prisoner secreted—I do not know whether he was lying or crouching down—the beans were seven or eight feet high—Benfield searched the place, and found</p>

               <p>the plate—I caught hold of the prisoner, and Benfield assisted me, and went for the police—the prisoner said, "What do you want of me?"—I said, "I want that plate you have brought from over the way from Mr. Birt's house"—he said, "What plate? I have no plate"—and when the policeman searched him he had nothing on him—it was about 130 or 140 yards from Mr. Birt's house that I found him, and about five minutes after Merritt spoke to me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. On the 14th of August I heard Merritt give an alarm, as I was walking home, rather past the turning where the plate was found—I directly went to the corner of the turning, and looked round the corner, but saw no one—I went and looked over the railing of Mrs. Cockett's garden, and saw something move under the beans, on the ground—I called Francis, and be went in first—he went to the further end of the beans, and said, "Here is one of them"—he caught the prisoner by the tail of his coat, and I took him by the collar—I found the plate produced stuck in the ground, near to where he was, the bowls of the spoons down-wards—I saw the ground had been fresh moved, and turned it up, and found the plate—it was quite covered with earth.</p>

Q.</hi> Did you observe any thing about the prisoner's dress? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—it was not unfastened—I did not see him till he was brought out of the beans by Francis—the fence between the beans and the road is about three feet six inches high—it is only a rail across—there is another fence at the bottom of the beans, and over that another garden—I did not hear the prisoner say any thing about being there to ease himself.</p>

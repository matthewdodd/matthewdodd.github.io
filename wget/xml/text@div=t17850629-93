I delivered the property to the prisoner, and the key, and within three hours she and the things were gone; the room was the next door to my dwelling-house; I saw the prisoner the Monday following by accident, and she denied herself being the person at first, but I can swear she is the person; I let her go home to her husband, she seemed to be surprised at first, but at last she declared she did take the room of me, but it was for another person, and that she knew nothing of the things; I never saw any of my things after; there are two other lodgers in the house, it is a public stair case, therefore I cannot swear she stole the property, though it was delivered to her.</p>

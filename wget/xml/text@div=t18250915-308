About the 12th of September, the prosecutor applied to me for 11 l. 9 s. 4 d., but I proved to him by my bills and receipts, that I did not owe him a farthing - the last bill I paid myself to the prisoner - it was 1 l. 11 s. he always brought the bread - that amount was up to the 3d of September; I produce the bill and receipts, which he gave me - I paid him a sovereign, a half sovereign, and a shilling.</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that his master had kindly advanced him 20 l. for the support of an illegitimate child, and deducted from 15 s. to 18 s. a week, from his wages in payment, which so embarrassed him, that he applied part of this money to his own use.</p>

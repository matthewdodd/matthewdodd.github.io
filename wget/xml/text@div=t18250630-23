The street-keeper said I could do as I liked about giving them in charge; I said I would, and as we were going along we were pursued by the person into whose<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182506300013"></xptr>house I had taken them, who said he had found the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were there any other persons in the shop? A. Yes; there might be four or five. The handkerchief could not have been on any part of my person. Tracey stood nearest the counter.</p>

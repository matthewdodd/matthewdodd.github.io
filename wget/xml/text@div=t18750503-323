I am the daughter of Henry Hawkins and live at 39, Wellclose Square—on Tuesday evening 13th April I was looking out at the door and saw the prisoner walking up and down from 8 till 11 o'clock, there were three more with him—about 12.30 in the morning my father missed three coats, three silk pocket handkerchiefs, a gold brooch, a gold locket, a lamb's-wool shawl, and petticoat, worth altogether about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., also a blue cheque duster which was covered over my father's clothes.</p>

I am a tailoress, and live in Wellclose Square—on Tues<lb></lb>day night 13th April between 11 o'clock and 11.30 I was coming through Ship Alley and met the prisoner; I am sure he is the man; I afterwards picked him out at the station from a great many others—he knocked up against me—I observed that he Had a parcel tied up in a check duster, he had another bundle tied up under his arm, but I could not see what that was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I said before the Magistrate that I saw his back and noticed his clothes—I also identified him by his voice, because he bumped against me, and as I turned round to speak to him he used most obscene language—I identified him by his features as well—this was just at the corner by Mr. Hawkins', he was coming direct from there.</p>

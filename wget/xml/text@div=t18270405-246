The prisoner applied<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050101"></xptr>to me to take my shop and parlour, on the 22d of February, we agreed that he should take it; I had not given possession - on the evening of the 1st of March, while I was out, he brought a caprenter - I returned that evening, and the glass partition, dividing the shop and parlour, was gone; it was fixed to the floor and ceiling; he came again on the 7th of March, and wanted to sleep in my house; I would not allow him; I sent for my landlord, who asked him what had become of the glass partition; he said he was not bound to tell - he was then taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PREDERGAST. Q. There was no particular time at which he was to have possession? A. No; I believe he said the rent would commence on the Monday after the Thursday that the partition was taken - he did not apply to sleep there before - he was to sleep there on Thursday, the 1st of March - he had taken my bed-room at the same time; he did not say the partition was useless to him - I had no other fixture, except two or three shells - it had been a fishmonger's, but those fixtures were not mine - he did not say I had better take them away - he said the partition must be moved about a yard towards the fire-place - he did not afterwards say that space would not do - he gave me this paper (looking at it) on the morning of the day the partition was taken down - he paid me no money; he left my daughter in care of the place while I was out, and a friend of his proposed to cut out part of the partition: I said if they did, they must make it good - I refused to let him move it without the landlord's leave - it was not to go out of the house - I never said he might do what he pleased with it.</p>
               <p>This paper was here read; it was an agreement from the prisoner to make good any alteration made upon his leaving the premises.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he know you were going out? A. He saw me, and I saw him with the carpenter, and thought he was come to make alterations - I did not know where he lived; he had given a reference to the Surrey-road.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see the prosecutrix there when you was taking it down? A. Yes, and the young lady brought the candle down when the prisoner knocked at the door - the prosecutrix was there till it was laying down.</p>

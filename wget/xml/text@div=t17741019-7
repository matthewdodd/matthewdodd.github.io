            ; we shewed the prisoner two boxes we had found there, and asked her if they were hers; she said they were: I asked if the things in them were hers? she said, yes. I asked if she had the keys? she said she had left them at her master's house. We got the boxes open; the first thing we took out was a sheet: Mr. Parnell asked her, if that was her sheet? she said, no, it was Mr. Alderman Bridgen's: Mr. Parnell said, I suppose they are all your master's; she said, almost: she said a man had packed them up, and that the gold watch was in the middle of the box. I found it in the box according to her direction.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing how they came to Stevens's house?</p>

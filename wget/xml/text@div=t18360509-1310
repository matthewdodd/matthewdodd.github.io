                  </hi>, I am one of the mangers of the firm of John Healey Booth and two others, wholesale grocers, in Upper Thames-street—our stables are in Princes-street, close by Harrod's premises—our people, going to put up the horses at night have to go near his shop—Moran was in the employ of the firm in April as porter, and had been so seven or eight months—we have a cellar where goods are kept—in April we had a stock of currants in bags, weighing 1cwt. each—they were kept close to the loop hole door in the cellar, close to where the cart loads—Moran had to it busi<lb></lb>ness in the cellar when the last load was taken out—he had access to it as porter—it was part of his duty to assist in loading the cart—we had a man named George in our employ who was taken ill, and left, shortly after Moran came—he was a porter also—I heard nothing of this till I received a communication from the officers of the Thomas police—Warner and Moran were then both taken into custody, and sent to Giltspur-street pri<lb></lb>son on the 16th; and at six o'clock on Monday morning, the 18th, I re<lb></lb>ceived this letter from Giltspur-street, in consequence of which I went there and saw Moran—I showed him the letter, and stated its contents—he said he did not write it, nor was he the means of sending it—I asked him if it was his confession, and he said, "No"—in the course of conver<lb></lb>sation, I told him we had been robbed for a length of time—he said, he partly knew that George, who had lived there, had carried on a robbery for some time; and that he was coming from his work one evening, and a strange man, in the street tapped him on the shoulder, and took him into a public-house—they had some beer together, and he said that they could do some business together; and that George had often done business with the man; and he had thrown goods out of the loop-hole, and the man had taken them away—I afterwards saw Warner, and showed him the letter—we missed 1cwt. of currants, as soon as were apprised of the loss, on Tuesday, the 5th of April—we had taken stock on the 2nd.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Thames police-officer. I received information about March of April, which induced me to pay attention to Harrod's shop in Rosemary-lane—I had seen the prosecutor's cart stop at Harrod's shop on one occasion, before the 2nd of April—Moran was not there at that time—I have seen Moran inside the shop, and Warner outside at the same time, several times—and Harrod was at home at those times, talking to Moran—I once saw the cart stop there, the shop was full of customers-Warner went into the shop on that occasion—I went behind the cart, lifted the tilt up, and felt a bag under the tilt—Moran was not there—Warner said something to Harrod, and then came out and drove his cart away without leaving any thing there—that was three or four days before the 2nd of April—in consequence of what I heard, I took Harrod into cus<lb></lb>tody on the 2nd of May—I had been endeavouring to find him before that, and searched his house on the 19th of April—he was not at home, and I had been watching ever since at his house night and day, and could not find him—after the discharge of Warner and Moran, I went again to his house, and then found him at home—I said, "Mr. Harrod, you must go with me"—he said, "Step into the parlour, mr. Fogg"—the parlour joins the shop—he said, "What is it for?" I suppose you heard that we searched your house the other day?"—he said, "Yes—I said, "Messrs. Booth and Ingledew have been robbed to a great extent, by their carman and warehouseman, of pepper, currants, and many things, and you have been receiving them"—he said, "Oh, consider my wife and family, what am I to do"?come up-stairs and see my wife, she is in bed"—I said, "You may go up and see your wife, but I cannot assist you, you must to with me"—when he got up-stairs he said, "Oh, what am I to do? can't you settle this thing?"—I said, "No"—he said, "Such</p>

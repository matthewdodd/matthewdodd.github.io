(The ladies were ordered to withdraw). - On the 27th of last month, about a quarter after one in the morning, I was coming by the Mansion-house, I saw the prosecutor lying, at the distance of about eight or nine yards, on the payement, near Mr. Hale's door, in the Pouhry, and a gentleman's footman expostulating with the prisoner about robbing the man that lay on the payement; she was sitting then on the threshold of Mr. Hale's door; I told him to take the man up, and I would take care of her; she seemed to be cramming something into her private parts, as I supposed, I took hold of her hands, and said, I am sure you have robbed the man and are concealing the property; Mr. Hale', and another man, said, they would take her to the watch-house; I desired them to keep her hands separate; when we came to the watch-house, and she was going to be stripped, I begged her not to expose herself, for the property would be found; she said, she had not got the property; just before her under-petticoat was going to be pulled off, she said, she wanted to speak to me; she said, she had given three guineas to Bet Goodwin; I told her, there were nine, there were six to come; she said, she had not got it; Mr. Hale desired me to search, I accordingly felt the guineas in her private parts; I did not take them out, my fingers were too short; here is a man that did take them out, I saw them taken out, all six; and they were put in a paper, sealed up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow. I carried on business in Upper Marylebone-street till last Wednesday, when my things were sold—on 9th Oct. I was up-stairs—I heard the shop-bell ring, and came down—I found the prisoner there, in custody—I examined the shop-door, and found the glass broken—it had been fast before I went up-stairs—it fastens itself when it shuts to—this looking-glass is mine, I had seen it in the course of the day.</p>

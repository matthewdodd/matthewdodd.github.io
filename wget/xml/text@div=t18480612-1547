                  </hi>. I am the principal officer of police at the station of the Great Western Railway Company at Paddington. Wilson was a porter therein the Goods-department, in Feb., 1846, and down to 27th May last—on Sun<lb></lb>daymorning, 28th May, in consequence of a communication from the witness Price, I went to the Harcourt-street Police-station, and saw Wilson there incustody, waiting to be bailed—I asked why he was locked up—he said upona charge of assault made by his wife—I asked what had become of the goldwatch which he had about him when he was locked up last night—he said hehad given it to his wife—I said I should very much like to see it, and whenhis bail had been completed we walked together to his lodging, No. 2, Hatton-place, Portman-market—Gardner was not at home—I had been makinginquiries in the neighbourhood in the earlier part of the morning—we thenwent to 14, Luton-street, where I found Gardner—we returned to 2, Hatton-place, and I there asked Gardner to show me the gold watch which had beengiven to her the night previous by Wilson at the police-station—she asked Wilson whether she should show it—(she had previously asked in Luton-streetwhat right I had to see it, and wanted to know what I had to do with. it—I told her I was not quite sure that I had anything to do with it at pre<lb></lb>sent, but I possibly might have, and as a police-officer I demanded to see it)—itwas in her bosom, suspended by the chain—she endeavoured to get itout—it had slipped down, and she asked Wilson to put bis hand in and drawit out, which he did—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I examined it, and found thename of "Allis, Bristol" inside—I then asked the maker's name, and thenumber, and where it was made—they said they did not know—I said, "Iam not at all satisfied, and with your consent I will retain this for the present"—I did so—Wilson told me that he had had it from his brother, who diedthree years previously, who was a chemist's assistant, and to whom it hadbeen given by his master—I asked who the master was—he named several, but could not tell which of them it was that had given him the watch—Iasked if he could refer me to any person who could satisfy me as to bow hebcame possessed of it—he at length said, "Oh yes, I have a sister living at Windsor, who will prove that it was my brother's watch, and that he leftit to me"—I went to Windsor that same evening, and saw the sister, who gave me some account—she is here—in consequence of what I learntfrom her, and from other circumstances, I apprehended Gardner on 1st June at Luton-street, and afterwards took Wilson.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gas-fitter, and live at 24, Wyndham-street—I keep the house, and have been there eighteen years. On Saturday night, 27th May last, I happened to be at the Harcourt-street station, and saw theprisoners there—Wilson was dressed as a railway porter—he was chargedwith assaulting Gardner—he was searched—he produced a gold watch—thepoliceman took it from him, and it was given to Gardner—she had previouslyasked for some silver that was taken from him, and likewise a knife—herefused to give her either, but he gave her the watch, and I understood himto say, "It is <hi rend="italic">yours</hi>, you may take it"—perceiving that it was gold, and amodern watch, in consequence of suspicions I went next morning to Collard, and told him what I had seen—I afterwards accompanied Collard to Hatton-place, where the prisoners lived, and Gardner produced the watch—Collardasked whose it was—Wilson said, "It is mine"—he asked where he got it—he said it was left him by a deceased brother, I think he said about threeyears ago, and he referred Collard to his sister at Windsor—on the Saturdaynight, when Gardner left the station with the watch, I went with her—shetold me that it was her watch, that it was given her by her grandfather, andshe had had it ten years—" Indeed," she said, "I call it my child."</p>

I have known the prisonerstwo years and a half, through attending upon two elderly ladies, who werein the same house when they took it—they lived together, and I worked forthe female—about a year and a half ago I saw her in possession of a gold watchlike the one produced in shape and size—I cannot speak positively to it, Idid not notice it much—she told me it was her watch, and her grandfatherhad given it her.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not observe him go there did you. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The first thing that attracted your notice was your apron that he had in his breeches. - A. Yes, I called my husband, I had got the apron, and the pin cloth; I asked my husband to lay hold of him; the other things were all wet, he had put them in this bag which he brought in with him.</p>

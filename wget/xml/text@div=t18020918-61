               <p>Second Count. Charging them to be the property of persons unknown.(The case was opened by Mr. Knapp.)</p>
               <p>GEORGE COWAN sworn. - I am surveyor to the Thames Police; my duty was on the river on the 27th, at night: About one o'clock, I was near London-bridge, and saw a boat row from Freshwharf to the southward; I perceived the boat was loaded, and rowed heavy; we got within a few boats length of her, when I saw something thrown overboard by the two men in the boat, which appeared to be very heavy; I saw the last, which I picked up, and it was a tea-chest, it was flood-tide, and the other parcel was picked up by the waterman, Warwick, and was a chest of tea with the East-India Company's and the ship's marks, which I know; we hauled them in, and gave chase to the persons who had thrown them over; the boat had rowed into Battle-bridge, Southwark; we could not see the men, but they run over the crast; I followed in, and found a boat there, booked to the crast; I cannot say I had seen the boat before, but I found this piece of a tea-chest in the boat,(produces it), and some loose tea; I afterwards examined the chests, and one had lost the top, and another the bottom; the lead is entire of one, and the other has received damage; I tried this piece of wood to one, and it sits very well, and the tea corresponded in quality; I took the chest to the office, and after I left it there, I went to the Company's wharf to enquire if any crast had been robbed; I found them all secure at Somer's quay; next morning, I saw the Essex hoy had swing among the Gravesend boats; I went to the house of the prisoner, in consequence of information, about eight o'clock, near to Battle-bridge, but did not see the prisoner till the 16th of August, between one and two o'clock, when I apprehended him in Amelia-row, St. George's-fields, with a girl; I got into the house after difficulty; I took him, after resistance, to my boat at St. Olave's stairs; he said, if I had known you had wanted me so long, I would have come forward, for you have nothing against me; I said I had been at his house every day, and his mother said he should come forward; says he, you have nothing against me, you did not find the sculls in my boat; I said I knew nothing of that, for there were no sculls in the boat when I found it; they were wet, when brought back to me, and one had the name of William Thorley. I took him to the office.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You were five or six boats lengths behind when something was thrown out? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You took both chests up? - A. Yes, which delayed us a little; the boat was in sight, about twenty yards distance, but I did not see the men, for it was dark; when we got to the crast, there was only one boat outside of it; as to the piece of tea-chest, I will not swear it belongs to either of these chest, but I think it does.</p>

             sworn. - I am a Thames policesurveyor, and was with Mr. Cowan: On the 28th of July, about one o'clock in the morning, I saw a boat row from Somer's quay, which we followed to Battle-bridge, Southwark, and saw some persons throw out something, which proved to be two chests of tea, and which we knew to belong to the East-India Company, knowing the mark; there were six in our boat, four men, and two surveyors; we chased the boat to Battle-bridge stairs, where I found in a crast a pair of sculls, which had been recently used, there were no sculls in the boat; one of them had the prisoner's name on it; the persons who were in the boat, made their escape; I was at the prisoner's father's house, next day, in Vine-yard, near Battle-bridge, when the prisoner made his escape.</p>

             sworn. - I belong to the East-India Company, and was employed on board the Essex hoy, loaded with tea at Somer's quay; I left them between seven and eight in the evening locked up; I searched them all, and saw them again at ten minutes past five next morning; when the vessel swung down athwart Billingsgate, I went on board, and found one lock broke, and one bar drawn off, and a batch taken off; I can swear these chests are the Company's property, by the mark.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You don't think it a very extraordinary thing for watermen to borrow boats of one another, to commit robberies? - A. I cannot say; it may be so.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the lighter loaded? - A. Yes, in part, and saw the lock put on; I saw the place from which the two chests were taken.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Can you venture to say, none of the chests of tea were broken in the loading of them? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My boat was stolen away, and I was at home when the robbery was committed, so that I know nothing of it; I leave my case to my Counsel. <rs id="t18020918-61-verdict325" type="verdictDescription">

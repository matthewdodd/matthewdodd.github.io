                  </hi>. I live is Waite-street, Poplar. On the 12th of May, about two or three o'clock in the morning, as I was returning home, I met the prisoner and another young woman—they took me to a public-house—I drank with them—I was intoxicated, but knew what I was about—I went with the young woman to a house—I left her, and in consequence of something I afterwards took her to the station, and made a complaint against her—the prisoner was present—I afterwards saw her in the street—she began to abuse the other female, and said what an ungrateful wretch she was for robbing me after the handsome manner in which I had treared her—I made the best of my way home—I did not know the way—she dragged me into a by street—I had thirteen sovereigns, a five-shilling piece, and other silver, in two different pockets—while talking with her the policeman came tip—he said, "I think you must have been robbed, for your pocket is turned inside out"—It was the pocket I had the silver in—I said she must have robbed me—I said, "You have got a crown-piece, and sundry other ailver from me"—she declared she had not, and used very abusive language to me for having accused her of it—I said I was certain she had it, and if she would give me the crown-piece I would say nothing about the remainder, she might go about her business—the declared she had not a crown-piece, and abused me very much—I said, "Very welt,</p>

               <p>then you must go with the officer"—on the way to the station she laid, "Are you certain you had a crown-piece?"—I laid, "Yes, I am positive of it"—I was sober enough to be positive—I had examined my money shortly before at the station—she put her hand into her pocket, pulled out the crown-piece, and said, "Here, take it," calling me an offensive name—the officer took it and her at the same time.</p>

Between two and three o'clock in the morning of the 2nd of May I was in Vinegar-lane—in consequence of something I went into a house, and saw a person there—I went with the prosecutor to the station—I afterwards saw him with the prisoner up a by street, at the back of Vinegar-lane—I saw them close together—I went up to them—I saw his pocket hanging over the fob of his trowsers—I said, "I think you have been robbed, sir"—he felt in his pocket, and said, "I have lost a crown-piece, and some silver"—he said to her, "You have robbed me; if you don't give me the crown-piece I will give you in charge"—she denied it several times—I took her in charge—as she was going down Vi<lb></lb>negar-lane she turned round to him several times, and asked if he was certain it was a crown-piece—he said he was—she then put her hand into her pocket, took out a crown-piece, and said to him, "Take it, you b----s—"—I took it, and took her to the station—I produce it—I found 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in her pocket.</p>

I was in the Coach and Horses on the 26th of Sep<lb></lb>tember, and went home with a girl to Twine-court—that was neither of the prisoners—my trowsers were taken from me while I was asleep—they were hanging over a chair—I did not see either of the prisoners with the person I went with—there were two more in the room besides the woman I went with—I cannot tell whether these prisoners were the women, as there was no light in the room—there were four girls in the room—we went to bed about ten o'clock, and 1 awoke about six o'clock in the morning—my trowsers were gone—I afterwards saw them.</p>

On the 21st of April, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the back room behind my shop, and some person came in; my wife went to serve him - I went into the shop, and saw it was the prisoner, whom I had known well before; he used to live at Hackney; before I came out of the parlour I heard him say he wanted five such thimbles as he had bought three of, of Mr. Bell a few days before: when I got into the shop, he said, "I want five such thimbles as my daughter had of you;" he bought nothing - as soon as he was gone I went to my other shop at Stoke Newington, and found him there; I told him I would detain him- he said I should not; I said I would, and took hold of him: we had a scuffle - he then said, had I a back room, and he would go there - I took him into the back room, and he began to cry; he said he had a wife and nine children, and he hoped I would not be hard with him; the officer came, and found this property, which I identified as mine - I believe it had been chiefly taken from my shop at Newington; there are four that I can identify particularly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me look at any property at Hackney? A. I have not said I did; I followed him to my shop at Newington - he had purchased a thimble at Newington, and paid for it; he did not mention about his wife being in the family-way - he lived about five years within fifty yards of me; when he put the property on the table he said, "You don't swear to that?" my answer was"That remains to be proved;" I only deal with one manufacturer for this sort of thimbles - we had but half a dozen of them; they were sent to Newington from my shop at Hackney, some weeks before, but it so happened that none of them had been sold; after he had been in the shop there were only two of them left.</p>

            . I am sister to Mr. Bell, and keep his shop at Newington. On the 21st of April I saw the prisoner there, between six and seven o'clock in the evening - there was no one there from two o'clock till he came in; I was giving him change - Mr. Bell came in, while the prisoner was there, under the pretence of getting a thimble of a particular size, to send to the East Indies - he was continually trying thimbles on his finger, and putting his hand into his pocket again - he almost tired my patience.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not ask you for a thimble with a particular motto "Remember me," on it? A. Yes, and I repeated the mottos I had, and gave you one "From a friend;" you said you would have one of them, but you repeatedly put your hands into the tray, and put them into your pocket again; when I saw them on the table, I could be upon my oath, those four had been in the tray - here is one I have worked with myself; it has a small bit of rust on it: I was in the shop when the officer searched him, but I went into the parlour just as the officer had taken them from him; he made no resistance to the officer, but he did to my brother - I went and locked to the door; I believe he got on the step of the door, but he did not get away.</p>
               <p>JAMES OFFORD. I was in Mr. Bell's service. I saw the prisoner come into the shop, at Newington, and opened the door for him; I heard him ask for some silver thimbles - I saw him put his hand into the tray, and then put his hand into his pocket, and make an excuse that he had the size somewhere.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Who told you to say this? A. No one.</p>

            . I am an officer, and took the prisoner- I found these fourteen thimbles on him, in his right-hand trousers pocket.</p>
               <p>MR. BELL. From the appearance of those thimbles, I believe, conscientously, that these four are my property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The Magistrate asked him if he had any mark on them, and he said No; the Magistrate then asked him if he could not buy them in every shop, and he said Yes. Witness. No, I said they could not be bought in Hackney.</p>

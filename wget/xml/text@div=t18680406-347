                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant X</hi> 30). On 30th March, about half-past one, p.m., I was called to Norland Road, Notting Hill, and found Thomas Smith, the deceased, lying on his back, with his arms extended, bleeding from two wounds in his face—the prisoner, who was standing by him, was pointed out to me as having struck him—I told him I must take him in custody for assaulting Smith, and somebody in the crowd halloaed out, "Step it"—I put my hand on the prisoner—he said that ho did not intend running away—he said, "I certainly struck him"—I had seen the prisoner about three minutes before, in Norland Road, when he asked me to take a man in custody for attempting to strike him with a pick, and like<lb></lb>wise his wife (the deceased's wife)—I said, "You do not appear to have any marks," and recommended him to go to the Police-Court, and take a summons out—I asked him where the man was, and he pointed to the Queen's Arms—I knew the deceased: he went by the name of Windsor <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>.</p>

I am barman at the Queen's Arms, Norland Road—on 23rd March, about one o'clock, the deceased came in, and had some beer—he appeared quite sober and sensible—he sat down a few minutes—some<lb></lb>body, I do not know who, put his head in at the door, and said something, and Smith got up and went out immediately—I looked through the window, and saw the prisoner strike Smith on the right side of his eye, and he fell—he got up, and the prisoner struck him again, and he fell with his arms extended, and did not move till the policeman lifted him up—I saw a mark on the right side of his face, under his eye—Smith made no attempt to strike the prisoner—I had not lost sight of them at all.</p>

I am a painter, of 11, Ashburton Terrace, Notting Hill—on 23rd March I saw Smith on the ground, and the prisoner skipping round him, saying, "Get up, you b——r, get up!"—the man rose, and I saw the prisonor hit him; he fell backwards, with his arms extended, and never moved—his face was bleeding, and there looked to be a wound over his right eyebrow.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a master painter, of 23, Norland Road—on 23rd March I was in the Queen's Road, Notting Hill; the prisoner and the deceased turned the corner as I did: a lot of boys were following them—the deceased had a pickaxe and a shovel, which he put down in front of him, and said to the prisoner, "If you do not go away, I will cleave you down with the shovel"—I shook my head at him, and he said, "Do you think I am going to be talked to by a man like that?" or "a boy like that"—I walked away—he had not got the shovel in his hand at that time—the deceased was bigger and older than the prisoner: I should say he was sixty.</p>

I live at 6, Charles Street, Queen's Road—about half-past twelve on 23rd March I saw the prisoner and Smith come down the steps of No. 1, where they both lived in the same lodgings—I live at No. 6—I knew them—Smith said, "If you do not go away, I will rip you open with this pick"—they walked on, and Smith went into the Queen's Arms, Norland Road—the prisoner walked away—I saw Smith come out of the Queen's Arms—I thought they were going to fight, and ran to tell Mrs. Smith—Smith went up to the prisoner in a fighting attitude, but I did not see that he struck at the prisoner, at all—Smith put up his fists at the prisoner, but I saw no blows struck.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at Saint Bartholomew's Hospital—on 22nd March, at three o'clock, Smith was brought there, with two slight wounds, one on his face and one over his right eyebrow, and a recent fracture of his right arm—he was partly sensible; he was suffering from symptoms of concussion of the brain; he died about half-past twelve that night—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, and found a fracture of the skull, extending to the base, and a large quantity of blood effused in the ventricles, on the right side of the brain—the cause of death was effusion of blood on the brain—if he was struck on the face, and fell on a hard substance, that would cause it; the fist itself would not do it, but falling on a kerbstone would—I think it was caused by falling on a kerbstone, but he must have had a blow on the face—he might have fallen down from being drunk.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>:—When I went up stairs, Smith had a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> with his wife. I heard her halloa out, "Murder!" He ran down into the room where I was, with a pick, and I ran to the door to shut it. He shoved against me, and wanted to come in. I shoved against him, and would not let him come in, so he broke the hinge off the bottom of the door, and then called a policeman, who said, "You must summons him." I had no sooner told the policeman than he came up, and we fought.</p>

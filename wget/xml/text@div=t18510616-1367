                  </hi>. I am assistant to William Greedey Mott, of No. 12, Cheapside, in the parish of St. Vedast Foster. On 6th June, about a quarter-past 8, I heard a smashing of glass, ran out of the shop, and saw the prisoner, about thirty yards off, with a cream-ewer—I caught him, and brought him back—the window was smashed—the cream-ewer is Mr. Mott's. (<hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate was here read: "I took it, that I might put myself in security in a prison of the Lord Mayor's."</hi>)</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, H</hi> 33, <hi rend="italic">the interpreter</hi>). I have known the prisoner since he was in custody last March. I told the committing Magi<lb></lb>strate that I considered him insane—when he was charged before, he thanked me for my attention to him, and told me that he knew the Emperor of Russia and his brother, and all the Potentates of Europe, and he would better me, and take me out of the police; and that he was in communication with the secret police and the Queen—I called the attention of the Governor of the House of Correction to his state, to see if he was a fit object for a lunatic asylum—one of the turnkeys told me that he had on a straight jacket three parts of the time he was in prison.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BRIARLY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did they send him to an asylum? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think not; but he is decidedly deranged, as far as I can ascertain.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">Mr. Wright, the Deputy-governor of Newgate, stated that Mr. M'Murdo, the Surgeon of the Gaol, had seen him, and considered him sane</hi>).</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner, whose hands were restrained, addressed the Jury in broken English, stating that he was a political refugee of the Papal States; that he discovered a Papist conspiracy in London and Switzerland; and that at present he communicated to Government all conspiracies against Protestants; that the officers in the House of Correction sought to murder him by night; and that he was in his proper senses; that he had struck four officers, because they accused him of unnatural practices; and that if he was out of prison, his life was not in security, on account of the Catholics; that he was obliged to run all night through the streets, and never shut his eyes for twenty days; that he was at war with the Pope and the Jesuits, and wished to be sent to Hamburgh, where he would be in safety.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, H</hi> 16). I had him in custody on the previous occasion. I took him about half past 9 o'clock at night, and had charge of him for about two hours next morning at the police-court—I believe he was quite insane then—he talked so wild I could not understand him—it did not appear put on.</p>

I live with my uncle, Mr. Lyon, a watch-maker, in Camberwell New Road—on 3rd February, between 6 and 7 o'clock, the prisoner came in and asked to look at a watch; I showed him several—he went away, and came back and looked at another watch—I found him one at 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I wrapped it up, and he said he had only 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I let him have it for 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; he paid me with six shillings and two half-sovereigns</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker, of 39, Camberwell Road—on 3rd February I went into my shop, and saw some money on the counter—I said "Those are two bad half-sovereigns"—I gave them to the constable—I cannot swear to the prisoner, but I can swear that this watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was in my window that evening.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> It has been repaired, because the hands did not work, but it is the same watch—somebody had bought it, and paid a trifle on it as a deposit—the hands have been altered since—I do not know the number, as we do not always take the number of cheap watches, and this is a very cheap one, they only cost 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. wholesale.</p>

My father keeps the St. George Tavern, Lambeth Road—I remember serving the prisoner with a glass of stout—he gave me an Australian sovereign, and I gave him a half sovereign and the rest in silver and copper—I went to another part of the bar and saw him with his hands on the change—a man came in who wanted a light, and inquired for somebody—he had some conversation with me, which took my attention off the prisoner, who then pushed a half sovereign forward and wanted change for it—I tried it, and it would not go through—it was different in colour to the one I gave him—I called my father, who said to the prisoner "This game won't do here"—the prisoner said that it was the one I had given him—they searched him, but found nothing—the man who asked for a light leaned over the prisoner, but I could not see what the prisoner was doing at that time—a policeman then came in, and he was given in custody, with the bad half sovereign—the prisoner then took a watch and chain out of his pocket and put it on the engine.</p>

            . Please you, my Lord, I was at Newgate-Market buying some Fowls, on the 7th of December last, of a Saturday Morning, before it was well light. There were two Dozen and eight Fowls, and six Ducks. Whilst I was bargaining I felt something justle against me, and immediately I miss'd this Box, where there was a Guinea and a Half in Gold, and a Nine-shilling Piece in Gold. Turning short round about me, when I miss'd them, I saw a young Lad stand, and the Prisoner at the Bar; I clapp'd hold of the young Lad, and said, I had my Pocket pick'd, and cry'd out, Give me my Money, give me my Box: And the Lad said, he had none of my Money, nor my Box. I cry'd out again, Give me my Money, &amp;c. With that, the Lad, in a little Time, gave me my empty Box; and this young Man, the Prisoner, stood by him. I did not see him take the Money out, or know how he came by it.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the Boy?</p>
               <p>Marriot. He run away.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you else to say?</p>
               <p>Marriot. Nothing else, but I saw this young Lad, the Prisoner, stand by him at the same Time.</p>

            (to Peter M' Adam ) What have you to say?</p>
               <p>M' Adam. While this Woman was buying the Fowls I perceiv'd the Prisoner and another standing by me, near a Quarter of an Hour. When we had bargain'd, the Woman went to pay me; but she was in a very great Fright, and said, I am robb'd, I have lost my Money. I think they were then both standing by me; but when I look'd again they were both gone. Upon this I run five or six Yards through another Stall in Newgate-Market: I took the Prisoner in a Turning on the Right-Hand, while the other was running on the Left. I took him, and sat him down by me. I ask'd him several Questions; Who he was? and, Whence he came from? but he could give but a very indifferent Account. And in a Day or two he was had before an Alderman in Guildball; there he was question'd if he knew any thing of it? He denied it; he said he knew nothing of it. Afterwards, when we were coming out he said very wicked Words; that he would have an Eye upon our Blood, or Words to that Purpose.</p>

            . Please you, my Lord , I saw the Prisoner at the Bar, and another Lad, in the Market for near an Hour, walking about, the same Morning the Money was lost; they did not seem to have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174601170037"></xptr> any Business. I said to the next Neighbour, Take Care of your Pocket. I fear'd these Fellows were upon an ill Design: Accordingly some Time after this Woman, the Prosecutrix, cries out, Pick-Pocket. I saw the other run away, and this one, the Prisoner, following of him.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner said of this Evidence, he would hang any Body for the Sake of a Reward.</p>

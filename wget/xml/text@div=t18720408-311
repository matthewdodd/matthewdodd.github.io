                  </hi>. I am manager to Messrs. Moses, Son and Davis, of 101, Hubbard Lane, Cheapside, clothiers and mercers—Claridge was in their employ as a trimmer—on 6th February, about 10 o'clock, for reasons I had I called him into the counting-house—I asked what he had got about him—he hesitated for some few minutes, and then he took from out of his hat about a yard and a half of black Italian cloth—I then asked if he had anything more about him—he unbuttoned his waistcoat and from</p>

               <p>thence took about two yards of blue cloth—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the goods—I said "Good God, Alfred, did you forfeit character and Situation for a trifle like that? how long has this been going on?"—he replied "Only two or three weeks"—I asked what he had done with the things that he had taken—he said he had sold them—I asked who to—he said to a Mr. Fel<lb></lb>lowes—I asked the residence of this Mr. Fellowes, which he told me—he was then given into custody—he began to cry and begged forgiveness, not for himself, but for his wife and family—up to that time I was not aware that he was married—I afterwards went with the officers Green and Row<lb></lb>botham to Fellowes house—he keeps a little tailor's shop in Golden Lane, St. Luke's (he has also another shop at Notting Hill, which I was not then aware of), when we entered the shop Fellowes was there; there being two or three persons there, Green told him that he wanted to speak to him privately, upon which he asked us into the back-yard; Green then told him what he was and the nature of our business—he stood still for some time without answering—at last Green told him that he had Claridge in custody for stealing a lot of cloth from his employers, and he had every reason to believe from what Claridge had stated, that he had purchased them of him—he then said "Well, I suppose it is no use"—he then took us back into the shop and said "What do you want?"—Green said he wanted some blue cloth, or any other things that he had purchased of Claridge, upon which he com<lb></lb>menced routing about some pieces on a board, and produced a remnant of black cotton velvet, which I swore to the best of my belief was the pro<lb></lb>perty of my employers—Green said "Now then, we want some blue cloth which you purchased of Claridge "—upon that he took Green upstairs into the second floor, leaving me and the other officer in the shop—after some few minutes I was called up by Green, who showed me four lengths of blue cloth, which Fellowes acknowledged that he had purchased of Claridge, and asked me if I could recognise them—I immediately swore on examining them, to the best of my belief they were also the property of my employer—Green then told me to look about the room and see if I could see any<lb></lb>thing else that I could recognise—I searched about the room, there were lots of pieces of stuff strewed about in nooks and corners; it was more like a lumber room, and I picked out several pieces of black cloth, and black doe and other things, which I also swore to the best of my belief was the property of my employer, and which Fellowes said he had purchased of Claridge; I picked out and took away twenty-seven pieces of cloth, twelve pieces of velvet, four pieces of Alpaca, one piece of Russell cord, and a quantity of lining, which are now produced—they are in lengths that will cut garments—the value of them is about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I afterwards went to the other shop in James Street, Pottery Lane, Notting Hill, and there found property which I identified, and which the officers brought away—there were about fourteen or fifteen pieces of cloth and tweed, no velvet there.</p>

I am barmaid to my father, who keeps the Ticket Porter public-house, 5, Arthur Street West, City—about 7.30, on Saturday evening, 5th February, the prisoner came for a glass of six ale, and gave me a shilling—I put it in the till—there was only a two shilling piece and a half-crown there—I gave him change, a sixpence and 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—about ten minutes afterwards he asked for another glass of six ale, and put down another shilling—I saw it was bad, and told him so—he said it was not—I then went to the till and found the other one was bad also—I told him they were both bad—he said they were not; he had not given me any bad money—I told him if he would give me back the change I would not call a policeman; he would not, and he was given in charge—I marked the shillings, and gave them to the constable.</p>

               <p>the 9th of May I was at the Quebec's Head public-house—the prisoner came in—no words passed between us—he asked for a glass of gin, looked very hard at me, then came up to me, and said, "You b——, I will spoil your night's pleasure"—he did not do anything then—he walked up and down the bar, then pulled out his knife, looked at it, and accused me of taking a hand-kerchief—he asked me where his handkerchief was—I said, "I had nothing to do with it"—I wanted to have nothing to say to him, and told him to be off—he looked at his knife, then put it into his coat pocket, walked up and down before the bar; and in about five minutes after he took the knife out and threw it at me—it struck me on the top the forehead—I went out at the door, and called out "Murder!"—ran out at the door, and the police caught him</p>

               <p>my house, and asked if I had got a gig—he said he had had an accident, that his gig was broken, and he had left it at the Green-yard—he came with a servant and a very fine horse—I went with him to a shop of mine in Warwick-street—I showed him the gigs—he chose one—I assisted him to put the horse in—he and his servant drove away with it—he was to bring it home on the Monday, and to bring his gig to me to repair—he said the axletree was broken—I did not see him again till he was in custody—I found my gig a fortnight after, at Mr. Joseph Bardell's, in Gress-street, Rathbone-place—the prisoner had no authority to sell it or part with it—he was to bring me his gig to repair, and I was to build him a new one.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a livery-stable in Gress-street, Rathbone-place. About seven o'clock on Friday evening, the 21st of January, the prisoner came to my stable—I saw a chaise in the yard, and a youth with it—the prisoner was there—he asked if I would buy the gig or let him have 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it for a week—I said I did not want to buy it, I had got two or three, but I would lend him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it, but I would rather he had it at the end of the week, because I had no use for it—I was to have the gig at a price if he did not repay the money, but I was to use it all the time I had it—I had it three weeks or a month—Mr. Kempster claimed it, and it was delivered to him.</p>

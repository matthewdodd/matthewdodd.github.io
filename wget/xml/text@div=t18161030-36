At about a quarter before seven o'clock in the evening, of the 25th of September, I set out from my master's house, in Basket-alley, Angel-street, St. Mantin's Le Grand, with two hundred ounces weight of silver, to take to Mr. Bateman's. I took it to Mr. Bateman's, at No. 108, Bunhill Row. Mr. Bateman wished it to be taken back to my master's house, as there were two gentlemen with an order for it. I took it back towards my master's house, and in the middle of <placeName id="t18161030-36-crimeloc179">Monkwell-street</placeName>

I had seen him before he came up; I saw him at the top of the Alley where Mr. Bateman lived. I am sure he is the man; he took the bag out of my hand. I struggled to keep possession of it; he got it out of my possession at last. I was struggling with him full five minutes. The prisoner had his hands over my face. It was at last taken away from me by another man. The prisoner threw me down and then walked away. I raised an alarm; I could not tell in what direction the other man went. I cried stop that man. he is a thief, and the prisoner was stopped in Noble-street. I am quite sure he is the man.</p>

            . I am a fruiterer. I live in Noble-street. On hearing the cry, I stepped out of my own door, and saw the prisoner running. I saw no one else running but him, and the lad. I made up to him as he ran, and caught him by the right arm. He instantly fell, and whether it was from me, or whether he slipped. I don't know. Then the lad came up. I said, are you sure this is the man, and he said, "yes, I will swear to him." The boy did not say he had lost any thing. He said,"take him to my master's; that is the man." We took him to Mr. Clementson's. The boy said he held him round his eyes and mouth, and he could not see, nor call out. He said then that the bag of silver had been taken from him. The prisoner did not say the least.</p>

As I was coming from Thames-street, where I work, going to Aldersgate-street, I heard this boy sing out stop thief, and I ran after the people that were running, and got before them, and missed the man all of a sudden, and I ran up a street, the name of which. I do not rightly know, and I was 
stopped by that man. That is all I know.</p>

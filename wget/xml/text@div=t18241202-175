I saw the coat safe in the cart, which stood in the yard about three o'clock, and missed it about half past five. I was in my father's tap room, and saw the prisoner come out of the yard, and come into the room, he had not the coat with him then; when he had been gone about an hour, I missed it; he was quite a stranger to me.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's father-in-law, he was at my house on this day - I took the prisoner with the coat on his back, about a quarter past six that evening at a house out of the main road - I took him to the constable - I know the coat to be my son's, it has been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming out of this gentleman's house, and a man said to me "If you will take this coat to the Bird Cage public house, I'll give you 6 d.," the man's name was Turner, at whose house I was; he asked me to go in, and have a cup of tea - I had put the coat on because it rained.</p>
               <p>JEREMIAH CROSS re-examined. Q. Was the prisoner in the road to London? A. No; in a place quite out of the way to come to London; the man whose house he was at, was not at home.</p>

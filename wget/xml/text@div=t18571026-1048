                  </hi>. I live at No. 3, Oxford Arms Passage, and am carman to Mr. Pritchard. On 19th Sept., between 8 and 9 o'clock at night, I heard a noise in the passage of my house as I was coming down stairs; I stopped a few minutes to ascertain what it was—I came down and heard some one under the stairs, and stopped a minute and saw Williamson with a bag on his shoulder—I asked what it was; he said a bottle he had to carry to the docks, and he was too late for the docks—I did not feel satisfied with the story, and he took the bag and went on towards Paternoster Row—I followed him, and saw him meet Fletcher, and give the bottle off his shoulder on to Fletcher's shoulder, and Fletcher gave him four or five shillings in silver—I let Williamson go down Ave Maria Lane, and I followed Fletcher to the top of Cheapside, where I saw Policeman 428—I took him with me, and we followed Fletcher, and came up with him in Cannon Street—I gave him custody on suspicion of having stolen property—the policeman asked him what he had got, and he said stuff he brought from Blackfriars Road, and he had made it to fry fish with, and was going to take it to some person</p>

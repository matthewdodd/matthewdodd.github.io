The landlord of the house let the room to the prisoner at the bar. Soon after the landlord came and told me, my cloaths were all gone: he took up the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you leave your lodging?</p>
               <p>E. Harton. I had an account of it on the 15th of May, and I had not left my lodgings quite a week. I came to town on the 16th. The prisoner told me, if they were my things, they were in pawn with one Mr. Langford, and that they were given her by a companion of hers. I went with her to justice Welch, there the things were produced, all but the stone-buttons, handkerchiefs, petticoat, ruffles, and lace, which she would not own to, and deposed to by the prosecutrix. [ Produced by the pawnbroker's servant, who deposed the prisoner brought and pledged them at different times.]</p>
               <p>E. Harton. The prisoner owned she sold my necklace to a young woman for a shilling; that was brought to the justice's, and delivered to me.</p>

               <p>I know nothing at all of them, my husband gave them to me; and he has run away from me since, and I carried them to get some money upon them.</p>

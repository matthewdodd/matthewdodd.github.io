            . I live at Byster, in Oxfordshire. On the 7th of October, I sent some flats of butter to town by Hudson, the waggoner - they would arrive on the 9th; some of them were for Mr. Jennings - there were tickets on the flats. I have seen these tickets and flats since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were the tickets in the butter - A. There is always one inside the flat, and another outside; they correspond with the quantity of butter sent - they are put in by the dairy-man, whose writing I know. Cooper and Wilson belong to the butter sent for Jennings.</p>

            . I keep a wine-vaults, in Ivy-lane. I know the prisoners by sight, Willis was a porter, and Shaw was a jobbing porter. On the 9th of October, between five and six o'clock in the morning, I saw them at my house - they each brought in a flat. I do not know what they contained, but they were heavy - they had a quartern of gin. Shaw went away, and Willis said they wanted somebody to carry these two flats of butter up to the Pitt's Head, public-house, Old-street, and that he would meet the man there with them. Pashley came in, and I sent him with them to the Pitt's Head - the waggons unload in Ivy-lane,</p>

            . On the 9th of October, I accompanied Mr. Summers to the Pitt's Head, and found the butter in the passage, and Pashley there, and in about a minute I saw Shaw - I was concealed behind the door, and came forwards. The porter said to me,</p>
               <p>"That is him." I waited a little, and Willis came in. I then went out of the parlour, and said to them both</p>
               <p>"Do you belong to this butter?" they both denied knowing anything of it. I had the flats opened in their presence, and there were two notes in them, with Cooper's name on them, and the quanty contained in each flat.</p>
               <p>MR. BERESFORD. I was present before the Alderman, when the prisoner were examined. Mr. Payne, who is ill, took down what they said. I know his writing - my recollection enables me to say it is taken correct.

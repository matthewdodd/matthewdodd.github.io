On the 3d of July, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, Kelly and Brooks came in - Kelly tried on a pair of shoes, which fitted her, and she asked the price, which was 4 s. 6 d.; she offered me 3 s., which I refused, and both went away together. I immediately missed some shoes from the window; Brooks had stood close to the window - I sent my son after them. A pair of shoes were afterwards found on Tanian, and a pair on Kelly.</p>

            . I was present when Kelly and Brooks came into the shop. I noticed Brooks at the window, taking up shoes and looking at them, while Kelly was trying on a pair; they went out together, and I after them, and saw them turning up Ludgate-hill, towards St. Paul's, in company with Tanian, who I had not seen before - all three went into a door-way. I was on the opposite side, and saw Kelly or Brooks give Tanian something, which she put into her apron; they crossed over the way, and went into a haberdasher's shop. Tanian waited outside - they came out, joined her, and walked slowly towards Fleet-market. I ran up the Old Bailey for my brother, and we followed them to Fleet-market. Kelly and Brooks saw us, and walked rather fast down to the middle of the market. I followed them to their lodging, in Lilly-street, Saffron-hill, and got a constable, who took them both, and found a pair of shoes on Kelly. My brother took Tanian, and found a pair of shoes on her.</p>

Tanian came up, and she asked her to carry them home, and said she gave 3 s. 6 d. for them.</p>
               <p>BROOKS'S Defence. I was in distress. We came out of the shop and met this woman - I asked her to carry the shoes; she said she did not think she could, as she had two children to carry.</p>
               <p>TANIAN'S Defence. I met these two women in the market - Brooks said she had a pair of shoes for herself, and another for Kelly, and asked me to carry them while she went to another place. I had two children, and said I could not; she forced them into my apron, one pair fell out; they picked them up, and walked away. I told the officer where they lived.</p>

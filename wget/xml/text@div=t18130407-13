On the 19th of February, about ten o'clock in the evening, the prisoner and two women came into my house. There were two other women there at the time they came in. The two women were quarrelling with the two other that were there. I desired the prisoner and the two women to walk out. A gentleman came in. I begged his assistance in turning the prisoner out. I took hold of the prisoner's arm. One of the women that came in with the prisoner caught hold of me and twisted me round I caught hold of her arm and twisted her round, to get at the prisoner. She took off both her pattens to strike me, but was prevented by another woman. I took hold of the prisoner. He took hold of the seals of my watch, and cut the ribbon. I saw him do it. I did not see any thing by which he did it. I immediately felt, and found my seals were gone. I charged the gentleman not to let the prisoner out; he had cut my seals off. I sent to the watchhouse for the constable, and on the constable coming the seals were found on the ground. The men and the women appeared to be drunk.</p>

               <p>MR. WILLIAMS. I went into the house about a quarter past eleven. At that time there might be about a dozen women in the room. It appeared that one woman and the prisoner had a scuffle with the landlord. He in a moment turned round, and said to me, sir, secure the door, the villain has cut my seals off after the constable came. The seals were found and a knife under the bench.</p>
               <p>MR. KENDAL. I am one of the men that came in the house last. We were all very much in liquor together, and the young women were all in liquor. I only know we were all very drunk.</p>
               <p>- CRESWELL. I am a constable. I saw the prisoner sitting between two girls. I picked up the seals at one of the girls feet.</p>

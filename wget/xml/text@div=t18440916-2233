                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Stirling Castle, London-wall, in the parish of Allhallows, London-wall. On Saturday, the 31st of Aug. I closed my house exactly at twelve o'clock—I went to bed about twenty-five minutes to one—before I went to bed I looked into the bar and tap-room—I went down into the cellars to turn off the gas—I saw no person either in the bar, tap-room, or cellar—there are a pair of glass folding-doors at the foot of the stairs, inclosing the tap-room and bar from the other parts of the house—I locked those doors before I went to bed—I took the key with me—I did not leave any person up in the house after me—I came down next morning about two minutes past eight—I found the glass doors locked—I unlocked them myself—I saw a chair which was in the bar over night, in front of a door which leads out into the street—I went to the doors, tried them, and found them unbolted—they were fast the night before—I found all the doors in the bar open, and some cupboard-doors—I missed 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from the till—there was 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of farthings wrapped up in brown paper, with "5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. Farth<lb></lb>ings" written on the outside—there was 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and the rest in pence and halfpence—it is my usual practice to chalk on the till the amount in it—I had left the money safe when I went to bed—I missed from one of the drawers two silver teaspoons—I have seen some tops of spoons produced—I had half-a-dozen spoons of that kind, only two were left in the bar-drawer when I went to bed—these two tops of spoons I should say are mine, from a parti<lb></lb>cular mark, by the Hall mark—I have the other four here, which exactly correspond in pattern—I swear to these—I know the prisoner as an occa<lb></lb>sional customer at my house—he came to me on the Friday evening, in the tap-room, and asked me if I had any objection to trust him a pint of porter—I said, "No, you look an honest young man"—he came out again after<lb></lb>wards, and said would I have any objection to let it be 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and have another pot—I said, "No"—he said he would come on the Saturday and pay me—I did not see him on Saturday.</p>

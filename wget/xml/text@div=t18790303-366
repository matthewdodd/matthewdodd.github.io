                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Inspector A</hi>). On 17th February, about 3 p.m., I went with Inspector Parsons and two officers, Inward and Childs, to No. 7, Queen Street, Webber Street—Childs rapped gently at the door—the female prisoner opened it—Potter was sitting at a small table in front of the fire, almost facing the door—I walked in, and said "Is your name Potter!"—he said "Yes, that's my name"—I said "We are police officers, I suppose you are aware what we are here for"—he made no reply—I walked towards him and saw four sixpences on the mantelpiece—I said "Have you any bad money in the place?"—he said "No, I have none"—I said "What are those?" referring to the sixpences—he said "They are all right"—I moved a dirty towel on the table, and under it I saw a number of sixpences—I said "Halloa! what is this here?"—he rose from the chair and said "All right, you have got me; I may as well tell the truth"—I said "Is there any more?"—he replied "There is four or five shillings, I do not know which, on the sideboard cupboard"—I counted off the sixpences and said "Just see how many I have got here, 19"—he said "Yes; there was 20, one not so good as I should like; I threw it into the fire, where all the others would have gone if I had only known you had been coming"—the female prisoner then said "We are sold by some one; I'll round on them, I'll put them away; I'm no <hi rend="italic">lag</hi>" or "old <hi rend="italic">lag</hi>"—I suppose <hi rend="italic">lag</hi> means re<lb></lb>turned convict—Potter said "Keep your mouth closed, I'll speak to this gentleman"—on the table was also a basin containing sand and lampblack; I believe it was wet and similar to that on the sixpences, which were as though they had been done over with the black—it appeared like lampblack, grease, and sand—I also found a spoon and a knife on the table—in the fender were three clamps and an iron ladle, which had been in use, and metal was adhering to it—the female prisoner could see everything but the sixpences under the towel—I produce them—in the fender was also a quantity of plaster-of-Paris, which had evidently been used, and was broken up very fine—on the mantelpiece I found six Hanoverian medals—as the other officer handed some things out from the cupboard Potter said "There is a mould there I wish you would take for my defence; that is a mould for making spoons"—I asked him if he had any spoons made from it—he said "No."</p>

I wished I knew who had <hi rend="italic">rounded.</hi> If I had heard you knock at the door you would not have got in so easily"—I found this copper-wire and battery in the cupboard, and some of these bands, or clamps, and this metal of two different kinds—they are labelled—I gave them to Mr. Webster.</p>

            . As I was at work in a brick field, I heard a noise of men quarreling for upwards of a quarter of an hour; I left off work and went into the brick field where they were and went up within six yards of them; and there stood the Deceased, and the Prisoner came up to him; the Deceased said what is it you would have? And the Prisoner said what do you want with me, sirrah? What do you mean by abusing me in this manner? Upon that the deceased asked him if he would fight him: fight you, says the Prisoner, what should I fight you for? you fight me! Says the deceased, fight you, aye, but won't you take the Law of me? the Prisoner said to the deceased, I take the Law of you, what should I take the Law of you for? with that the deceased struck the Prisoner or struck at him - I can't tell whether he struck him, but he struck at him; - they had each of them sticks. (The stick the Prisoner had was produced, which was a small bamboo cane with a crook Ivory head, part of which was broke off.) After he had struck at the Prisoner, the Prisoner struck at him again; and after several blows had passed on both sides, the Prisoner laid hold of the deceased and threw him down with his face upon the ground; his face was very bloody and the blood run down very sadly between his Eyes. After he was down the Prisoner beat him with his stick several times, and broke his stick upon him. Then a person took him up, but the Prisoner being stronger than he drove him four or five yards, and he fell down flat upon his back in a cart rut; and then the Prisoner went to strike at him again, though I don't know that he struck him any more, but the deceased lay in a dismal condition; for I believe he was in liquor, and what between that and the blows he could not stir himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you observe the deceased turn from the Prisoner, and then the Prisoner follow him and strike at him.</p>
               <p>Smart. I did not see that - the deceased had the biggest stick.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you observe that when the deceased was down, the Prisoner continued to strike him over the back and reins?</p>
               <p>Smart. Yes, and I asked whether he was going to murder the man, and the people said the deceased began first; I said if he did begin first he ought not to be murdered.</p>
               <p>Sparham, Surgeon. On the 16 or 17 of May, I was sent for to the deceased, which was thirteen days, as I was informed, after he had received an injury by Mr. James the Quaker; there was a wound upon his nose, which upon searching I found was almost healed up by his own applications, and I found his under jaw contracted close; his swallowing prevented almost entirely; he could not go to stool and could hardly make water. I examined his head to see if he had received any wound there; there was no fracture, and I could not perceive any wound except that in his nose: I did something to relax the jaw and to make him evacuate; but in about three days he died: the upper part of the bone of the nose was bruised, upon which I put my probe into the outward membrane or covering of the bone, and the probe came through into the roof of his mouth, and by the simpathy between one membrane and another, this bruise occasioned the contraction of the jaw, so that it is my opinion the man died of a penury or a perfect starving.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know an instance of this nature before?</p>
               <p>Sparham. Yes, two or three times; but 'tis very rare, I saw it once in a carman; that such a contraction was occasioned by the bruise of one of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174409120019"></xptr> his fingers. It is my opinion this contraction occasioned the want of swallowing and going to stool, and that this contraction was occasioned by this blow.</p>
               <p>Jury. Mr. Sparham, if you had been sent for at first might not this have been prevented?</p>
               <p>Sparham. I believe if I had been sent for I should have laid it open, and that would have relieved the membrane. <rs id="t17440912-37-verdict197" type="verdictDescription">

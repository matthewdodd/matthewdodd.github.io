                  </hi>I am a baker, and live in Monmouth-street, St. Giles's. The prisoner was in my employ—I have lost three planes, which are here—they were taken from my bakehouse—I asked the prisoner about them, he said he knew nothing about them—I found them at Mrs. Wildman's—the is not here.</p>

About ten days—I have known him for several years—he has worked directly opposite to me—I have a lad besides him, and some lodgers—we have persons about our yard—the lodgers are about the yard, but not in the bakehouse—the water-closet is in the yard, not far from the bakehouse—persons to go to the water-closet pass a trap which opens for the men to go down to the water-closet.</p>

No—he said, "Go over into the next yard and fetch the planes you saw me throw over in the morning"—I went to the door and fetched them, brought them out myself, and took them to Mrs. Wildman's—my little brother was down in the cellar—a little boy went up stairs—I went into the yard myself and fetched them—I gave the boy 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he went up stairs and brought them down—I said nothing to him—I did not find them in the yard—he brought them down to me—I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for bringing them down—I did not say, "Where are the planes that were chucked over here this morning?

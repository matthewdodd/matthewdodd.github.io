                  </hi> I am a teacher of dancing and music, and live in Belgrave-mews East, Grosvenor-crescent. On 26th April, between one and two o'clock, I was standing at the corner of Grosvenor-erescent, and saw two men standing in Halkin-street, whom I had seen come out of the mews where I live—I saw one run through the Church or chapel-yard, at the top of Belgrave-mews, and whistle with his fingers—he then ran through a bit of waste ground at the back of the chapel—I walked a few paces, and saw him look up to the top of the house, No. 2. Grosvenor-crescent—I looked up, and saw the prisoner come out of the middle attic window into the gutter—I am sure he is the man—I saw him feel in his pockets—I spoke to a person coming by, and noticed him some time, I saw him go along the gutters to No. 3 and 4, and try to open the windows of both houses—I called, "Police!" and immediately I did so the shrunk down in the gutter, and hid himself—I told the policeman what was going on—he crossed over, and we saw him come out of the gutter, and run along the parapet to No. 9, and get in at window—I went and got another Policeman.</p>

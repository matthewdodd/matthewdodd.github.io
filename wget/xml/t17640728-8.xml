I gave the girl three guineas and 4 s. 8 d. the prisoner desired me to put it in a piece of paper. I delivered it to my child in her presence, and my child went with her, with the shoulder of veal: after that, the child came and told me the woman had taken it. I went to Justice Fielding's, and they took her dress and size in writing: after that, she was found at a bawdy-house door; I ran and took her with my own hands, about eight o'clock the same night: the robbery was about twelve in the day.</p>

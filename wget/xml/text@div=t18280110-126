On the 16th of November, about eleven o'clock at night, I took a hackney-coach in Holborn, and desired to be driven to Conduit-street; I had been dining with some friends in the City, and had drank a good deal of wine; I saw my property secure a short time before I got into the coach, and had no reason to believe I had lost it when I did get in; I had two 20l., four 10l., and two 5l.

I obtained the number of some of the notes at my banker's; I have since seen a 20l. note, No. 4056, and two 10l. notes - I do not know the dates of them. I believe I did not tell the coachman to go to any house in Conduit-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. So, as far as you are able to tell, if the notes had fallen from your pocket, the man would not have known where to bring them? A. No. I did not advertize them.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Is that memorandum in your hand-writing? A. Yes; the 20l. note was No. 4,056, dated the 19th of October, and, I presume, 1827; but we do not take the year, unless it is an old note.</p>

I was at the Boar's Head public-house, in Oxford on the 22d or 23d of November; the prisoner came in with another man, and said he had just come off the coach; he asked the landlady to change him a 20l. note, and she said she could not, but perhaps I would go to the Bank and get it changed, which I did, and gave him the change - I do not know that I saw him afterwards.</p>

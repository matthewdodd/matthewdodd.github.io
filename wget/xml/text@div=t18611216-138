                  </hi>. I live at 2, Denmark-street, Soho; and am a leather ease maker—on morning of 5th December, about 2 o'clock, I was on my way home, going through Broad-street, St. Giles—two men came up to me; the prisoner was one of them—they rushed upon me, and knocked me down—I thin'k I must have received the blow in my chest; I felt pain there afterwards—it was so sudden I believe it was with the fist—it must have been hard; it knocked me down—my hat was lost in the affray—it fell off the instant I was down—there were two pocket handkerchiefs in it—I had about 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my right-hand waistcoat pocket before this happened—when I was on the ground, the prisoner seized me by the throat instantly, and asked me if I had any money; I said, "No"—the other man was feeling about my waistcoat pocket in which I had the money—I struggled, and called "Police!" as well as I was able—the hard pressure on my throat by the prisoner, prevented me from calling out loudly—the handkerchiefs and hat were taken away as well as the 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—as soon as the policeman came up, they made off, and ran away in different directions—I was on my back when they ran away—the handkerchiefs were cotton ones; worth about 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. the two.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, F</hi> 18). I was on duty about 3 o'clock, on the morning of the 5th, in Broad-street, and heard a cry of "Police"—I stepped lightly across the road—I stooped down first and saw two men busily engaged in something; the prisoner was one of them—he was holding the prosecutor down—I am sure he is the man—I did not lose sight of him for a second, till I took him into custody—the other man was rifling the prose<lb></lb>cutor's pockets—I saw his hand in the right-hand pocket of his waistcoat—I got within four yards of them before they saw me; they then turned and saw me, and ran away—the other man went up George-street, and got away—the prisoner went up High-street—I called out, "Stop thief!" and sprang my rattle—I saw another constable coming towards me from the opposite side of the street, the prisoner was then going up High-street—I kept him in view; he ran into the passage of a house, previous to that he tell, which enabled me to gain upon him within a yard—I got up to him and almost put my hand upon him—when he got into a passage I turned my light on, and saw him trying to force a door open—I took him into custody there—I never lost sight of him for a single moment—on my way back, I saw the prosecutor coming towards me, with both hands upon his throat as if suffering, from pain—I had then got the prisoner with me—the prosecutor instantly recognised the prisoner, and said he had robbed him of a hat, two handkerchiefs, and 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I do not think the prisoner said anything at that time—when I had him in the dock and the charge was read, he said that the prosecutor had struck him first, and that he knocked him down—he also mentioned a woman—I saw no woman there—the prosecutor was drunk; he could stand; he walked with me to the station—we always understand when a man is worse for drink that he is drunk—he could walk alone.</p>

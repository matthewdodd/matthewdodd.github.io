                  </hi> I am servant to Mr. North, who keeps a licensed refreshment shop, at 119, Blackfriars Road—on the 16th Novem<lb></lb>ber, about 10.30, Miller came and asked if I had a bed for two, and how much it was—my sister said "A half-crown"—he said "I will go outside and fetch my friend," and brought back Brown—they both spoke English—next morning, at 9.30, I went into all the rooms, they were all right and I looked them all, except No. 5, in which the prisoners were—I called them, and they came down about 10.15—I passed them on the stairs, and they both said "Good morning"—they left directly—one had his coat buttoned up, and looked rather stout—I found all right in their room, but in the afternoon my master called me up to No. 6, and I missed a counterpane and three blankets from the bed, which were there when I fastened the door in the morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a licensed refreshment house in Black<lb></lb>friars Road—Keane brought these keys to my house, and I found one of them opened No. 6, the room which was robbed—the value of the property lost was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had no other lodgers that night—I did not see the prisoners.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoners' Statements before the Magistrate. Brown says</hi>:—"I went to sleep in that house, but I took nothing. We were not alone in the house; it was a public lodging, and there were other persons in it."<hi rend="italic">Miller says</hi>:—"It is quite true we were in the house, but we did not take anything. We went out in the presence of the young lady and the master and mistress of the house, and if we had anything on us they must have seen us. I account for the keys; each of us had one. We had permission of a friend who has gone to Belgium to sleep in his room, and, as we were not always together, we had each our key to go in."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Brown's Defence</hi>. We both had keys exactly similar, and if you desire to know where I had my key filed, the blacksmith lives in Old Compton Street. It is not an extraordinary thing that one key will open several doors; my key will do the same. There was plenty of time between 10 and 3 o'clock for people to take the things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Miller's Defence</hi>. Both keys were made for the same lock, and we each had one. The bit of candle found on my comrade was used to get up and down stairs of an evening. It is impossible that anybody could get out of a house with such a large parcel of linen without being seen. There was a man in the next room to us who got up twice or three times in the night.</p>

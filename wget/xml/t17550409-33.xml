               <p>Pardoe. He lives in Great-russel-street, Bloomsbury; these things were carried to the inn in order to go down into Wales. I set them down at the warehouse-door and went to look for the book-keeper; when I returned, the box was gone; I advertised the box on the Monday following, and on the Tuesday the prisoner was brought to the Yorkshire grey in Bloomsbury-market<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175504090033"></xptr> by Mr. Bunn, a pawnbroker; I was sent for there, there was the piece of silk and gown produced; I asked the prisoner how he came by them? he said he bought them in Covent-garden-market for sixteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear they are the same ?</p>
               <p>Pardoe. I can't be positive, but our housekeeper is here, she can.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them put into the box?</p>
               <p>Pardoe. I put in the seeds myself, and saw her put in the gown and silk, and I nailed and corded the box up. I went to Mr. Welch the high constable, he came and took the prisoner into custody, and carried him before justice Fielding, there he said before the justice he bought them in Covent garden; the justice asked him if any body saw him buy them? he said, no.</p>
               <p>Cross-examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say who took the goods away?</p>
               <p>Pardoe. I can't pretend to say who did?</p>

               <p>Pardoe. The pawnbroker did.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Houndsditch; on the 20th of January a Jew woman in our neighbourhood, that I knew brought me thirteen yards of blue Persian silk, and this blue tabby gown unmade, to pawn. I lent her a guinea on them; and about two hours after, I was reading the Daily Advertiser, and I saw an advertisement of a box, and some garden-seeds, and a gown, and thirteen yards of blue silk, lost from the George on Snow-hill; then I suspected this gown and silk to be the same. I sent for the woman that brought them; she said she had them of the prisoner's sister, then I sent for the prisoner, (he is a Jew, and lives in Houndsditch;) he came, and said he gave it to his sister, in order for her to pawn it, to make some money.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose custody has it been since?</p>
               <p>Bunn. It has been in mine ever since. ( The gown and thirteen yards of silk produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Q. to M. Dobson. Look at them, do you know them?</p>
               <p>M. Dobson. These are the same I saw before the justice; the gown I am certain to, and the other is the same both in quality and quantity.</p>
               <p>Bunn. I took the prisoner to the Yorkshire-grey, there he said he could not produce the person he bought the things of; but said he had an apron on, like a porter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Does not the prisoner deal in buying and selling old cloaths?</p>
               <p>Bunn. Yes, I believe he does; I know him no farther than by sight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go with you freely and voluntarily to the Yorkshire-grey?</p>
               <p>Bunn. He did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I am intirely innocent of what is laid against me; I am a young man that gets my living by buying and selling of cloaths; coming along, I call'd out, old cloaths! A man gave me a call; he took the gown from under his arm, and I bought them of him. He was a little higher than I am, and had on a brown coat.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175504090034"></xptr>E. Goburn. It was on a Monday, about eleven weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to see it?</p>
               <p>E. Goburn. I deal for China; a man offered it me to sell coming up Half-moon street by the church in Covent-garden; he had it in the lining wrapt up.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the man dressed?</p>
               <p>E. Goburn. He had a brown coat, with a cape to it. He asked me if I would buy a gown ? I said I would if I could. I looked at it; I said there was not a gown, there was but six breadths. He asked me a guinea; I offered him twelve shillings, after that thirteen; I thought I could not afford any more; I left him, and the prisoner came from towards Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you usually buy things in the street?</p>
               <p>E. Goburn. Yes, we frequently do. I looked back to see if the man would call me, and I saw the prisoner with the man, with the gown in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>E. Goburn. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What size man was he that offered it to you?</p>
               <p>E. Goburn. He was a little higher than the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he an apron on?</p>
               <p>E. Goburn. I did not mind that.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live ?</p>
               <p>E. Goburn. I live in Woolpack-alley, in Houndsditch.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner ?</p>
               <p>E. Goburn. I have known him some time; I never knew him for any ill.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be in Covent-garden at that time ?</p>
               <p>E. Goburn. I buy my china at the corner of Grocer's-alley, of Mr. Wood, and I had been there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner buy the gown?</p>
               <p>E. Goburn. I saw him put his hand into his pocket, and saw him wrap the gown in his handkerchief afterwards; but I would not take a false oath for a thousand or ten thousand guineas, I can't say what he gave for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him after this?</p>
               <p>E. Goburn. I met him on the Monday night in Rosemary-lane. I said I hope you have got a bargain, though you did buy it out of my hands. He said he had not sold it yet; and on the Wednesday I met his mother, and she said to me, you need not grudge my child it, for if I had bought it, I might have been where he is.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner fifteen or sixteen months; I am an old-cloaths-man sometimes, and sometimes I travel in the country with silver and hard-ware. When I went with old cloaths I met the prisoner every day almost, calling old cloaths. I know no harm of him.</p>

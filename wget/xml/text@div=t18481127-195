I am a confectioner, in partnership with John Boyd—the prisoner was in our employ, in the engine-house, adjoining the counting-house, from which I missed about 30lbs. of almonds—these produced are of the same sort—the prisoner had no authority to take them—I did not give him any.</p>

On 10th Nov., about seven o'clock, I was in Great Guildford-street, in plain elothes, and saw the prisoner and another about 200 yards from Mr. Duncan's—he put his hand into the top part of his <hi rend="italic">smock</hi>—I said, "What have you got there?"—he said, "What <hi rend="italic">odds</hi> is that to you? what I have got is my own"—I said, "I do not think it is"—he was working his fingers into the hole, and the almonds were running out of the bag—I said, "Where do you work?"—he said, "At Mr. Duncan's; what I have got, his boy <hi rend="italic">Sam</hi> gave me"—I said, "Who is <hi rend="italic">Sam?"</hi>—he said, "You come with me, I will show you where I got them"—I took him to the shop—Mrs. Duncan said they were stolen, she did not believe the partner's son gave them to him—the prisoner said he did—Mr. Duncan came—he begged not be locked up, and said it was his first offence—I took him to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner is my brother.

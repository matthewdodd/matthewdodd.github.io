             - A. Yes; I have been his apprentice two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your master lose any green baize on the 26th of April - A. Yes, about twenty minutes after six in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the shop was it lost from - A. It was standing up, inside of the shop, tied up with a string near the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the person take it - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you was informed that it was taken, how long before that had you seen it safe yourself - A. I had seen it safe ten minutes before it was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to learn that it was taken - A. Because the next witness brought it into the house; I knew it was my master's property by the marks.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the prisoner near your house that day - A. I had not; I served a man that came into the shop with two yards of tape at three halfpence a yard, that I believe to be connected with him.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot perhaps be certain of that - A. No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the man in custody when the baize was brought in - A. No, the baize was brought in before they took the man; it has been in our custody ever since; this is the baize that was at my master's door, with four more pieces; it has my master's hand writing on it.</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutor. What is the value of the baize - A. Five pounds is the lowest; it cost me six pounds nine shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM DEER. I am a carver and gilder, No. 9, York place, Banner street, Old St. Lukes. On the 26th<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010043"></xptr>of April, about twenty minutes after six in the evening, I saw the prisoner he had nothing with him; I saw him enter the shop of Mr. Croten in Drury lane; I saw him stoop near the door where the baize was, I saw several pieces by the door, what they were I do not pretend to say; he was stooping by the green baize, I watched him, I saw him cut the string, and take up two pieces of green baize; he crossed over the way from Mr. Croten's shop with the two pieces and he went into Clare court; I looked at him very hard and followed him. I called out stop thief several times. I was joined by several other people in the cry, upon my crying out stop thief; he ran when the report became general of stop thief; some one made a thrust at the prisoner as if to take him; immediately the baize fell from him on the ground; I picked up the green baize; the other people pursued him.</p>

               <p>Q. You was not present when he was secured - A. I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that he was the man that took the green baize - A. I looked upon him very hard, because I thought I should be called upon. I am quite positive he is the man; I brought up the baize and took it to the shop; he was not brought back while I was there; I saw him on Thursday the 28th following, in the evening, at Bow street; this was on the Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then recollect his person - A.Perfectly.</p>
               <p>Q. You staid no longer than to deliver the baize - A. No; I delivered it to the young lad in Mr. Croten's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he dressed then as he is now - A. No, he had a great coat on then.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure the green baize was within side of the shop - A. I am perfectly sure it was inside of the shop.</p>

            . I keep the Green Man public house, Bow street.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner on this 26th of April - A. Yes; I first saw him in Clare court, nearly opposite of the shop where the goods was taken from; I was taking to a friend in Clare court when I heard the cry of stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing with him when you heard the cry of stop thief - A. He had this bundle of green baize upon his shoulder: the prisoner was running; I fronted him as he was coming towards me, I attempted to stop him, he chucked the property at me; I followed him from Clare court into Wych street, he turned down Blackmoor street and into Drury lane, and at Astley's I saw he was getting the start of me, I called out stop thief; I never lost sight of him, he was stopped in my presence; I went up to him in a second after he was stopped; I am quite positive that he is the man that threw down the baize; when the man stopped him I saw him put his hand into his pocket and drew out his knife.</p>
               <p>Q.Had he time to open it - A. No, he had not time to open it; I seized his hand to prevent mischief; I secured him and brought him back to Clare court; they told me the shop where the property was taken from; then I took him to Bow street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you see the knife in my hand - A. I did; I laid hold of your thumb and wrenched it back; the knife fell and a boy picked it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I make any attempt with the knife - A. You did not, you might.</p>
               <p>Court to Deer. Did you see him open the door - A. He pushed the door open; the door went on a pulley I believe.</p>
               <p>Bird. The door we keep on a leaden pulley.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to character.</p>

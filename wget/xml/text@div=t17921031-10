               <p>On the 24th of September, about two o'clock, I saw the prisoner Gibson and the other come out from among some casks, where there was some copper and brass; I was adjoining the Custom House quay, and I saw the tall man, Mathers; he helped to lay the brass under Gibson's jacket; they attempted to cross the way; I followed them and asked what they were going to do with it; Gibson then let it fall, and Greenwood took him by the collar and brought him back to the place where he had taken the brass from; Mather got away; I am positive Gibson is the man, and I believe Mather to be the other.</p>

               <p>I saw the prisoner Mather assist Gibson in taking this brass out of the cask, and Gibson assisted Mather to put it under his jacket.</p>

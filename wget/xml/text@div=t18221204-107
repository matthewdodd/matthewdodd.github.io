            . On Tuesday, the 1st of October, the prisoner brought a shirt, waistcoat, two old silk handkerchiefs, and a pair of stockings, to be washed; my wife takes in washing; she washed them, and I saw them safe on Sunday, the 6th, at two o'clock, when I was at home. My wife and daughter were out; I fell asleep by the fire; the back-door was bolted, but there is a door leading from the shop to the bed-room. When I awoke, this linen, which I had seen on the bed was gone. I did not see the prisoner for ten days after; he then called, and said he was come for his things; my wife told him she had looked all over the house, and could not find them; he said he was very sorry, and if he had been in place, instead of out, he should not care about it; she said she must make it good; he said he wished to have it made up adequate to what was lost. The cloth was bought to make him a shirt, but he had that day a pair of stockings, a waistcoat, and white handkerchief of mine, and one of my shirts till they could make him one.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. I sent the shirt back, three or four days after - A. Yes, that was the shirt my wife lent him.</p>

            . My mother washed for the prisoner. On the 1st of October, he left these things to be washed by the following Saturday. They were pinned up ready for him on the bed, but he did not call. On the 6th, I went out; I saw the bundle safe on the bed, between two and three o'clock. I returned at nine, but did not think to look for it. On the Monday after the 6th, he came and desired to have them made good.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. When I came for my things, you asked which waistcoat it was that I lost - A. He only had this and a dark black striped one. He lodged the next door to us.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Are you sure No. 2, was the shirt he brought that day - A. Yes; he had No. 1 away the day before. My mother asked which waistcoat he had lost, as she did not exactly know; I did not recollect it at first, he only had two washing ones, and he had the black one away the day before.</p>

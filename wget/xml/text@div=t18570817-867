                  </hi>. The prisoner is my husband; we have been married twenty—two years. For some little time past we have not been living together—on the last day of last year I went to the theatre, and there met a person named William Forty; we conversed together, but merely con<lb></lb>cerning the performance, and after it was over he went to his home, and I to mine—I saw him several times afterwards, and on 7th or 8th March, I went to be his housekeeper—I ceased to live at his house on Tuesday, 14th July, and went to No. 2, Smith Street, Percival Street, Goswell Road—the prisoner came there on 20th July, about 9 o'clock in the morning, to see if I would give him some breakfast—he took my breakfast, my daugh<lb></lb>ter was having her breakfast, and I was going to a dispensary in Alders<lb></lb>gate</p>

               <p>Street—the prisoner came out and walked with me; on the way I called at Harley Street, Hoxton—the prisoner went into his own residence there, and afterwards went to the dispensary with me; I left him outside, waiting—I came to the door three or four times and saw him there, and when I came out the last time he was talking to William Forty—I went across and spoke to them—we then all walked together to the Angel public house; there was no quarreling going along—we went in, my husband sat next to me, and Forty next to him, the prisoner was between us—I had some half and half, and a biscuit, and Forty paid for it—Forty said to me, "You do not eat your biscuit;" my husband said, "She does not respect the giver, or else she would eat her biscuit"—another pot was called for; I asked the prisoner to pay for it, and he struck me on the face with his fist—Forty got up, and said, "If that is your game, George, I am off," and went out of the house—my husband followed him, and I went out and saw them in the road—I heard some person say, "Mind, he has got a knife"—I ran away, and my husband ran after me, he caught a slight hold, and I ran farther on—when I got to a tobacconist's shop I fell down, and the prisoner then struck me, once on the shoulder, and once on the back, with a dagger—I had often seen a white handled dagger in his possession at home—I bled a great deal, and was taken to St. Bartholomew's Hospital—my hus<lb></lb>band knew that I was at Forty's house; he has said that he would have money or revenge—he has repeatedly said that all he required was money, that he did not wish me to live with him; if he had money he would take a girl, and that was all he wanted, and I could live with he knew who.</p>

I think, before my husband was aware of it—I did not tell him where I was going; he ordered me and his daughters to pay him rent, or leave his house—we would not do so, and I took the apartment for my daughters—I lived with Forty as his wife, and was called Mrs. Forty by the lodgers—he asked his son how he liked his new mother-in-law, but he never called me his wife—my husband saw me during the three months I was living with Forty, but he did not know where I was lodging—I told him on this day that I had left Forty's house; I did not say that I would return home at the end of the week, when my time was up—I promised to see him again that day, and I met him; he left me in Goswell Street, and I came back and told him to go away, that a man was watching him—about half past 10 o'clock that night Forty came, and knocked at the street door, and I opened it—I had not told my husband that they did not know at Forty's where I had gone to—my husband struck Forty on his head, and made him bleed, and the police came, but Forty would not give him in charge—I told my husband that I was parted from Forty; I told him that on purpose to keep him from Forty, because he has threatened his life so many times—he had tried to get money from Forty; first 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and then 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and at last he came down to 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and if I had given him money I might have stayed—I knew that both my life and Forty's were to be sacrificed, unless 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid—I was at my husband's house each day—my husband</p>

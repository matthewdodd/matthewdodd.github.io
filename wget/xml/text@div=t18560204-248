                  </hi>. I am living at Mr. Sims' office, No. 45, Elgin<lb></lb>crescent, Paddington-road—Mr. Sims is my master. On 23rd Dec. he was repairing the house of Mr. Alexander Rea Thompson, in Paddington-road—I was pot in charge of the house, and of Mr. Thompson's goods—it was my business to sleep there—about 7 o'clock on the evening of 23rd Deo. I left that house by the front door—I shut the door, and fastened it with a spring lock—I went to my own house—I returned a little before 9 o'clock the same evening—I was very poorly, and I got another watchman—I returned with Jeffery, and on applying the key to the street door, I found it was fastened on the inside—I staid outside, and sent Jeffreys round to the back of the house—I heard him, when he was inside, call out, "<hi rend="italic">Sam</hi>, here is one; and I think there is another gone up stairs"—I said, "Open the door"—he opened the front door, and I saw the prisoner just behind the door; Jeffery had got hold of him, and he delivered him to me—the prisoner struggled very violently—Jeffery went to look over the house—I asked the prisoner how he came there—he said he had just come from Reading, and he came there for a night's lodging—I asked him how that hole came there—there was a hole cut through the brick wall, leading from the hall to the drawing room—it was large enough for a man to get through from the hall into the drawing room—he said it was not him—I searched him, and took from his pocket a chisel, and put it into my own coat pocket—I found a couple of little sash lines laid down close by him, and there was a jacket lying on the bricks where the hole had been cut—he said the jacket was not his—he afterwards asked me to let him put that jacket on—I then left him in custody of Jeffery, and I went over the house—I went into my bed room and found the things all strewed about the place—I</p>

About 9 o'clock at night, on 23rd Dec. the last witness called on me, and in consequence of what he said I went to the back part of Mr. Thompson's house—I found the window of the billiard room half open, sufficiently to admit the body of a man—I went through into the hall, and found the prisoner behind the door—he had two window blinds under his arm—I opened the front door, and gave him in charge of the last witness—on searching the house I found the prisoner's shoes in the billiard room—he afterwards put them on—he was taken to Mr. Sims's, and given into custody.</p>

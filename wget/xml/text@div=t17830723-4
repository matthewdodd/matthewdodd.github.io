               <p>I live at Paulin's and sometimes serve in the shop, I remember the three prisoners on Saturday the 21st of June, I came into the shop after I had dined, and found Mrs. Lillington serving these three people with black laces, knowing she had not dined I desired, her to go and leave them, and I would finish serving them, I shewed them several black laces in the drawers, the white laces still remained in the window by the counter, I shewed them several black laces and reached down others, and continued shewing, among which were these black laces.</p>
               <p>Prisoners Council. You did not know any more but this one? - But this one happened to lay upon the top and is a very particular one, and upon seeing the card I saw Mr. Coates's private number and mark upon the lace.</p>
               <p>Jury. Have you never seen any other lace of that same pattern? - I so seldom see any other lace but what I see in Mr. Coates's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230014"></xptr> shop, that I do not think I have; I served the prisoner King with a quantity of lace, which she told me was to trim a cloak; I told her it was 2 s. 7 d. a yard, but as it was a remnant, I let her have it for 2 s. 6 d. she paid me 15 s. they appeared to be in a very great hurry to be gone, it is usual to follow people to the door, I saw them either run or walk very fast up Tavistock court, the short one desired the tall one and the man to go to the coach, and she would soon follow after, and they all went up the court together, either walking or running very fast; I put by the laces after they were gone, I came and spoke to Miss Lillington, who had before served them, I thought they were strange people, because they called me my dear, in a very sociable way, the man did; I did not trouble myself any more, I put the laces by as soon as we found they were lost, I went and took the drawer out, which had not been taken out since; as Mr. Coates was out, he heard such people had been taken up, and upon looking at the laces, he knew they were ours, but sent us to look at them, I went to look at them, it was two or three hours after I saw them at the Round-house; Mr. Hemmings, the Round-house keeper, shewed them to me, I believe the prisoners were taken away then: I kept the laces ever since, they are the same.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. You do not know whether there are not several laces of the same pattern? - There may.</p>
               <p>You do not mean to say, that is the only pattern in London? - No, I know the mark upon the card: we do not usually sell a card.</p>
               <p>Suppose there were half a dozen yards, she takes away the card, does not she? - We do not usually do so.</p>
               <p>You lay no store by your cards? - Certainly not, but we do seldom give things that are marked.</p>
               <p>Other goods may go on that same card with the mark on it? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Jury. Does the mark on the card corroborate with the mark that you sell by? - Yes, Sir, it is the mark we sell by.</p>
               <p>Council for Prosecution. That card would not do for a different lace? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Prisoners Council. But, if I buy lace I may have a card with it? - Yes, there is a seal at the end of every card, till it is cut, and several of these laces were uncut, and have the seal on, and the number of yards on the piece which answer to it.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt about these being Mr. Paulin's laces? - Not in the least.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. These laces were delivered to you by another person? - Yes, Sir, by Hemmings, (the laces deposed to by Mr. Coates) three of them are marked with my own hand-writing, the other by one of my people that I know, I saw them after they were lost at the Round-house, I was told there was some laces taken out of the necessary; I went immediately to the master of the Round-house, and had an Order for them to be taken out, they were very filthy at the time I saw them, the master of the Round-house shewed them to me.</p>
               <p>To Branch. Look at the quantities, and tell me the value of the whole? - Twenty-one yards of black lace, and thirty-one yards that has been put in water, and marked 5 s. 3 d. per yard, that is the selling price; the next is marked upon the card 27 yards, that is a little shrunk, put down 26, the selling price of this is 4 s; the white is shrunk from 15 to 14. about 3 s. 4 d. the selling price of the other is 15 yards, at 5 s.</p>

               <p>Were they altogether or separate? - They were separate, I drew them out separate.</p>
               <p>Prisoners Council. There was a great many people, as I un derstand, round? - I did not see so many as half a dozen in the back apartments.</p>
               <p>The door of this necessary was not locked? - No.</p>
               <p>Any body might have access to it? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Mr. HEMMINGS sworn.</p>
               <p>You are master of this Round-house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long was it after Hill had been at the privy a second time, that this place was searched? - I cannot tell the time, I was very busy at the door, letting people in and out.</p>
               <p>How long were they there altogether in the whole? - I believe they might be there an hour, they came in about half after four, and they went to the Justices about six; there were a number of people came in and out; some to see whether they knew them, and some had business there.</p>
               <p>Had you any other prisoners? - Only these three during any part of the time.</p>
               <p>How many people had you that came in and came out that were not prisoners? - A great many.</p>
               <p>Had they all access to the necessary? - No.</p>
               <p>It is not locked? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did these women desire to be searched when they first came in? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>What do you think? - I was so busy, I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Did you remember hearing that they desired to be searched? - I do not indeed.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230016"></xptr>Jury. Might any body else go to the privy besides the prisoners? - Yes, they go from the watch-room into the parlour, and into the yard, there were a great many people in that very room.</p>
               <p>Did any body go into the yard besides these women before the privy was searched.</p>
               <p>When I understood what it was for, I immediately went back into the parlour, and found the prisoner missing, and I saw my daughter stand at the necessary door and I was vexed, and she said, she could not come yet, she was very bad.</p>
               <p>How do you know nobody else went there during that hour and a half? - When they had taken care of the door, and people were pretty tolerable quiet, hearing it was for shop lifting, I went backwards and missed the woman, I was vexed, and said, ten to one if there is not some of the property down the necessary, I saw my daughter at the door, and I wanted the woman out, she told me then, she was so bad that she could not come, she went as I understood a second time, then I went with Mr. Wallis, and I brought her out myself.</p>
               <p>Prisoners Council. How do you know during the hour and a half, who went to that necessary? - I do not know who else might go.</p>
               <p>Which woman did you miss? - Mrs. Hill.</p>

            . To my knowledge nobody went but the prisoner; I was out of one room into the other, I had a view of the yard out of each room, and if anybody had gone they must have gone thro' one of these rooms.</p>
               <p>Prisoners Council to Wallis. Do you recollect the people desiring to be searched? - Hill desired to go to the house to be searched, but refused going to Proctor's, that was immediately when she was stopped, before she went to the Watch-house.</p>

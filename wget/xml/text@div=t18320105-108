I first saw the prisoner about the 27th of September, when he came with a customer of mine, and from what passed between them I supposed they were on friendly terms; the prisoner called a day or two after, and looked at a brooch which he had seen before, and asked me to let him take it to show a lady, a friend of his wife's, which I did - he returned in a day or two, and said the lady would keep it, and if she did not pay for it he would; he did not give her name - on the 5th or 6th of October he called to look at some gold chains, and chose one; he said he would take it to show his wife, and if she approved of it he would call and give me a cheque for it in a few days - as he did not call, I sent my boy to No. 20, Finsbury-place, where he lodged; he was not found there - Heaton afterwards brought the chain to my shop, but I did not see the prisoner again till he was in custody; the price was mentioned to him, but I merely lent it to him to show his wife - it was worth 7l.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I came to look at a brooch with Mr. Thurnell. Witness. You bought one of my shopman - it was never paid for; it is entered in the book, but the chain I merely delivered to be shown - I mentioned the price as nine guineas, but you never said you would keep it; I believe you were to return it that night, or next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. But if it was approved of, you were to charge it to me? A. No - I could not tell whether you would keep it till you called to tell me; I called about the 9th of October, and found you had left your lodgings.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not, on my discharge from the Mansion-house, give you an order on a lady to receive some duplicate? A. Yes, this was one of them.</p>

Mr. Woodhill said, "If you, or any body, will come forward and pay for the goods, I will not appear at the Mansion-house."</p>

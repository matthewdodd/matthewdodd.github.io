                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">the Prisoner</hi>). I have pleaded guilty to this indictment—I have been a travelling draper nine years—I purchased the business of Mr. Hands—I have known Walter Thompson fourteen or fifteen years, and the others nine or ten years—I saw them at the time the composition deed was proved in 1874—I bought for Edward Thompson, first in October and November, 1874, and went on doing so till March and April, 1875—they were fancy goods and heavy goods—I bought them from Walker and Johnson, of Manchester, and Rotheram, and Caldecotts, and other houses—Edward was then carrying on business in Newington Causeway—I recollect his liquidation in 1875—after that I bought things for Walter—that commenced about May, 1875—I bought silks, calico sheetings, and kid gloves, and went on buying for Walter till September, 1875—he had the goods sent to my place at Hoddesden, and I sent them up to him by Stanningford and by Mace, carriers—they were sent to the booking office—I sometimes sent them by carrier, sometimes by Page, and sometimes I took them myself—goods were sent in my name to the Liverpool Street booking office—Walter used to go with me and fetch them away himself—Edward has also done so, but not for goods ordered by Walter, only for those ordered by himself—on 18th February, 1876, I bought some silks from Rotheram's, and on the 19th February some silks from Hitchcock and Williams, and on 19th and 21st of February some other things from Cal<lb></lb>decott's—I got invoices from Rotheram and sent them to Walter Thompson—I do not know whether by post or with the goods—I bought some goods at the London Warehouse Company on 15th February for Walter Thompson—he gave me orders to buy all the goods I have mentioned and also for some which I bought of Taplin and some of Kynaston and Son, on 18th February, and some of Hitchcock and Williams on 21st February—all those goods were sent to Walter Thompson; some by Page and some I took myself—those which Page took were packed, but what I took were un<lb></lb>packed—I took them in my four-wheel van—I took them the next day after I received them—I always did so as quick as I could—Walter's address was West House, West Green, Tottenham—that was his private house—his place of business was 61, Paternoster Row—he and Alfred lived together at West Green—I do not know whether it is their mother's house—this invoice (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) represents part of some goods I boug it from the London Warehouse Company in February—this other invoice, marked T 1, is a similar invoice as regards Taplin, and here is another as regards Ky<lb></lb>naston, another of Rotheram's, two of Caldecott's, and two of Hitchcock and Williams—all those goods were forwarded to Walter Thompson—I afterwards asked him about them—he said he had got them all right, and they suited very well—he did not pay me for them, but I paid Dent and Allcroft—I made out no invoice to Thompson, nor did I charge him in any</p>

               <p>"You bad better file a petition and we will find the money and get you out"—that was because persons had distrained; they went with me to Mr. Benton, Mr. Pary's managing clerk, and said that I was in difficulties, they had brought me there, and the best thing that I could do was to file a peti<lb></lb>tion in bankruptcy—I consented to do so, and they said they would see me out of it—we all went together to Benton's—they suggested that I should pay 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—I said "What is the use of that as I have no money"—they both said, "We will find it for you"—I made a statement of my affairs for the purpose of my petition—they told me to get all the creditors I possibly could—they said I must get a majority of the creditors in my favour to oarry the composition that would be offered—I left myself entirely in their hands—they said that that was the best thing I could do—this paper (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) was drawn up about the same time, at Mr. Benton's—I believe Walter Thompson was present—I do not know whose writing it is—it is a statement of the names and addresses of my creditors—some of those are persons to whom I did not owe money—Herbert Hunt is one of the false names—it is untrue that I owed him 340<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I did not owe him a halfpenny—I did not put his name down—I owed Alfred Thompson about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for horse hire—that amount is exaggerated into 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not put down Butt 48<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or Edward Thompson 78<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not owe them anything—this little slip of paper marked N 15 was written by Edward Thompson one day when I was at the warehouse talking about the cigar cases and pictures—he reckoned them up and said "I will find the money, you put that in your pocket," and when I got home I found he had put down anything but the right prices—the total is 58<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the cigar cases came to 72<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—here is Gage 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Iowed that, but this Challoner 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I did not owe—I put that down myself—I borrowed the money in my wife's presence and gave it back—neither of the prisoners were there, but they told me to get all the creditors I possibly could—Mrs. Challoner gave me this money; I pat it on the table and she took it up again, and, I gave her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for interest—that was Dot my invention, it was both of the Thompsons—they told me to get all the creditors I could, and I thought of Mrs. Challoner—they said "Never mind who they are so long as we can put their names down"—they said that they had a large majority in my favour, but they did not tell me who they made creditors—when I told the prisoners what I had done with Mrs. Challoner, they were very pleased—they said everything would be right and we had a majority in our favour—here is Baggallay, 48<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I did not owe him anything, I did not authorise that—here is Onslow, 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I did not owe him anything, or authorise anybody to put him down—on the day of the meeting of the creditors, I saw all three of the prisoners at Mr. Parry's office, and Walter and Alfred were present at the meeting—I made an offer of 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound, which was not accepted—Mr. Levering wanted me to give a statement of sixteen creditors of over 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, and I went into a private room where Alfred and Walter were and told them so, and Walter suggested that I should put down anybody, and I think I put down four; I cannot say now who they were—I said that 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was not likely to be accepted, and Walter said "offer 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I did offer 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but it was not accepted—Alfred was in the private room, the next room to where the meeting was; he did not attend the meeting—this was at 28, Basinghall Street—this letter is in Walter Thompson's writing, "Messrs. Kynaston and Co. Gentlemen,—I only returned home this evening, and am very sorry I forgot to make a note of your bill. I shall be up on Monday to pay it. William North"</p>

               <p>—a copy of that letter was sent to me at Romford by Walter for me to write to Kynaston's; it was a sort of form for me to copy—this other letter is in Walter's writing; it is to W. Hitchcock and Co. to the same effect—I copied it and sent the letter—Walter knew where I was, because he had lists where I should be from one time to another—this other letter is in Edward's writing; this is a request to the picture dealer to frame six pictures as soon as possible, when they would be sent for—I did not serf for any more pictures; I told Edward he had better pay for the others first—I made up my statement of debts to 2,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I owe nothing to any<lb></lb>body except the wholesale houses, and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Walter Thompson—out of this 219<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to Hitchcock and Co. there might be 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for myself, or not so much, and the rest is Walter Thompson's—I do not think I owe any of Taplin's account, or of Caldecott's 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that is all for the Thompsons—30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of the 153<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due to Parsons may be mine, the rest is Walter Thomp<lb></lb>son's—out of the 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Cook and Son 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. may be mine.

I should say—I will swear I do not owe more than 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for these transactions—neither of them told me what had become of the goods I bought for Walter and Edward, and I never knew—this I O U is in Edward Thompson's writing.

I owed the Thompsons—I did not in November, 1876, apply to Mr. De Chastelaine for an advance of money, I always used to meet Walter and De Chastelaine together—I applied to Walter—if any money was to be paid away I went there for it—I don't remember applying to him for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as an advance from De Chastelaine in November, 1875, I won't swear I did not; I won't swear anything about it—I did not see Mr. De Chastelaine's brother—I swear I did not apply for money—I was to pay their debts, I don't know the amounts; I don't know what I have had; I have had several sums to pay for their goods that I bought for them—I did not receive 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from De Chastelaine for myself; I never applied for such a thing—I did not send 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods as a deposit for the money—I did not give a bill of exchange to De Chastelaine for the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I swear that; I never owed him anything—they always paid for the goods, except this last lot, that was left owing to the Thompsons, and remained when Mr. Hands took the business, he took the debt and I paid it to him—I bought the goods for the Thomp<lb></lb>sons; I was debited by the wholesale houses, they looked to me and Hooked. to the Thompsons; I say that I owe about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and they owe the rest of the 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd; they always promised to pay—I did not deposit the goods with them for advances of money—Walter sent me a copy of a letter to write fur Alfred to get money; I wrote it and sent it, this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); it was their own proposition, the money was not for me, it was for them to pay their debts—I speak in that letter of De Chastelaine owing me money for goods I had sent to him; I never had sent him any, it was a lie, Walter asked me to do it; I did it because they promised to get me out of the difficulties they had got me in—I said in one of my letters that my wife was going to the trustee, that was because they would not come near me to assist me in any way; it was not a threat to get money out of them, merely for them to come and see me and arrange matters, because they promised to pay—I said I should tell Mr. Loveriug the whole truth, where the goods had gone to and where the money was—I could not file a debtor and creditor account—I did not borrow 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Walter; I never borrowed 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of him—I got one of his brother's cheques from him for 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not apply to him for an advance of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he did not give me a cheque for 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., deducting interest—there were three bills to meet, and he gave me a cheque and I got the money and gave it to him—I paid 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think, to Hitchcocks—I don't</p>

I live at 11, Devonshire Place, Brighton—I have known the three Thompsons for some years and North about two years—he was introduced to me by Edward Thompson, if you call it introducing—I have seen him at their place in the Causeway—Edward Thompson carried on business at 29, Paternoster Square—I know 61, Paternoster Row—I have seen the name of De Chastelaine on the door there—I think I have seen Walter there once—I did not know that he was manager for De Chastelaine—Alfred carried on business at 15, Monkwell Street; his name was on the door—Listers carried on business at 4a, Cripplegate Buildings—Hunt was their London representative—I have seen the Thompsons at all those ad<lb></lb>dresses, Edward and Arthur more or less—I have only seen Alfred at Mr. Hunt's place and at his own place Monkwell Street—in March, 1876, Edward spoke to me about buying some oleographs—North was present—Edward said that North could buy some, he did not say for what purpose—North said he had a horse and van and he was going round the country and might sell them to hotel-keepers where ho was staying—I offered to take North on to Mr. Caro's to introduce him and select them—I had been with Edward</p>

I am clerk to Bilton and Powell, in Great Russell Street—in March, 1876, I was out of employment, and whilst so I got employ<lb></lb>ment from Edward Thompson to look after the warehouse at 29, Paternoster Square—the name of "A. Thompson and Co." was on the facia—Alfred Thompson used to come there, and Edward, and Walter sometimes, not regularly—I saw Walter there, perhaps once or twice a week, and Edward every day; Alfred not so often, perhaps once or twice a week—whilst I was there I re<lb></lb>collect the house at Monkwell Street being opened—I used not to be there, but I have, called there frequently—I saw Alfred and Walter there; the name of A. Thompson was up there, I believe—I believe I have sent there for goods that were delivered at Paternoster Square—I believe there was a parcel came in the name of Bass and I think I have an idea of sending it back again; there was no such name there; I did not sign for it to my re<lb></lb>collection; I know nothing about it, except what I have been told; I was not told anything about it by either of the three prisoners—there was no one named Bass at the place—I recollect a piece of card being given to me in March or April, 1876, either by Edward or North, I do not know which—I hired a cart or van and the goods were brought to Paternoster Square—they were pictures from Caro's, thirty-two I think, like those produced—they stayed there some time, and they were hung up round the warehouse—after that some Mr. North had, and some Mr. Edward had at his private house, I think North had four; twelve were sold by Mr. Edward—I was in charge of</p>

I am a draper's stocktaker and draper's valuer—I have been in the habit of buying drapery stock for the last nine years—I reside at 26, Park Street, Cainberwell—I know the three Thompsons—in 1874 I was in possession of the premises and stock of Walter and Edward, at Newington Causeway—I could not say the exact date at which I saw Walter Thompson in reference to some goods; I have seen him so many times in reference to goods—I think I bought a stock of him about February, 1876; at least I bought a stock of De Chastelaine about that time—that was at the time I was with De Chastelaine—he showed me some stock—that was at Paternoster <hi rend="italic">Row</hi>—it was in the early part of 1876, I could not say whether in February or March—they were new goods, but they were out of the wrappers and in a very confused state—Walter asked me to make an offer for the stock—I said I must make an abstract of it and see what it consisted of, and divide it into compartments—I made out a stock sheet and he called it over—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my writing, with the exception of the blue ink writing at the top and the pencil marks in the body—I took an account of the stock—I gave my prices and I made him an offer for the whole—I almost forget what it was; I think it was something like 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he refused; my offer was not good enough—I saw him a few days afterwards and he said he sold it at a better price to Roberts, of Islington—at that time the silk market was in a very uncertain state—you could buy goods at all sorts of prices—these were plain goods, most of them—I cannot say that two or three days would make much difference in the price—it is the difference of a man's opinion upon them—in June, 1876, I again saw Walter Thompson about some stock—I buy for Davis, of Hull—I do not know that I bought any goods of him on account of Davis, in June—I think I bought of Edward a parcel, but I am not quite positive as to the dates unless I see the documents—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) refers to a parcel I bought from Edward at Paternoster Row, in Juno, I</p>

I was aware that Edward Thompson was carrying on business at Paternoster Square—about February or March I remember going and seeing the stock there—previously to buying the stock I sent portions of the samples to Davis of Hull—taking it as a whole I should call it a very job lot—there was a small bit of calico amongst it, 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—all sorts of odds and ends—there was some good stuff as well as some rubbish—I had to take 75 off—there is nothing unusual in purchasing a job lot with good calico amongst it, or something of the sort—it is a thing very often done to give it a respectable appearance; to give you something that you can sell—that was the only transaction I ever had with Edward, except buying some umbrellas once for Watts, of Liver<lb></lb>pool, for about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe he had bought them at a public auction; at least, he told me they were bought at Burton's, at Ludgate Hill—they could not have come from a wholesale house, because they were damaged goods—I think it was in July that I bought them—there is nothing unnsual in the sale of job lots of drapery to a large extent—we know that wholesale houses offer goods at extra discounts off—I took 20 per cent, discount off the calicoes—if you bought them in the ordinary way you would have five months' credit—this was ready money—there are a variety of discounts; the average is from about 47 to 49 1/2.</p>

Thompson"—I refused to do business with him again in consequence of the doubtful aspect of the transaction; that was because there was no proper invoice sent with the goods; the goods had been delivered at that time, they were on the premises and I had agreed to buy them—I might have sent them back and I blamed myself very much for not doing it—I did not observe that the name was not properly spelt; I swear that Walter wrote it—I can't tell whether anybody <hi rend="italic">else</hi> saw him write it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a draper, of Ashford, Kent—I know the three Thompsons—I had business with W. Thompson about November, 1875—he represented himself as commercial traveller for Mr. De Chastelaine, of Paternoster Row—about 27th April I bought some goods of him most likely at Monkwell Street—I gave him this cheque for 115<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. deducting two and a half percent.; it is dated 17th May, 1876, payable to A. Thompson, or order, and it came back endorsed A. Thompson—the invoice is headed "Bought of Alfred Thompson"—I bought alt the goods in the invoice except the hose which were sent on approbation—I selected them at Monkwell Street; Walter Thompson was present—I have been there occasionally and seen Alfred there—the goods in this invoice marked "5 L" I bought in March of Walter Thompson at 61, Paternoster Row, in the name of De Chastelaine—I may have seen De Chastelaine about it, but Thompson was the man I did business with—these are some of the invoices sent to me from Pater<lb></lb>noster Row, they are all in De Chastelaine's name—he never explained his being at Paternoster Row and also at Monkwell Street, he hardly commenced at Monkwell Street till De Chastelaine called in 1876, and then Thompson appeared—De Chastelaine's transactions were all in March; I paid for them by this cheque for 135<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it is payable to Edward De Chastelaine—Alfred Thomson came to Ashford once after some money for some goods sold by Walter—this cheque does not correspond with any particular invoice—I do not know whether it takes in several—it is endorsed by De Chastelaine.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been managing clerk to Mr. Parry, of Basinghall Street, up to the last <hi rend="italic">few</hi> days—North was introduced to the office by Walter and Edward Thompson, at the end of 1874, or the beginning of 1875—I attended to the proceedings in North's bankruptcy, he con<lb></lb>sulted me in July—I think Edward Thompson was present the first tune—North had an execution in his house, I believe it was by Dent and Alcroft, and we were at that time seeing him for Mr. Bult, on two bills of exchange—if I recollect rightly he had heard something about a private meeting of his creditors, and he did not know what to do; I suggested that he should call a meeting of his creditors—I think Edward Thompson was present—I then went down to Hertford and filed a petition—on this list of creditors on the first page, nearly all the figures are in my writing, and No. 10, 11,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170132"></xptr>
               <p>and 12 are names of creditors Caro, Blunt, and Downing—the rest is written by Mr. James Walham—I got the information to write down, from a list; I cannot say who gave it to me, though I have thought a good deal about it for the last three months—I am quite certain Mr. Alfred did not give it to me, but I will not say whether Edward, Walter, or North did, it is utterly impossible; I was very much engaged at the time with the two Thompsons in a Chancery suit, and it was done in a hurry—nobody but the Thompsons took an interest in North's affairs—before the. first meeting of creditors there was a conference between us as to what offer would be likely to be accepted, and what offer North could make, he told us that he had 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of book debts good and bad, and no stock or other effects or furni<lb></lb>ture—Edward and Walter Thompson promised to assist him in paying the first composition proposed, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound; 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was first talked of, but they said they did not think it likely to be accepted, and that they endea<lb></lb>vours to get Mr. Hands, who they had just made friends with to secure the other—this proof of Alfred Thompson's is my writing, it was sworn before Mr. Parry at his office—I understood that it was partly for horse hire, and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. damage to a horse by hard work, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for some goods—four bills were given to me, but not as Hunt describes—before the first meeting of creditors Hunt came with Edward Thompson, the meeting was at 11 o'clock: Walter and North were in the office at the same time, and I think I prepared Alfred's proof—I cannot say at this length of time who produced Hunt's bills, but I know they were all complete when they came into my possession—I looked at them casually and gave them to Mr. Walham, who made out Hunt's proof, and had the four bills, and the proxy for Mr. Parry, but I did not produce them, because Mr. Lovering and Mr. Mason held a large amount of proxies and any I held would have had no effect—Mr. Hunt was in very great trouble, bankruptcy proceedings were taken out against him, and he was in hot water till the time of his conviction, he was afraid he would have to make a clear breast of it; he consulted me, and I advised him that all unnecessary papers should be destroyed, and they were torn up by him in my office and by nobody else—at that time I was not aware of what was taking place—there was no dividend and nothing to receive—it is not my habit as a solicitor to consider bills and things of that sort as unnecessary documents, but Hunt told me that the money was not owing to him—I thought he had better tear up the bills, and the less said about the trans<lb></lb>actions the better.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You, knowing that it was a fraudulent transaction, recommended Hunt to destroy the evidence of it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You must not take it in that way—I had known him a long time, he was in very great trouble, and I did not think it necessary for him to get into further trouble; I did not advise him to destroy the evidence of a fraud, he had never proved, and he said that the money was not owing—as far as I can remember, there were three 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bills and one 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this first item, Herbert Hunt, 340<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., was, I think, 240<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. ori<lb></lb>ginally and has been altered; that was made out in liquidation; I cannot throw any light upon it, as the three bills only amounted to 240<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the four bills were not all together when the proof was made out, the list was filed on 3rd August and the meeting was not till the 29th—Hunt is the drawer of the bills, and I understand that they are in his writing—North is the acceptor—we went into a private room and North was asked to put down the names of six debtors to his estate owing over 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the offer of 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound was refused at a moment's notice and he went into a little room at</p>

On 2nd May, I went to Tottenham, and saw Walter Thompson on the way to the railway station about 10 o'clock—I told him I was a detective officer, and should have to take him into custody on a charge of conspiracy between him and his' brothers and other persons to. defraud various persons in the City—he asked me for my warrant—I showed him my card as a detective, and explained that I had not a warrant—he asked to be allowed to go home—I told him he could not—I took him to the Moor Lane station where the warrant was read to him—he said at the railway station that he thought a summons might have answered the purpose—I searched and found on him two duplicates for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., two deposit notes for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

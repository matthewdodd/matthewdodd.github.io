I took hold of him, when he put his hands into his pocket, and said I did not cut the glass: I said he was taking the things out of the window. The other boy said to him, bolt, and immediately ran across the street. I took the prisoner into the shop, and gave him to the shopman - the window was cut before I went up. The other boy was pushing the glass out of the way while the prisoner took the goods out. Both of them had their hands through the window.</p>

            , who is a linen-draper, and lives in the parish of St. Clement Danes; I came into the shop just as Andrews brought the prisoner in. I had looked at the window about half an hour before; it was then dark - the pane was then entire, and not cracked; it had been fresh put in that morning, as it was cut the Saturday before, and three nights running. I observed that a piece of handkerchief had been moved, and drawn close to the square that was cut - there was about twelve of them; the glass was cut out four inches wide and eighteen long. I took the prisoner from Andrews, and as I took him through the passage he dropped a small wire with a hook to it; part of the handkerchiefs were through the hole - they are worth 14 s. the piece of glass laid inside the window.</p>

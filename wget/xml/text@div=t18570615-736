Thomas Barton")—none of these cheques are in my writing, or written by my authority—to the best of my knowledge they are written by the prisoner Brooks—I have not a shadow of doubt about it—while he was with me I was not aware that he was in the habit of using my name, nor have I since discovered that he did—I found a sheet of blotting paper, with a great number of imitations of my signature, in Brooks's own drawer—I missed some of my business cards—we usually send the advertisements to the office by one of the clerks, and sometimes send a cheque with them.</p>

This letter and cheque was brought to my office on 20th May last—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "2nd April, Wellington Street. Sir, Please give the bearer three dozen of sherry and port, and take out of the cheque. J. Barton")—the prisoner Hardy brought the cheque to me—Mr. Barton used to deal with me—when Hardy brought the cheque, I said that I thought it was very strange, as I had been conversing with him about an hour previous—I asked him who had sent him—he said, Mr. Barton—I asked him what he had to put the wine in, and he said a horse and cart, which belonged to Mrs. Clark, I think—I asked him if he had any baskets—he said, "No"—I did not order the wine to be delivered to him—I ordered him to take the horse and cart up the yard—I saw it afterwards in the yard—there was no one with it—Hardy did not come back for it—I sent the wine to Mr. Bar<lb></lb>ton's—Mr. Barton said that he knew nothing at all about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Jesse Roberts, of Denton, near Newhaven. I have known the prisoner since 1844—on Thursday, 29th March, 1855, I was at the registrar's office of the parish of St. George, Canterbury, when the prisoner was married to my daughter-in-law, Char<lb></lb>lotte</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185705110043"></xptr>
               <p>Roberts, my husband's daughter by a former marriage—she was alive on Thursday last—they remained in Canterbury, in my daughter-in-law's lodgings, till the Saturday, and then he went to his situation, in Ashford, which is fourteen or fifteen miles from Canterbury—he was assistant to a chemist and druggist there, and my daughter-in-law had lived there as servant; she remained at Canterbury till the Tuesday, and then went home with me to my house, at Rotherfield, in Essex, where she remained till Sept, 1855—the prisoner came twice to visit her in the course of those six months—he stayed for three nights at one time, and at another time he left his situation, and remained a month or five weeks, till he took his wife and child to London—the child was born at my house—I have never seen him since till last Thursday—he was on the most friendly terms with his wife, and I thought them a very happy couple—I have seen him write, and know his writing—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was sent to my house, at Rotherfield—these three letters are in his writing—(<hi rend="italic">Two of these were to his wife, and dated 30th March</hi>, 1855, <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 14<hi rend="italic">th July</hi>, 1855; <hi rend="italic">and the third, dated 27th April</hi>, 1857, <hi rend="italic">was to the woman whom he afterwards married</hi>)—the prisoner said that he was twenty when he was married; my daughter was twenty in May as she was married in March—I cannot say that I looked at his age in the register when he had signed.</p>

                  </hi>. In Jan., 1856, I became acquainted with the prisoner, by living as servant at Mr. Carter's, a chemist, in Smithfield, where he was in a situation, and last June he made me an offer of marriage—he did not tell me his age till we went to Church, and then he put it down in the book—I supposed he was a single man when I accepted him; he did not say anything about it—I have spelt my name wrong in my deposition; I have put "Susan" instead of "Jane"—I have not communi<lb></lb>cated with the attorney, Mr. Martin, since I made that deposition, but my sister did—I was married to the prisoner on 23rd Feb., at St. George's, Bloomsbury, by banns—my sister, Mrs. Owens, and my brother, were present—I lived with the prisoner as his wife only one night, Feb. 23rd, and returned to my place on the 24th—that is the only time I lived with him, but I am in the family way by him—that is for the first time—I have left my situation now—I received this letter from the prisoner, dated from the House of Detention—I expect to be confined about the latter end of Nov., or the beginning of Dec.—I heard at the latter end of April that he had been married before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I lived in the same employment with my first wife, and got her in the family way, and the stepmother came to me, and threat<lb></lb>ened to expose me to my master if I did not marry her; I would not consent, but afterwards agreed; they then went to Canterbury, and gave the names, and told them we were both inhabitants of Canterbury, and were both of age, whereas I was only nineteen; soon after I found I had been allured into a most disgraceful family, that one of my wife's sisters had had two illegitimate children, and since that has had another, and all by different fathers; some time afterwards I heard of my wife's disgraceful conduct before marriage, that she frequently had connection with a young man named Elger; I accused her of it, and she not only admitted it, but defied me to do anything; I was led away by an artful, designing woman, who took advantage of my youth; and I ask if your Lordship considers my first marriage legal? and I was not in Canterbury before the marriage took place, whereas the law requires nine clear days.</p>

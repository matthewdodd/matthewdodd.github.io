I counted it over again, I said it was right; then she wished me to make a bill, I said what a bill for half a pound of tobacco and a quarter of a pound of snuff; my little boy made a bill, she said it is right enough, she took the tobacco and snuff under her arm and was going out of the shop; I observed to her when I came out of the parlour with the silver, and said madam you know you have not given me the note, when she was going out with the tobacco and snuff; she said she had; I told her she must be mistaken, she said she was not; I said feel in your pocket, she did not; I asked her what she saw me do with it when I had taken it, she said that I had taken it into the parlour when I went for the change; says I that cannot be, because when I come out of the parlour, I told her she had not given me the note; she said, I have given you the note; I went and looked and she followed me; I took out the bowl where I put my change; I said look, you see your note is not here, you see there is only two notes and they lay considerably under the silver; she would insist on my taking the notes out of the silver; I did it to gratify her; she said there were spots of ink on the note she gave me; when she saw the notes, I observed to her where is the spots of ink, here is no spots of ink upon these; she said no; we walked into the shop, she then said she should know her note if she was to see it, her note was torn at the corner; I went and looked again and there was one of the two torn at the corner; I said you took more notice than I did. I did not observe it was torn, she said she was sure that was her note, she had taken it of Mr. Townsend; she asked me to let my little boy go along with her to Mr. Townsend with the note; to gratify her I let him go; after my little boy was gone out with her, I then thought she was not an honest woman; my husband come up, I desired him to run after her; I was confident she would not come back with the tobacco and snuff and the change; the change was sixteen shillings and sevenpence halfpenny.</p>

Yes, as I thought; we went along till we came to Mr. Jones's facing of Houndsditch, she went in there, she asked Mr. Jones if he had not given her a note on the Saturday, he said there were so many notes he could not tell; then she came out, I asked her if she was not going to Mr. Townshend; she said her name was Townshend; I asked her for the change, she said she had not got the change; then we went down Houndsditch; as we were going along I kept asking her for the change, she said she had not got it, and if she was not in the state she was, she would thump my head against the wall; I asked her again for the change, she said she had not got the change; then I went home.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into the prosecutor's shop to buy half a pound of tobacco, and a quarter of a pound of snuff. I put the note down and the lady gave the change, with a half guinea; she said she would rather give me silver; she took the half guinea; then I lost sight of the note; I never had the tobacco and snuff.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. You are to consider the conduct and demeanour of the prisoner. In the course of this transaction, when she got this change, she quarrelled with it a long time, not having given the note. When she is asked for the note, then she said that she had given the note, when in fact and truth she knew she had not. How does her innocence and demeanour consist with her conduct; when she is asked for the change, she said Mrs. Benningfield had not given her the change, when in truth she had.</p>

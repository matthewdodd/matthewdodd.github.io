                  </hi>. I live at 15, Nelson-street, in the parish of Stepney. On the evening of 4th Jan. I was in the area in the front of my house, between six and seven o'clock—I saw a man knock at the door of No. 16, and peep through the key-hole—I went in and shut the area door—I then heard the door of No. 16 open, and heard footsteps in that house in a direction from the passage towards the kitchen stairs—in about ten minutes I heard the door of No. 16 close—I got a chair, stood on it in the area, and saw a man bring something out of No. 16—he put it down in the road and folded it up—I thought it was a very large carpet—he went with it towards the New-road—I found a hat near the door of the house, and I sent my son for a constable—I then heard the steps of two men in No. 16, and told my son and the officer.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my mother at 15, Nelson-street. On 4th Jan. I went for a policeman—I went to the back of No. 16 while the officer went to the front—I then went round to the front and saw the officer talking to the prisoners—when I came to the door they made towards the kitchen—we followed them down there, and a key was thrown in the ashes—we took the prisoners to the station—on the following Sunday I found this key on the ashes, but on the Friday night I found in the kitchen this key,</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 111). On 4th Jan. I went to the front door of 16, Nelson-street—I heard some persons whispering within—I then heard the bolt of the door drawn, and Stevens looked out—I put my foot in the doorway to prevent any one shutting it—I said, "What do you do here?"—they made me no reply; but the third time I asked Stevens answered, "What is that to you?"—I said I wished to know what they did there, and who the landlord of the house was—Stevens turned to the other prisoner and said, "Mr. Green, here is a pretty thing, the policeman wants to know what we do here"—he said, "Mr. Green is master of the house, to be sure"—I said I did not feel satisfied with that, and called to the persons next door to bring me a light—the prisoners then made towards the back door, but they went down in the kitchen—I followed them, and heard some<lb></lb>thing fall, which sounded like keys—Mr. Neave brought me a light—I then saw who the prisoners were, and took them to the station—I saw Mr. Neave take this skeleton-key off the stove, it opens the street-door very easily—this other key was found on the Sunday—I saw this cloth, which appears to be a table-cover, lying on the floor in the passage near the parlour-door—I laid it on the parlour table.</p>

On the night of 3rd Jan., I slept at 16, Nelson-street, Stepney—I slept several night there to protect the furniture and take care of the house for Mrs. Jarvis; the furniture was hers as far as I know—at the time I left the house on 4th Jan., there was a large chimney-glass in the front-room, and a large carpet at the back of the door—after the prisoners were apprehended, I went to the house, and missed the glass and carpet—I saw this cloth on the parlour-table; it had been in the kitchen—the glass was worth about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the carpet about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were certainly worth more than 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when I left the house on the Friday morning I went over it to see that everything was correct—this cloth was then in the kitchen, and I saw it on the parlour-table between ten and eleven o'clock that night.</p>

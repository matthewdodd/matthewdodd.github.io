My husband was not at home then; he came home, I think, about 11 o'clock; he was very drunk. He got swearing; he wanted something neat, and I said 'You must give me some money, as I have not got any'. He said 'I don't intend to give you any.' I said 'Jaw to yourself while I wash my face.' He kept on jawing, and I went down stairs, and I was running down the stairs and I saw him take up the lamp off the coal-box outside the room. I don't know whether he knocked it off the coal-box or threw it at me, but the paraffin came all over me, and I was at once all on fire. I ran on into the passage, and I don't know who came to my assistance."</p>

I had had some drink; I was neither drunk nor sober. I lit the lamp, and put it on the box out<lb></lb>side the room. When I was asked who had done it—set me on fire—I said 'I think Jack has done it,' meaning my husband. He had been in bad before I left the room. I did not see him get out of bed. I am almost positive I did not knock the lamp over myself. I cannot tell whether I saw my husband come out on the landing or not, I was so excited. I did tell my daughter Alice that I did not know how it was done."</p>

When I picked up the lamp I laid it on the first step of the stairs going up to the floor above—that was on the stair leading from the landing up to the first floor—when I came down into the hall the deceased was still lying there with her head in the parlour doorway and her feet towards the wall—I did not go farther than the first landing window; I opened the window; I went up for that purpose because the smoke was so dense—I did not speak to the deceased after I came down—some time after Dr. Waight came she exclaimed "Oh my head, my head"—the policeman came about 10 or 12 minutes after I got into the house; that was Godinge—Dr. Waight had not come then.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw the prisoner about 20 minutes after I entered the house—I saw him come down stairs—during that time there was a very great deal of noise and disorder downstairs in the passage—until the policeman came—their first duty was to pitch every one out but myself and one or two others—until that time the place was packed; it was about 12 minutes from the time I came till the policeman came—the police ejected the people; that was very speedily done—I should say there were a score, or perhaps more, in the passage way and crowding round—the words the deceased said were, "I have burnt myself"—I can't say whether she used the abbreviation "I've burnt myself"—I have not the slightest doubt she said "burnt myself."</p>

The passage was not packed when I entered the house—there were only two or three there when I first went in—they followed—it was just as the public-house was closing, within two doors—I saw Mrs. Benson; I just spoke to her—I had not the slightest idea at that time who the deceased was—the great majority of the people there seemed to be under the influence of drink, ready to fight—there were very angry words and disputes as to how much drink they had been having—I think one or two of the people lived in the house—I distinctly saw the woman thrown down in the passage by a couple of men who rushed at her pell-mell—that caused her</p>

               <p>to fall—that was directly after the water was thrown on her—I put no direct question to her—I think the remarks I made were simply to the effect that she would be well cared for, to be quiet, help would come soon, something of that sort—I did not put questions to her with a view of ascertaining how the matter had happened—I did not endeavour to elicit anything from her nothing of the sort—I had no meaning in the phrase "All I could get out of her;" it was not in reference to asking her any questions.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman, of 111, St. George's Road, Holloway—on the night of 20th December I was standing opposite this house—the door was thrown open, and the reflection of the light came over my shoulder across the road—I turned round and saw a man crossing the road and I followed him, and when I got into the passage the man who ran across the road had a big door-mat in his hands—I took it away from him, and I and another party who was in the passage threw the woman down in the passage and put out the flames—after they were put out she said she had burnt herself, she should die, she should die, she knowed she should—that was all I heard her say—I did not ask her any questions—I saw one gentleman talking to her two or three little words—I don't know what he said—that was Mr. Limmer—I saw him stoop down and talk to her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Her words were, "I have burnt myself, I shall die, I shall die, I know I shall"—she said it twice over—the passage was crammed full of people when she said that—there was a good deal of confusion.</p>

I was leaning over the woman when I heard her say this, just finishing putting her out—there were two or three parties leaning over her, one was Mr. Limmer, the others were strangers to me—Mr. Lack was the person I saw cross the road—I was talking to a chap I work with, Jim Doo—I don't know where he lives.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of the prisoner and deceased—I lived with them at this time—I was not at home at the time of this occurrence—I was coming down St. James's Road when I met the ambulance with my mother on it, but I did not know then that it was her—I went to the hospital—she had arrived there before I got there—she was lying on the ambulance in the passage—I said to her, "Mother, how did you meet with this accident?"—she said she was going downstairs with the lamp in her hand and she fell, and the lamp exploded—this was between 12 and 1 o'clock—I visited her again on the same day between 2 and 3 o'clock—she was then in bed in one of the wards—she then again told me the same, that she was going downstairs with the lamp, and she fell and the lamp exploded—I next saw her on the following Friday—she died on the Saturday—I had not much conversation with her then, she spoke so very low—she made the same statement on the Friday—we talked about how the accident occurred, and she repeated the same statement—my uncle was with me and heard my mother say the same—when my mother spoke to me in the passage Godinge, the policeman, and Dr. Warry, the house-surgeon, were there—I can't say whether they heard what she said—they stood at her head by the door—they stood at her head by the ambulance—I stood close by, just by the door, about 2 feet away from her—I did not go close because she smelt so, she was so frightful—it was during that time that this conver<lb></lb>sation took place—I had seen my mother about half-past 8 that evening—she then seemed rather the worse for liquor—she began jawing, and with that I walked out—she was a woman of unsteady habits—she used to drink.</p>

I heard some one scream as I was sitting at my kitchen fire, and I ran upstairs in the passage—there are two flights of stairs from the kitchen to the passage—I only heard the one scream, and then I rose and went up—the first thing I saw was Mrs. Boyce in flames—she was then running down the stairs—she was on the first flight of stairs from the passage—I saw her on the landing, and was coming down the other flight of stairs—when I rushed to the street door she was harrying—she was not below the landing, just on the landing, the first landing from the passage.</p>

On the 15th of December I lost a Silver Pint Mug; the Prisoner had been drinking out of it, and as soon as ever he was gone, I miss'd it. There had been another Man drinking, in the Room at the same Time out of another, and I suppose when the Man was gone, he gave me the Man's Mug, and went away with that which he had his own Drink in.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the Mug the Prisoner drank out of from the other?</p>
               <p>Stevenson. The Prisoner drank out of an upright Mug, the other was a belly'd one. As soon as the Prisoner was gone, a Man came in for a Pint of Beer, and I then miss'd it. I found the Prisoner on the 3d of March, and took him up on Suspicion, and carry'd him before Justice Margett's, who discharged him, because I could not swear he stole it. As we were coming from the Justice's, I said, now you are discharged you may tell me where the Mug is; well then (says he) come along with me; so he carry'd me to Degan's a Pawnbroker, where he had pawn'd it for 45 s. and there I paid 48 s. 4 d. The Prisoner asked for the Mug, and 't was produced directly; here it is - the very same that I lost, and found again at Dogan's.</p>

            . The prisoner I have known many Years, he brought me this Mug one Evening to pawn, and I lent him 45 s. upon it; I can't swear this is the very same, but 'twas much such an old-fashion'd Thing as this. I do believe this is it, and my Servant told me that Stevenson and the Prisoner had it out together.</p>
               <p>Q. How come you to remember what Sort of a Mug the Prisoner drank out of, at this Distance of Time?</p>
               <p>Stevenson. I drew him the Beer my self in this upright Mug.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to recollect this? You say he gave you a different Mug at the Time you charge this Fact upon him. Why did not you ask him then, for the same Mug you drew him the Beer in?</p>
               <p>Stevenson. Because I did not mind it, till after he was gone.</p>
               <p>Several People appear'd to the Prisoner's Character. <rs id="t17370526-46-verdict206" type="verdictDescription">

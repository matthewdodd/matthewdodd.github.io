             were in another Room in the House;) Leach came, and forced his Discourse to me; I drank the Pint of Beer, paid three Half pence for it, and came out of the House; as I was going to my Lodging, four Fellows came up to me about twenty or thirty Yards from the House I came out of; two of them struck at me - this Burton is one. and Warwick the other; they struck at me, and I was knocked down with a Weapon, which I took to be a Mop-stick or a Broom-stick.</p>
               <p>Q. Who knocked you down?</p>
               <p>Fennel. He with the red Waistcoat on (Bunn) Bunn struck me with a Mop stick, and Warwick with something else; after they had knocked me down, I cried out Murder; Leach came, and threw himself down upon me, and caught me by the Throat, while one of them took away my Money - he held me down while my Money was taken away - they took 16 s. from me - it was in the right Hand Pocket of my Breeches; they took my Hat and Wig from me, and carried them quite away - I cried out Murder; and the Servant-Maid belonging to the Publick-House came out with a Candle; then I called out for the Watch - I cried out Murder before they robbed me - I saw every one of them very plain; I knew them before. I got hold of Warwick; but the three others made off directly; they went about forty or fifty Yards, as near as I can guess; came back again, and knocked me down again.</p>
               <p>Q. Who knocked you down then?</p>
               <p>Fennel. He in the red Waistcoat, I take it to be Bunn.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Bunn knock you down with a Mop stick or any other Stick?</p>
               <p>Fennel. It was with a Mop-stick, I am sure of that.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you do?</p>
               <p>Burton. I held him by the Feet while the others robbed him - we all shared the Money together, that Night (the Linnen we did design to steal being taken in) we went into Spittal fields Church yard, got over a Wall into a Gentleman's Garden, and stole some Linnen; I was taken that Night, and carried to New Prison, and I made myself an Evidence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Bunn. The first Night I saw Burton was at Mr Smith's, the Yorkshire-Grey in Rag-Fair; he called me in, to drink a Pint of Beer, and said, he had robbed a House, and got 15 l. and so persuaded me to go a robbing with him.</p>

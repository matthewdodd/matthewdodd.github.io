                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR GIFFARD</hi> conducted the prosecution.</p>
               <p> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">VISCOUNT CURZON.</hi> On 8th February, I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Curzon: Twenty months have elapsed since I stated in a letter that your father was a liar and a robber, a shabby fellow, and would turn like a weathercock. When I wrote the letter to you, then living at Pen, in the Amersham Division, God only knew my motive, which I now refresh your memory, for so doing. Bone of his bone treated it with disdain, I expect, counselled by that monster of a villain, Thynne; that be as it may, I shall be on the watch strictly for you or your father and Thynne, to put my menace into execution. You may sneer at this, but, by God I carry that with me about the streets of London, as will rid the earth of tyrants. I let you to know I belong to that stamp of man as states his principles, and determined to shoot any of you down. I think no more of it than you did of shooting a hare on that farm, in the year of grace, 1840. Remember, it as entered so deep in the soul, and the only cure for it his execution; I mean, tie me up by the neck in the heavens—you may rely on this, I have been forty times in Great George-street this last ten days, to meet with that scoundrel, Thynne. The stamp I belong to is, 'Be up and doing,' for it is wisdom to kill such fellows so help me God! Pencil or ink, parchment or paper, I <hi rend="italic">are</hi> the same man. I declare to God you have had every chance to remedy and redress father Lynch; now, it is my turn. By God, beware! what I mean, I say, what I say, I mean; tomorrow, if I have the chance, I actually will blow out your brains, and throw your body into Slur-hole!") The prisoner's father was a tenant of my father's at Shakleston in Leicestershire—a person named Thynne was Lord Howe's agent—I believe the prisoner's father left the farm by the directions of Mr. Thynne, but I do not know it myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did not the tenancy commence with my father under the Baroness Howe? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have no reason to think so—I remember your father—I said on 12<hi rend="italic">th</hi> August, at Marlborough-street, that I had never seen you before, and I do not know that I had—I do not recollect seeing you in my troop for nine years, or on the farm, when I have come shooting hares in a field of turnips—I do not remember seeing you when there was a fox in a drain at the bottom of the farm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I have three brothers who have been writing to you, but I never wrote to you; Thomas Hill wrote to tell you that if I had not been down in Ire<lb></lb>land, there would have been murder committed; the bailiff told me to give it up, and I said I would never do so; he sent thirteen or fourteen men into the farm, and let it at 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an acre more than we were giving for it; he had no business to come and take it in that way; twelve mouths' rent was overpaid at the time they took possession of it; that was in 1858; I was thrown apon the world, and the property was given away entirely, we were not tenants to Lord Curzon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> The farm bailiff was not my servant, but my father's—this was my father's property—I never could have given any order to my father's servants about this—I did not interfere in the slightest degree in the management of my father's property; never in my life—I did not receive any letter from your brother Thomas in 1861.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He wrote three: one to Lord Howe, one to you, and one to the bailiff. One of them had my signature to it, but I never put my signa<lb></lb>ture to it, though I knew it was written. I can bring my mother to prove the injustice. He got 2001. a year out of this from this model farm, just at the time of the Russian war. This farm-bailiff came in, and was going to do wonders. Lord Howe has got a second family, and he said he would get</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186410240085"></xptr>
               <p>a fortune for them, and get 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year out of it, just at the time that agricultural produce waft doubled. This man came speaking the grossest insolence, and insulting me. There was land hardly worth 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi> an acre, full of clay pits, and my family made that land. I knew my signature was put to the letter of 1861, but I am innocent of the letter of 1864. I am not my brother's keeper, and I cannot answer for this letter. I am as innocent as any man I am in the presence of. I am here with a clear conscience. I did not know a word that was in the letter till I heard it read at Marlbo<lb></lb>rough-street. I have been locked up ten weeks.</p>

On 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> or 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> August, I received the letter produced from Mr. Packer, and took the prisoner in custody—I asked him if he was John Hill—he said, "Yes"—I said, "I have a warrant for jour apprehension, for sending a letter to Viscount Curzon, threatening to kill him"—he said, "I sent it, and T have sent some to Lord Howe too, and I mean to carry out what I have stated in it"—I then produced these two letters, and asked him if he had seen them before; I mean the writing and the pencil.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> That letter was not written within 200 miles of this town. <hi rend="italic">The</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> What he has stated is quite false. I never touched the letter. He said, "I hold a warrant against you for sending a threatening letter to Lord Curzon." I said, "If I did anything of that kind I will stand by it." He said, "You have sent a letter to a man named Dummelow, a former. "I said, "I know my brother sent a letter, with my signature to it. I am going into Kent, and must see a solicitor about it." He said, "My good man, do you know I demand you as my prisoner?" He afterwards asked me to take 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to go to Australia, but I said I would not go at any price.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> The letter found on me was written at Liskeard, Cornwall, to be left till called for. My brothers insulted him with gross letters, but kept their hands off. I went down to Liverpool. This man has made as wicked a statement as ever came from the lips of man.

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I confess I broke the windows I had threatened for two years to commit such a crime.

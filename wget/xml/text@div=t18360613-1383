                  </hi>. I am a policeman. About nine o'clock on Tuesday 7th June, I was at the end of Union-street, Shadwell, and heard "Murder" cried—I turned round, and saw some people running from the opposite side of the street, over towards No. 4—I directly went up to No. 4—when I got against the window, I heard "Murder"cried in the parlour—I tried to get in at the street-door, but it was fastened—I went to the parlour window—there was a square of glass broken—I put my hand through, and pushed the curtain on one side, and saw the prosecutrix bleeding very much at the head—the door was open at No. 5, and I went through No. 5, and got into the yard of No. 4 into the passage and into the parlour—I saw the prosecutrix sitting in a chair by the window, bleeding very much at the head—she told me she was stabbed, and the man was gone out—on turning round, and looking about he room, I saw the witness Hesketh sitting in a chair—she said, "That is not him"—I went into the yard, and found the prisoner in the privy, and brought him through the passage into the parlour—he was dressed all but his hat—the prosecutrix said, "That is the man that stabbed me"—I told him he must be a brute to use a girl in that his hat—I told him he should have it if he went quietly—he wanted to go up-stairs for it—I told him he should not go up-stairs, and then he called out for the people outside to shut the window-shutter—it was shut, and then we were in darkness in the room—I had got him by the collar, and was trying to make my way to the street-door—I trod on something in going across the room—I stooped down, and found it to be the handle of a jug—when I got the street-door, I held him by one hand, while I open the street-door—a little scuffle ensued between us, and he got hold of the door-post—he was trying to get away—he got me back into the room, and I trod on the handle of a knife—I stooped, and picked it up—we were in darkness; and in the scuffle, I put him back in a chair, and dropped the knife again—I called out to the people to open the shutter—Serjeant Denny came by at the time assisted in taking him to the station-house, and he was committed—I saw the prosecutrix afterwards—she had two wounds on the forehead, one on the top of the other—one on the top of the head, and one on he thick part of the arm—I took her to Mr. Croucher, and he took her to the surgery, and dressed her—he is not here—I cannot say the wounds were given by a knife, more than from what the doctor said before the Magistrate—I picked the knife up in the room—I did not see it done—she was taken into the surgery, and I waited in the shop while Mr. Croucher dressed her—when she came out, she had three plasters on the fore<lb></lb>head and one on the arm—I saw the wound on the arm—the blood I saw was on her head—I took a double handfull of blood out of her hair—there was a <hi rend="italic">goodish</hi> drop of blood on her arm and on her clothes—I did not see any blow that was given by the jug.</p>

               <p>You must not mention what any body said.</p>
               <p>A. In consequence of that information, I got a warrant to search the house of the prisoner, at No. 5, White-Hart-court, Old-street, St. Luke's; there was nobody at home; the window was open, and I desired the constable to go in; upon searching the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130124"></xptr>house, we found two nine-gallon firkin casks, empty, with a brand mark, signifying them to be Felix Calvert's; there was nothing else we could swear to; there were other marks besides the brand mark, by which I knew them; the prisoner was journeyman to the farrier that contracts to do the business of the yard; his shop was in the yard. (They were produced in Court, and deposed to by the witness.) Our mark is an hour-glass, by which we describe all our casks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. One of the casks seems to be broken? - A. The top is loose in the inside of it.</p>

            They don't seem to be such casks as brewers use. - A. We carry finings to the publicans in them.</p>
               <p>Q. And leave them with the publicans sometimes? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you send out porter in casks of that fort, and sell them? - A. Yes, but not of this size; we sell nothing less than half a barred; we never send these casks out but for finings.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know when the casks were lost? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. When was it? - A. In August, it was very dirty; the next morning his wife brought it to the door and cleaned it, and took it in again, and set it under the dresser; it was never out of the house till it was taken out by the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. You saw this man bring a cask into the house in August? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Was that the reason why you did not give information before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You lived in the same house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You was intimate with his wife? - A. Not very.</p>
               <p>Q. You are upon good terms with her? - A. Not very.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not on good terms enough to borrow money of her? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never borrow any money of her? - A. Yes, I have; but I paid her again.</p>

               <p>I am a farrier; I have known the prisoner between two and three years, up to the present time; he bears a good character for honesty as far as I know of him. I know he bought the two casks at the Blue Anchor, in Coleman-street.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time? - A. Between three and four in the afternoon; it was at the Blue Anchor, in Coleman-street; he bought them of John Walker, who is dead since; he worked for Mr. Calvert.</p>
               <p>Parry. He was in the house, he used to carry out finings.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Crozon.) Q. You are a farrier? - A. Yes; I work for Mr. Jones in the Curtain-road, Moorfields.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you work at Mr. Calvert's? - A. I did; I was his fellow-servant at the same time; I worked in the room of another man that was sick. I work now for Mr. Jones, who does the work for Mr. Calvert.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew Walker very well? - A. Yes; he carried out finings to fine the beer.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it he sold these casks? - A. It was a long while ago; about half a year, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. What sized casks are they? - A. They held about nine gallons.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not seen them here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been here? - A. Not about half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the Blue Anchor? - A. In Coleman-street, Moorfields.</p>
               <p>Q. Who keeps the house? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose beer do they draw? - A. Felix Calvert 's.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose the landlord was present? - A. I am not able to say.</p>
               <p>Q. It was in the public tap-room you remem ber? - A. Yes, before all the company.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130125"></xptr>Q. What did he give for them? - A. He gave the man liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. How much? - A. I cannot say, he gave him liquor and money.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money? - A. I cannot say particularly; I did not take notice.</p>
               <p>Q. He gave you some of the liquor? - A. I drank in the company.</p>
               <p>Q. How much liquor had your? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You know the bargain was for money and liquor; cannot you say how much money and liquor? - A. I cannot recollect, it is so long ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect the month? - A. No; I believe it was about seven or eight months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it summer or winter? - A. It was last summer to a certainty.</p>
               <p>Q. Every body might have seen it? - A. Yes; it was done openly.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in your company besides? - A. Nobody but this man and me coming home together, and John Walker; there was a man with Walker that I am not acquainted with.</p>
               <p>Q. You four partook of the liquor? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And no more? - A. I cannot say who drank, and who did not, but what we drank was paid for.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is the landlord of this house? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been there since? - A. Yes; this Christmas, with a friend or two, and had two or three pots of beer there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know the landlord's name? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it not appear odd to you, that this servant of Mr. Calvert's should be selling casks to the farrier? - A. I did not know but what they were the man's own property; it was a piece of business I had nothing to do with.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not observe the marks? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You would not know the casks again? - A. No, I should not; there are so many of that size.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has Walker been dead? - A. I suppose about two months.(The prisoner called three other witnesses, who gave him a good character).</p>
               <p>Parry. Walker has been dead about three months; he was employed by the coopers to carry out finings; we served the Blue-anchor; the man that kept it five months ago is gone away; I don't know the person that is in it now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ally. Q. Walker used to carry out finings in that sort of cask? - A. Yes.</p>

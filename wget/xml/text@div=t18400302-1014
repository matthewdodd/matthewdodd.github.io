               <p>morning of the 28th the prisoner's labourer, Charles Dove, brought some solder—the prisoner was present—it was put into the scale to be weighed—the moment he put it into the scale he came to me and reported himself as being correct to time—I walked to the scale and saw three of the bars which I had marked among the eight which were there—the prisoner came to me in the evening and asked me to take the weight of the solder—I asked him twice over how many bars there were—he said, "Eight"—I said, "Are you sure there are eight?"—he said, "Yes," counting them—I then ordered them to be taken to the counting-house, and saw the three that I had marked, and recognised in the morning—I called two men to weigh them, and about three-quarters of an hour after, I saw the prisoner, and told him I had a very unpleasant charge to make against him—I told him he was selling me solder twice over—he denied it—I told him it was no use to deny it—he said, "I hope you will deal leniently with me, and not give me in charge," as he would appear to-morrow morning—I said I could not do such a thing, as I was answerable for the property to the company—I gave him into custody, and delivered the three marked bars to the officer—these are them—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and worked for the prisoner. On the 27th of February, in the evening, he gave me directions to call at his house on the following morning—I did so, at twenty minutes before seven o'clock, and found some bars of solder in the passage—he had left his house, and gone to the factory—I took the bars there, and saw him there—he told me to put the eight bars of solder into the scale, and I did so—it was weighed in Mr. Munro's presence.</p>

Munro did not make any observation to me about them—I told him I had 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week from the prisoner—on the Saturday morning, the 29th, Munro said it was a great shame that I should only have 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, when the pri<lb></lb>soner had 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from the firm—I was never taken up for any robbery—I was accused of one by a person who is here to give the prisoner a cha<lb></lb>racter—I considered myself innocent—I was sent from his employ, and taken in by the prisoner out of charity.</p>

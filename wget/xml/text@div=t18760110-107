I reside at Barrington Road, Brixton—on the evening of the 13th December last I was at the Ludgate Hill station at about 6.30, and about to get into a first-class carriage—the prisoner snatched my watch from my pocket and wrenched it off the bow—he ran away, and I cried out "That man has my watch. Stop him"—I recognise the prisoner as the man.</p>

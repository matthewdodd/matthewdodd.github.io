On the 3rd of March I was at work in my cellar—Brown, who was with me, said something—I went out, and saw the prisoner run<lb></lb>ning down the street with seven pails on his shoulder, which had been taken from my door—he dropped some of them—I ran and overtook him with the rest of them—he turned round to me in a frantic manner—I siezed him—he seemed hardly conscious of what he did.</p>

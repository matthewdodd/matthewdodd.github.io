            . I am the son of Joseph Wicks.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 24th of March last did you carry any parcel to the prisoner at the bar - A. Yes. The parcel contained to the amount of two hundred guineas, in guineas, half-guineas, and seven-shilling pieces. I weighed them myself, and put them in four paper parcels, fifty in each. I delivered them to Hitchinson. They were directed to John Silvester, 33, Goswell-street, London. I saw the prisoner by the Broad gate. I there delivered them to him, the parcel, so directed. I told him, if that person did not satisfy him for his trouble, my father would. That is all I said to him. He said, very well; that is all right. I went away, leaving the parcel with him. He was standing in the street.</p>
               <p>JOHN SILVESTER. I am a butcher. I live in Goswell-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Yes, very well. Towards the latter end of March I received a letter. I saw the prisoner pass the door on a coach. I called him. He came into my shop, and asked me if I expected a parcel from Mr. Wicks, of Coventry. I told him, no; I had no advice whatever to expect any. He said, he had some recollection of receiving a parcel, but he was not certain. He was rather malty. I told him to enquire of Mr. Wicks, whether he had or not. He said, he would. In two days time I saw him again. He said, he had been to Mr. Wicks. I am not certain whether he said they were not at home, or Mr. Wicks was not at home. Two days following the coach stopped at the Maidenhead, Goswell-street. He put a passenger down. I asked him, whether he had made another enquiry. He said, he thought it must be nothing but a letter, or else he must have heard of it, I understood.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Do not tell us what you understood, tell what he said - A. I cannot. He gave me sixty guineas in a bag. I gave him bank-notes for them. I bought them by weight. Some were light, and two or three that were heavy. I am not able to recollect the conversation between him and me.</p>
               <p>Q. I will endeavour to remind you what he said. Did not he tell you, when he first got down, that a passenger got in the coach at Highgate. He saw the packet was safe at Daintry, that he had taken up a stranger at Highgate, and put him down at the Three Cups. He searched for the parcel, and could not find it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160060"></xptr> Q. How long was it after he brought you the sixty guineas - A. That must be the latter end of March, or the beginning of April.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that the sixty guineas came from Mr. Southgate - A. I cannot recollect. He did tell me who the sixty guineas came from, but I cannot recollect the name.</p>

I took another person, and left him at home. I returned about half past seven o'clock, when I asked the maid where William was; she said he was gone out. I went into the back parlour, and missed two gold watches and three silver ones; they were hanging under the chimney glass when I went out. I opened the parlour cupboard, and all the cash I had in the house was gone. I saw it in a box in the cupboard, and put five guineas in it not five minutes before I went out, as I did not chuse to carry it with me. There were sixty-eight guineas in gold, six crown-pieces, some half-crown-pieces, and about twenty shillings in silver. I heard nothing of them nor the prisoner since they were taken till last Monday was a week, when I was sent for to Sir

            . What have you to say? - I am servant to Mr. Davison, pawnbroker, in High-street in the Borough. On the 17th of October, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to our house and asked half-a-guinea on that gold watch (pointing to one of the watches which Mr. Younker deposed belonged to him). I am sure this is the watch with a shagreen case. I asked him where he lived; he said in the Borough. He was not dressed as he is now: he had light-coloured cloaths; from his dress I took him for a baker. I asked him if the watch was his own; he said it was a family affair, and he would not lose it for never so much: he desired me to take great care of it: this was all that past. I am sure that is the watch he left with me.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Younker come and look at the watch? - Yes, he did, and said it was the watch-he had taken out of his house. I am not certain what day of the month the gentleman came; it was Monday was a week.</p>

            . Some time ago Mr. Younker gave information at Sir John Fielding's office that he had been robbed, and his servant had absconded. Sunday was a week a letter was sent to our office that the prisoner was with his father on the other side of Westminster Bridge. I went with some other officers, and found the prisoner at the bar in his father's house. I asked his father if his son had brought any thing there; if he would not tell me I would search. The prisoner told me where that plain gold watch was in a cupboard by the side of the fire-place (after looking at one of the watches produced, said it was the watch he found by the prisoner's direction). We took him into custody that night; on Monday evening he was examined: the prosecutor was sent for, and the prisoner told him the whole matter, and where he pawned the other watch; that he robbed his master of two gold watches and three silver ones and money; that he went down to Staffordshire; that he hid the money in a field at Blackstone in Staffordshire, but somebody took it away.</p>

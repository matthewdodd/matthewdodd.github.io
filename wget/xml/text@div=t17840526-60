               <p>Court. It is now settled, that if a man sets fire to the house he occupies, it is not arson. In the case of the King and Spalding, tried at Bury the last assizes, the man had insured the house, and he was indicted on two general counts; first, for feloniously setting on fire his out-house; the second, for feloniously setting on fire his house; and it was proved that the prisoner's house was at the village of H - , and there was no doubt but he wilfully set fire to the girder, by which means the house was burnt: the prosecutor called the following witnesses;

            , to whom this house was secured; this was laid before the Court to induce them to think that he had the advantage of the insurance money, and destroyed the security: the question was, whether the prisoner's offence amounted to the crime of arson, and the Judges were of opinion it did not. The premises being induced makes no difference in the offence, as for instance, the case of the man belonging to the hospital for blind people at Kentish town; I cannot make any difference between a tenant for three years and for seven years.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. My Lord, I certainly say this man was in possession under this title from year to year.</p>
               <p>Court. How long had he been in possession? - Several years.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Sylvester. If you think seriously that there is any foundation to have a special verdict on this, you shall take it, but I cannot reserve it; we have tried Holme's case over and over again, and it is now confirmed to be good law; it is not another man's house whilst I have the lawful possession. It is now settled, that if a tenant sets fire to the house he occupies, it is not arson: the Judges said Holmes's case governs us. But however I would not have this man discharged by any means in the world, if you will undertake to indict him for a misdemeanor at common law in burning the house.</p>

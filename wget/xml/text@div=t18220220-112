On the 5th of January, I went to Bellas's, and found this property, and some letters on the mantle-piece, directed to her, which refer to some duplicates, Bellas gave me the duplicates on my asking her about the letters, I found several other duplicates in a tea-chest, one of which was for two plates, pawned at Neats's - I also found a shirt at Stevens's. I went to the prosecutor's house in Huntingdonshire, and found the prisoner there, and said, I had a warrant to apprehend her for felony, and asked for the keys of her box; she refused, but said she would shew me the place, I asked where her letters were, she said she was not such a fool as to keep letters by her, for such a fool as me to look at, and that she burnt them; I said I had found letters at Bellas's, and a parcel directed to Bellas - she said she had sent letters to her, that the housemaid wrote some, and a baker at Stilton the others.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am fourteen; the prisoner was in our house on Monday evening, and this muslin was wet, and she put it in a pan, to iron it; I last saw her at five o'clock on Tuesday morning, I did not see her afterwards; I went to bed, she never came near the bed, any farther than to help me to make it; she was to sleep with me at night; my mistress gave her leave to sleep with me; she sat up to iron, I went to bed directly, she said she would come at least in an hour after me, but she did not come.</p>
               <p>Did you miss your things in the morning? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see her afterwards in the house? - No, Sir, not till she was taken up; she went away on the 18th, and was taken up on the 26th; I saw her before the magistrate, and there was a pair of my mistress's stocking upon her; the stockings were soled with a sort of thick cloth, called Russia.</p>

               <p>- LEE sworn.</p>
               <p>I apprehended the prisoner, to the best of my knowledge it was on the 26th of January at night; I took her from the Blue Posts; I did not see her before; I did not examine her till I brought her to the Rotation-office; I took her stockings off by the Magistrate's order; which Mrs. Sharp said were hers; she never was out of my sight all the way, till we came to the office, and there Mrs. Sharp desired to look at her stockings; nothing else was found upon her; Mrs. Sharp has forgot to tell you, she went through the back room into the girls room, and took the jacket off the bed.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Sharp. I saw her in the bed room that evening.</p>
               <p>Did you owe her any wages? - Only three shillings.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was with the prosecutrix when she was ill, and I staid with her five weeks; they owed me seven shillings and six pence, and he gave me three shillings and six pence; he said I must go away, he had too many to keep already; I went away and she sent for me to wash; I did not know what to do, I was very much distressed, and was obliged to stay all night; there are many girls work for her, and they are girls of the town.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. Did she apply for her wages that night? - Yes; she said she would lay in bed till I came from the linen-draper's, and got the money.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness to her character.</p>

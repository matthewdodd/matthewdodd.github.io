                  </hi>. I live at No. 2, Finsbury Market, and am a general dealer. On 13th Nov., about 12 o'clock at night, I was returning home with Mary Casey—when near Red Cross Street, I had occasion to leave her for a short time within two doors of Whitecross Street, and on my return I saw her and the prisoner—there was a lamp close by where she was stand<lb></lb>ing—she said the prisoner had indecently assaulted her—I asked him why he had done it—he made use of a most beastly expression, and I said, "I shall lock you up"—I directed Casey to go to the corner of Golden Lane, where I had seen a policeman a few minutes before, and tell him I wanted him—I said, "I will take care of the prisoner"—he said to me, "Do you mean to lock me up?"—I said, "Yes, I do"—he said, "If that is what you mean, fol<lb></lb>low me," and took to his heels—I followed him down Lower Whitecross Street, and into a court—the entrance of it is very narrow, but at the top is a square—I followed him there, and on the left hand there is a recess, and he fixed himself in it, and as I came by he <hi rend="italic">fetched</hi> me two violent blows on my face—they came so unexpectedly, that I was knocked down—I could see it was the prisoner—I jumped up and grappled him—I could have mastered him, I believe, but I found there were two more, who knocked me about most dread<lb></lb>fully, and kicked me about—I had a silver watch and a silver chain—I was knocked down three or four times, and the last time I was knocked down the prisoner seized my waistcoat, tore it open, and took my chain from round my neck, and the watch from my fob, while I was on the ground—I do not believe the prisoner kicked me, he struck me, and the others kicked me—I jumped on my feet, and made a last effort to get my watch—the prisoner had a muffler round his neck—I seized it, and he struck me again—I received three or four more blows, and fell with the muffler in my hand—it was all over soap suds, the same as my coat—there were soap suds in the gutter or drain—the prisoner dragged the muffler from me—I received some more kicks from the others, and they all left me—after I had recovered my<lb></lb>self a minute, I went to where I had left Mary Casey—I saw the officer, and he went back with me to the place—I saw where the soap suds had been mopped up from the ground with my things—I told the officer what kind of man the prisoner was—he took me to the yard where the prisoner was taken, and I went to the station in Moor Lane; I saw the prisoner there, and charged him—I am sure he is the man—this muffler was taken</p>

               <p>from his pocket, but it had been refolded; I told them to open it, and the mud and soap suds was on it—I told the officer to take off my coat and let the inspector smell it, and it had the same soap suds on it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you never seen this person before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never—it was not a mile from my dwelling—Mary Casey is living with me as my wife—it is out of my power to make her my wife, because I had the misfortune to be married to an abandoned character—I was going home—I had been to several places; I left home about 4 o'clock in the afternoon; I left Casey to mind my business—I met her at a friend's house, at near 12 o'clock that evening, where we had supper—I believe I had been in two public houses that evening, not after Casey joined me—the place where the robbery took place was in a court—I do not know whether it is a thoroughfare—I believe there is a lamp in that court—it was not a dark night nor a dark court—I gave a description to the officer of the prisoner's dress and features, and the officer asked me how he ran, and I said, "Bandy legged"—I said at Guildhall about there being soap suds in the gutter; I do not believe I said it before I went there—I have been tried to be tampered with about this case, but I declined it—his sister has been in my shop—I do not believe I have mentioned it to any one—I was in this Court about two years and eight months ago, as a prisoner—I have never been in any other Criminal Court beside this—I have been at Liver<lb></lb>pool—I belong to Liverpool—I was charged here about a box of ivory; I left without a blemish on my character—since that I have never been in custody, nor taken on any charge—I believe I was fined 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for an assault—I never was charged with felony—I saw the prisoner in custody of Tur<lb></lb>ner, he brought him out of a hayloft in custody—I have heard that the pri<lb></lb>soner was asleep in his father's loft—I did not say after the prisoner was taken, that the shawl fell in the mud.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi>, 162). On 13th Nov., I was on duty, and saw the prisoner about a quarter past 12 o'clock in Beech Street, with two other parties with him—that is but a very few yards from Redcross Street—I knew the prisoner before; I passed them on the other side of the street, and about five minutes after I left them, I heard some person running and screaming—that turned out to be Casey—she made some statement to me, and I walked with her—in about four minutes O'Conner came to me—his face was swelled on one side, and covered with blood, and the back of his coat was nothing but mud—he told me he had been assaulted, and he described the person—I went in pursuit of the prisoner to his father's, at No. 2, Silk Street, and, not seeing any light there, I went to his father's stable, in Whitecross Street—I found the prisoner up in a hay loft, and took him into custody; he runs bandy legged—I took him to the station; I found in his coat pocket this shawl—the prosecutor said, "If you unfold it, you will find marks of mud"—I unfolded it, and found them, and the mud was moist—I went to examine the yard where the assault had been committed—there is a lamp in the centre of the court, it is a very light court—there is a gutter in it, where there had been some soap suds thrown down—the pro<lb></lb>secutor's</p>

Q.</hi> Did you remember about the gutter and soap suds when you were before the Magistrate, and about the prisoner having bandy legs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I did, but I omitted stating it—I took the prisoner at his father's place—his father is a keeper of <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi>—the prisoner was lying on a truss of hay, he was not asleep—I knew him well—I called him by name, and he jumped up directly—the prosecutor had given me a minute descrip<lb></lb>tion of his dress, and likewise of his running away—this is the prisoner's shawl, the one that the prosecutor said the prisoner had on—this shawl fell down in the yard after I had the prisoner—it was damp where it fell; some water had been spilt—I told him I took him for robbing a person—he said, "You don't mean to be nasty"—he said he was innocent.</p>

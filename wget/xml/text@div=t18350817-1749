The pri<lb></lb>soner called on me the 17th of May—I have known him all his life—he said he had just arrived from Portugal, because the Government of that country had no further need of his services—he said he was in great dis<lb></lb>tress, and wished me to relieve him—I said I had a large family, but any trifle for his present wants, I would give him; but he had rich friends, and must apply to them—he said he had a claim on Mr. Bullock, an auctioneer in Holborn, from 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for goods sold for him, from his chambers in Gray's-inn, before he went abroad—the last time I had seen him he was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183508170081"></xptr>
               <p>an attorney in practice—I undertook to see what the claims on Bullock was, and he was in the habit of coming to my office frequently about it—on the 6th of June, between ten and eleven o'clock, he came to the house—the arrangement was proceeding with Mr. Bullock's snilicitor—during the conversation, Mr. M'Laren came in, and I sent the prisoner into the back-office, and when Mr. M'Laren left the prisoner returnde into the front office, and said he wished to write a letter at the desk on my left side—I gave him some paper—this was about twelv or one o'clock—there was nobody but me and the prisoner in the office—at that time, my watch, chain, and seals laid immediately on my right—I left the office, leaving him there writing, and went up—stairs—I retunred in upwards of an hour, and did not find him there—my watch, and chain, and reals were gone—I did not see him again till he was at Marlborough-street—that was about a fornight afterwards—Mr. Pearce was in my back office—the front office leads into the passage, and then into the street—the outer door was shut—nobody could have gone into the front office from the street unless the door had been left open—there is a communication between the back and front office—nobody could come into the front office without being let in by somebody inside—I had a female servant down stairs—there was nothing to prevent her going into the front office.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Wright. I was in the back office on the 6th of June—I remember seeing the prisoner there—Mr. M'Laren had gone into the front office to master—I remember his going away—the prisoner then went into the front office—he afterwards came into the back office to me, and was looking over some writings—he asked</p>

               <p>me what time the two-penny post went out—I said, "At two o'clock, I be<lb></lb>lieve"—he appeared rather confused at the time—I after wards saw him at Marlborough-street—I remember my master returning down stairs to his office—there was no one but the prisoner in master's office from the time Mr. M'Laren left till my master came down—the prisoner generally wrote his letters by my side, in the back office—there was nothing to prevent his writing in the back office as usual.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Was there no person in the back office besides yourself and me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nobody in the front—William, the boy, was in the back—the boy had no business in the front office—I will not swear he did not go there—I do not recollect any other person coming in while you were there—I do not recollect a person coming with some meat from the market.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I called on Mr. Wright about the 17th of May, and employed him to do for me what I do not think I could have got any other person in the profession of the law to have done—it was to recover a sum of money to which I had no earthly right—he consented to do it, and, has told you, matters went on, proceedings were taken, and it being a family matter, he says they agreed to pay 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and ten guineas his costs, if I went to America—he says the following Tuesday was to be the day for paying the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I put it to any gentleman of common sense, whether, with the remotest possibility of receiving 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the Tuesday, I should commit such an act—the reason I did not go to him afterwards was</p>

               <p>this, the time for pleading had expired, and I understood the party intended to defend the action, and being in difficulties, I knew I should be watched into his office and arrested—another reason was, if the parties had made up their minds to defend the action, I must have dropped it; because they would have beat me by producing a most respectable friend, who would acknowledge he had received the money on my account, and paid it away, which would place him in a very awkward position—I had incurred a bill with Mr. Wright, and that was the reason I did not go to his house—the boy was in the house at the time; he is not produced—I still say he had a lodger, and that lodger a servant—why are they not called?—why not have the best proof in a case of suspicion?</p>

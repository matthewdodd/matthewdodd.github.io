                  </hi>. I live in Herefordshire. I took some heifers and sheep from Herefordshire into Essex, to sell, and on returning I came through Hanwell, on the 17th of October—I stopped at the Duke of York public-house—I took some refreshment—I could not get a con<lb></lb>veyance, and intended to sleep there, but the landlord said I could not—I went out to get a lodging—a person came out of the Duke of York after me, dressed in a flannel jacket—he said, "Old man. I can find you a lodging"—I walked a short distance with him, and then two others joined us—I had not got above twenty yards from Hanwell when they joined us, and said they were going the some way, and we all waked together—they took me over some fields and there was a hedge or two—they took me to a hay-rick—I could not see any public road there nor any foot-path part of the way—when we got to the hay-rick one of them seized me by the throat, and pinned me to the ground while the other two rifled my pockets—I had four half-crowns about three or four shillings in silver, and two or three sixpences, which they took, and four cotton handkerchief, and a bunch of about six keys out of my pocket—the prisoner was in the public-house when I left it—he was dressed in a flannel jacket—it was about nine o'clock when I left the public-house—it was rather a dark foggy night—there was no moon, that I could observe—it was very dark—the prisoner is the same height as the man that was in room—I have not the least doubt in my own mind he is the same person who came out of the house after me—I heard his voice in the room, but had no conversation with him—I am positive he is the man who was in the room, I have not the least doubt that he is the man who robbed me—they attempted to take my boots off, and strip me of my clothes—I begged and prayed of them not to take my clothes off—they were in the act of doing it—they were pulling to take my boots, and had hold of the handkerchief which was round my neck—they desisted when I desired them, and threatened, as they left me, that they would kill me if I make noise—I heard one of them say so—I cannot say which it was—they left me, and I remained</p>

                  </hi>. I am horse-patrol of Hanwell. The prosecutor came to me on Tuesday morning, the 18th of October, about o'clock, and gave me a description of the things he had lost—he told me one of the parties who robbed him, had a flannel jacket, and the others were in dark clothes—he described where he had been robbed, and I went to inquire at the Duke of York what parties had been there that night—Hanwell is a large parish—it extends more than a mile round the Duke of York—in consequence of information, I took the prosecutor on to the rail-road, where people were at work, and told him to keep at a regular distance from me, and I would point our different men, who I though were concerned in it—I lost for a time, and then sent my partner after him, and I put myself in possession of the prisoner till he came there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that in consequence of the prosecutor's description? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he had given me an account of his having a flannel jacket on, and by speaking to the landlord, I got possession of the prisoner at work on the rail-road, and went for the prosecutor—as soon as the prisoner saw him, he walked away from his work—he walked between the arches of the rail-road, and kept a little distance till I saw him out of sight—I then walked a little distance, and saw him on his hands and knees, between the tiers—thirty or forty yards from where he was at work—I followed after him, collared him, and brought him back to when I had seen him on his hands and knees—my partner came up, and I told him to go and look in the gravel in that part, and he found four pocket-handkerchiefs and a collar there—I asked the prosecutor if he knew them—he said, yes, they were his, he could swear to them—I then searched the prisoner, and found a box and knife which the prosecutor has sworn to as his own.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I accompanied Spillman to the rail-road, and saw the prisoner—I did not see him leave his work, as I was looking after the prosecutor—after he left his work, by Spillman's de<lb></lb>sire, I searched some gravel to see what I could find—the prisoner was in his possession, close to the spot at the time—I found four handkerchief, and a shirt collar covered with gravel, except a small corner—about half an inch of it—I took possession of them, and asked the prosecutor if he knew any thing of them—he said they were his—I did not hear the prisoner say any things.</p>

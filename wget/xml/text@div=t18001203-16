               <p>JAMES DEMSDALS sworn. - I live at No. 14, Brown's-lane; I hold three pieces of land in Bethnal-green-road; My next door neighbour gave me information that my gate was burst open; I found the gate, of the stable burst open; I went into the summer-house in the garden, and found I was robbed of the articles mentioned in the indictment; I went to a Jew broker's, in Hind-street, Spitalfields, and there I found two saws; she told me she bought them at No. 1, in Booth-court; I went there, and found the woman prisoner sitting at breakfast with three children; I did not tell her any thing about it; I then went to the office, got a warrant, and went to the house, about one o'clock; there I found a chair, two chissels, a chopper, a large hammer, a mallet, and a nail-box; the officers took possession of them.</p>
               <p>HANNAH HYAMS sworn. - I was called by the prisoner to buy some goods, the Monday before she was taken up, and I went to her house, and bought two chairs and a table.</p>
               <p>PETER MASON sworn. - I am an officer; I went with Mr. Dimsdale, and two other gentlemen that had lost things from their gardens, to the prisoner's house, the woman was in the lower room with her children, and there we found a number of articles; we had been to Mrs. Hyams's and found two saws.</p>
               <p>Hyams. I forgot to mention the saws; I bought them of the woman at the bar. (The property was deposed to by Dimsdale).</p>
               <p>Mason. We went up stairs afterwards to search for other things, and there we found the man, and I asked him whether he had stole the things or the woman; he said he had stole them himself, that his wife had nothing to do with it, that he had taken them through distress.</p>

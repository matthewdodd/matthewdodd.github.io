               <p>HELEN LEARY. I left my situation on Tuesday last, and went to lodge in the same room with the prisoner Kelly. I went out on Wednesday morning, at half-past ten o'clock, leaving these things in a band-box. Baxter also lodged in the same room; I desired Kelly to take care of my box while I went after a situation; Baxter was in the room - the box was tied round with a piece of tape. I returned about five, but did not examine my box - they were both in the room; I slept with Baxter that night, and next morning, about four o'clock, I looked into my box, and missed 4 yards of lace - the money was in my pocket - I had four shillings, and two sixpences - Kelly had come into the room at two o'clock in the morning. When I awoke my band-box was untied - I missed the lace - I saw the officer find it at the feet of a woman who was in the room.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was fetched to this room at half-past ten o'clock in the morning, and found the prisoners, prosecutrix, and two more women in the room - they said they were all innocent - I looked round the room and found the lace laying down - another woman picked it up, and said "Here is the lace!" it must have fallen from Kelly - it was on the toe of her shoe - it was not there when I first went in.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>- GRIFFITHS. I have known Kelly twenty-three years. I happened to go into the room about ten o'clock- the constables were there - I happened to pick up the lace; I saw a bit of white paper lay by the side of the drawers - I kicked it with my feet, turned it out and handed it to the gentleman, and said "There is the lace." It was not picked up at Kelly's feet.</p>

            . I saw it lay on Kelly's toe - this woman said "Oh, here is the lace!" she stooped down and picked it up; it was not wrapped in any paper.</p>
               <p>- GRIFFITHS. It was close to me, but not to Kelly.</p>
               <p>Q. The officer says it was not wrapped in any paper - what do you say to that? A. I have nothing to say - I picked it up.</p>
               <p>Q. You have sworn it was in paper - was it so or not? A. Well then, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it was in paper? A. I do not know - I really will say now that it was in a bit of white paper - but I will not contradict the gentleman, for he ought to know better - I know there was a little bit of white paper about it.</p>

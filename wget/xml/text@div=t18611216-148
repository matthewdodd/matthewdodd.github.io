                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my father, Morris Harris, and my brother, Simeon Morris Harris, as rag merchants, in Barron's-place, Waterloo-road, Southwark—the prisoner Johnson was in our service as fore<lb></lb>man, and Rowlands as carman—Baldwin had been in our service as a labourer up to within a few days of the robbery—Johnson resides in a house abutting the roof of our warehouse—on Friday, 29th November, I marked a bag con<lb></lb>taining white flannel rags, and saw others marked; one of them contained cloth cuttings—on the Saturday, I, and my brother, and a police constable concealed ourselves in the warehouse between 5 and 6 in the afternoon—we had not done any business that day, being the Jewish Sabbath—after we had been there about an hour, it must have been about half-past 6, I heard the window of the house adjoining our premises opened—I then heard some steps on the tiles just over our heads—the steps continued along the tiles, and presently I saw some laths, which form a portion of the roof, removed, and the prisoners Baldwin and Rowlands descend from the roof into the ware-house—the laths extend some fourteen feet, but the opening made was, I should imagine, from six to eight feet, and about four or five feet wide—after that a bag was carried by Baldwin up a ladder which is usually placed there, and put on the tiles; two other bags were then passed through this opening. on to the tiles, by both the prisoners, and they then got—out on the tiles; but I should have stated that there was a man on the tiles whom I could not distinguish at the time—I then heard the bags rolled along the tiles, and heard them drop down the wall into the yard at the side of the warehouse, which yard is the fore-court of the prisoner Johnson's—e—I afterwards went out of the warehouse, and saw Baldwin in the custody of a police-officer, and Johnson and Rowlands running from a van which stood at the door laden with rags—I went a short distance down the street, and saw Johnson in the custody of my brother—I then returned and took Rowlands into custody, and handed him over to the police-officer; he had run down an entry which I knew had no thoroughfare—there were some bags in the van—I did not know who they belonged to, but three of them were our property, and part of those marked on the Friday—there were five or six other bags of rags in the van.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What sort of a warehouse is this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is a large ware-house; the portion now in question is one floor only, but at the end there is a building, which some years back was used as a stable and provender loft, and that loft is now converted into a rag store—the loft is about ten or twelve feet from the floor of the warehouse—rags are stored in the loft and also on the floor of the warehouse; we have some hundreds of tons there—the warehouse is lighted with gas—the gas was not lighted on this evening—there are no windows, only about fourteen feet of these lath openings; the laths are about three inches wide, and are placed about four inches apart—that is the only means of light—the weight of one of these bags would be from about 1 1/2 cwt. to 1 3/4 ewt.; one bag weighed more—I have not weighed them since—that is the average weight of a bag of flannel rags—the size would be from about four to five feet long and three feet wide.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my father and brother—I was concealed in the warehouse this evening, with my brother and the policeman—I heard the window of the house, belonging to the prisoner Johnson, open, and I saw three persons get out of the window on to the roof of our warehouse—I saw that through the lattice work, which looks on to Johnson's house—I could not at that time see who the three persons were—I heard them walk along the roof until they reached the loft; they then removed some palings or laths, and made an opening of some seven or eight feet, or it might be more—Baldwin and Rowlands then descended into the loft—I saw them get down the ladder—Rowlands then lifted a bag of rags on to the back of Baldwin, and Baldwin earned it up the ladder, and placed it on the tiles, assisted by Rowlands—Baldwin then stepped on to the ladder again, and from thence into the loft, and took two bags out of the loft, and put on the tiles—they then got on the tiles themselves; but, previous to that, I heard a remark made by Rowlands, "Here is a <hi rend="italic">whacker,"</hi> that was speaking of the first bag, which was very heavy; and, while in the act of rolling it on to the tiles, it caught the edge of the gutter, and he said, "Hold hard, it catches," or, "it has caught; all right"—when they got on the tiles they replaced the laths, and commenced rolling the bags along the tiles, towards the end of the warehouse which looks into the fore-court of Johnson's house—I then got upon a stack, formed of some bags of rags, and looked through the lattice work into Johnson's yard, and I saw Johnson standing in the yard or fore—court, seven or eight yards up the fore-court—I saw the bags thrown down to him by those on the tiles; they then passed through the window of the house, and came down and assisted each other to put the bags on each other's backs, and carry them to the van—they all assisted in that—we then made the best of our way to the counting-house, and through that into the street—some noise was made in opening the door, and a remark was made, such as, "There is some one coming"—I ran towards the van, and saw Johnson running from the van—I ran after him, and caught him within a very short distance of the horse's head—Rowlands also ran away, and con<lb></lb>cealed Limself down a little right of way adjoining our warehouse—I did not see where Baldwin was.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186112160098"></xptr>
               <p>—the others were not thrown down in the same way; not at that time—they might have been earlier in the day; but none but the three were thrown down that evening, and they were thrown from our warehouse, not from Johnson's window—we had commenced watching at 4 o'clock—I don't know that the other six bags were Johnson's; they came from his house—I don't know that they are not ours; I would sooner say they were than they were not, although we cannot identify them—we deal—in that description of bags.</p>

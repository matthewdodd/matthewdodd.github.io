                  </hi>. I had a quantity of ashes on some waste land at Acton, Middlesex. The prisoner came to my wife about purchasing them, on the 21st of January—I declined selling them—next morning I missed a quantity, and went to Starch-green and found the prisoner there—he had a cart and horse standing at a small distance from his house, with his name on the back of it—there was an appearance of ashes having been in it—I ac<lb></lb>cused him of taking my ashes—he denied it—I took him into custody, and in the cage he said he did take them, and that he thought he had a right to them, as they lay on waste—he said if I would forgive him he would bring them back, and give me a load of dung besides—they were worth about 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there was about sixteen or twenty bushels.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gardener. I recollect seeing the prisoner on the 22nd of January, loading the ashes at Mr. Burleton's, which laid by the side of the road on waste ground, about fifty yards from the premises—he took about half of them—a boy was him—he threw them up into a caret, and drove off with them—I did not interfere, not knowing whether he had bought them.</p>

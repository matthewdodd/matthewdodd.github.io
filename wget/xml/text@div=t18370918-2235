                  </hi>. I lodge in Bryan's-yard, Greenwich. I never saw the prisoner till she was in custody—I left my gown behind the parlour door of my house—I rent the house myself—I went into the town about nine o'clock, to fetch some articles from where I work—the policeman fetched me about half-past ten, and said the gown was stolen—I found it at the station-house—I had left my sister-in-law at home with two children—this is the gown—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>).</p>

I live with the prosecutor, who is my sister in-law—I was at home—the gown hung behind the door—I went out at half-past nine o'clock, leaving it safe, and a little boy nine years old, and a little girl of five at home—the room is on the ground-floor—the door goes with a spring-lock—I did not fasten it, but drew it to—when I re turned the gown was gone—the prisoner's daughter has done a little work for me—she lives close to us—I am a dressmaker—both the children were fast asleep.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 19th of August I received information that a gown was stolen—I saw the prisoner and her daughter in the wash-house of a house—the place was dark, and I suspected them as there was an alarm—I sent Williamson to look for the prosecutrix, and then saw the prisoner come out of the out-house with a bundle, with her daughter—I said I must search them—she returned into the house—I said I must search it—I took a candle, and searched all round the place—I then told her to step aside, and picked up the gown from where she was standing.</p>

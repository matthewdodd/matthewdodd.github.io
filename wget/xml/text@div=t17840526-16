               <p>Whose house do you call this; who is the officer that lives there? - I look upon it to belong to the Paymaster.</p>

            . I believe there will be no occasion to trouble you.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Willes. The only difference is, if it is not stealing out of the dwelling house, it is not a capital offence, that is all the difference.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Where did your watch hang? - It generally hung at the bed's head, my bed room was on the second floor.</p>
               <p>What might be the value of it? - I cannot positively say, it cost me seventeen guineas, there were two cornelian seals set in gold; on Monday the 3d of May, when I came home in the evening, my wife said she had been very much alarmed, that a strange man had been found in her dressing room; I did not miss my watch till Thursday following; Mrs. Bunbury was taken ill that night, and I did not think of my watch; I did not usually carry this watch in my pocket, it was the watch she used to wear; I went the next morning after I missed it to Bow-street, and had it advertised, and there I found my watch and the prisoner, on whom it was said to be taken.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you recollect at all how long before it was you had seen this watch? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>Being Mrs. Bunbury's watch, you had not frequently seen it? - No, it generally hangs at the bed's head; I cannot say upon oath, but I think it was at the bed's head the day before, which was the 3d.</p>
               <p>You did not miss it till the 6th? - No.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner in your hearing give any account how he came by the watch in Bow-street? - Yes, I think he said he won it at cards, that he played three guineas against it to the best of my recollection; he said it was in some alley out of Leadenhall-street, but he could not describe it; the prisoner has totally altered his dress since he was at Bow-street, and he had his hair tied.</p>

               <p>I belong to Bow-street Office; I and another man apprehended the prisoner on the 3d of May about four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. What time on Monday, the 3d of May, was it you came home? - I did not come home till evening, but there is a witness that will speak to the time he was seen.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I beg Mr. Bunbury's servants may go out of Court.</p>
               <p>Court to Lebar. Where did you apprehend him? - In Pearl-street, Spital-fields; I imagine he was just come from his father's house; I apprehended him on another affair; I seized him in the street, we put him in a hackney coach in Bishopsgate-street, and conveyed him to Bow-street; I searched him directly as he got into the coach; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178405260037"></xptr> found this watch upon him in his right-hand.</p>
               <p>Was it in the condition it is in now? - Yes.</p>
               <p>(The watch produced, and deposed to by Mr. Bunbury.)</p>
               <p>Court. Did the prisoner give you any account of that watch? - He said he had won it that day at cards, at a coffee-house in Leadenhall-street.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Is it gold enamelled? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are the seals set in gold? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Lebar. What became of the watch? - I have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it is the watch you took from him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What distance is it from Whitehall to the place you apprehended the prisoner? - About three miles.</p>
               <p>Near his father's house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he persist in the same story at Bow-street? - I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Has he been uniform in that story? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Leadenhall-street, where he describes, is near the place where you apprehended him? - About three-quarters of a mile.</p>
               <p>Is it in the road to his father's house? - It is in that neighbourhood.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant to Mr. Bunbury; I saw the prisoner come to my master's apartments between two and three, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>What did he come there for? - He enquired for a young lady whose name I cannot remember, he was in the dressing-room when I saw him.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The door is open at the bottom of the stair-case.</p>
               <p>Court to Petch. Was any body in the room? - No.</p>
               <p>What did you say to him? - My mistress was in the drawing-room, and she was ending me up for a sheet to lay on the sopha; I asked him who he wanted, he said he had been knocking this half hour, and could make nobody hear, and he mentioned the name of Miss somebody, which I cannot remember, and I told him there was no such person in the house; he moved his hat, and said he was sorry for the trouble he had taken.</p>
               <p>Was he dressed as he is now? - No.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that is the man? - Yes; I called the maid servant, and asked her if she knew that gentleman; she said no; he also moved his hat to her and went down stairs, and I followed him; he moved his hat at the door, and said he was sorry for the trouble he had taken; the door was upon the latch, and he opened it and went out.</p>
               <p>Are you sure this is the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Is not there a door out of the dressing-room into the bedchamber? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How was the prisoner dressed? - He had an olive green coat on, and a round hat, and his hair was tied and very elegantly dressed.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen that person before? - No.</p>
               <p>How soon did you see him again? - In Bow-street, he was charged with this robbery.</p>
               <p>He had a fetter upon his leg? - Yes, he had.</p>
               <p>All that corroborated a little towards inducing you to swear him? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>This was at the distance of four days? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had not seen him in the mean time? - No.</p>
               <p>Is the stair-case light? - Yes, very light.</p>
               <p>Could you have sworn to the man if you had met him in the street, would you have said that is the gentleman that was at our house? - Yes, Sir, I saw him there.</p>
               <p>And that helped you pretty much? - No.</p>
               <p>You say you think you should have known him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Why a flap round hat does not help one much to know a man again; was his hair<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178405260038"></xptr> well dressed at the Justice's? - I do not recollect it, his coat was a sort of olive green, inclinable to brown.</p>
               <p>That is pretty difficult to describe; did you swear to him at the Justice's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Positively? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Could not your fellow servant see him as well as you? - He was a very pale faced young man.</p>
               <p>And you following him, and seeing the back of his well dressed head, could swear to his pale face? - She did not see his face not two minutes.</p>
               <p>How many minutes might you see him? - Not long, I do not know how long; Mrs. Harris said, she believed him to be the man.</p>
               <p>You are not sure that you should have known him any where but at the Justices, with a fetter on, standing at the bar? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Court. I think you said before, you should have known him, are you sure that is the man by seeing him fettered, or by the recollection you have of his person? - I am sure that is the man that was in the house.</p>

               <p>What did you say about the hour at the Justices? - I told him it was about two or three.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Yes; I do not recollect particularly.</p>

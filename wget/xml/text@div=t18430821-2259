                  </hi>. I am an unfortunate girl, and live at No. 26, Baker-street, Bedford-square. On the 26th of August I and a friend had been out, and on returning felt rather thirsty, and went into the Bedford-Arms to have a glass of porter—the prisoner was there, and a female who had lodged with her had a bunch of flowers, she asked me to smell them, and gave me one—the prisoner then became very angry, and used a great many blackguard words, then struck me on the left temple with her first, and after that took up a carpenter's mallet which was on the table I believe, and struck me on the left temple with it—I had not struck her—I fell, and do not know what happened after—I believe she was a little in liquor—we had had a few words four or five months before, but nothing to signify—I cannot tell why she struck me with the mallet—she keeps a brothel, and is like me as well.</p>

                  </hi>. I went to the public-house with Mrs. Taylor—some workmen were doing repairs—I saw a girl there with flowers—she asked Taylor to smell them, and I believe she took one—some words passed between her and the prisoner—she said, "You are very fast in taking the flowers"—Taylor said, "They have nothing to do with you—they do not belong to you"—the young woman said, "Do not have any words about them"—with that I believe the prisoner struck Mrs. Taylor with her fist—the landlord came in, and there was a wrestling together—Mrs. Taylor said she had a fight first herself, but I did not see it—I saw them struggling—the</p>

               <p>landlord tried to part them—I saw the prisoner strike her with a mallet and put her out—I went to put my shawl on the bar, and when I returned they were fighting again at the bar—it commenced in the tap-room—she struck her with the mallet about two minutes after striking her with the fist—they both struck at the first, and the landlord parted them; that was when she struck with the mallet—Taylor threw off her bonnet and shawl after the first blow was struck.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> She prepared for battle, did not she? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I suppose so—I do not know that she is considered a fighter—they are all alike in that neighbourhood—I did not see the centre-bit thrown—Taylor declared to me that it was not a centre-bit, but a pipe, but not till after we were before the Magistrate—she told me she had shammed ill, and <hi rend="italic">done the beak.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever say Taylor did not strike her, and if she did you could not have seen it for the prisoner was at the top of her?

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Hertford-terrace, Commercial-road. I examined the prosecutrix, and found a contused wound on the right side of the head, with corresponding swelling on the op<lb></lb>posite side, a bruise under each eye, and several abrasions of the skin about her face—the wound on the head might have been inflicted with a mallet—those on the face I consider to have been done by the nails—we consider all wounds on the head dangerous, for fear of inflammation—the skin was broken superficially, and there was effusion of blood under it—there was no concus<lb></lb>sion, nor any thing very serious—she may not he said to be out of danger now, taking into consideration her habits of life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you prepared to swear the blow was not done with a fist? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—any abrasion of the skin in a woman of her habits would be dangerous—as I was coming into court just now, the prosecutrix said to me, "You must make my case as serious as possible."</p>

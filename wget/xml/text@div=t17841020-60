               <p>Court to Coachman. What enquiry did you make of West? - We gave a description of his person, Mr. Silvester's country-house is at Stewardstone in Essex, three miles and a half from Waltham Abby; West told me at first he purchased him at Uxbridge for five pounds ten shillings, and paid four guineas and left one pound six to pay; I went to Uxbridge and found every thing true as he had said, I staid there till between four and five, and in my way back I met West and another man, he came back the same night on the Monday, it was not convenient for me to go to Essex, I went on Tuesday, I then took him to market about twenty yards in the town, he said this is the man, says I be you sure you make no mistake; Currer gave the same account at the Falcon.</p>
               <p>Did you know any thing of the prisoner? - I never saw him to my knowledge, tho'<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200099"></xptr>he does not live above three miles from our house.</p>
               <p>Do you know the gardener? - I believe he is something of an odd man to go in there occasionally when my Lord comes down to his country house, he might have been a servant many years, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. When was this man committed? - On Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The coachman told me when he took me that he would carry me to Bow-street and send for some friends, instead of which they carried me to Hicks's-hall, and to New-prison, I sent for this old gentleman, I had no other in the world to speak for me; if I was not innocent I should be willing to suffer.</p>
               <p>Jury to West. Who wrote that note? - The prisoner.</p>

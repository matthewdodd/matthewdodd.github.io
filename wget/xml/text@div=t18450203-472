The prisoner lodged there—I was making up a silk dress—I put it in one of the drawers in the room where he was lodging between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, before be left—no one but him went into the room except Redding the servant, who waited on him—the prisoner left about two o'clock the next day—directly he was gone I went to the drawer to look for my dress, and missed it—I saw the prisoner about three weeks afterwards in St. Mary Axe—I told him about the dress—he said he had lost a pin in the house, and if I would give him the pin he would return the silk, or tell me where it was, I cannot say which, as I was behind him.</p>

You are soon back from France"—he said he had not been—I said I came to inquire about a silk dress—he said, "Me lost a pin in your house, if you give me pin I will tell you about the silk"—I think there has been a deal of undermining work through the whole piece—there were two witnesses bribed to keep away, and a woman has been brought up to say anything against me.</p>

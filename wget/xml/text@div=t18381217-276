I was at work on Lord Mansfield's grounds—I heard Harrington call out about twenty-five mi<lb></lb>nutes after one—when I came out I saw the bag and the lead lying in the field—he pointed out to me the direction in which they were gone—I went in pursuit, and in about five minutes overtook the two men—I got within twenty yards of them, but did not stop either of them—I noticed them sufficiently to be able to say the prisoner is the one I spoke to—I told him to stop—I am certain of him—I have no doubt—he did not stop, but ran on—they got over the fence, and ran into the wood—I called to our carpenter and others to pursue them—I did not notice any thing the matter with either of the men's hands myself—I looked at the fence where the lead was taken from, and saw the appearance of flesh and skin, as if somebody had been torn by the hook or spike—I did not see any blood.</p>

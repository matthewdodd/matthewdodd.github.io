             sworn. - On Saturday, the 11th of August, I lost a pair of cotton stockings, and a cotton shirt from my lodgings in <placeName id="t17990911-95-crimeloc517">Gee's-court, Oxford-road</placeName>

               <p>Q. Do you know how she got into the room? - A. No, (produces them); I brought seven cotton shirts from Bengal in the East Indies, and this is all I have got left of them; I am sure the stockings are mine, but they have no particular mark upon them.</p>

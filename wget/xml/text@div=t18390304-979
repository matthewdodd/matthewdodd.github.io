                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Haylock—we live in Westbourne-street, Pimlico. On the 16th of February I hung out a counterpane to dry, at half-past nine o'clock, in our yard, which is in the building yard, where the shops are—I missed it in about ten minutes—one of the men said that a man had just gone out of the yard—I went and asked him if he had got it—he said no, but two girls had been there—he came down from where he was at work, and went and brought the prisoner with the counterpane in her lap—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it.</hi>)</p>

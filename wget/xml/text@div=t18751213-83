                  </hi>. I am clerk at the Marlborough Street police-court—on 21st October I was present on the hearing of this summons and took notes, which I have here—Annie Dobson was called for the defence and swore that she lived at 42, South Bank and was servant to Mrs. Wilkinson; that on Thursday Mr. Sinclair came to supper at 9 o'clock and that Mrs. Wilkin<lb></lb>son was not out that night, but dined at 7 o'clock and supped there and was there the whole evening—it was not stated at what time she went to bed, but she spoke to midnight, or nearly midnight—this was on the evening of the 14th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The Argyle Rooms are within the jurisdiction of the Marlborough Street police-court—I have been at that court over eight years and have heard of these little pleasantries between ladies at the Argyle before this—it is necessary that the abusive language should be used in a public thoroughfare—Miss Morton was called on the hearing and also Catherine Newroth and Ellen Sinclair—I recollect Miss Morton saying that she had complained to the manager of the Argyle Rooms of Mrs. Wilkinson's conduct to her, but I have not got it on my note—the manager was called on the hearing of the perjury charge, and I think he contradicted her; his evidence is in writing—a good many summonses are disposed of of an after<lb></lb>rnoon, and Mr. Knox does not waste time over them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 87, Winchester Street, Pimlico—Mrs. Newroth is my landlady—Mrs. Bransen also lived there on 14th October, but she does not now—Madame Giovanni also lives there, "we call her <hi rend="italic">The, Senorina</hi>—I formerly lived with Mrs. Jane Wilkinson, at 42, South Bank, Regent's Park, and left, owing her some money, on the evening of 14th October—I dined at 6 o'clock with my landlady and her husband, and Mrs. Branson and her daughter, from Ireland, and Madame Giovanni, as it was Madame Gio<lb></lb>vanni's birthday—after dinner I went to the Argyle with my landlady, we got there at 10 o'clook—I saw Mrs. Wilkinson come into the rooms at 11 o'clock precisely, she wore a black silk dress and a black bonnet with a tiny red and white rose and two scarlet feathers hanging behind—I saw her again upstairs, and again about 12 o'clock, but I did not speak to her—it was a little after 11, or from that to 12 o'clock, when the lights were being put out that I came downstairs with my landlady—Madame Giovanni and Fanny Hamilton and another lady, a stranger to us, were there, and Mrs. Wilkinson made use of very bad language to me inside the rooms—we left, and she came out after us and insulted me in the road as I went along—I took no notice, but got into a cab and went home with the French lady and my landlady—I went to Marlborough Street police-court next morning and took out a summons, which was made returnable on the 21st, and on the 21st I attended at Marlborough Street and gave evidence, and my landlady also on my behalf—the defendant was called as a witness for the defence and swore that Mrs. Wilkinson was not there—I saw Mr. Rosenbaum, a hair dresser, outside the Argyle as I came out.</p>

               <p>agreed to pay her—she sued me in the County Court for 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. instead of 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I heard my solicitor put forward for the purposes of my defence that the articles supplied were for the purposes of prostitution, and that I was not bound to pay for them—the money has never been paid to Mrs. Wilkinson—I have met her several times since April at the Argyle Rooms and she has abused me in the rooms on several occasions and outside also, but I never answered her in my life—I never made a formal charge to the Magistrate till the 15th—I did not make a complaint to the officials on the night of the 14th when this took place—the disturbance was confined to myself and my friends, except that one of the officials of the Argyle was talking to Mrs.—Wilkinson, and pointed us out—that was Mr. Higgins (<hi rend="italic">pointing to him</hi>)—I had last been at the Argyle on Tuesday evening, and this was Friday—I had been there frequently before, but they would not let me in on Tuesday, because I summoned Mr. Higgins to come and say that he was talking to Mrs. Wilkinson on that night; that was the Tuesday after this transaction I also went there on the Tuesday before and all the week—I had seen Mrs. Wilkinson there on other nights; she is there nearly every night, and she was there on the nights before the 14th when I say that this took place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I summonsed her for my own protection, and I summonsed Mr. Higgins as a witness for me to say that he was talking to her that night, and he came; but in consequence of that, I and all my witnesses were refused admission on the Tuesday after.</p>

October, and we all dined together, and after dinner we went to the Argyle Rooms—I saw Mrs. Wilkinson there—I had never seen her before; she wore a black dress, a darkish bonnet, and a red feather right across it—it was exactly 11 o'clock when my attention was called to her as she came. in—and I saw her up to the time of closing—she spoke to me in reference to Miss Morton and called her a b----y thief—when we left I saw her again outside with some elderly man and she used disgusting language—I went next day with Miss Morton to apply for a summons, and again on the 21st to support the summons—Mrs. Wilkinson put in an answer—she was the same person who I had seen at the Argyle Rooms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been at 87, Winchester Street, three years—I was at Townsend Road before that—there was a complaint against my house there by the parish authorities—there is nothing remarkable in a dark dress and a red feather in a hat, but if you see a person with it you know that they have got it on—if I saw any other woman with it I should know she had got it on, but Mrs. Wilkinson came up and talked to me—it is not usual for ladies at the Argyle to wear silk dresses and red bonnets—Miss Morton and I and <hi rend="italic">The Senorina</hi> and Mrs. Bransen were always in the habit of dining together in my room; I provide them with board and they have their own apartments—they do not often go out of an evening, but occasionally—Miss Morton very seldom goes out—she has not been at the Argyle every evening, not lately; they would not let us in there—she was not there every even<lb></lb>ing before this Thursday evening, she was in very bad health, and besides she is under the protection of a gentleman—she had lived with me three months before this, and she went out perhaps three or four nights a week, or it may have been six nights; she has no latch key, we do not allow that, the bell is rung and I have to let them in—the only man in the house is my</p>

The coach-house whence these articles were stolen, is behind the house; there is a communication between them. The coach-house and stable are together; and some of the servants sleep over the stable. The coach-house door was broken open on the night of the 21st of May, by a false key; a hammer-cloth, a box coat, and four coach glasses, were stolen that evening. I saw them safe when I locked up the stable at seven o'clock, and the next morning at nine, they were gone. I went into the stable directly after seven, and did not quit them until we went to bed. I slept over the stables. It was impossible for any one to get into the coach-house and get these things while I was awake, without our hearing; for we were so near; we went to bed about half after ten. I missed them at nine the next morning. I saw part of them the same morning, at Marlborough-street office, they were in the possession of the St. Giles's watchhouse-keeper, I can swear to them as the property of my master.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 21st of May, I was in Browlow-street, Long Acre, between one and two in the morning, I was standing talking to the patrole and another watchman, and I heard a foot coming along on the other side of the way; I crossed, leaving the patrole and watchman, and saw a man coming along with a box coat, and the prisoner was behind him. I knew the prisoner before; I saw some glass under his coat, by the light from my lanthorn. I went to lay hold of him; the other man ran off, and so did he. I cried stop thief, and sprung my rattle. He let drop the glass immediately. I never lost sight of him until he was stopped by my pal, the watchman; seeing him secured, I pursued the man with the box coat, which he dropped, together with the hammer-cloth, and escaped.</p>

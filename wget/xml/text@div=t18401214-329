                  </hi>. I am the son of Samuel Barnfield Bartington, a carver and gilder. I lost this painting and frame, which was outside his shop, at ten o'clock on the morning of the 10th of December—Leathart brought it to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Bath-place, Bayswater. About twelve o'clock on the 10th of December, I was in Wardour-street—I saw the two prisoners together, looking at a number of picture shops—I watched them—they went on to the prosecutor's—Gibbins took this picture down and looked at it—he put it down and came round the corner of the street—there they had some conversation, and went back—Walkeley then looked in at the window, while Gibbins passed and took the picture again—he put it under his arm and went down the street with it—Walkeley walked after him—I ran and caught Gibbins by the collar, and took him to the station—Walkeley came past us, and Gibbins said "Bill"—I turned my head, and Walkeley went on—a policeman came up—I gave him Gibbins, and ran and brought Walkeley back.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Gibbins' Defence</hi>. I was coming down Wardour-street alone—I do not know Walkeley—a gentleman said, "Will you carry this picture to Frith-street, and I will give you a pint of beer?"—I crossed over, and he said, "Make haste—run up here"—I went on—Leathart took me, and said, "Where are you taking this?"—I said, "That is my business"—I think it was a planned thing.</p>

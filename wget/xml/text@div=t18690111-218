                  </hi>. I live at 3, Grasshopper Court, St. Luke's, and I am a cos<lb></lb>termonger—the prisoner is my wife—on Saturday night, 19th December, I had been at work very hard, and I went home the worse for drink—I laid down on the floor and fell fast asleep—my wife was not in the room then—I was awoke by finding blood coming from my neck—I think it might have been 1, or 1.30, I can't tell the time—my wife was then in the room—I said "Holloa, how has this been done?"—I found my waistcoat and trowsers had been undone, and she had taken my money out of my pocket—she said, I have done it, and will do it again before 7 o'clock in the morning; you aint dead yet"—what with the loss of blood, and the little drink I had I fell into a sort of sleep again, with my head against the fire-place, and the next thing I recollect was being woke up by two policemen who were in the room with my wife—the blood was running down my neck then—the po<lb></lb>liceman said to her, "What have you <hi rend="italic">done</hi> this with?"—she said, a "A knife"—he said, "Where is the knife you <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it with?"—she said, "That is not the knife, it was a white handled knife, I can find it, "or" get it out of the cupboard"—she had put it into the coal cupboard—it was fetched from the cupboard, and she said, "That is the knife I <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it with," and she told me she had given herself up.</p>

About 3 o'clock on the morning of the 20th December, the prisoner came to me while I was on my beat and said, "I want you to take me into custody; I have stabbed my husband"—I said You are a foolish woman; you had' better be careful what you say"—she said "I have done it, and I meant to do it; I can show you the knife I done it with; it was a white—handled one"—she said if she was not locked up she would finish him before 7 in the morning—she took me and another constable to her home, and I there found the prose<lb></lb>cutor sitting by the fire—I saw a wound on his neck, which was bleeding profusely—she repeated her statement that she had done it—her son brought this knife from the cupboard, and immediately she saw it she said, "Yes, that is the knife I done it with."</p>

On Friday the 3d of March, I left home with notes to the amount of 84 l. - a 30 l. bank note, a Portsmouth one-pound note, and three one-pound bank notes I noticed.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, in the course of the day had you drank so as not to be sober - A. I had drank a little, and the liquor affected me.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of the night did you pass Catherine-street - A. I did; I had been to Tothil-street to buy tallow; returning home I met with the two prisoners, they began hustling me about my breast pocket, they felt so as to ascertain I had a pocket book there; they followed me; I was going to the alamode beef shop; this was about half past eleven o'clock at night. In Nag's-head court they asked me to treat them; I took them to a public house, I believe, I treated them, I went home with them to their lodgings; I felt the pocket-look safe not five minutes before I went into their lodgings; I did not count the notes, I saw the bulk of them, I thought they were safe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, when you went into their lodgings, lay down on the bed - A. I did, and went to sleep; they were both in the room when I went to sleep.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they lay down on the bed with you - A. They did not: I did not pull off my clothes; I awoke in the morning between three and four o'clock, the women were gone; my pocket-book was in my pocket, but the notes were gone; upon that I raised an alarm.</p>
               <p>COURT. Where was this house that you went to - A. No. 3, Nag's-head-court, Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Upon your alarm, did Mr. King, the constable, come to you - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after that did you see the prisoners - A. In the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know them again - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the notes that you had lost - A. I did; I went before the justice, I there saw the notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any note that you could swear to - A. Yes, the thirty-pound note, I wrote Blackit upon it.</p>
               <p>COURT. How came you to go with a couple of women - A. I did not know who they were.</p>
               <p>COURT. You do not mean to be believed, because you cannot think the jury will believe you; if a man got into a scrape, he ought to tell the whole truth - who can believe that you did not know what these women were, and that you went there to lay down on the bed.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Clement's Danes. In consequence of an alarm made by the prosecutor, I went to No. 3, Nag's-head-court, Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know whether the prisoners occupied that room - A. I can only speak from information; I have seen them come out of the house and go in - and from information I received there, I went to No. 7, Bembridge-street, about half past seven the same morning; I took with me Booth the patrol; I went into a one pair of stairs back room, there I found the two prisoners; on my entering the room,

I directly picked them up; I found it consisted of six one-pound bank notes, and a Portsmouth one-pound note; Booth then took her and searched her. I afterwards searched Holt; I found a thirty-pound, a twenty-pound, and ten five-pound notes; I and Booth took them away; all these notes were produced at the office. I have the thirty-pound note and the Portsmouth note; the other notes were given back to the prosecutor.</p>

            . Q. When your husband went out on the 3d of March, did he receive any notes from you - A. I gave him eighty-four pounds in notes - one note was a thirty-pound bank note, Blackit on the back, and a Portsmouth one-pound note.</p>

               <p>Holt's Defence. On that evening we were walking in the Strand, between the hours of twelve and one; this gentleman asked me where I was going; I said home; he was very much intoxicated indeed; he said he had some property; he gave them me to take care of; this young woman knows nothing of it; I went to get something to drink, I stopped longer than I ought to have done; these gentlemen came and took me; the gentleman was so drunk at the first examination, that he could not be examined.</p>

On the 5th of December I came up from Queenborough, to go to Somerset-house, to receive his half-pay; I received three sovereigns, and 5s. 4d. I left Somerset-house about twelve o'clock, and went to Billingsgate, but was too late for the boat; as I returned the prisoner stood on the stairs, and said, if I would give her a glass of any thing to drink she would show me a boat that was going away - I went into a house, and gave her a glass of gin; I did not sit down; we came out; she said, "I can't find any boat;" I said, "Very well, good night." I was going to Fleet-street; I went into the Three Cranes public-house, to get a pint of beer, and there the prisoner came in with some friends; she asked me for drink, and I drank with her; I then said I would pay for some more; she then asked how much I had got, and how much I had laid out; she was at the bar; I went into a side room, took out my money, and put it down on the table - I had two sovereigns, and nearly 1l. in silver; she came in behind me, and took a sovereign off the table; she ran outside the little room, came in again in about five minutes, and put down a sixpence: I said nothing to her - I do not think she left the house - I said, "That is not the money you took;" she abused me very much, and I said,"You had better give me the money back again, or I shall see further into it." I gave her in charge.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took the prisoner in charge, and said, "Mary, I must search you;" she used some dreadful language, and stripped herself quite naked; she flew at a man in the tap-room, and beat him; she was made to put her clothes on again, and in going along, from inside her portering-hat, this sovereign slipped down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Robert Davis, who keeps a beer<lb></lb>shop, in George-street, Chelsea. I missed a saucepan off the cellar stain, on the 15th of January, between half-past ten and eleven o'clock—I had seen it at ten—I saw it again at about a quarter to eleven, in the bands of Poole, the policeman—I did not see the prisoner at all.</p>

On the evening of the 15th of January, I saw the prisoner in Wilderness-row, Chelsea, with a saucepan in her hand—I had received information, and asked how she came by it—she said she had been to have it repaired—I examined it and found no repairs on it—on the road to the station, she said she had borrowed it of her daughter, and was going to take it home, that her daughter lived at No. 9, Ranelagh-grove—I went there, and no such person was known there—I returned to the station, and said so in her hearing—she then said it was No. 5, Flask-row—I went there, and found the daughter—I returned and told her that her daughter said she had lent her nothing—she said nothing to that.</p>

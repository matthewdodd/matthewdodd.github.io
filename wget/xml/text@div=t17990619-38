I laid hold of him and would not let him go; he got behind me, and put his leg behind me, and got me down, and kicked me in the teeth, and several parts of the body; there was a soldier coming by, and he charged the soldier to assist him, for that I was a deserter, and had made my escape, he had my handkerchief in his hand at the same time; he was taken to the watch-house. I knew him before, for I had him tried last Sessions at Hicks's-hall, for cutting my water-pipe; it belonged to Mr. Biley because I had the house of him; there had been no other dispute.</p>

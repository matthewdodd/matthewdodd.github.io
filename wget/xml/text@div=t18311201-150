            . I am a constable. I was in Skinner-street between six and seven o'clock in the evening of the 1st of November; I heard a cry of Stop thief! and crossed the road at the corner of Turnagain-lane, and heard the child cry out again; the prisoner came running up as fast as he could - I took him down the lane; the child had a crowd of people round him: as soon as he saw the prisoner he said, "That is the man who took my umbrella;" he pointed him out from the other people; I saw no one running but the prisoner.</p>

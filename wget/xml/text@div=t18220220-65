On Tuesday afternoon, the 12th of February, about four o'clock, I went out, and left my wife, child and nurse at home. The nurse fetched me at a quarter before six o'clock I found the glass of the parlour window broken open; I had left it secure. My flutes were on a board in the window exposed for sale. I found a flute removed from where I left it; it was within reach of a person's hand.</p>

            . I am a city patrol. On the 12th of February, about a quarter before six o'clock, I was coming by, and saw the prisoner in company with two others, lurking about Powell's window. I went back, passed them, and saw the prisoner and another close to the window, and the third opposite, looking about. I got into a door-way, and think he saw me, for he went over to them, and they came away towards me. I collared them both, and took them into a public-house; and found a knife on the prisoner, with putty on the blade. I found a pane of glass partly out, and the flute five or six inches out of the hole. I knocked and told the servant. While they were at the window I heard something fall like glass. One was discharged.</p>

            . I was nursing Mrs. Powell. Carlisle alarmed me. I had closed the shutters about half-past five o'clock, but did not fasten them - the glass was whole then, and the flute safe. I heard no more.</p>

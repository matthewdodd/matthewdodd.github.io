                  </hi>. I am the landlord of the Gordon Arms public-house, in High Holborn. I saw the prisoner at my house about three o'clock in the afternoon, on the 8th of November—I asked what his business was— he said he was waiting for his father—I let him remain some time, and asked him again if his father was come—he said no, that his father was a chaff-cutter, and worked in the Mews—I let him stay till about seven o'clock, and then sent him off—I was called the next morning at six o'clock—I found the bar had been disturbed, and a bag and 144 pence, 240 halfpence, and 144 farthings taken—they had been in a drawer in my bar—the lock of it had been opened, and fastened up again—the house had been safely fastened up at twelve o'clock the night before—it is my dwelling-house, and in the parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields—on the same evening, the prisoner came to the house, and I put him out of doors—on the 10th he was there again, and on the 11th, about nine at night, the Pot-boy found him stowed away in the lumber-room, and I pulled him out—He was searched, and this bag and purse, and a pamphlet, in which there had been two shillings' worth of farthings, were found on him.</p>

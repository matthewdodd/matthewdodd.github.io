               <p>Q. Were you at home on the twelth of January - A. Yes, I was when the prisoner came into my front parlour, and my watch was hanging up under my mantle-piece. I saw it there while the prisoner was in the room, he lodged in my house about four months, paid me three months, and left me one month in debt; that was about a year and a half ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner come in - A. Yes, he said, how do you do, old woman? I owe you a little money, I am come to settle with you. He asked me what it was, I said fourteen shillings. He said he would call and pay me on the next Wednesday, this was on a Friday; then he asked me how a gentleman in my house did up stairs. I said, very poorly, go up and see him He did, he came down into my room again. I saw him take a Jew's harp that my child played with; he said, good bye, took hold of my hand, and went, out of the room, saying he would call and pay me next Thursday. I turned my head to see what o'clock it was to put on my tea-kettle, the watch was gone, that was the very minute he was gone. I went to the street door directly to see which way he had gone, I could not see him. I made enquiries; the watch I found at Mr. Lane's, about an hour and a half afterwards.</p>

            . I am one of the Officers of Bow-street. I apprehended the prisoner. I told him to keep his hands out of his pockets. I took the duplicate of the watch out of his hand, the Jew's harp I found in his pocket. I apprehended him the same evening about six o'clock.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming from the city, and passing by Mrs. Knight's door, she asked me to come in, and after I had been in her room some time, she asked me if I had any money to get her some gin. She desired me to pawn the watch and bring in a pint of gin. I went and pawned the watch. After I came out of there, I met a friend, and spent fifteen pence of Mrs. Knight's money. Not being willing to go back to Mrs. Knight's, I went to my lodgings to make the money up, and before I could get back again, an Officer came and took me at a Bookseller's in Piccadilly. Mrs. Knight knew that I had the Jew's harp likewise.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Knight. Upon the oath that you have taken, did you give him the watch, and desire him to pledge it - A. I never did, nor did I see him take it down; not a word was said about gin.</p>
               <p>Q. to Humphries. Did he say that he had the watch to pledge for Mrs. Knight - A. No, I charged him with taking the watch, he denied it.</p>

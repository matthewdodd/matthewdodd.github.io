                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-inspector, F</hi>). On 23d January I was sent for to Hall's house by Inspector Brannan—I went through the bar into the tap<lb></lb>room—the whole of the prisoners and the two Brannans were there—I heard the elder Brannan ask the prisoners how they accounted for being in possession of the counterfeit coin that was lying on the table—Hall replied, "I cannot say anything to it"—he was the only one that replied—In the presence of all the prisoners, I heard Inspector Brannan describe how he had found the coin; he also mentioned about the prisoners giving the "office" to Winter, and her throwing a packet into the fire—he pointed out a hole in the floor—he said, "I must see what you have down there"—Hall said, "I will get you the key," which he did—I and Inspector Brannan then went down into the cellar—when Brannan pointed out the hole, he said, "This hole is cut out for a purpose, and it is very convenient for the sort of customers you have in your house"—Hall said, "I never saw it before"—Brannan said, "I am sorry you have not attended to repeated cautions, and that you should not have had more thought for yourself"—Hall said, "If I drive such characters away from my house, I may as well shut it up altogether, but if I thought it was coming to this, I should have given infor<lb></lb>mation, certainly"—Brannan said, "That would have been a wise course, instead of which, you have traded in this way ever since you have been in the house"—Hall made no reply—I took him to the station.</p>

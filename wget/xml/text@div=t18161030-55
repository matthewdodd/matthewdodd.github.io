When he came down, he stood talking at my side with another boy. The prisoner told him to go on his own side, and mind his business; the boy made answer that he should not. The man gave the boy a shove, and the boy said if he did that again, he would kick his shins. The man told the boy if he would not hold his tongue, he would bring a chissel rod, and give him a good hiding. The boy repeated again that he would kick his shine. The prisoner had a spring-mander, which he threw at him in the heat of passion; it struck him on the forehead, and the prisoner went and pulled it out of his head; he exclaimed Oh God! what have I done; and he tore the hair of his head in handfuls, and the blood and froth came out at his mouth. He immediately took the boy in his arms, and took him to a coach.</p>
               <p>MR. MANN. I was in 1809 house surgeon to St. George's Hospital. The boy was brought to the Hospital, and I saw a small wound on his forehead; but from the account which I received, fatal consequences were to be expected; it had perporated the scull, gone a considerable way into the brain.</p>

As soon as this unfortunate affair had happened, which was in 1809, I went and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181610300032"></xptr>cave myself up to the boy's father, and a constable. The father said, I know he would sooner hurt himself then my son, and I went off down into the country immediately.</p>

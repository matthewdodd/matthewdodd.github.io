                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and live at Coventry. On the 26th of Sept. I was in Princes-street, by the Bank, about four, o'clock—I felt some<lb></lb>thing in my pocket, and at the same time a gentleman behind me told me something—I turned, and saw the gentleman with the prisoner in his custody—he said, "This man has taken your purse"—I saw the purse lying in the street—I picked it up, and the prisoner was given into custody—I delivered the purse to the policeman—this is it—it contained 15.—it was in my coat-pocket not more than a minute before.</p>

I was walking in Princes-street—I saw the prosecutor crossing from the opposite side to Princes-street, the prisoner and two others following him—one person whispered to the prisoner, and they walked on very fast to overtake the prosecutor—just as they got to the corner, one got on one side of him, the prisoner close behind him, and the other behind the prisoner—I observed the prisoner lay hold of the gentleman's pocket with his right hand, and take something out—he turned round, and I took him by the collar—I saw the purse in his hand, and saw it drop—the prosecutor picked it up—I called to the prosecutor, and some of the prisoner's friends tried to get him away from me, but I kept him till I met the officer.</p>

When they came to the pails which run along by the side of the foot path, they turned short round, and Harrison clapp'd a pistol against my breast, and said, stop, Sir. He took my watch out of my pocket, he took half a guinea out of my left-hand pocket and ten shillings out of my other pocket; he clapped his pistol against my breast and said don't look at me, but look another way, but I took such notice of his person that I am positive to him. After Harrison had done this, he went to my wife, put his hand to her pocket and took out some halfpence. The other man that was with Harrison likewise had a pistol. I mentioned the robbery at a public house the corner of Stepney causeway, the first but house I came to.</p>

            . I was with my husband and my little girl at the time we were robbed. As we went through Stepney church-yard, I saw two men, they looked at me, and I at them, but said nothing. Harrison was one of those men, and I believe Sell was the other. When we got to the field leading to the Green Dragon, which goes to Stepney causeway. I looked back when I was about the middle of the field, and observed the two men I had seen before in the church-yard, following us. They said it was a fine night. or some such thing, and passed us. They passed on to the pails, from whence they might see to Stepney causeway, then they turned short about, and one of them clapped a pistol to my breast, the other went to my husband; I believe it was Sell that put the pistol to my breast, but I am not certain as to him. I am sure Harrison is the person that took my husband's watch and money; Harrison came up to me after he had robbed my husband; my husband gave an account of the robbery at the next public house, and described the persons of the men that robbed him. I heard of their being taken on Monday night, but I did not see them till Tuesday, when they were before the justice; I knew Harrison immediately, for I kept my eyes upon him all the time.</p>

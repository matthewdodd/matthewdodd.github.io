On the 29th of December, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I was absent from home, and left the silk in the loom with him, in the first-floor. I returned about five o'clock, and missed him, and the silk. He never returned - he did not tell me he was going. On the Saturday after I found him in George-street, Whitechapel, and charged him with it - he denied it, and said I could not swear that he did take it. He used to sleep at my house. I have never found it. I had been told that somebody wanted me at No. 50, Wheeler-street - I went there, but found it was not true.</p>

I missed property while he was in my service, and in about three weeks or a month after he had left, he returned wishing me to take him into my service again; I told him I should not because he had robbed me, and said I should send for an officer; he said he hoped I would not, and he would confess all. I had said nothing more to him whatever; I did not say he might as well tell the truth, or any thing to induce him. I went for an officer, leaving him with Richards my shopman.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you instructed Richards to endeavour to get any confession from him, or to make him any threat - A. I had not. I returned with the officer, and found him still with Richards, who stated in his presence, all that he had said. I went to different pawnbrokers, by the prisoner's direction, and at each of them found property which was stolen while he was in my service.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESSWELL. Q. Did you miss it while he lived with you - A. Yes, and suspected him. I missed it three or four days before he left. I did not charge him with it. I sent my clerk round to all the pawnbrokers, but he found nothing; and a few days after the prisoner asked leave to go home to his friends; he went. I told my clerk that if he returned, to discharge him, which was done. I have eight shopmen, and did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182404070031"></xptr>know who to charge; he lived a year and a quarter with me. I believed him a faithful servant.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Walker. After the prisoner had left, he came to ask master to take him back. Mr. Walker's account of the conversation is correct; I heard it; he went out for an officer; he had not desired me to question the prisoner, or to make him any threat or promise; he left me in the counting-house with him, and as soon as he was gone the prisoner, was standing by the fire, he came up to the desk and asked me to let him go; I said, I certainly should do nothing of the kind; he burst into tears, and said he would tell the truth; he then leant on the desk. I took up a piece of paper and wrote down what he said; (reads,) he said he had taken a silk shawl. I asked what he had done with it, he said he had pledged it at Parson's, in Hounsditch; and had taken four lengths of lace, and pawned it in the name of Hart, at Flemming's, Whitechapel; and had also pawned a silk scarf or shawl there for 12 s., and four pairs of silk stockings, at Barker's; and six yards of sarsnet for 17 s., in the name of Hart, at Matthew's, in the Minories; he said nothing more; upon Mr. Walker's returning he was taken into custody. I went to the pawnbrokers' next morning, and found property corresponding with the account he gave me.</p>

               <p>MR. WALKER. I believe the silk shawl to be mine, but the mark is taken off. I missed one exactly like this; the sixty-six yards of lace I believe to be mine. I missed this very pattern, and know I had not sold it; it is worth eight or nine pounds; a single piece is worth 3 l. 10 s.; it cost more than 3 l.; the handkerchiefs and stockings are mine, the marks are taken off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There are thousands of yards of lace of this pattern - A. No doubt of it, I swear to the best of my belief. I have several handkerchiefs of the same pattern, and miss some; the shawl is rather an uncommon one.</p>

On the 18th of August I left the warehouse, a few minutes before seven o'clock, leaving nobody there - I saw the warehouse secured, and Mr. Frost's son took the keys home; it could not be opened except by force - I returned a few minutes after nine o'clock in the morning; Mr. Frost's son had opened the warehouse before that - I had left locked in my desk a snuff-box, five half-crowns, and a sixpence; also a black coat hanging on the rail; I found the desk forced open - my coat was also gone; I saw the coat and snuff-box at the Mansion-house that day, when Flinn was in custody - he had my coat on when taken; the five half-crowns and sixpence were produced - I had no mark on them; I found the warehouse in great confusion, every thing thrown in a heap into the middle - I missed an end of cloth, which I saw at the Mansion-house that day; I am certain it was safe in the warehouse overnight - a pane of glass, thirteen inches square, had been cut entirely out of the warehouse window; several ends of cloth were piled near the window - the cloth appeared to have been drawn through the pane; it was worth about 15l. - I did not notice the window overnight; a person could get through the pane into the warehouse - Lanagan was in the employ of a person who had an office on out premises; Mr. Frost lost a pair of boots, which I saw at the Mansion-house.</p>

On the 18th I was at the warehouse till Strachan left - it was quite safe, and the window was secure I am certain, for I always look at it; I returned at nine o'clock in the morning, before Strachan; I was the first person there - I unlocked the door with the greatest difficulty, for the cloths were so piled against it; they were in their proper places overnight - I missed one end; Strachan's desk was forced open, and his coat gone - Lanagan was in the habit of passing the door, but I never saw him in the warehouse; a cupboard was broken open, and two bottles of wine drank on the premises - several things were left behind.</p>

I took him to the Compter, searched him, and found a snuff-box, five half-crowns, and a sixpence on him, and some steel buttons; he had a dark coat on, and boots - I took the coat off at the Mansion-house, and Strachan claimed it; the boots were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160040"></xptr>brought to me from the Compter, and claimed by Mr. Frost - Strachan claimed the money and cloth as his master's; Flinn gave no account how he came by them.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Coleman-street: Mr. Frost's premises are on my beat. On the 19th of August, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, I was walking through Coleman-street, and saw a person in the passage which leads to Mr. Frost's warehouse - I believe it to be Flinn; he had three parcels on his shoulder - it appeared to be cloth; I did not stop him, as I saw Lanagan standing at the door of the warehouse at the same time, and believing him to belong to the premises, I had no suspicion; the door was open - I am certain of Lanagan's person; I took him into custody on the morning of the 20th, and asked if he was at Flinn's house the night before, or on the morning of the robbery - he said No; I asked if he was not in the court at all - he said he was not: Flinn lived in Blue Heart-court, Little Bell-alley - I took him to Flinn's house, and saw Flinn's sister; I said in his hearing,"Did any body call on your brother the evening before the robbery?" she said Yes; I said, "Is this the lad that called?" she said Yes; I asked if he had called on the morning of the 19th - she said he had; Flinn was not present.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you specify what day of the week you meant? A. I asked if he knew Flinn; he said he did not - that he had not been to his house the night before the robbery, nor in Blue Heart-court; I did not mention on what night the robbery was committed, but he was aware of it - I believe I have seen him before about the premises, but will not positively swear it; I think I have seen him a great many times going to and fro - his features are well known to me somewhere; I pass the place twelve or fourteen times a-day - I have been on duty in that street three or four months; I think I have seen him at evening and morning - I cannot say how often or how long before this; I never spoke to him - he had on a blue coat, and, I think, a light handkerchief; he had nothing with him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you quite certain he is the person you saw between seven and eight o'clock at the door of Frost's warehouse, which was open? A. The entrance door was open, and he stood at it.</p>

            . This is my coat; I had had it about a month - this snuff-box I am certain of, it is tortoiseshell; my cousin's initials are on it - he had left it in my care; five half-crowns and 6d. were produced at the Mansion-house - they were the exact coins I lost; this cloth is Mr. Frost's, and is worth about 15l. - I am certain it was in the warehouse over night when I left; Mr. Frost's name is on the boots - a strange pair of boots, and a strange old coat were left behind in the warehouse; they were not so good as those taken away - two broken chisels and two old keys were left in the warehouse; the flap of my desk was forced from the lock - the chisels appeared to have been used to force the cupboard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. By what mark do you know the cloth? A. By the number, 15,025, and mark; I saw the boots there in the course of the 18th - I know the coat by a rent in the button, which I made in sitting down; Lanagan worked for Mr. Taylor, the City printer, who has premises over ours.</p>

               <p>Flinn's Defence. I am employed by my father to deliver newspapers to the morning coaches, to go into the country - I went on the morning of this unfortunate affair, and when the newspapers are got rid of, the coachmen expect the venders to treat them with drink, which I did, and drank rather too freely; at the corner of Coleman-street I met a young man, previously known to me - he said, "I have got a roll of cloth - can you take it as far as Goswell-street for me?" I said I could - he took me up a gateway: he had the cloth, the boots, and coat, and three small bundles of paper - he said, "If you will take this cloth I will meet you in Old-street;" I said I could not, as I was obliged to go out, and had got a bad pair of boots on, as such I could not go - he said, "Well, here is a pair of boots, you can put them on, and you can put the coat on - and here is a snuff-box which I will give you to take the cloth;" I went on, staggered about, being rather in liquor, and the patrol stopped me - I answered him rather sharply, and told him I had brought it from Coleman-street; he said, "From any warehouse?" I said No, and wished him to come back, thinking the person would not be gone.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tradesman in Roman Road, Old Ford—I know Chater—on 9th August last he came to me with this cheque for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. dated 9th August, drawn by Alfred B. Rocke, payable to self or bearer, on Rocke and Co., Old Bank, Shrewsbury—he asked if I would pass it through my bankers for him—I at first objected, and asked where he got it from—he said he had taken it from Mr. March, a pawnbroker at Poplar, in payment of two cases of cigars; that he had been to Lubbock's bank, and they had told him that they had orders to pay, but being a crossed cheque it must be passed through a bank—ho assured me that it was perfectly right, and it would put him to great inconvenience because he had not given it a thought of the cheque being crossed, and he could not get the money—he asked me to make him an advance, to give him a post-dated cheque of my own for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., dated the 15th; he said he had an account to pay at Bradford the next morning, and that it would save his commercial reputation if it was paid, and eventually I gave him a post-dated cheque; I was to pay the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque in to my bank, and it would be collected and the balance would be in my bank before my 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque became due—I paid in the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque, and it was returned on the 13th through my bank marked "No account"—I stopped my 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque the same morning; Chater was to call for the balance of the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the Monday or Tuesday, the 12th or 13th; he did not call—I communicated with him, and on Friday, the 16th, he came with Stephenson, who was a stranger to me—the shop was closed; Chater rang the bell; I went to the door and said, "You have some one with you"—he wanted to come in—I said, "I don't want any of your friends inside," and I declined to admit his friend—Chater came inside and I closed the door—he asked me if I had got the balance of the cheque—I said, "You are quite aware that the cheque was no good"—he said the cheque was perfectly good, and he had taken it of March, of Poplar, as he had stated to me—I said, "Then the best thing we can do is to go and see March, of Poplar, to see if this is correct"—I then said, "Who is your friend outside?"—he said, "Mr. Charles Davis, solicitor, of Cheapside"—I then went out with him, and he introduced me to Stephenson; he said, "This is Mr. Charles Davis"—we then all three went to Poplar and saw March; we went into the shop, and I asked March if he had given Chater a cheque for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in payment of two cases of cigars—he said, "No, I never had a business transaction with Chater; in fact, I have no knowledge of him"—I said, "Then it is not true that he got this cheque from you?"—I had the cheque with me; March asked me to produce it—he said, "No, I never saw it"—Chater and March then commenced a quarrel, and I left, leaving Stephenson, Chater, and March together—I came from Poplar by the last train, and Stephenson and Chater came in the same train, I believe in the same carriage—when we, got out of the train Stephenson said, "You can see plainly enough that March knows all about this cheque"—I said, "I decline to have anything to say about it till I have consulted my solicitor"—Stephenson said, "Who is your solicitor?"—I said, "Mr. Crossfield, of</p>

               <p>Mark Lane, Ellis and Crossfield"—he said, "Then you had better refer Mr. Crossfield to me; I have not a card, but Mr. Charles Davis, of Carey Street, Cheapside"—next morning March and Beaumont called on me; March said, "I have come to know why you disturbed me so late last night about the cheque, I know nothing about it, I have never had a business transaction with Chater in my life"—I said "Who is this gentleman with you?"—he said "It is my solicitor"—Beaumont then said "Do you know what you have done?"—I said "No"—he said "Well, you have given a post-dated cheque, for which you are liable to a penalty of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and if you take any steps in this matter we shall lay an information against you and enforce the penalty"—I then ordered them to leave and they then left—this is my 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque produced—I went and saw Mr. Grout about it—I wrote to Rocke and Eyton, of Shrewsbury, about the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque and got an answer—I applied for a warrant against Chater—Mr. Grout showed me these three bills produced and left them in my hands for inquiry—I had seen one of them before—I believe it was the one for 86<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but I could not positively swear to it—that was about a week before I gave Chater the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque—Chater showed it to me and asked me to discount it—he said that Stephenson had been in the habit of paying him with a cheque, but that he had sent in this bill by post, stating that trade was bad and he could not get it discounted—I returned it to him and he took it away, this is it.

Stephenson, 2, Carey Lane, Post-office, London; drawn by Frank Chater, accepted by Charles Stephenson, payable at the London and County Bank, Shoreditch; endorsed "Frank Chater, 65, Lefevre Road, Old Ford, London, E"—when I get these bills from Grout I made inquiries respecting the acceptors—I did not try to get the money, they were not due—I went to the addresses—I went to Beaumont's address and to Stephenson's address which was given on the bills—I went to 23, Wilson Street, Finsbury; I found the name of Beaumont and Co. on the door-post, but there was no one in the office—I then went to 2, Carey Lane; I could not find Stephenson there or any one of that name—when Chater showed me this bill for the larger amount, I said "I don't know who Stephenson is"—he said "I am very much surprised at that, you being in the trade; he is a large staymaker, carrying on business in 2, Carey Lane; I thought every one knew him"—I saw a person at 2, Carey Lane—after the first hearing of the case against Chater, March called on me—a person named Tickell called first—March and Beaumont called together—March said that he had called to see if we could not come to some settle<lb></lb>ment—I said "I have nothing to say to you, this is your solicitor; what is his name?"—Beaumont said "I am not a solicitor, my name is Hughes, I am summoned for the defence"—I said "Then you are Beaumont?"—he said "Yes, Beaumont Hughes"—I said "Then I have nothing to say to either of you, get out of my place"—they left; nothing more passed—when Rocke's cheque was presented to me I thoroughly believed it to be a bond fide cheque—I should certainly not have advanced the money had I not believed it—a person named Tickell called on me twice with reference to this affair—these documents (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) came to me by hand in this envelope—a child left them wrapped up as a parcel—both letters are in Chater's writing.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Chater.</hi> You first called on me about this cheque on the 11th, and afterwards on Friday, the 16th—it had been returned on the 13th—I received a letter from you on the morning of the 15th, asking me to wire you whether the cheque had been met or not—you did not call on me on that same evening; when you did call, you asked me for the balance of the cheque—when you had my cheque you did not deposit any security with me besides the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque—I received that same day a security for a previous advance—you gave it me enclosed in an envelope—I did not see what it was at the time—I afterwards found it was two contract-notes for two pieces of silk in pledge—I had lent you 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. four or five days previously—the securities are in the hands of the solicitor to the Treasury—I decidedly did not receive them as security for my cheque—after I had given you the cheque you apologised for not giving me the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said, "You had better give me an I O U"—you had a broken finger at the time, and said you could not write, and you gave me these two documents enclosed, and said, "Here is something worth 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; put that in your cash-box, and I will bring you the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the morning"—you gave me the tickets as security for the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not open them till after the cheque was returned—I have known you 12 years, perhaps more—your letter was dated from High Wycombe; but posted at Richmond—I applied to your wife on the 13th, the day the cheque was returned, and she said you had gone into the City and would be home to tea—you were in town that day, I had the means of knowing—your wife came to me on the 13th after the cheque was stopped, and showed me a telegram; it was open—she said you had gone to Bristol—I did not go to your wife afterwards and say you were a foolish man not to have come to me—I went with a sergeant of police past your house, your wife was standing at the door, I am not quite sure that I spoke to her, she had been ill, I believe I said, "Your husband is a very foolish man never to go near any one about this affair, to let it come to this pass"—she said, "He is in the public-house below"—she said she had persuaded you to come and see me or Mr. Grout about the affair, but she could do nothing with you—I went down to Mrs. March four times.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. I believe in my cross-examination at the police-court I said that I would not have given this cheque except on the faith of its being received from March—I gave it on the faith of Chater's statement, not on the faith of his statement that he had received it from March—I said at first that I did, but I was not allowed to explain—I was cross-examined by Mr. Abbott, and he put it to me, "Would you have given him the change only on the faith of his only having had it from March?" and I said "No"—of course, if he had brought me a cheque which he picked up in the street I should not have cashed it—I believed he had taken it in a business transaction—I had no idea who March was—I did not take it on Chater's statement that he had it from Rock—I never heard a word about his having had it from Rocke—I never saw Chater to speak to him but once after the cheque was dishonoured; that was on Friday night, 16th August—I saw him several times, you understand, but only once to have conversation with him; that was the time he called for the balance of the cheque; nothing was said about Rocke then; not a word—I saw the name on the cheque in the first instance, and asked him who Rocke was—I gave him the cheque on the faith of his statement entirely—I did not take pains to find out who the drawer of the cheque was at the time Chater gave it to me—I said "Who is Rock?" and he replied "Rocke is a brother of the member of the bank on which the cheque is drawn"—I did not make any further inquiry—it was at Chater's request that I post-dated the cheque after I declined to give him an open cheque—I had no doubt about the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when he gave it to me; his object was to get the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by some means, or to get anything—he did not suggest the date of the 15th; I swear that—he said the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque was payable at Lubbock's, and would be got on the Saturday morning—I was asked at the police-court what my balance was at the bank at the time I gave this 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque—I did not decline to answer—I beg your pardon, I was not asked what my balance</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and am concerned for the Treasury in this prosecution—I received the papers that Sergeant Miller has spoken of—I have them all here—I have examined them; they relate almost entirely to correspondence addressed by various persons from different parts of the country and abroad relative to orders given for goods, addressed to J. Beaumont and Co.—amongst them I find three memorandums from Waterlow Brothers to J. Beaumont and Co., 23, Wilson Street, Finsbury, relating to orders for stationery, delivery notes, and a long account for stationery; a letter from Anvers of 25th April, in French, to Messrs. E. B. Reeves, another to B. Reeves, Esq., Wimbledon, relating to wine from Hamburg; there is a vast quantity of that correspondence—I communicated with a number of the writers of the letters, and received replies with en<lb></lb>closures, which I now produce; they are letters signed J. Beaumont and Co., in different handwriting, and addressed to the writers of some of the letters which were found in the drawer—the articles referred to in the cor<lb></lb>respondence were of every imaginable kind, from pianos down to fire-bricks cigars, watches, iron goods, coals, woollen goods, fencing wire, cement, work-boxes, pianos, fancy boxes, glass-ware, flooring, matting, dolls, stone, slate, fire-bricks, wine, and many other articles—here are letters found in a bundle addressed by the Longford Iron and Steel Company, Limited—here are the replies received in answer to my communication—in one of the letters there is a reference to J. Barth and Co., 17, Devonshire Street—there is another bundle among which I find a letter addressed to Mr. Hughes, from Mr. George, of Moorgate Street; also some income-tax notices addressed to Beau<lb></lb>mont and Co., 23, Wilson Street, dated 22nd July—Barth and Co. were supplied with goods by one of the prosecutors in this case—I was not at the police-court at the first hearing against Chater about Rocke's cheque—I was present at the adjournment when Rocke appeared; I was applied to to assist the police—there was a question of an adjournment, and I stated that I had only just been instructed and I wanted time to look into the matter, and perhaps it would be necessary to call Mr. Rocke or</p>

               <p>to deal with him in some way—he then came forward and said he was Mr. Rocke; that he had attended on a prior occasion, and he came there to give evidence, and he had already written to the clerk of the Court—this is the letter I afterwards received from the Chief Clerk of the Court. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "October 15th, 1878. London and County Bank, 15, Langham Place, Dunn v. Chater. Sir,—My attention has been called to a report of this case in the Daily Telegraph, On coming here I found a summons to attend on behalf of the defendant. I need only say that upon adjournment I shall be most happy to attend, but the testimony I can give I imagine would most aid the prosecution. My cheque was given to Mr. March for a totally different purpose from that to which it was used, which appears to me to be an attempt to frighten my brother in the Shrewsbury Bank into paying the money to avoid exposure. I never knew that March had parted with it till it came to my knowledge through the Shrewsbury Bank, and that Chater was trying to extort 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from them to settle the matter; as I feel sure no money has passed it may be settled. I shall be very happy to attend, especially as I have suffered most severe losses through the treachery of March and his associates, whom I don't even know. Signed A. B. Rocke.") I also received this diary, in which I find numerous references to most of the parties in it—it begins on the 21st March—I find references, for instance, to Barth and Tickell, F. Reeves, and others—it is simply a scribbling diary—the last entry is October 4th, "Chater 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. due"—I produce an I O U from Rocke to Beaumont for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., dated September 18th—I received it from Miller, but not with this bundle—this is a bundle I received in a cash-box which Miller brought from a public-house in the neighbourhood of Wilson Street—there is a post-card in it, and a letter addressed to Chater by a Mr. Perring, of Welling borough, dated 16th October, 1878: "Have not heard from you since taking four pair of samples from Mr. Norman. I have ex<lb></lb>pected a line from you with some orders, please remit me post-office order. Your kind attention with orders will much oblige. "Here is a memorandum dated from Aldersgate Street making an appointment for 10 o'clock, another with the initials T.

Beaumont, a letter signed E. B.

Hughes and Co.: "Your promissory note for 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was due on Saturday, let me hear from you without fail on Friday. "Here is a further letter from the same people: "I am surprised not to have heard from you or seen you; no alternative but to realise at your expense to-morrow. "That is addressed to A. B. Hughes—then there is a receipt for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. deposit on letting two rooms on second-floor at 29, Fenchurch Street, at an annual rent of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and a bill for 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on March, due September 13th, 1878, drawn by Augustus Beaumont Hughes, payable at the London and County Bank, Limehouse—these are papers that were given to me from the cash-box by Miller.</p>

                  </hi>. I am general manager to Messrs. Waterlow, stationers, in the City—in April last year Beaumont called to order some printing and stationery—he gave his name and address as "Beaumont, 23, Wilson Street"—I made inquiry, and eventually executed the order; they were printed memorandum headings and letter paper with headings; that was done by his direction—I asked him for a reference, as he was a total stranger—he did not mention any name, but I received this letter.

When it fell due I went to 23, Wilson Street, and found the place shut up—the bill has never been paid—I traced the glue from the railway to Frith Street, where I saw it in the shop of Bellow and Co., who showed me an invoice and receipt for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was from my traveller's repre<lb></lb>sentation that the order was executed—he told me that it was all right—I saw Edmund Reeves before the bill was given—he said, "This is not my affair, it is an affair of my brother's."</p>

I was traveller to Mr. Harding last April—I know Beaumont as Hughes—I met him in the City in April; he told me he was acting as manager to a firm in Wilson Street, and I told him I would call for orders—he knew that I was in Mr. Harding's employment, and that he dealt in glue—he did not tell me what business was being carried on in Wilson Street—I called there, and saw the two Beeves and Beaumont, but they seemed to be busy, so I called again, and the two Beeves gave me an order for two tons of glue at 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a ton; but Mr. Harding had not so much in store—I told them so, and that he only had one cask, and E. B. Reeves said, "Let us have that"—I communicated with Mr. Harding, and they got the glue—they said that they wanted it at once, as they had an order on hand—I think I went quite 20 times to 23, Wilson Street, but have only seen the two Reeves and Beaumont there—I know Stephenson, but have not had dealings with him—I know March, Chater, and Tickell, but not Breed on—I have seen some of them together at various times—I have seen Tickell at 23, Wilson Street, with Reeves and Beaumont—when Beau<lb></lb>mont introduced me, he said, "I am manager to Mr. Reeves"—that was in their presence—he said that one of them was a barrister; that was Mr. Francis Reeves, but he did not say so in their presence—he had previously told me that Mr. Francis Reeves was finding the money—I let them have the glue on the representation made to me by Beaumont, that there was money in the firm, and I was influenced by the fact that Mr. Francis Reeves was finding the money.</p>

I might do so, but I should not say to anybody who came that I would speak to Mr. Beaumont about it—when my employer took the bill I did not know that it was in Beaumont's writing—I looked at it in the office—I knew Beaumont as Hughes—I don't remember whether I saw the Reeves at the office after the bill was accepted.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "65, Lefebvre Road, Old Ford, 18th July, 1878. Gentle<lb></lb>men,—Yours to hand about C. Stephenson's bill. Why was it not presented lust Friday? I saw his clerk to-day, and he tells me the money was left with him to pay on presentation, but no one called. How is this? Mr. C. Stephenson, I believe, is now in Paris. However, you must present the bill, or I must call and pay you, and then present it myself. I had hoped this matter would have been settled before now. Shall be in Leicester either Saturday or Monday, and will call and see you. Yours faithfully, Francis Chater.") This other letter is dated 3rd August, 1878, from the same address: "Gentlemen,—I have just returned home, or should have written you earlier. You have not replied to mine of ten days ago about C. Stephenson's bill Please do so at once. Frederick Ebert and Co. desire their bill renewed for two months. Please send me word what amount you require for holding it over for that time. I have promised to do this for them. Yours respectfully, Frank Chater."</p>

I duly received your telegram about silks. Whatever more can I possibly do than I have done? Sykes promised to remit as soon as he is able to get out, and I tried all I could to get the accounts at Leicester, or I could have sent you the cash, even as late as 9 p.m. last evening, but did not succeed.

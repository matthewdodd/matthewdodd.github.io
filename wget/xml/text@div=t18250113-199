The prisoner came there on the 11th of December, and took a lodging; he was alone - he slept in the same room with me; another young man, named William Bicknell, slept with the prisoner. I was awoke on Tuesday the 14th of December by Bicknell, who told me something about the prisoner. I looked at my box, and the lid was open. I had put my clothes in the box the night before, and shut it up. I looked into the box and missed two coats and a pair of blue trowsers, they were worth about 2 l. 10 s. I missed a waistcoat from the box, and lost my hat, a black silk handkerchief, and three other handkerchiefs. I gave notice at a public-house about it, and saw the prisoner again in Mary-le-bone watch-house on Sunday, the 2d of January.</p>

            . I slept in the same bed with the prisoner on Monday, the 13th of December. On Tuesday morning he got up early - when I awoke, he was going out at the door - it was dark, I could not see him - he spoke to me, and said his master was going to York, and he must go to the coach-office. He asked me how he should get out; I told him to draw back the bolt. I heard him go out, and shut the door. I went to sleep again, and awoke about seven o'clock. I then found my things tumbled about, and missed 4 s. 6 d. from my breeches pocket, and a pair of stockings. The prisoner had left his own stockings in the room.</p>

            . I was requested by a witness in another cause, (Henry Birt,) to go and search the prisoner at the watch-house on the 3d of January, as he thought he had got his shirt on, but he had not. I asked him where he sold Allison and Bicknell's goods - he said first he sold them to a Jew in the street, and afterwards that he had sold them at a shop in St. Giles's.</p>

I live at 32, Queen-street, Mile-end, Newtown—my husband is a butcher—we keep a licensed slaughter-house—on 20th of last month the prisoner came to our house with a horse and cart loaded with meat—another man was with him—he unloaded the cart and went away—he did not say anything to me—that was about half-past 9 o'clock in the evening—it might be a little later, but I do not think it was any earlier—I saw what was taken out of the cart, but I cannot say exactly what it was—I did not see any name on the cart—the policeman afterwards came and found it, and took it away—I sent to my husband directly, and in con<lb></lb>sequence of that the police came almost directly; at about 10 o'clock, I should think they were there, and they kept watch there till about 1 o'clock—the prisoner then came, and was taken in custody—I saw the policeman and him have a scuffle together—he scuffled hard with the policeman outside the door, hut I was so frightened that I got away, and I cannot say exactly what it was.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, living at 2, Limekiln-hill, Limehouse—on 20th of last month I was at Leadenhall-market, about 9 or a quarter past 9 in the morning—I had a pony and cart there—my name was on the cart—there was a quantity of meat in it, a side of beef, two sheep, a sheep cut up, a shoulder of mutton, breast of mutton, and some flanks of beef—I left the pony and cart just outside the market—when I returned I found them and the meat gone—the value of the meat was about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the pony, harness, and cart, about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., from that to 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I next saw the pony and cart at my house—they were brought home to me about 5 o'clock by the witness Dunmore—I afterwards received a large quantity of meat said to be mine—it nearly all corresponded generally to what I had bought—there was a breast of mutton gone—Mr. Banks brought the meat—I saw the prisoner—I never authorized him to take my pony and cart away, nor any meat—I have seen him loitering about somewhere—his face is familiar to me some-where.</p>

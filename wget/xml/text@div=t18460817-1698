                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, and live in Charles-street, Back-road, St. George in the East—the prisoner was in my service—in consequence of suspicion, on the 13th of August, I marked five shillings, and put them into my till about five or six o'clock—I went about seven o'clock, and found them safe there—I then marked two more shillings and a sixpence, and put them in the till—about eight o'clock I went to tie till, and missed one of the shillings—I then took the sixpence out, and left the six marked shillings in the till—I sent the prisoner over to the ware-house—he came back, and I went into the parlour at the back of the shop—I watched, and saw two children come in for half a pound of butter—they gave him a shilling, and he gave them sixpennyworth of halfpence in return, which he took from the till—there was plenty of copper in the till, but do silver but what was marked—I directly went into the shop, and there was bat five shillings in the till—there ought to have been seven—I took the pri<lb></lb>soner by the collar and said, "What have you done with the two shillings you have just taken out of the till?"—he trembled very much—I pushed him into the parlour—he said he knew nothing about it—I told him I certainly should send for a policeman—he then said he would give it me back if I would for give him—I said, "I told you I was robbed a few weeks ago by the last boy, and you knew Tery well what I intended to do with the next I caught"—k said, "Pray forgive me on account of my mother"—I gave him into custody, and two shillings were shaken out of his boot—one was marked—the other was not—this is one I had marked with a scratch on the top of the crown.</p>

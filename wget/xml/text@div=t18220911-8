On the 12th of August, the prisoner and four more boys came to the shop - the prisoner and three of them were inside; one of them asked for a penny loaf and paid me for it; they all went out except the boy who had the loaf - I missed five weights from the end of the counter immediately they went out; the boy asked me for the bottom loaf - I said they were all alike, and gave him the top one. I went round the counter; the boy who bought the bread had just got out - I saw the other boys running off. I called to him to stop his companions, for they had got my weights; he said he knew nothing of it, and went after them - I did not follow. The prisoner and another, who was discharged, were brought back. I asked the prisoner if he knew anything about the weights; he said he did not take them, but he knew where they were, and if the witness would go back with him, he would shew him where they were. Part of the loaf was found in his pocket.</p>

            . I live in Smith's-lane, City-road. I heard the cry of Stop thief! I came out, and pursued. I took the prisoner and another boy in a privy; I had seen them running. I took them back to Mrs. Gibbs's shop; she asked the prisoner where the weights were; he said, he did not know, he did not steal them, that the other stole them, and if I would go back with him he would shew me where they were thrown; but the constable came and took him - he found some bread on him, which appeared to be part of a penny loaf.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I and another went out to gather blackberries, and met the other two, who went in for a penny loaf; one of them came out, beckoned to me, and I ran; one of them gave me a bit of the loaf, and told me to run.</p>

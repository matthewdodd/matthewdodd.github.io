On the 3d of July, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to my shop, and asked me to make him a pair of dancing pumps; he staid in the shop about twenty minutes; there were two pairs of boots within his reach, but I had no suspicion of him - I did not leave him alone. About two hours after he was gone I was going to carry these boots home to a customer, and they were gone; no other person had been in the shop. I went to the direction he had given me, Jones, No. 22, Great Sutton-street, which proved to be fictitious. I met him about seven hours afterwards, on Clerkenwell-green - I told him he had stolen a pair of boots; he said if I would go with him he would get them - I refused, and gave him in charge. I afterwards found the boots in Portpool-lane, exposed for sale - I knew them to be the same. The prisoner did not say he had not the boots; he said I was mistaken in the man.</p>

            . The prisoner brought the boots to my shop in Portpool-lane, on the Saturday night, about half-past ten o'clock - he said they had been repaired for him about three weeks before, and they were taken in so small that he could not wear them; he offered me his address, but I did not take it. Mr. Perry came to my shop, and claimed them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Can you swear to me, having never seen me before - A. Yes, I am positive you are the person.</p>

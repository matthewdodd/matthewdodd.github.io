               <p>I went out about five o'clock in the morning, and left my wife at home, when I came home, my wife, who had been out, came home, and as I was coming home I met my daughter, who was coming down to the field where I was at work, to tell me,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140098"></xptr> and as I was going home I saw two men, with each of them a bundle, in a field adjoining to the wheatfield which I came out of; I was reaping wheat; that was about half a mile from my house, this was about half after one.</p>
               <p>Who were the two men that had the bundles? - They are the prisoners at the bar, who were strangers to me then; I am positive to the prisoners; they were going from my house across the field towards Harrow on the Hill, I went back to the field I came out of, and called to the two men that were reaping in the field, and told them I really thought my house was robbed; they came to my assistance, and the prisoners ran across a hedge into a plowed field; I had heard at this time that my house had been broke open, I pursued them about ten or a dozen yards, but after they threw the bundles away I returned back to pick them up; I saw the bundles picked up; the prisoners were taken in less than half an hour; when I came home I saw a back window was broke open into the orchard, the glass was unnailed, and one side of the light, and two of the staves, were broken down, and the case was pulled out.</p>
               <p>Were the things that are contained in those bundles in your house that morning? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In what part of your house were they? - In my lodging-room.</p>
               <p>Prisoners. When you saw us pass over the hedge, how could you see us heave the bundles away when you was the other side of the hedge? - Oh lack-a-daisy! you did not throw the bundles away till we had run after you six or seven yards; there was only a hedge that parted the plowed land from the field; we could have touched them if we had but a rod when they first jumped over the hedge.</p>

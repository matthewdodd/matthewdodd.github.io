            . I am twelve years old; Watts left his cart in my care - it was standing at the corner of Mr. Butler's. I have known the two prisoners a good while; I was in another cart emptying a sack of peas; Morgan came up first, and then Hinton - one of them took one half-seive of currants and the other another - they went down Maiden-lane; I told Mr. Watts - he went after them, but they were gone,</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160035"></xptr>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. When was this - A. About half-past six o'clock in the morning; I did not call out, because I was afraid they would knock me down - there was no person near. I went to Mr. Watts as soon as he came to the cart and told him of it; I have never got into any scrape. They were taken about half-past three o'clock that afternoon.</p>
               <p>Prisoner MORGAN. When you was at the office, you said Hinton took the first, and I the second, and that you jumped out instantly, and cried Stop thief! - Witness. I never said so at all at the office. I did follow them to the place where they put them, but did not cry out.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took up the prisoners, but found nothing on them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner MORGAN. Mr. Pace asked us separately where we had been between five and six o'clock. I gave an account of myself. and so did Hinton - Witness. I enquired where they had been; Morgan said in Westminster - Hinton said in the garden; he might have said he was with his mother buying fruit. I will not swear that he did or did not.</p>
               <p>- HINTON. I am the mother of the prisoner Hinton. I was in the garden on the morning of the day he was taken up. I bought a round of raspberries about half-past five o'clock, and left him to mind it while I went to find my girl. I was then with him till seven, and then he went with me to sell them.</p>

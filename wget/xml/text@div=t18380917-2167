I am sixteen years old, and live in St. Helena-place About five minutes before two o'clock on the 24th of August I was coming to my work, and saw a lot of boys running after the prisoner's not know him before—I looked him in the face—he said if I touched him would fire—I was not going to touch him—he no sooner said the word than be fired the pistol, and hit me in the head—I saw the pistol in his hand—I was three yards from him—I had said nothing to him to provide him—I never had any quarrel with him—I was hurt on the head, and bled—Charles Webb caught hold of him, and a policeman came up were about six boys running after him—I do not know what they doing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Tabernacle-square, Shoreditch. On Saturday, 26th July, I saw the deceased Betsy or Elizabeth Leaf at I, Luke-street, Shoreditch—I did not know her before—I found her in a dying state, and she died soon afterwards—she was senseless when I saw her—the prisoner was there—he said, "I struck her, and knocked her down," or, "I struck her, and she fell down"—he said she had produced a knife, or had a knife about her, or attempted to use a knife—I saw marks of violence on both her cheeks, more especially on the left cheek—I do not think that could hare been done by one blow—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination on the following Wednesday, July 30th, assisted by Mr. Davis—I found all the organs in a healthy state, except the brain—there was congested blood on the left side of the head, and considerable swelling, some marks of lividity and bruises on the right and left cheek—there was coagulated blood in both nostrils and in the mouth, and three ounces of blood extravasated on the brain on the left side, sufficient to cause death—the other portion of the brain was in a healthy state—I attribute her death to extravasations of blood on the brain, produced by violence—it might have been from a blow combined with a fall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the blow on the cheek appear to have been one that of itself would have caused a vessel in a healthy condition to burst, or was it from the tumble on the ground? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From the two causes combined—I think the blow on the side of the bead might have been produced by a fall—I think all the marks were produced at the same time—they were recent—I noticed no difference in them, bat the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination was not made very early—I could not discover the vessel which bad burst—the kidneys were considerably enlarged, from which a professional man might conclude that she was a very extensive drinker—I found no organic disease—if a person was an extensive drinker the vessels of the beam might be more easily ruptured—with a drunken person a concussion is more</p>

               <p>likely to produce apoplexy—the prisoner said, "She threatened me with a knife, and I struck her a blow"—there is a mark on the prisoner's hand inflicted with a cutting instrument, but it is not recent.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I assisted at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examina<lb></lb>tion—the side of the face was wounded, and there was a quantity of blood under the scalp—I opened the skull, and found an effusion of blood on the left side of the brain, which was caused by violence, and which was the cause of death—a blow would produce it—there were three distinct marks of blows on the right cheek, one on the left side of the head level with the other, and another on the side of the head.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner and deceased lived four months in my house—she passed as his wife—on this Saturday, about 11 o'clock at night, I heard quarreling going on in their room—I heard very high words, common abuse; then a blow and a very heavy fall ensued—I had seen the deceased that evening—she was quite sober—I went into the room, and saw the prisoner—his wife was lying on the floor, bleeding from the mouth and nose—she said, "Pray, oh pray!" and after that she raved, and became delirious—the prisoner said, "Do all you can for her; I have hit her, and knocked her down"—he asked me to fetch Dr. Leonard—I did so—he came back with me—the deceased was not moved—she died on the floor, at a quarter to 1 o'clock—she was a healthy woman—the prisoner said she had a knife in her hand, and they were quarreling, and he was afraid she was going to stab him, and he knocked her down—a policeman was sent for, and the knife was found on the floor.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Could you hear what passed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I was sitting close to the stairs—if more blows than one had been struck, I must have heard them—when I heard the blow, I was up-stairs in a minute—I do not know of her having stabbed him on a former occasion—he did not threaten her during the whole of the quarrel, and I did not hear her threaten him—he had come home from his work—he drives a <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>—I never saw her in liquor.</p>

On the 12th of January, about five o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner was about to leave the premises - the plumbers leave at that hour - I searched all the men; I suspected something, and locked the gate. On searching the prisoner, I felt something hard in the band of his breeches - I said "There is something there," and desired him to take it out - he denied that he had any thing - it dropped from him, and proved to be lead; an officer was sent for, and he was taken into custody; the lead was weighed; it was the same description of lead as was on the premises.</p>

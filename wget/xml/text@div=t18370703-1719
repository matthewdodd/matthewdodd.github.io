                  </hi>. I am a horse-patrol of Ilford. On Monday, the 26th of June, I got some information, and went to Mr. Kebbell's granary—I took some samples of his beans and oats, and have brought them here—I observed marks of oats and beans outside the yard over the fence, and traced them to wall, about a quarter of a mile from the granary—I could only trace them to the fence and the wall, which is about one hundred yards from the prisoner's stable—I then went in search of the prisoner, and apprehended him at Bow—he was openly about his business—I told him I suspected he had some oats in his stable—he said he had about two bushels of oats and a few beans—I went Ilford with him—I could not find the key of his stable, and broke the door open, by his consent—I saw some oats, and asked him where he got them—he said he bought them up the road—I asked of whom—he said he could not tell me them, nor has he tole me since—I asked where the beans were which hie said he had got—he said he supposed his man had given them to his horse—I thrust my stick into a vessel which had chaff in it, and found beans under it, and some oats mixed—I produced them—I compared them with what I took from the granary, and they seemed to correspond—but I do not pre<lb></lb>tend to swear to them myself—I showed them to Mr. Kebbell.</p>

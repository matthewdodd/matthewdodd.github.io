            , she came out of a yard, into Wentworth-street, she had a bonnet on, she met me and appeared in a fright, and said, "For G - d sake, come and help me, there is a person in distress;" or words to that effect. I ran into the yard, she said, up stairs, and I followed her up stairs to the first floor. Norris ran up immediately as I got in, shut the door, and put her back against it, and said, she would have some money for the room - there was a bedstead in the room. She persisted in this for some minutes. I said, I would give her no money; she said, she would be **** but she would have it, I still refused, and at last I said, "What do you want?" she said, she would have 1 s. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182110240005"></xptr>gave her that, and then she said, she would have another; I gave her another, and then she said, she would have four more; I pushed her on one side, rushed down stairs, and Norris called out "Lock the door." When I got down, five more women below seized me, and took some money from me, above 3 s., they tore my breeches pocket and all off, and beat me dreadfully. I kept my hand on my pocket as well as I could, and I got a sovereign from one of them which she had taken, I think I lost eight or ten shillings. They said they would have more money, I gave them some money when they were holding me below, and they said I had given them none, the door was fastened, and they said "Do not let him get to the window;" I cried Murder! for six or seven minutes, and there were about twelve fellows outside who shut the shutters, and left me in the dark, both the prisoners had ran down after me, and assisted in holding me, the door by some means came open, and I got out of the house without my hat, and found twelve or men standing outside, they did not attempt to stop me. I went to Lambeth-street police office immediately, three officers went with me to the place, and saw the two prisoners, and some more, but I was sure of these two - they beat me very much, and Norris said, "Murder him." I said I could swear to those two, for they were up stairs, and I had an opportunity of seeing them. When I went with the officers, there were four or five women there, and about a dozen men still outside; the prisoners were taken into custody. I was perfectly sober. This was between two and three o'clock in the afternoon - I had dined at my brother's in Great St. Helens, and was going to a hair-dresser's in Whitechapel. I had come to town on the Saturday before. I went up to the room, in consequence of the woman making an alarm, and for no improper purpose whatever. The money I gave for the room, was extorted from me through fear of being murdered, and nothing else</p>
               <p>Prisoner NORRIS. Q. Are you positive to me - A. Yes. She said she was mistress of the house, and would be paid for the room. I am positive of it, and would say so on my dying bed. I am also as certain of Palmer, as I am of my own existence.</p>

            . I belong to Lambeth-street office. The prosecutor came to me on Tuesday the 9th of October, about a quarter past three o'clock, he had a hat on then; the Magistrate was just gone, he complained of being robbed - I went with him, and two officers, to Wheeler's-court, George-yard, part of it comes into Wentworth-street, it has three outlets, and is about a quarter of a mile from the office, he pointed out the house, we went in with him, and found five or six women, and I think one man, and five or six men were standing round the house, and some bricklayers at work - I went into the lower room and said, "Be particular, look round and see if you can point out any of these women," they were altogether, I made them stand up, he pointed out the prisoners from among the rest, and said they had robbed him, and told the same story he has now. They said he must be mistaken, for they should not remain in the house, if they had done it. He said, in their presence, at the office, "If you look at one of their hands, you will find I have bit one of their fingers." I examined one of Palmer's fingers, it appeared as if it had been hit or scratched.</p>

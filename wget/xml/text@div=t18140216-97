These are the proceedings under the commission, 2nd of November, at Guild-hall. I was present, and saw the assignees sign it. I witnessed it on the 2nd of November.

On the 15th of November, I was at the Ship public-house, Little Bridge-street, in company with Roberts, the man who is indicted and is not here. I afterwards communicated to Kinghorn what had passed between

             and me. Roberts asked me if I would prove a bill under Kinghorn's commission. In half an hour afterwards I went with Roberts to Kinghorn in the Fleet prison. I found Kinghorn, Roberts, and Forest, together, and several more. I cannot say whether Kinghorn was in the coffee-room or the tap, in the Fleet. Roberts said I would prove a bill under his commission. Kinghorn pulled out several bills from his pocket; he asked me if I would prove a bill of two hundred pounds; I said, no. He agreed that the last bill for sixty-seven pounds four shillings. He himself took that bill out of his pocket; he agreed that should be the bill I was to prove.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this the bill - A. Yes, this is the bill; it was endorsed by Forest at that time, and I have since put my initials upon it to know it again; here is I T G upon the back of it, drawn by James Ferrest. I have seen Forrest write; it is his hand-writing. This bill was given to me by Kinghorn. Roberts requested me to attend the next day at Guildhall to prove the bill. Kinghorn and Roberts promised me one pound for the job. I attended the next day at Guildhall, and something that Swancot said induced the commissioners to adjourn the meeting. The meeting was adjourned to the 30th of November; between that time and the 30th of November I saw Kinghorn two or three times in the Fleet.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive of Kinghorn any part of the one pound - A. He sent me down ten shillings by Mr. Sanderson on the 11th of January. In the Fleet, Kinghorn stated to me that I had received ten shillings,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181402160050"></xptr>part of the one pound, he sent it by Sanderson. I afterwards disclosed the whole of the transaction to Mr. Davis.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner in the Fleet Prison - A. I did, on the 15th of November, I saw him in the Fleet. I was in the Ship public-house, Little Bridge-street; there were Gregory,

            , Sanderson, Wheatley, and two or three more, whose names I do not know; Roberts called me out, and said something about Kinghorn; I said, I would see Mr. Kinghorn, he owed me some money. I went to Kinghorn; he was then in the Fleet. I told Kinghorn, Roberts had desired me to prove a small bill for him. Kinghorn begged very hard for me to do it. I said, I would prove no bill. I said, Mr. Kinghorn do away your friendly commission, and let your creditors have the just property that is left; he said, it is gone too far, how can I recall it back. He asked me if I had seen Edwards; I said, yes, I had seen him that morning. He asked me if he would come forward and prove two bills of two hundred pounds as he had promised; he left the two bills at my house. I took the bills to Edwards; Edwards said he would prove one, and his friend was to prove the other. Kinghorn said, if Edwards proved them it would be ten pounds in his way. The majority would be in his favour for the choice of assigness. I went to Guildhall the next morning; I called in at the Castle, going; Gregory was there. I told him if he had come to prove a fictitious bill I would stop him. I stopped them from choosing assignees; I told the commissioners what I knew. In consequence of that they adjourned the meeting. I saw Mr. Kinghorn after that, be gave me five pounds; he said he was very sorry for what was past, you will hold your tongue for the future; I hope you will say no more, and I will pay you the the other five in a few days; he was really my debtor. I attended the choice of assignees, and then I was arrested by a friend of Mr. Kinghorn's for an unlawful debt.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the plantiff in that arrest - 
               <persName id="t18140216-97-person908">A. John Richard Pim</persName>
            , of Marsh-gate, Lambeth; I owed him nothing, not an halfpenny.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Kinghorn after that - A. I saw him on Monday after Christmas day; I told him I had been arrested for a false debt; he said, he was sorry, he had nothing to do with the arrest; he hoped I would not impute it to him. He wanted to see Mr. Davis, who was his principal creditor; he wanted to arrange matters, as he had been misled by the other party.</p>
               <p>MR. DAVIS. I am a corn-chandler, I live in Warren-street, Fitzroy-square. I am a creditor of the prisoner's under the commission; I was a creditor to about seven hundred pounds; I have proved under the commission one hundred and fifty pounds; I had parted with the books to my brother. I could only prove one hundred and fifty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any disclosure made to you by Swancot and Gregory - A. There was.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 16th of November do you remember by something that Swancot stated to the commissioners, the commissioners postponed the meeting - A. I do; the meeting was adjourned. On the 27th of December, Swancot brought the prisoner to me in Mark-lane. Swancot brought Kinghorn to me at my house in Warren-street on the next night; Kinghorn then told me he had something to say to me; I said, what have you to say; I have nothing to say to you. He said, he wished to make some arrangement to prevent me from going to Guildhall. I asked him what he had got me; he told me he had his country-house, that was made over to his friend, it was worth an hundred and fifty pounds; I should have that, and also some money that he had got, and some money that a friend had, which I should have in preference to any other creditor. I told him I would have nothing to do with the lease of his house, to put away the swindlers he had about him. If he had any money to let the just creditors have the property; he replied, I might well say that, for he had got a set of great villians about him; he had expended five hundred pounds within a few months. I told him that I had got the false bill in the hands of my attorney for sixty-seven pounds; he admitted I had, and he was sorry for it. I told him I should prosecute him; he said, he was sorry for it. He wished to make an arrangement with me, he did not mind any other creditor as he did me. I am the greatest loser by him. Kinghorn admitted to me he had given the bill of sixty-seven pounds to Gregery.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the amount of debts proved under the commission including all these bills - A. Foar thousand three hundred pounds. Only eleven pounds have been realized, and only seventy pounds the amount of the whole of the real debts.</p>

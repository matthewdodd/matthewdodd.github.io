               <p>Court. Is there a person really existing of the name of Goodluck, or is it an assumed name? - No; there is such a person in partnership with me. The prisoner was employed by me and my partner in an office in <placeName id="t17790217-28-crimeloc161">Pall-Mall</placeName>

About the 13th of December last, I was looking over a bill of sundry expences that were incurred at that office in Pall-Mall, and seeing two dozen of candles every other day charged, when I knew they did not burn three pound a day, I imagined there must be some bad tricks played, either that they had not been laid in, or that they must have been carried off; they were both for candles and oil; I was determined that evening to find out how it was. I went to Mr. Jarvis, a tallow chandler in Pall-Mall, showed him my bill; these bills were delivered to me by a principal clerk of mine his name is

            , I questioned him with it; he denied it and proved that this lad always brought to him the bill and receipts as he always gave him the money for it. I went to Mr. Jarvis, and showed him the bill of parcels; they were his blank bills of parcel, but were not filled up-by him, nor any body belonging to him; the boy (the prisoner) I understood afterwards, had begged blank bills of him and then filled them up.</p>
               <p>Court. Had it been the practice to pay ready money for the goods you had of Jarvis? - Yes; there was no account subsisting between us.</p>
               <p>Court. The prisoner seems very young; in what capacity was he employed in your office? - As an <rs id="t17790217-28-deflabel162" type="occupation">errand boy</rs>

               <p>Not entrusted? - Yes; he has come with lottery tickets and cash to a considerable amount.</p>

               <p>Mr. Jenkinson on the 15th or 16th of December last, it was on a Monday, I think it was the 15th, came to me in Pall-Mall and asked me if I knew any thing about any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177902170027"></xptr> receipts of the tradesmen, which he produced to me afterwards. I told him for those receipts I had given the prisoner the money to pay; I always gave him gold to bring me change, because I would have silver. Mr. Jenkinson asked me whether those bills were paid. I told him they were by the boy. He afterwards said that for those bills no such money had been paid. He had enquired something of the tradesmen and had found the sum of money charged in the bills had not been paid. Mr. Jenkinson has got the receipts, I believe.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you got these receipts?</p>
               <p>Jenkinson. No; I had them in court last sessions. The boy was then to have been tried. I think I remember taking them home safe, and putting them into the top of a writing desk. I looked for them this morning, and they were gone.</p>
               <p>Court. Unless you produce them, and they are compared with the record, and found to be exact with that, the prisoner cannot be convicted.</p>
               <p>Jenkinson. I searched for them this morning, and could not find them.</p>
               <p>Court. I suppose this was intended. You did not bring the receipts I suppose by design? - I had them in court last sessions, when he was to have been tried, but since that I have lost them.</p>
               <p>Court. But you must know these receipts were material to have been produced in evidence; and, therefore, you ought to have been as careful of them as of Bank notes. - I did take care of them, and put them in a drawer. I never looked for them since till this morning, when I could not find them.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the jury, you must acquit the prisoner.</p>

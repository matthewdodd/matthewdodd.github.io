I am a brush-maker, of James-street, Bethnal-green—I was sitting by the fire, and my wife came up stairs, and brought up all manner of family affairs—I requested her to go down, and she would not—I turned my head to avoid quarrelling with her—she said that her brother-in-law and I were to meet together—I became rather irritated, and up with my hand rather hastily; it might have struck her—she snatched something off the box, and I felt a sensation come over me—I do not know what she struck me with, it was so hasty—I did not see what was in her hand—I do not think she intended to do it, because she was smiling a few minutes before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am divisional surgeon to the Police—on Sunday, 15th January, between 4 and 5 in the afternoon, I examined the prosecutor—he had a clean incised wound, an inch deep, on the upper part of his right arm—it could not have been self-inflicted—it was dangerous from its wounding the nerve of the delcoid muscle, which might have caused paralysis—it might have been inflicted with a knife, but certainly not by a file.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> My husband is paralyzed, and that arm is always numb; the knife was in his hand. I had made some broth, and sent some up by the little boy to my husband, who was sitting by the fire. When went up, he called me filthy names, and used disgusting language. I said, "You ought to be ashamed to use such language before the child." He struck me on the mouth, and he had the knife and fork in his hand. I declare I did not do it I hope the little boy is here to prove how he ill-uses me.</p>

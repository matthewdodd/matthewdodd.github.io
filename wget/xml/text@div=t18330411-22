He was articled for three years; I received 5l. with him, and 3l. they owe me - I was to have 12l., but I never knew where his mother lived; I sent to her for the money about Christmas - the prisoner did not tell me he had desired her not to give me the money, because I did not teach him any trade; I did not take him to Political unions - he belonged to one before I knew him, which is fifteen months ago; he belonged to one at Benbows' Commercial coffee-house - I have seen him there, but do not believe I ever went with him; his mother has found him money to buy arms with, but not tools - I have got a fowling piece, and a brace of pistols; I had a weapon called a macharoni - I sold it to a person who made many hundreds of them; I bought it for 8s. 6d. - I bought it to protect my premises.</p>
               <p>Q. It was invented, I believe, by Colonel

            , to fight against the government? A. I do not know; I never saw one until the boy brought one into my house - my wife took a pistol from him, which he attempted to shoot me with; I believe he got his weapon broken at a public meeting, and it was of no use - I was persuaded, like many more, to have one; I never said I would murder the Duke of Wellington with it - I was never taken up; I got into a scuffle with Mr. Lee, the head clerk of the ordnance department, and took him to the office with a warrant - I was once taken up for striking a Policeman, who insulted me one morning; I was bound over to keep the peace towards Mr. Lee, as I called him an old coward on leaving the office; he went back and swore the peace against me - after I wrested the chisel from the prisoner, I jumped up; my trousers and shoes were all bloody, and I pushed him out at the door - I cannot say whether he left the house, for I fell back fainting; I believe he fell with his face on the joists; I cannot say whether his face bled - I never struck him, nor did I say I would murder him; he did not cry murder three times - I believe he did once, when he fell, and me upon him, and I wrested the chisel from him - I never wanted to compromise this; his mother has been to me fourteen or fifteen times, and brought a witness with her - I never offered to compromise it for 20l., and say I would go to America; nor that I would take half my recognizance; the witness Saunders was never in my house - I never saw Sarah Ray; a young woman came to the institution one night - I never saw her with my eyes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you blind with one eye? A. Yes; I never saw her at all - I cannot say who Mrs. Davis might have on the landing, but she only brought one woman into my room - I never said, if I made a flaw in the indictment that would blackguard me - Mrs. Davis came to me when I was in bed, before I went to the Magistrate; I then said I did not want to injure him, and, if she paid the doctor's bill, I would not go before the Magistrate; I did not kick the prisoner in the presence of West - it is West's son and Pearse who have ruined him - West keeps a disorderly house; one of my apprentices was convicted yesterday.</p>

             ABRAM. I am assistant surgeon to Mr. Griffiths. On the 12th of February, I saw the prosecutor at his house, in Tudor-street; he had received some severe wounds from a sharp instrument - they were clear incised wounds, one near the joint of the hip, the other about the centre of the exterior of the thigh; I found cuts about his clothes, but no other wound on his body - they were not dangerous wounds,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110017"></xptr>not calculated to do any great harm - they would not maim him; they were about three quarters of an inch deep, and must have been inflicted with great violence, I think.</p>
               <p>ANN HUTCHINSON. I am the prosecutor's daughter-in-law. I was sweeping the passage down stairs in my father's house, and heard a noise next door, about ten o'clock in the morning; I heard William Davis say to my father "D-n your blood, I will murder you;" I looked out to see what was the matter; I saw my father take William Davis by the collar, and throw him down; I looked into the door of the building - I saw my father have the boy by the collar, and throw him down on his back; I saw my father struggling with the chisel to take it out of his hand, and he attempted to stab him in the breast while he was attempting to take it out of his hand; my father jumped up, and Davis jumped up - father pushed him out of the door; I rang the bell for my mother to come down, and my father fell down from loss of blood (fainting); the prisoner went up stairs, came down again, and went away - he was not up stairs a minute; he had nothing in his hand when he came down - he did not say what he went up stairs for.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw him after this took place? A. Yes - his face was not bleeding.</p>
               <p>JOHN BISHOP. I am an upholsterer and cabinet-maker. My daughter came to me rather terrified, and said, "Father, Mr. Hutchinson is lying bleeding to death, the boy has stabbed him;" I put on my coat and hat, and went and found the prosecutor in his own room.</p>
               <p>EMMA BISHOP. I am the daughter of the last witness. On the day this happened I saw

             give Mr. Hutchinson the wounds - he was in the building, working there; I do not know whether Hutchinson had his face or back to him - I did not see Davis strike him, but I saw him bleeding - the blood came from his thigh; I heard the bell ring as I was going down stairs; Mr. Hutchinson was then laying down; I heard nothing said between them - I went to my father, and said the boy had stabbed him; I said so because I saw Mr. Hutchinson on the floor bleeding - I said the boy had done it, because I heard somebody say

             did it; Davis was by the door when it was said - he said nothing; I do not know whether he heard what was said - Mrs. Hutchinson came down stairs, went up again, and brought some clothes, and as she came down Davis went up; Mrs. Hutchinson laid hold of him, and asked him, what he did that for - he said, "D-n your eyes, if you don't loose me, I will serve you the same;" I saw Mr. Hutchinson go up stairs, and lay on two chairs, bleeding - Davis went away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he say Hutchinson had struck him? A. I think he said Hutchinson had kicked him and knocked him about - the prisoner had a little cut on his lip; it was only bleeding a little - he wiped it off with his handkerchief; it did not bleed much.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My master was in the constant habit of ill-using me, ever since I refused to go to the Political unions with him - he restricted me to come home by nine o'clock, and if not at home then, he locked me out; he was constantly quarreling with me because I would not write to my mother for money - I was kneeling down to my work, which I was obliged to do, he came and kicked me, and accused me of telling tales, which I denied; I got up to prevent his hitting me again, he knocked me down, kept kicking me in the ribs, and told me to be gone and never come near the place again.</p>

            . I am single, and live at Knightsbridge, with my father, who is a carpenter. I saw the prosecutor at his house when I went with the prisoner's mother, about a week ago; we were there an hour - it was evening, and there was a candle in the room; I do not know that I spoke to him - I spoke to Mrs. Davis in his presence; he said he would compromise the matter for 20l., and go to America; he said if he made a flaw in the indictment he should only get scandalized, and the boy would only get off with transportation; but if he had 20l. he would go to America: I also saw him at the Political union.</p>

            . I was going to work about half-past eight o'clock, and met the prisoner at the door; he saw the shutters shut, and went round and asked the witness when he would allow him to open them, as he was doing compo' at the window; the prosecutor met me, and asked where his boy was - I said, "Round the corner;" he went round and ordered him away - they had some words, and he said if he knew him in conversation with Pearse again he would knock his brains out; I am positive I heard the boy cry murder three times.</p>

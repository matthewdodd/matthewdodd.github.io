Finding her hand had been in the right hand pocket, I suspected that it also might have been in the left; I put my hand into my left hand pocket to see if it was gone, and she had taken it; when I put my hand there, I found what I thought to be the half-guinea and the shilling, but I did not take any notice to her; then I walked away with her, and I gave her in charge to the first watchman that I met, which was in Dean-street; he took her to St. Ann's watch-house, and she was searched, and nothing was found upon her but the bad sixpence which I had had in my pocket seven or eight days, and that which I supposed to be the half-guinea in my pocket was a bad farthing, which had not been there before.</p>
               <p>Q. You never found the guinea nor the half-guinea? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober? - A. Perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You have said that she took some liberty with you, I dare say you would rather have expressed it by mutual liberty? - A. I should not unless it was mutual liberty my speaking to her.</p>
               <p>Q. You think you had a guinea and a half - how long before had you felt that guinea and a half in your pocket? - A. Not more than ten minutes before she accosted me.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a dangerous thing going along Soho at that time of the night - You did not tell the girl that you meant to give her in charge of the watchman till you met the watchman? - A. I did not but probably she having been guilty of similar circumstances she might be aware of this.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an oil and colourman, and live in Wardour-street, Soho; the prisoner was my porter for three years. On the 2nd of Decem<lb></lb>ber I sent him down for a shilling's-worth of wood—he took the basket from the shop, and went below, he brought the basket of wood into the shop, and put it in front of the counter—while I was making out the bill of this wood and some other articles, I told him to go to the top of War<lb></lb>dour-street with a bottle of ketchup—while he was gone I examined the basket, and found in it 12lbs. of candles, and 2lbs. of gum—they had been be<lb></lb>low stairs, so that he could take them, and the wood was at the top of them—when he came back I desired him to go and take the wood to Poland-street, but not to mind taking the bill—as soon as he got out I called him back, and told him he had been robbing me—he begged for forgiveness, and hoped I should not prosecute him—I gave him in charge—this is the property.</p>

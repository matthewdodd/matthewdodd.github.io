I</hi> am a City detective-officer—in consequence of some instructions I received, on 12th June I went to Old Swan-lane, Thames-street—I had seen the prisoner on the 8th, at the Black Lion public-house, Bishopsgate-street Within—I saw him meet Mr. Pye—I did not hear what passed between them—I saw them separate, and did not see the prisoner again till the 12th—he was then going on to the pier, from Thames-street, by a Chelsea boat—he was carrying a bundle tied up in this handkerchief (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I went up to him and said, "Your name is Slipper, I believe"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "What have you in that handkerchief?" at the same time telling him I was an officer—he said, "I have some stuff for making combs"—I said, "From whom did you get it?"—he said, "From a man who brought it to my house"—I said, "I have reasons to believe that that property belongs to Mr. Carter, of Primrose-street, and that it is</p>

                  </hi>. I am a comb-maker, at 3, Queen-street, Chelsea—I know the prisoner as a horn presser and polisher—he has been in my father's employment—on Sunday, 5th June, he came to my place—I had seen him on the previous Tuesday, and he asked me if I could do with some ivory pieces to manufacture combs, as he was in a position to get some pieces, and supply me with three or four gross a week—I said, "Yes;" and he said he would bring me a gross on the following Sunday as a sample—he came on the Sunday, and brought me a gross and four pieces of ivory, for which I paid him twelve shillings—these are the things—it is not customary to sell pieces of ivory in this state—on the following day, I communicated with Mr. Carter, of Primrose-street, upon the subject, and on the Tuesday I saw the officer Smart—I wrote a letter on that day to the prisoner, making an appointment, and met him on Wednesday at a public-house, nearly opposite the London Tavern, from about half-past 7 to 8 in the evening—I told him that I could do with some more pieces—he said, "How many would I have, as he was unable to get them without three or four days' notice"—I said, "I should like two gross; when can you bring them?"—he said, "I can't bring them before Sunday, but I shall by then, and it will not interfere with my work"—he then made an appointment to bring me two gross on the Sunday—I did not see him again till the following Monday, when he was in custody—this description of ivory, in my judgment, is worth from twenty-five to thirty shillings a gross.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you ever bought ivory before from any one? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I do not manufacture it myself—I was in a position to manufacture combs, but not of this description—I have manufactured ivory into dressing-combs, but only for Mr. Carter, and for Mr. Simnitt of Kennington-cross—I have received from Mr. Carter certain unmanufactured ivory to make into combs, but not above twice or three times; perhaps I have received it a dozen times from Mr. Simnitt—we are manufacturers of dressing-combs—the other combs are quite a different branch of the trade—I have known the prisoner ten or twelve years—he never made combs—he prepared them for cutting the teeth—I do not know that he ever made horn combs—he flattens the horn into sheets, preparatory to its being manufactured into combs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an ivory merchant and workman in ivory in Fleur-de-Lis-street—I never saw the prisoner till I saw him in custody—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the description of ivory that I manufacture—it is in an unfinished state, and is used for the purpose of making fine tooth-combs—I never sold pieces of this sort in this state—I have a very large stock—we should not miss a gross or two, or twenty gross—this ivory is my property—it is worth from twenty-five shillings to thirty shillings a gross.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Crow-examined. Q.</hi> You have no doubt that that, some time or other, was your ivory? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I make 100 gross a year, all on my own premises—I cut my ivory with water; that is how I know it—there are five or six ivory manufacturers in London—there are some in other parts of the world—I know them all, all over the world, I think—I have cut my ivory combs with water for fifteen years—the advantage in cutting them with water instead of oil is, that the work will not discolour by keeping—ivory cut with oil is apt to discolour by keeping, which deteriorates from the value of the combs if you have not a quick sale for them—I have not taken out a patent for cutting with water—it is open to every one to do it—I know these by the <hi rend="italic">race</hi> the saw makes, and you will find these are rougher than my uncle's, or any body else's—that is a disadvantage—I make the saws that my ivory is cut with myself—we have not taken stock since Christmas last—we take stock every year—I have 8,000 gross in stock—I cannot pledge my oath that I have lost a single piece of ivory—I could if I took stock, I dare say—I cannot tell whether these particular pieces were cut five, three, or two years ago—they may have been cut fifteen years or fifteen weeks.</p>

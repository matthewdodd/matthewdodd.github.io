            . I live in Primrose-street. Bishopgate-street. On the 26th of June, about six o'clock in the evening, I went up the <placeName id="t18090920-13-crimeloc68">City-road</placeName>

I followed the mob into the Shepherd and Shepherdess field; after the fight was over, the croud divided into two columns; after that I went up to see the man who was bruised, a soldier that had been fighting. In about a minute the prisoner and another worked in on each side of me between the mob, and one, by that means, I thought I felt the watch go out of my pocket; I tried to get my hand down between them to feel whether it was gone or not, they pushed against me so that I had not room, at last I gave a little back, I got my hands down, I found it was gone. I took one of them with one hand and the other with the other hand, I pulled them both five or six yards from the ring; I then said one of you two have robbed me of my watch, the men in the ring all came round me in one minute, and left the man that had been fighting; I kept my hold, and a gentleman popped his head over my shoulder; he said, young man you have got more than you can do, have not you a friend that can take one in custody while you keep the other, I answered yes, and delivered one out of my hands to my friend, and bid him keep him; he being rather afraid of the mob, did not touch him; I kept fast hold of the other. It was Goodman that I let go; he then stripped his coat off, and said, search me all over whether I have got the watch or no. Some person said, d - n you, put on your coat and go off, he put on his coat. The prisoner pulled a watch out of his pocket, and asked me if that was my watch, I told him no; my friend, said Hartley, make him prove where he has got that watch. He cried out, father, come and take my watch, they have robbed me of my watch. A man came up, pretending to be his father, took the watch out of his hands. They went away, I I saw no more of him, I still kept my hold of the other, and the mob began to hustle one person against me, and then another, they said I wanted to steal watches. I saw the mob all round was against me; I let him go.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find your watch. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see Goodman afterwards. - A. Not till he was taken in custody the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there a great number of people around you when the watch was gone. - A. There were, but their backs were towards me, they never touched me at all, Goodman and the other were nearest to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never find your watch again. - A. I never saw the watch again.</p>

             at this fight. - A. Yes, I missed Hartley during the fight, after the fight was over I saw Hartley, he had hold of the prisoner and another, he challenged them with having his watch. He did not know which had it, the prisoner pulled off his coat, and offered to be searched, he let him go.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to the counsel, and called no witnesses to his character.</p>

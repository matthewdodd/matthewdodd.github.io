             (Police-constable V 2). I have a certificate of the prisoner's conviction, at Kingston, on the 26th of March, 1832 - I was present, and know she is the person.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating, that her late mistress had struck her in a fit of intoxication and insanity, and afterwards gave her the bracelets, purses, fruit knife, some linen and a handkerchief, as a compensation; that on her return from the hospital on the 1st of March, she missed several things from her box; and her master accused her of stealing two watches, which she denied; that the prosecution proceeded from revenge on his part, because she would not consent to certain improper proposals,. which he made to her on her entering the service.</p>

               <persName id="t18330411-195-person1457">M. FIELDWICK</persName>
            . Q. Did your brother charge her on the 1st of March? A. Yes - I believe he did not intend to prosecute her, if she had produced the watches; she never charged him with making any advances to her - she had only been a fortnight there when she was taken ill; I had not seen the watches for some time - there was a charwoman, but she had no access to the property; I believe a young woman whom the prisoner recommended, attended to my sister, but I was there, the first night I went I had to do some work - I looked for this thimble, and it could not be found; this led to a search for the other things, and they were missed.</p>

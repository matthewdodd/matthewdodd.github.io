                  </hi>. I was carpenter on board the <hi rend="italic">Heather Bell</hi>, from London to Barbadoes. The prisoner was captain of it—John William Norris was an apprentice on board—the vessel started on 1st of August, and up to the fith day the boy conducted himself very well—it was his first voyage to sea—he was about fifteen, and a tall boy of his age—on the fifth day we were in the Channel—the captain accused the boy of being stupid, and that he would not look after what he told him, and he took him by the arm and beat him with the rope's end—he struck him with a three inch rope, and struck him with his hand as well—the boy had not done anything to require a punishment of that sort—when a boy goes on board a ship it takes some time to learn—this boy was willing to learn—after this the captain struck him several times with his hand on the passage out—on the return voyage, on the evening of 30th Oct., I saw the captain take him by the throat, and knock his head against the rails of the mainmast—it was so dark, I could not distinguish his features—it was not blowing hard at that time—the captain did not do anything more then—the boy showed me the marks afterwards, in about ten minutes—I saw the blue marks on the side of his neck, they appeared to have been caused by the hand—I could not see how many marks there were—theboy did not look very bad at that time—he said he did not know what he should do—about 1 o'clock in the morning I was sent to reef the fore tops—Ibelieve the lad was in the fore top—I did not see him fall—he did fall—Idid not see him in the water—I heard him sing out for help—the captain and the black boy were on deck—as soon as we came down the ship was put about—there was a life buoy on board—there was no order to cast it over board, nor to put the boathook out.</p>

                  </hi>. I was an ordinary seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">Heather Bell</hi>—Iremember Norris being in the vessel—after we had been at sea five days I saw the captain rope's end him—I did not see any cause for it—he seemed a sharp clever boy, and willing to do what was ordered—the captain was always at him all the passage out—on the night he fell overboard I was at the wheel, and I saw the captain take hold of him by the throat, and with his other hand he was striking him in the face till he was blue in the face—Isaw him strike him three times—a few hours afterwards he fell overboard—Ido not know whether he fell—I do not know how it happened.</p>

I was steward on board the <hi rend="italic">Heather Bell</hi>—I saw nothing in going out; but in coming home I saw the captain illtreat Norris—heseized him by the throat with his left hand, and beat him about the face with his right, and put the watch tackle round his neck—I saw the boy afterwards; he did not show me his neck the same night—I was going up to reef sails when the boy went overboard—I saw the boy fall.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What do you say the captain did? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He seized the boy by the throat, and knocked him about the face; he put the watch tackle round his neck and twisted it till the boy was black and blue in the face; his eyes became fixed, and his tongue projected—I was at that time close to the ship's head—the captain did it full in my face—I was complained of by the captain for getting drunk—he did not complain that I was so drunk I could not speak: he said, "Steward. I have seen you in liquor before; mind I don't see you so again"—he did not charge me with taking a little rum out of his cabin.</p>

                  </hi>.

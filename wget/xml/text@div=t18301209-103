On the 16th of November I attended a sale at Artillery-place, and on the 18th I went there again - I paid the auctioneer 3l. 6s. for this glass, which was then fixed in the drawing-room, over the fire, and he gave me a ticket to receive it from the porter; I had seen the prisoner in the hall of the house - he had assisted me in taking down the bracket of a clock, which I had bought, and having the tool in his hand, he offered to assist in taking down the glass, and I told him be might; I then sent the porter I usually employ, home with the clock, and told him to return for the glass - I left the house, and did not see the glass till the following Saturday, when I went to a public-house in Shoreditch, and saw it fixed up there - the prisoner came to my house that day, by the persuasion of an acquaintance of his, and gave himself up to me; the other man said, in his presence, "This is the man who has taken your glass;" he did not contradict it, but appeared to me knowledge it - I then gave him into custody: when he offered to take down the glass he appeared heavy and dull, as if habitually drunk, but he did not appear drunk then; I did not see any other glass at the sale.</p>

            . I keep the Crown and Shuttle public - house, in Shoreditch. On the Thursday morning before the 23rd of November, I saw the prisoner at my house, between eleven and twelve o'clock; I had known him fifteen or sixteen years - he asked me if I would buy a looking-glass; I said I was not in want of one - he pressed me very much to look at it, and said it belonged to a friend of his who wanted money, and asked if he should show it to me; I said if he came that way I had no objection to look at it - he brought it in about a quarter of an hour; he said the person wanted 50s. for it - I offered him 2l. for it: he went away, returned in about a quarter of an hour, and said the person said if I could not give more I should have it - I paid him, and put it up directly; on the Saturday the prosecutor came to my house and saw it - I gave it up to Eagles, the officer; I have known the prisoner sixteen or eighteen years, and thought him an honest, hard-working man.</p>

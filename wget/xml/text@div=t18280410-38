Smith, the deceased, frequented the house, and was there on Saturday, the 22d of March, between six and seven o'clock, very much in liquor - he came in about half-past six, and was very disorderly; he kept abusing my mistress and her sister who were in the bar; my master was out, and had asked the prisoner to come home as early as he could to assist mistress in the house - he came between six and seven o'clock, when the deceased was abusing mistress; the prisoner cleaned himself to wait in the tap-room; Smith continued to abuse mistress and her sister till a quarter to ten, when he went into the parlour and rang the bell violently - he was intoxicated, and we would not supply him with liquor; I answered the bell - Smith was standing at the door, and two gentlemen behind him; he asked them to take something, which they refused; he then said, "I shall go and serve Curley out," (the prisoner was called by that name in the house) - he went into the passage, opened the taproom door, and dragged Curley out by the collar with both hands - the prisoner had done nothing to him; two gentlemen who had followed him from the parlour got him away, and to prevent further disturbance I pushed Smith out of doors - he asked me to give him his hat, which I did; he left the house, and in five or ten minutes returned to the bar - he continued abusing us as before; the prisoner was then in the tap-room - mistress called him out, intending to pacify the deceased, who was using words unfit for a female to hear; the prisoner came and stood in the passage outside the tap-room door, and said, "Smith, take my advice, and go home" - Smith answered, "I shall go when I like, and where I like;" he then challenged the prisoner to fight - they both went out of the house together, and when I got to the door I saw Smith rising from the ground; I laid hold of his arm, and begged of him, for Heaven's sake, to come into the house, and not fight any more - he got from me, and struck another blow at the prisoner, who then gave him a push between the shoulders and he fell.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he behind him? A. He was coming towards him from the opposite side of the way - he was rather sideways; I went in to get a candle, and when I came out I saw him sitting on the curb on the other side of the way, but he did not appear to be hurt; Mr. Peters came and examined him - the prisoner and three others brought him into the house; he staid there all night, and master sat up with him - he died in our house about nine o'clock the next evening.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. He was very drunk, was he not also in a very great passion? A. Yes- the prisoner and him were very great friends before, and he treated him the day before; it was time for our house to be cleared - the prisoner only pushed him to get him away from him; the prisoner is a very good natured young man.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Bligh, an oilman, who lives a few doors from this house. A few minutes after eleven o'clock I put up the shutters, and as I turned to go into the house I heard a bustle at the door of the public-house - the deceased fell three or four feet from where I stood, and his hat fell off; I thought he was pushed, but did not see how it happened - he got up and made a reel towards the door; I saw two females in the door-way - the prisoner stood with his back against the side-post, and as the deceased approached the prisoner, he (the prisoner) said, "D-n his eye," and struck one blow at him - he fell across the street with a terrible crash - it was like the falling of a tree; the parties then withdrew, and shut the door; Mr. Peters came up, and asked me who struck the man - Mr. Peters then went and knocked at the door; they did not open it readily - he insisted on its being opened, and the servant opened it.</p>

            . I am the street-keeper: about ten o'clock on this night I went into the public-house and shook hands with the deceased, who I knew - he was drunk, and using words before the landlady and her sister which a sober man would not use - I persuaded him to go out with me; we walked down Gutter-lane; he was about a quarter of an hour with me; I pressed him to go home to Hackney; he said "No, I think I am insulted by that monkey Curley, and will go and kick up a row." I did all I could to persuade him not to go, but he would - he went, and I left him - being an officer, I would not meddle with such things.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Gutter-lane: I was returning home about ten minutes past eleven o'clock, and about ten yards from this public-house, I heard somebody swearing; I turned round and saw the deceased fall with a very heavy fall - he was very drunk; I found he had fallen on his face: I paused a few moments, and finding he did not get up, I went and examined him; he appeared insensible; I drew his hand from under his face and felt his pulse perfectly correct; I asked the last witness who had knocked him down; I then went to the public-house and knocked at the door; they did not open it immediately, but in a very few minutes the servant and landlady came out, and rendered him every assistance in their power; they took him into the house, while I went home for my instruments, and on returning, I made a strict examination of his head, and was astonished to find there was not the least contusion or any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100041"></xptr>external appearance, except a very small bruise on the side of the eye; during my examination he vomited as if he had been drinking a great quantity of ardent spirits - he was put into the prisoner's bed and every attention paid him - the prisoner sat up all night; I saw him three times that night, and desired I might be fetched if an alteration took place; I was fetched about nine o'clock in the morning - I found him insensible, and bled him copiously; I cupped him about seven, and at half-past nine he died: I afterwards examined his body in the presence of Mr. Kingdom: on moving the scalp from the head, there was not the least appearance of a bruise between the scalp and skull - on opening the head we found a very considerable effusion, covering the whole surface of the brain, but more particularly on the right side, where there was a very considerable quantity of coagulated blood - a considerable blood vessel on the brain had given way.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not his being in liquor and in a passion, have caused the rupture of the blood-vessel? A. Certainly - and his straining when vomiting would produce it.</p>

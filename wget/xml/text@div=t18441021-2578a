                  </hi>. I am the wife of Zachariah Francis Daniel Purdy. I have a baby, which was eight weeks old last Friday. About one o'clock this day week Blake came to my house—she said, "Mrs. Purdy, will you let me take your baby out for a walk?"—I said, "You can't take it out"—in consequence of something she said, she took the child out of the cradle, and I gave her the hood and the shawl, to put over the baby—I did not see it again till two in the morning—I had been searching for the child all the day and all the night—it was very ill when it came back—it has been in fits ever since—I took it to the doctor—it is a male child—it was not christened—I was very ill during the day—I have seen the prisoner Smith passing by my door.</p>

Stanton asked me to go and ask Mrs. Purdy to let me take the child out for a walk—Smith was there at the time—they said they would not be gone above a quarter of an hour, and told me to clean the room out—they said they would give me a shawl and some shoes after they returned—the prosecutor did not live above a minute's walk from our house—I got the child, and brought it home to Stanton, as she asked me for it—I gave it her—I remained in the house, and they went away im<lb></lb>mediately—I was taken to the station—I did not know Smith before, any more than by her coming to Mrs. Stanton's, a fortnight ago last Tuesday—I remained at the station till the child was brought home—I am sure it is the same baby.</p>

I live in Kirkham-place, Tottenham-court-road—on the 17th of October, Smith came and rang the bell—I went down, and took the child out of her arms, and took it into Smith's mother's room—Smith told me to take the child up stairs, and she went into the room—Smith had lived at the house before—her husband is a policeman, and lives at the station—she resided in Kirkham-place before her marriage, and for seven or eight weeks since—she came up stairs—I made her tea, and then I changed the child's bed-gown, because it was dirty—I did not hear her say whose child it was—we thought it was her own—she had been away ten days, and we did not know where she was—she said, some one had run for Smith—meaning her</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live at No. 12, Nelson's<lb></lb>place, Locksfields. The prisoner is married to my niece—he is a shoe<lb></lb>maker, and lodged with me up to Thursday, the 27th of March—hs came home about a quarter to two o'clock that day—I think he was in liquor—I went down to his room and asked if he had any rent for me—he owed me 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. rent—he said he had none for me—I said it was not likely that he would have any, for he had been out three days previous, and had not been at work, he had been losing his time so, idling about—I told him I would forgive him the rent be owed me if he would go out of my place—he said I could not afford to lose it, and he should not go until he had paid me—I said I thought I was authorised to put his things outside the door—he said he knew the law as well as me, I must not put them out, if I did I should find him a different man to what he was (he had been a very quiet well conducted man before) my wife was there, and portion of his furniture and put it out at the door—I think it was a child's chair, and another chair—when she came in again he went over towards her—I said, <hi rend="italic">"Jem</hi>, do not strike my wife"—he had not lifted his hand to strike her at that moment, but I thought he was about to do so—I cannot say whether I pushed a table up against him, or whether I did not, or whether he thought I intended to strike him, but he took up a hammer</p>

               <p>and struck me with it on the head—I cannot say that he struck me more than once—it stunned me—I cannot say whether I lost my senses or not, but I heard my wife scream; that brought me to myself—I was bleeding—I went over to Mr. Dry, the surgeon—he dressed my head—I was bleeding all the way I went—I walked home again, and went to bed—I kept my bed for a week, without getting up—I am a great deal better now, quite nicely—it was a shoemaker's hammer he struck me with—it was in the room where he worked, and the hammer laid down before him—I have known him from a boy, I should say twelve or fourteen years—he always behaved very quiet—that was his character up to the time he struck me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Girling. I remember the prisoner coming home on Thursday—he has two children—the eldest little girl was in my room when he came home—he spoke from one room to the other to the child, and asked her what business she had with me—I said I took her in out of good nature, as he had left her with a fire in the room—I afterwards went into the room when my husband was there—I began to remove a chair or two from the room—when I came back, I laid my hand on a tea-board—I did not see the prisoner come towards me, but I heard my husband say, "Don't strike my wife!"—I saw my husband standing still—the prisoner took up a hammer, and struck him one blow—I screamed and threw my arms round my husband's neck—he seemed to reel, and put his hand to his head—he did not fall—the prisoner stood still—I took up a little chair, and tried to strike him with it—he threw up the window, and told the people outside what rent he owed—he remained abont the place a little while, and then went away—he said he would not strike me—I could not see whether my husband's head bled, for my sight seemed to leave me, I was so frightened.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. Girling came to me about two o'clock in the afternoon—he had two incised wounds in the head, over the left eye—the sharp edge of this hammer might have inflicted them—a branch of the temporal artery was severed by it, and a considerable quantity of blood lost—he has been under my care ever since, and is not well yet—I think he will do well—it is impossible to say whether he may not suffer permanently from it—the wound is of that character that weeks and months might elapse before any symptom might present itself—I do not think him out of danger—when before the Magistrate, I called it a dangerous wound—it must have been inflicted by two blows, for the upper wound is longitudinal, and the other transverse.</p>

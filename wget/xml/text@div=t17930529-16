I told him I was; he told me he had been robbed of half a guinea and two half crowns and a purse; I went and took the woman out of the room directly, and searched her, and found 2 s. and two halfpence, and a clasp knife.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. This man picked me up in Broad-street; he asked me if I had a room of my own; I said I had; I took him to the room, and he asked me what I was to have? I said I left it to him; he said he had a six-pence; I said I never was with a gentleman for six-pence; he then said he had a shilling, and after he had connection he wanted the shilling back again, and I said I would not give it him; so he knocked me down and gave me a black eye, and made me bleed, and the other woman came to my assistance; as for the knife I had it to cut a bit of bread and cheese.</p>

On the 25th of October, the two prisoners came into my shop, to order a riding hat, and on the 31st, they came in to know if it was ready; it was the prisoner Thompson who ordered it, only she left her name Fulford. She tried it on, and it fitted her, and she remarked there was no band on it; I told her I could put a band on it in a minute, but she said no; she had seen a pattern a day or two before, and she would come the next day and bring it, They then went out of the shop, they went both together; and had not been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181512060053"></xptr>me scarcely a moment, before I heard a violent scream, and a man came past the door, with the woman who calls herself Thompson, and held up three beaver bonnets, saying at the same time, here are only there. He took her to the Compter, and came again, and shewed the bonnets to me, and asked me if they were my property? I told him they were, and he said I must go to Guildhall the next morning.</p>

            . I am an officer, and on the evening of the 31st of October, I was standing at about five o'clock at the corner of Barbican, in company with another officer. The prisoners went past us, and a little girl with them. Knowing them before, I was induced to watch them; they went into a large linen-draper's shop, in Barbican, and staid in for a full hour. When they came out, I immediately went in, and asked if they had missed any thing; but they said no, they had not; for they had been aware of them, and had watched them too closely. They then went into a hatter's shop, at the corner of Redcross-street; they talked together in the shop for a little bit, and then hustled up together to a chair against the counter. Thompson was pulling her own bonnet off, which she had on, and the other was covering her, and I saw her scramble one of the hats from by the chair, and clapped it under her petticoats. Then she went behind the counter, to try her bonnet on, where she was about two or three minutes, and then she came back again, where she was before, and stopped, and put another hat under her petticoats. She then fumbled about a good bit about a band for the bonnet, and then she took another, and put that under her petticoats. In about two minutes they came out; I let them get about two houses from Mr. Frank's, and then we stopped them; they struggled very hard, and a gang of fellows came over from the corner of Golden-lane, and rescued Ford from me. I brought the other prisoner and the hats back to Franks's and he said that the hats were his property. I am sure Ford is the person who was in company with Thompson; Barrett apprehended Ford the next day.</p>

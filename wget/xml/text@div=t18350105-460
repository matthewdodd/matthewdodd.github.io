                  </hi>. I am a surgeon and apothecary, and live in the parish of West Ham, in Essex. I went out on Tuesday, the 23rd of De<lb></lb>cember, about eleven o'clock, leaving a gold watch and chain, seal and key, and a mourning ring, on the table in the surgery, at the back of the shop—I returned home aboit a quarter to one o'clock, and was informed they had been stolen—the female prisoner was there in custody—I asked her who had given her the basket of lemons and oranges, which she had when taken—she stated that a man in black gave them to her to hold, and then ran away, and she had never seen the person before—while I was in convers<lb></lb>tion I was informed that the male prisoner was taken—I then went out, and saw him in the custody of the constable of West Ham—he was then taken to my house—I asked him what he had done with the property he had taken—he said, "What property?"—I then begged of him to state the truth, and tell me where he had placed what he had stolen—he was then searched, and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. found on him, but no portion of the property. I then went out of the room, and heard him in conversation with Mrs. Fenner, who was in the house when the property was stolen—she was endeavour<lb></lb>ing to persuade him to acknowledge where he had placed the property—I held him say, "If they would let me go I would tell where I put it"—on hearing which, I entered the room, and told him if he would tell me where he had peaced the property, I would do all I could that he might not be punished—he said he was afraid I would not keep my word, or he would show me—I then said, "Well then, you must take your course, I am no liar"—he then said if the handcuffs were taken off he would company me and one officer, and show us where he had Placed the pro<lb></lb>perty—I said, "Do so, and all that man can do for your discharge I will do"—he then accompanied us to the marshes, where he had been taken, and said he had plunged them, with his left hand, into the ditch, both the watch and the mourning ring—he was allowed to go into the ditch, and was searching about from one ditch to another for three hours, but we be<lb></lb>gan to suppose he was merely losing time, and refused to remain any longer—he still swore he had placed it in the second ditch, and was then taken away in custody—I have not found any part of the property—the ditches have been searched.</p>

I know nothing about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge at Mr. Vallance's—I had charge of his house. On Tuesday, the 23rd of December, I was in the surgery—a gold watch, and gold chain, seals, and key, and a mourning-ring, laid on the table—I left the room about twenty-five minutes after twelve o'clock—I shut the surgery door, and went down into the kitchen, which is under the surgery—the outer door of the house was open—I was gone two minutes at the outside, when I thought I heard a footstep over my head, in the surgery—I directly came up and saw the prisoner Green leaving the front door, with a basket under his right arm, with oranges and lemons in it—I thought it appeared very strange, his leaving a house without either knock<lb></lb>ing or ringing—I went and looked into the shop, and then saw the surgery-door open, which I had shut when I went down—there is another door leading to the kitchen stairs, which was likewise shut—seeing the surgery-door open, I directly missed the watch and rings—I then followed as quick as possible, and saw Green give the basket to Allen, who turned her head and saw me coming—she said something to Green, what I cannot say, and then Green ran—I directly went up to Allen and asked where the man was who gave her the basket, and what he ran for—she said she did not know, she never saw the man before in her life—I cried, "Stop thief"—I took hold of Allen, brought her into the shop with me, and sent for an officer—she still declared she had never seen the man before, and that she had not broken her fast—it was then half-past twelve o'clock—I took the basket from her hand in the street, and placed it in the shop till the con<lb></lb>stable came—the constable wished me to search her—I did so, and found a half-crown, some halfpence, and the key of a door in her pocket—I then asked her how she could say she had no means to break her fast, when she had money in her pocket—she had said she had no means to break her fast—I asked her what brought her to West Ham—she told me, to look for shoe-binding, which she had inquired for at one shop, as she said—John Green was brought back about half-past one o'clock, to Mr. Val-lance's shop—he was then nearly up to his shoulders in mud, from the ditches he had been jumping in—I then asked him how he came to take the property—he appeared to be very confused, and said, "What property?"—I told him the watch and ring which he had taken from Mr. Vallance's surgery—he ihcn burst into tears, and said, "If I tell, Mr. Vallance will prosecute me"—I said, "You had better tell what you have done with</p>

On the Tuesday, when Mr. Vallance's house was robbed, I was at Mr. Smart's corner, about twenty yards from Mr. Vallance's house—I saw the male prisoner run past the corner—he had a watch in his hand—the chain hung down out of his hand—it was a yellow metal watch—I could see it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable. I took the prisoner Allen into custody—I asked her what Mrs. Fenner had brought her there for—she said some man had been stealing a watch, and she was brought there on suspicion of being with him—that the man ran to her, and gave her a basket, but she had never seen the man before in her life—she had a young child with her—I said, "It is not very likely, having a young child, that you would carry a man's baket, if you knew nothing of him"—she said, so help her God, she never saw him before in her life—I asked her where she came from—she said, from London; and as she was a poor unfor<lb></lb>tunate girl, her father and her had had a few words, and she came to look for some shoe-binding, and she had not broken her fast for two days—the man was afterward, brought to Mr. Vallance's house, and Mrs. Fenner identified him—they asked him what he had done with the property—he said if we would take off the handcuffs, so help him God, he would show us where the property was—that it was either in the first ditch or the second—I said it did not rest with me—Mr. Vallance said he would try all he could to ease him in the punishment—he said, in the first instance, that he was not the man—we accompanied him to the marshes, but did not find any thing.</p>

               <p>said, if the handcuffs were taken off, he would go and show where the property was? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the shop—Mrs. Fenner was there—I stayed there the whole time she and he were in conversation—I never left the place—he said this without any suggestion from any body; and said he was in such a fright, he could not tell what ditch it was in, but it was in the first or second—Mrs. Fenner said if he would tell her, she would do all she could towards easing his punishment, or something to that effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Green's Defence.</hi> I know nothing at all about it—they are swearing quite false—Mrs. Fenner at first said she would give me half-a-sovereign if I told her where it was—they were at me nearly an hour and a half, in the shop, to tell—I said I knew nothing about it, but at last I said, "Take the handcuffs off, and if you will let me go, I will go and show you"—I was forced to do it, or they would not take the handcuffs off—they kept me out until nine o'clock, and kept giving me liquor in the public-house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Allen's Defence.</hi> When the man was brought into the shop, they asked if that was him—I said I did not know, for all I knew him by was a black coat and handkerchief—a man came in, and said the doctor says, "Let the woman go, I do not see what she has to do with it"—Smith said, "Oh yes, we can get people to say any thing."</p>
               <p>(Henry Tyler, coal-dealer, Kingsland-road; and James Harris, Nelson-street, Shoreditch, gave the prisoner Allen a good character.)</p>

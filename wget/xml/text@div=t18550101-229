                  </hi>. I am a labourer—on Sunday, 24th Dec, about 1 o'clock in the morning, I was going along the London-road, carrying a bundle under my arm, containing two sheets, four pillow cases, and a petticoat; it was wrapped in a handkerchief—as I was walking along, a man came up and knocked me down—I do not know what he hit me with—he hit me on the side of my mouth, and the back of my head—I had a hat on; it was knocked off, but I got it again—the consequence of the blow was that I was quite <hi rend="italic">unsensed</hi>—I cannot tell for how long; I think for an hour—when I came to myself I felt very uncomfortable, and all blood and mud—I bled from my head and face, and I have been very ill ever since—I was hurt all over—I do not know that I was struck anywhere else—I never saw my bundle again till the policeman brought it to me—I</p>

                  </hi> I am a waiter, and live at Walworth—I was going along the London-road about 1 o'clock on 24th Dec.—I was going towards the Elephant and Castle—I saw the prisoner and two other persons running, and they met the prosecutor—they either pushed or knocked him down—I ran across and picked him up, and while I was doing so, the prisoner stooped and picked up the bundle, and ran away with it—the prosecutor was quite insensible, lying on his back, and I saw he was bleeding from the mouth and the back of his head—I went to the station, and found the prisoner there—I am sure he is the person who picked up the bundle—I had seen him before, very frequently, and I was quite certain as to his person—the prosecutor was brought to the station, but he was in such an insensible state, that when they asked him the questions all he could say was, "I don't know."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, L</hi> 134). On Sunday morning, 24th Dec., I was on duty in the London-road—I saw a mob of fifteen or sixteen people assembled at the top of the London-road—I hastened to the spot and looked over the people; I saw the prosecutor on his back apparently insensible—Mr. Rouse was assisting him up—a woman touched me on the shoulder and said, "There goes a man with a bundle; it belongs to this man"—I turned round and saw the prisoner—I knew him before, and I chased him through three or four streets—he ran into the hands of a plain clothes constable, who took hint—I had seen him with the bundle, but he had dropped it—he had not got it when he was taken—I saw the prosecutor afterwards; he appeared to be in an insensible state—I found the bundle had been taken back, and was by the side of the prosecutor—with the assistance of another officer, I got him to the station—he was insensible, and not able to answer questions at first; after about twenty minutes he recovered him<lb></lb>self—he did not appear at all drunk.</p>

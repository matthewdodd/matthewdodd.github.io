I am the wife of John Bath, who keeps a chandler's stop at 21, Ecoleston-street, East—on Friday, 29th November, the two prisoners came to my shop, and McManus asked for some tea, sugar, and butter, with which I served her—they came to 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and she gave me a half-crown—I gave her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in change, and put the half-crown in my pocket—I had no other silver loose in my pocket—they turned away from the counter, and McManus said, "I forgot, I want a half-quartern loaf"—I served her with it, and she offered a shilling—the loaf was 3 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I gave he 8 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and put the shilling in the till—there was no other shilling there—it was no one of the shillings that I had given her previously—I gave her the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of my pocket, and am sure they were good—the two prisoners went away together</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186112160068"></xptr>
               <p>—about 10 minutes afterwards I looked at the shilling and found it was bad—in consequence of that I looked at the half-crown, and found it was bad—I put the half-crown and the shilling by themselves in a purse—I gave the prisoners in charge on Saturday night in Grosvenor-road—I gave informa<lb></lb>tion, and they were taken by constable A 249—I gave the coins up at the police-court.</p>

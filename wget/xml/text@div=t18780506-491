                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi> 238 <hi rend="italic">H</hi>). On the evening of 16th April I was in Bethnal Green Road about 2.15—I saw three men standing together—the prisoner was one—I concealed myself in a doorway—they went down Church Read—I heard a breaking of glass—I crossed the road and met the prisoner, buttoning up his coat—I stopped him and asked what was the matter, he said "Nothing"—I asked him what he had under his clothes, he said "Nothing"—I opened his coat and took this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> from under his left arm—another constable came up—I took the prisoner back to the house and found a ground-floor window broken, a small pane, about ten feet from the pavement—I took the prisoner to the station—he was examined—I found these five keys, this knife, and a gouge on him—I have accidentally lost the gouge—the prisoner said I made a mistake.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I did not see the other two men afterwards—I lost sight of them in about a minute—the keys were separate—I have corded them together—they are ordinary keys—the prisoner did not say that he heard the breaking of a window and that he stumbled and picked up the piece of iron in the road.</p>

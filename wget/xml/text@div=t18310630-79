On the 13th of June I gave her into custody for being intoxicated - we could not get her to bed nor out of the house, she was so riotous and abusive; the articles stated have been produced to me by the officer, and I can swear to them - it is a particular sort of soap which washes with hard water: we send for it out of the City -I have the fellow sleeve to this one, and the ribbon and lace are what I had sold Mrs. Willder out of my own shop.</p>
               <p>GEORGE TILLEY. I am a Police-constable. On the 13th of June I was called by the prosecutor, and found the prisoner intoxicated; I went up stairs with her - she got her bonnet off the table, then unlocked a drawer, and pulled out a shawl; she locked the drawer again, and when she got to the door she said, "I have a bob in the drawer, and it is of no use to go to quod without blunt;" she then went to the drawer, and took out a purse - there was an eye-glass in it, which she took out, and was going to put it into her pocket; I took that and the purse from her, and brought them down - the prosecutor said the glass belonged to one of his children, and the purse was claimed by Mrs. Willder; I took the prisoner to the watch-house - I searched her, and found some of these articles on her; I then went to her room again - she gave me the key of her drawer to fetch a pocket-book, which had some writing in it, which she did not wish her mistress to see; I found in the drawer, this ribbon, lace, frock-body, and shoe-horn - she said her mistress desired her to put all the things laying about in the drawer.</p>
               <p>MR. WILLDER. This key is the key of the beer, which she purloined to help herself - I know these things to be ours; we had two or three of our children in that room, but the prisoner had the drawers exclusively to herself.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in a long defence, stated, that the prosecutrix had desired her to put any thing into the drawers which she might find laying about, and having found some of the articles she had done so; that the drawers were for the use of the children, who slept in the room, and some of the things had been given to her by the prosecutrix's daughter.</p>
               <p>MR. WILLDER. My wife did not keep her drawers locked - part of this lace is quite new.</p>

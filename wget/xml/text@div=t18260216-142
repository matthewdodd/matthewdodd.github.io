               <p>WILLIAM MAYGER. On the 20th of January, about five minutes past ten o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came up to me while I was looking in at a shop - she accosted me in a familiar way, and asked if I would go with her to a corner - I did so, and staid there a short time - I then missed my purse and five sovereigns; I looked about, and found her in about twenty minutes in Pimlico; she denied having seen me at all; in coming by a dead wall, near Grosvenor-place, she took her right hand from her pocket, and dropped something - I said to the watchman,"She has dropped something;" he found two sovereigns and a half; she begged very hard for mercy - and I said, if she would return me my money, I would satisfy her and the watchman; she said she could not, as she had thrown it away; she then desired the watchman to let her go, and she would give him what silver she had in her pocket; I then heard some money chink in her left-hand, and said she had got my sovereign; she said she had not - and I said she should go to the watch-house; and there she said she had thrown away the money, thinking it might be marked.</p>

The prosecutor gave charge of the prisoner, and I took her to the watch-house; there was another woman in her company; I walked between the two - the prosecutor said, "Watchman, she has dropped my sovereigns;" I turned round with my light, and saw the three pieces on the ground - he took them up; we went to the watch-house, and there she said she had thrown all the money away.</p>

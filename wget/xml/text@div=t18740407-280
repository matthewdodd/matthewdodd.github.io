                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman II</hi> 156). On 27th February, about 12.10 at night I saw a drunken man in the street in St. George's-in-the-East—I saw the prisoner strike him a violent blow on side of his head and snatch at his watch—he then saw me and ran off—I was on the opposite side of the way 6 or 8 yards off standing in shadow—I was able to see him</p>

I live at 2, Ell Street, St. George's-in-the-East—on 27th February, at 12.20—I was returning home, heard a cry of "stop thief," and saw the prisoner running—I pursued him, and when he found that he began to walk—I went behind him and caught him by the collar—he said "Let me go"—I said "I shan't"—he threw himself down and kicked me in the jaw, and about the body and on my knee—there was a crowd round him, and he said to them "For God's sake get me away"—they rescued him and he got away and ran—I went after him and gave him in custody.</p>

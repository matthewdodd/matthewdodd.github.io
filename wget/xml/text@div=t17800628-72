               <p>Was you at Mr. Baker's, on the 7th of June last? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner any time that day? - I cannot positively say he is the person. Several people came up to me and demanded money; that was at about eleven o'clock at night on Wednesday the 7th of June. I was standing at the door, about half a dozen people came up to me and demanded some money. I offered them some halfpence; they refused halfpence. I then offered them a sixpence; they refused that, saying they took nothing under a shilling; upon which I gave them a shilling. When I gave them the money they gave three huzzas, and went on.</p>
               <p>What induced you to give this shilling? - It was through fear.</p>
               <p>Are you able to recollect whether the prisoner was or was not one of those persons? - I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Court. Had these persons any weapons? - Yes, I think most of them had sticks or bludgeons.</p>
               <p>Was there any more persons assembled at the time? - The street was in confusion at the time; I believe there was but half a dozen of the mob.</p>

               <p>Do you remember being present at the time Mr. Wheeler has spoken to, when some people came up to him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What was it? - I do not recollect the evening, it was the night Mr. Langdale's house was attacked; I believe between ten and eleven o'clock. They came and knocked at the door; I was in the dining-room putting out lights. I went down stairs and opened the door; they wanted money they said. I told them that Mr. Baker was not at home, and we were nothing but servants, and could not afford to give any money; Mr. Wheeler offered them money for a pot of beer; they refused that. After that he offered them money for half a gallon, sevenpence; they refused to take that, and said, they took nothing less than a shilling. I desired Mr. Wheeler to give them a shilling to get the mob from the house.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect either of them? - To the best of my knowledge the prisoner was one of them.</p>
               <p>Court. If you have a doubt about it say so? - I doubt about it because it was late. I cannot swear to him.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. I have another witness to support this charge, but I have learned that he has some ill-will to the prisoner, therefore I shall not call him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, living in Bowling-green-street, Stoke Newington-common—the prisoner lodged in the same house as me. On Wednesday evening, the 6th of April, I had five sovereigns and two half-sovereigns—I pinned them in my left side waistcoat-pocket—the prisoner was in the kitchen at that time, and saw me with them—I went to bed, and laid my clothes down on a box by the side of the bed—the pri<lb></lb>soner came to bed to me—he got up next morning about five o'clock—I got up about six—I put on my clothes, and went to work—I did not miss my money till about half-past six—no money has been found—three or four men slept in the room—the prisoner wanted to borrow 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from me the day before, to have his hand-saw mended, and down stairs, about eight or nine o'clock, he said he had only 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

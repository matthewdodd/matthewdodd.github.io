            . I am the prosecutor's son. In consequence of suspicion, I made a hole in the wainscot through which I could see all over the workshop, and about five minutes to eight o'clock, I saw the prisoner go to the fire to toast a small piece of cheese with his right hand, and with his left he took two pieces of pewter out of the put, and put them into his left hand breeches pocket - I acquainted my father, who sent for an officer. My father stopped him as he was going out of the shop door. I saw it found in his pocket - he said it was the first offence, and begged forgiveness.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Pancras; I know New Inn-yard, Tottenham-court-road, where this stable is. On the night of the 10th of May, I was passing by there, but did not go down the yard; about three o'clock in the morning as I was going by the yard to the watch-house with a charge, I saw a horse come out of the yard with the prisoner Rowe on its back; I proceeded on with my charge - this was about eight minutes before three o'clock. I knew Rowe's person well before - I knew him by the name of Cooper - I have not the least doubt of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you tell anybody of it that night? A. I told the master (the prosecutor) of it at four o'clock in the morning, and gave him a description of the prisoner: I did not mention his name- it was on Sunday morning, the 11th of May.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to deliver up your coat at the watch-house that morning, did you mention it to the night officer? A. I did; his name is Burchman - I did not tell him the name of the person I had seen on the horse; I knew him well by sight - I described him as a short stiff man, and described his dress; I swear I gave Burchman that description; I mentioned it to all who were at the watch-house; Burchman was present, but I did not mention any name; I have known Rowe for twelve months by name, but not by the name he is indicted.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any name to Burchman, or to any body till you heard Rowe was in custody? A. No, I did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290019"></xptr>- a reward of 10l. was offered, but I never knew that till I had described the prisoner; I did not mention his name till I heard of the reward; I did not hear that 10l. was offered till the Sunday night.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had known Rowe's name for twelve months, what is the reason that you did not mention it to your own night constable? A. I could not recollect the name at all; I described his dress - I did not describe his person.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say you said it was a short thick man? A. Yes, but I never mentioned his name; I described his dress - I did not particularly describe him to Burchman, but he was present; I was not able to recollect his name till after I heard a reward was offered - that did not bring it to my memory.</p>

               <p>Q. What brought the name to your memory? A. I saw the man at Marlborough-street - I saw him that night, but he goes by so many nick names.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Burchman mention the robbery to you? A. I will not be sure which of them mentioned it - whether I mentioned it to him or he to me first; the other watchman was talking about the horse; I said I saw a horse that morning, and said it was a short stiff man, and had a dark dress on; I said that in the presence of several; Burchman was in the chair; I heard of the reward between eleven and twelve o'clock on the Sunday night - I did not see Rowe till the Thursday following; I never mentioned his name, only to my fellow watchman, Halliher; I mentioned the name to him on the Monday; that was after I heard of the reward; I never had a quarrel with the prisoner: I was once at a fight.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he not been continually sneering at you about that fight? A. He never insulted me any more than at the fight; I was chucking a skittle ball; and he gave me a push down at the fight; I have no ill will to him; I was not fighting myself at all.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long ago was this fight? A. About eighteen months; I have seen him about the streets at nights since that; I never knew him by the name of Rowe, before he was apprehended; I knew him by the name of Cooper - when I saw him in custody he was at Marlborough-street, among other persons; I looked round the yard where they were, and pointed him out; I described him to the constable of the night, between five and six o'clock in the morning, when we were going off duty.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On Sunday morning, the 11th of May, I and Waters were going to the watch-house with a charge, and saw the horse come out of the New Inn yard, with a man on it; I was compelled to stop for it to pass - I did not know the man before, but I knew him afterwards; it was the prisoner Rowe; I am positive he is the man - I took particular notice of his clothes and gaiters, and am certain of him; I pointed him out among fifteen prisoners at Marlborough-street; I went on with my charge to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You never knew him before? A. No; it was about 5 minutes before 3 o'clock in the morning; we were taking a drunken man to the watch-house, and had hold of him; he was rather angry - we had to stop till the horse passed by; it came out quite easy; I went to the watch-house with Waters - Burchman was in the chair; I did not hear Waters mention the prisoner's name; he came to me on the Wednesday, and told me I was to go to Marlborough-street; and said the man's name was Cooper; I am sure he said that on Wednesday; I did not hear of a reward till Thursday; Waters did not tell me of the reward on Sunday night -Wednesday night was the first time he mentioned Cooper's name to me; I never heard of the reward till after I came out of the office; I then saw it stuck up in the office; Waters told me there was a reward on Wednesday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not swear you never heard of it till you came out of the office on Thursday? A. I mistook you- he told me of it on Wednesday.</p>

            . I am a carrier, and live in New Inn-yard, Tottenham-court-road. On Saturday night, the 10th of May, between twelve and one o'clock, I saw Rowe facing the prosecutor's stables; he had no business there- he does not live in the yard; I went to the privy, knocked at the privy door - nobody answered, but at last Finch came out of the privy - that is all I know.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you first mention Rowe's name? A. I told Mr. Turtle's son on the Sunday morning. I had a bill filed against me some time ago, and was in prison for an assault; I do not know how many years ago that was; I was once accused of robbing a man of 15s., but was innocent - I was here about a fortnight for the robbery; I was in Clerkenwell prison - I was not there more than three weeks; that was for the assault - it was about two years ago; I was imprisoned here on the charge of robbery in December; I was brought here from the New prison - I was in custody on that charge five or six weeks altogether, as near as I can recollect; I was not tried - I was never in prison on any other charge - I was taken on suspicion about three coats one Saturday night; I cannot tell how long ago - it was after the assault; the watchman stopped me, and I was taken before a Magistrate, but I was not in prison about the coats, nor for anything, except what I have mentioned.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were you sent to prison for the assault? A. No, I was discharged; when I was stopped with the coats I was sent down for bail; and when I was brought here for a robbery I was discharged, without being indicted; I have known Finch many years - I have had no quarrel with the prisoners, and have no malice against either of them.</p>

            . I live in the same house as Finch, at No. 7, Lower Fitzroy-place, Fitzroy-square. I never spoke to Rowe in my life, nor yet to Finch; I have repeatedly seen Rowe, but am not acquainted with him; Mrs. Woodward is landlady of the house; she is not here - she cannot come. On the night of the 10th<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290020"></xptr>of May I saw both the prisoners come into the house at half-past twelve o'clock, as near as I can guess; I was up till near four, and nobody went out of the house, for I fastened the door after them; I am in the habit of sitting up; I am an odd woman, and go out to wash in the day; I sit up to do little jobs for myself; I came in about half-past twelve o'clock that night, and left the door open - these two young men came in; it was impossible for them to go out without my seeing them - they slept in the house; Finch lodged there, in the next room to me; Woodward has been here two days; she is not very well- her husband is a tailor, and he will not let her come.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. At what time of night do they come in? A. Between twelve and one o'clock; it might be a quarter or half-past - it was not later - I was in the back parlour till after three o'clock; Finch lodged in the front room; there is a back door leading into a small yard - there is no admittance the back way. I was not examined at Marlborough-street - I went there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the Justice what you had to say? A. Yes; I did not mention Rowe's name - I said the two men came in; I did not confine my evidence to Finch- Finch is a married man, and has a wife there; Rowe came in and staid all night, and what made me curious was, the landlady said she did not like two men being in one room; Finch could not be out at one o'clock, or Rowe either, for I saw them come in, and I fastened the door.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you examined on oath at the office? A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You think it impossible for them to be out at one o'clock? A. Quite so; I have seen Rowe before repeatedly on the stairs, and have heard his name; I was busy ironing a few things for myself, with the back room door open all the time - that is how I am confident- I do not generally keep my door open, but it was a very close night.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose it is always close in a small room, when you are ironing - do not you always sit with your door open? A. Repeatedly, every day; I am confident neither of them went out.</p>
               <p>Q. The reason you give for the landlady not being here, is that she is ill? A. She is not very well, and their work is wanted, so they cannot come, and they know no more than what I can say, as I was the last person up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Finch in the habit of bringing Rowe home with him? A. He was at meal times; I never remember his bringing him home at night, but I am seldom at home myself; it struck me as remarkable, and my landlady said, "What, is two men come in?" and she followed them up stairs, to see, and I said, "Why, it is that Mr. George Rowe."</p>
               <p>JURY to THOMAS HALLIHER. Q. You state, that when you were going by the end of the yard with a charge, you were obliged to stop, in consequence of Rowe coming out with a horse; you swear it was him? A. Yes; it was twilight; I had a full view of him, and am certain it was him.</p>

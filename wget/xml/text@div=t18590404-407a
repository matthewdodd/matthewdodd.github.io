I was at the White Lion public-house on Saturday night, 22d January, between half-past eight and nine o'clock—I saw Burke there—I saw him strike the prisoner on the nose with his fist, and make his nose bleed—there was a bit of a scuffle between them—I afterwards saw a knife, I believe it was in the prisoner's hand, but I am not quite sure of it—I saw him catch Burke in the side with it, and he was taken away to a surgeon's, and then to the hospital.</p>

I was in the White Lion at the time this took place—the first I saw was the prisoner turned out of the parlour in front of the bar—he called for a pot of beer—it was brought to him—a few minutes afterwards, Burke came up to him and said, "You want to fight, don't you? you want to fight my mate; he is too drunk, I will fight you"—and he went up to him and hit him in the head with his fist—the prisoner's mate walked up to him and said, "You sha'n't fight," and pulled the prisoner back—the prisoner then rushed out and struck at Burke—I did not see anything but his fist—he tried to hit him in the head first—he struck at him three times, and the last time he hit him below, near the hip—I went and fetched a constable, and then took Burke to the doctor's, as I found he was bleeding.</p>

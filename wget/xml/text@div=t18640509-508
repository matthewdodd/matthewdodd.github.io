I know him very well indeed; shake hands with me, we are better friends now, I hope, as we know each other's connexions"—we drove to the George the Fourth, in Cloth Fair, and got out there—Powell ordered three glasses of sherry—we then went into the back part where the skittle-alley is, and there I saw Finch playing a game of skittles with another—the student addressed him and said, "This place has been changed since I was here five years ago; you had a place twenty-five or thirty yards long"—Finch said, "Yes, sir, at that time we had such a place, but it has been changed; we were obliged to give it up"—the student said he used to come there with the gentlemen from St. Bartholomew's—Finch was dressed very like he is now—he and another were playing a game of skittles, and he re<lb></lb>quested Powell to stand out of the way while they finished the game—Powell stood out of the way—he threw the ball, and the game was finished—Powell and the student then played a game at skittles—Powell took up the ball, and said it was stone—Finch said it was not, and they made a small bet of sixpence about it, and Powell lost it—the student then came to me, and said, "Here is a man that has come in for a lot of money, I shall not get such a chance again, I am going to play a game with him, and you had better do the same"—I made no reply, so the student went over to Powell and said, "I will make you a bet for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and my friend there will do the same"—Powell came over to me directly and said, "Will you?" and touched my hand, and I touched his hand—the student then asked me how much money: I had—I opened my purse, and found 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. available for the purpose—there was more than that, but 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. seemed available for the purpose—the student said, "The bet is for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I will lend you 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. "so the game was played—I put the money into the hands of the man who I took to be a waiter in the place, and who was playing with Finch when we went in—I lost the money—I had no more except a few shillings—Powell and the student then made a bet for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and</p>

I find it is only 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; you must give me an I O U for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he induced me to make out an I O U in favour of Frederick Pearce, payable in twelve months—he said his name was Frederick Pearce—Finch said to Powell, "The fact is, sir, you have won our money; you have won my watch and this gentleman's, and all our money; I have only a short distance to go and get 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and this gentleman (pointing to me) has only to do the same; if you will allow us to go for a few minutes we can get the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—so Powell consented to make a bet of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. under the circumstances that we were to go and get the money if we lost it—the bet was made, and the game played, and we lost—Finch, when he saw that the game was going against me, said, "Put on your coat"—it was lying on the settle, and I put it on—he said, "Come away, come away; we are going to fetch the money"—I went outside the door, and he said, "We are not going to get any for that man; it won't do for us to be together; you go that way, and I will go this way," and he ran off—I went into Long-line, saw a policeman, and he told me something—after that I went to Morley's Hotel, Trafalgar-square, but could not find Powell—I next saw the prisoners that day seven weeks, 23d March, walking together on the Strand side of Temple-bar—I followed them into Fleet-street, and gave them in custody.</p>

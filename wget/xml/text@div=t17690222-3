I walked round the house, and looked about the garden; then locked the doors and made all fast, and went to bed between nine and ten. I heard a good deal of noise between twelve and one in the next room. I got up and looked about the house softly, and as there are a good many cats in the house, I thought it might be them. Then I went to bed again.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a noise was it you heard?</p>
               <p>Flannagen. It was as if something was rustling against the window. As soon as I laid down in my bed I heard the window in the next room fall in. Then I got up again, and went into the room, and saw the prisoner standing in the middle of the room packing up several things. Taking the dressing glass from the table, he came and struck me with his fist, and made no attempt to get off, but then fought me with an iron that he had in his hand. The moon shone bright into the room. I fought him till I mastered him. I saw a ladder standing up against the window; I took and drawed that up into the room. I took him down stairs, and sat over him with a gun till seven o'clock; then I brought him to a constable: he confessed he brought the ladder out of Mr. Bristow's yard, which is not above an hundred yards from the window. (It was Mr. Bristow's ladder.) The bar of the window was bent so that it was forced out of its place. It was a sash window with the shutters on the inside; the shutter was shoved on one side, and the glass broke. He had throwed two japan dressing boxes out of the window before I came into the room, which were found in the morning, some distance from the window: he confessed he throwed them out. We found a knife and a great long iron scure in his pocket. I know that window was whole, and the shutter fastened over night.</p>

            . I was at work about two hundred yards from the prosecutor's house. I saw Mr. Flanagan bring the prisoner out; they were both bloody and scratched about their heads and faces. Flanagan had a gun on his shoulder, and had hold of the prisoner. I went into the room, and saw the window was broken. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176902220004"></xptr> looked out and saw the two dressing boxes lying at some distance. There was a ladder lying in the room, the room was bloody in several places, the cieling was broke and the sides of the room bloody (The two dressing boxes produced and deposed to by Flanagan.)</p>
               <p>Flanagan. I believe the window was broke by pushing the ladder against it.</p>

               <p>I was very much in liquor. I wanted to get to a place to lie down, and seeing a ladder stand against a window, I got up upon it, and fell down into the house. I had no intent to rob the house. I had nothing to do it with. When I was in the house, the man came and struck me with an iron bar, and knocked me down: I got up again, he knocked me down again, and after that he knocked me down a third time. I had fourteen cuts on my head.</p>

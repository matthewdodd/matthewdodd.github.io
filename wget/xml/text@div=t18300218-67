            . I am a pawnbroker. On the 8th of January the prisoner pawned two wine-glasses; I asked how she came by them, knowing her to be a charwoman - she said she had been in better circumstances, and had kept a better house than Mrs. Harben, and that they belonged to her - the other articles were pawned at my shop, but I did not take them in.</p>
               <p>MAURICE NICHOLAS. I searched the prisoner on the 16th of February, and found three duplicates on her, which correspond with this property - one is for two glasses, pawned on the 8th of January; the others are for two towels on the 7th of October, and a tumbler on the 26th of September.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HOWS. These tickets belong to the articles I have produced; I have the counterparts on the goods - we put the duplicate inside the glasses; the towels are not pawned in her own name, but the glasses are; it is a name she formerly pawned by; we knew her by both names.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. These things do not belong to Mrs. Harben - I bought the two wine-glasses in Oxford-street.</p>

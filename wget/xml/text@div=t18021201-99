               <p>- MARTYN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney.</p>
               <p>Q. In the beginning of June 1801, where did you live? - A. In Well-street in the county of Middlesex.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a clergyman of the Church of England? - A. Yes, in Priests orders.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first become acquainted with Colonel Thornton? - A. At the latter end of May, 1799.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you employed by him to do any thing for him? - A. Yes, to arrange a great quantity of papers, and to peruse them with a view to their being published, which I did, and he paid me 34l. 14s. I believe on the 30th of January, 1800.</p>
               <p>Q.After you had arranged those papers were you employed by Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person692">Thornton</persName>
             to compose any work in his vindication, and was any specific agreement made between you, and when? - A. Yes, on the 23d of February, 1800, both for the quantity, and the price; the quantity was twenty sheets of letter-press, or three hundred and twenty pages for seventy guineeas; to be compleated time enough to be published on the 30th of June, 1800, the composition was to come down to 1794; I composed and finished it about the middle of May, 1800, and saw Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person693">Thornton</persName>
            , to whom I delivered it, and he was perfectly satisfied.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive the seventy guineas stipulated? - A. No, I had received 26l. 1s.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards receive any more? - A. I did not specisioally on that account, but I received money on account; it was afterwards agreed between us that the memorial should be extended to the end of the year 1795; no time was fixed at the agreement for its completion; but in December following I delivered a great part of it, and it was then agreed that fifty guineas should be paid for it, twenty-five of which was to be paid immediately, and that it should be completed by the end of January, 1801. which it was.</p>
               <p>Q.What was the nature of the business on which you employed this composition? - A. Upon the Courts Martial; there had been five Courts Martial and a Court of Enquiry, in which Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person694">Thornton</persName>
             was the prosecutor, respecting the West York militia, and the Court of Enquiry was appointed to enquire into his conduct; Col. Thornton said there had been two other Courts Martial, before which he was defendant; with regard to the Courts Martial, I was to do every thing in which the Colonel was prosecutor, and to make such objections as occurred to me, and he reserved the desence of those Courts Martial where he was defendant to himself; he furnished me with hints and instructions, with letters and minutes of the Courts Martial; I had a prodigious quantity of papers some thousand sheets I suppose; while I was composing this last memorial, he applied to me to review those two Courts Martial before which he was defendant, and after I had finished the first, I undertook it, and finished that sometime in May, 1801; no price was stipulated for those two Courts Martial; but in May, 1801. I saw Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person695">Thornton</persName>
            , and read the whole over to him; but prior to that, he came to town, and I delivered him the memoir that ended the 31st of January; I then read part of the strictures, and delivered to him a copy of the other.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you then received any money from him? - A. I did; for the stricture I finished in January, I received twenty five guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you receive in the whole? - A. One hundred and eighteen pounds six shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that amount to the sum Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person696">Thornton</persName>
             engaged to pay you for all the prior parts, exclusive of the strictures? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.After you received that money, and had read the strictures, did any conversation pass between you respecting the price to be paid for those strictures? - A. Yes; I demanded one hundred guineas for the extra statement of a great part of his case, and the correction of the press. which before had been agreed upon at half a guine per sheet; I had estimated the statement at 30l.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you reckon for those strictures on the two Courts Martial? - A. I reckoned the remainder, the corrections of the press, and the strictures, at one hundred guineas; Colonel Thornton said, he would consider of it, and let me know next day; the day but one after the 3d of June, I saw him, and he offered me 50l. which I refused; he said he was going out of twon the next day for Yorkshire, and that he should set out in three days for France; I still refused it, and he wished me good day: On the 5th of June I was arrested by him, at the house of Mr. Bateson, the printer of the work, employed by Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person697">Thornton</persName>
            , who was present; I called at Bateson's house, and was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180212010069"></xptr>shewn into a parlour, without any thing being said; I there saw Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person698">Thornton</persName>
             and two or three other people; he desired me to walk in; I said I was going home; he said, we may as well settle our business here, and wished me to walk in; I said, I certainly should not settle it there, and Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person699">Thornton</persName>
             then said, you must give me leave to arrest you, and in an instant two officers came from the back parlour; Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person700">Thornton</persName>
             said, "officers, do your duty's, that is Mr. Martyn;" the officers then said, they had a writ against me at that gentleman's suit, pointing to Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person701">Thornton</persName>
            , and I went to a spunging-house, where I remained till the evening of the next day, when I got bail.</p>
               <p>Q.At the time Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person702">Thornton</persName>
             so arrested you were you indebted to him in any thing whatever? - A. No, never; I never had been.</p>
               <p>Q.It is hardly necessary to ask, were you indebted to him one hundred pounds? - A. I never was indebted to him one shilling in my life time.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you ever received any money from him, except the one hundred and eighteen pounds in part of payment for the labours you had performed? - A.Never.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. As a matter of form, more than as a matter of substance, you have stated that you are a Clergyman of the Church of England? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your preserment? - A. I have none.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you do duty? - A. At no place.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it long since you did any of the duties of a Clergyman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many years? - A. I have done duty as a Clergyman repeatedly, but not in any employment.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately? - A. I believe ten or twelve years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you the same Mr. Martyn who was the Curate of St. Ann's, Soho? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you the same Mr. Martyn who was a silversmith in the neighbourhood of St. Martin's-lane? - A. I am the same Mr. Martyn into whose hands the business sell by the death of my brother-in-law.</p>
               <p>Q. And who conducted it? - A. I had a person who conducted it for me.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not interfere in it youself? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. It was at the corner of Hemmings's-row, I believe? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you occupied it for some years, Mr. Martyn, did you not? - A. About two years, and the object was to dispose of the stock, to prevent the value of it being reduced.</p>
               <p>Q.During that period, it would have been unseemly to have had the air, dress, or appearance of a Clergyman, therefore you cast them all off; one cannot forget these things, because we all remember seeing you in your pig-railed wig and brown coat? - A.It was not a brown coat; if not black, it was blue.</p>
               <p>Q.Indulging in all lay habits? - A. If you please, let it stand so.</p>
               <p>Q. It would not have been decent to have been seen in your shop in a clerical habit: it seems to me to be an odd thing, but we have heard something about a reserence to an arbitration; did he order this blow composition of your's to be burnit? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Was it burnt? - A. No, the arbitrator ordered it to be burnt, if the parties should desire it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. I know who the man is to whom it was referred; he is a man of no sense or religion to do that? - A. He has the reputation of being a man of tasle and religion too.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he order it to be burnt by the hands of the common-hangman? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Then his award was good for nothing? - A. You speak-from your own opinion.</p>
               <p>Q.You have written a great deal of one sort or another, I should rend your sermons with much pleasure? - A. You shall, if you think they will edify you.</p>
               <p>Q.It seems an odd thing to me, that a grave reverend clergyman should have been selected to compose such a work as this - pray did the arbitrator take it into his head that it was libellous? - A. I don't know what was Mr. Maurice's motive.</p>
               <p>Q.Then he kept his own secret, and did not declare why he rodered it to be burnt? - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he not order it to be burnt as a most atrocious libel? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you have not the least imagination why he ordered it to be burnt? - A. I have an imagination that he might have had that opinion of it, but that he never intimated it.</p>
               <p>Q.We collected from the opening speech, that you cannot be much of a judge of that, because you are no lawyer? - A. I am not.</p>
               <p>Q.That Mr. Martyn was a very good lawyer, who pleaced his own cause in the Court-of-King's-Bench, was that the same Mr. Martyn, who was curate of St. Ann's, Soho? - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon the subject of the law of libele, you cannot be supposed to know much? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.This was the first libel you ever had the misfertune to write, if it was a libel, and Mr. Maursee was foolish enough to call it so? - A. You say it is.</p>
               <p>Q.I put it as a question - where were you when Mr. Thornton first had the honour of becoming acquainted with you? - A. In the King's-Bench prison.</p>
               <p>Q.Did it so happen that you were unrighteously there? - A. I dare say, you know. I was suffeering the judgment of the Court for a libel, for endeavouring to guard against a new sangled imposition, under the deseription of country Banks, and sell onder the imputation of having written a libel against

               <p>Q.Do you recollect the first conversation that Mr. Thornton had with you in which he desired that you would take care you would not get him into the same situation with yourself; and that you made answer there was no man in England who kinew the law of libels better than you? - A. To the first part of the question I deny that I ever said any thing, or that Colonel Thorn - <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180212010070"></xptr>ton two mentioned the word libel, for I was to write nothing, it was to arrange the paper which he said contoined full justification; I had nothing to do but that; as to making a prosession that I knew more of libels than any man in, England, my situation gave the lie to it, because he found me in prison for a libel.</p>
               <p>Q.Which proves, that with all your knowledge of the law of libels, the deveil deserted you for once? - A. You did not give. me the opportunity of having your opinion upon it.</p>
               <p>Q.You had better opinions than mine, for you had the opinions of the Judges, who gave you a sententious opinion, and sent you to prison? - A. They did.</p>
               <p>Q.I will ask you who 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person704">drew</persName>
             this indictment? - A. A Mr. Dogherty.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you never said otherwise? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Be a little cautions, Mr. Dogherty drew it? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you mean to be understood, and I desire you to be cautious, that you never said you drew it yourself, and for a special reason? - A. I drew one myself first, which was afterwards laid aside.</p>
               <p>Q.You 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person705">drew</persName>
             an indictment for perjury against Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person706">Thornton</persName>
            ? - A. I did; I sketched the plan of an indictment, and slibmitted it to Counsel.</p>
               <p>Q.You took down a volume of Bishop Atterbury's fermons; and sketched the plan of an indictment? - A. I did not prefer that indictment.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you never said the present indictment was drawn by youself, and that afterwards it was found, and have you not said it was known to nobody but the Grand Jury and yourself? - A. I swear I never said it was drawn by myself.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you never said it was drawn by myself, and at the time you were speaking, known only to myself, and the Grand Jury, or that no other person is acquainted with it, but the Grand Jury and me? - A. I do not recollect ever saying any such thing.</p>

               <p>Q.Now you come to recollect, will you swear you never did? - A. I cannot; I am aware, by experience, of the evidence that may be brought against me, and although I may be able to speak positively, I think it necessary to speak with that guard which I know to be nesessary with respect to truth; I say, I do not remember it; I 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person707">drew</persName>
             the form of an indictment first, I then I had's second drawn, and this third was drawn by Mr. Dogherty.</p>
               <p>Q.By your direction? - A. By the direction of Mr. Davison.</p>
               <p>Q.I shall remind you of the time, and occasion on which this conversation took place, and ask you if you mean to deny it - do you recollect being applied to by the solicitor, for Mr. Thornton, to know what the warrant was for, which you had against Mr. Thornton? - A. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you not say to him, you had better not stir in it, for I 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person708">drew</persName>
             the indictment myself, and nobody knows any thing of it but myself, and the Grand Jury? - A. Upon my oath, I never said any such thing; it would have been very absurd, and you will do me the credit to suppose I should not express myself in those terms, or that I should syllogistically shew that, because I 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person709">drew</persName>
             the indictment, and that because nobody-knew of it but myself, that I should say to him, you had better not stir in it.</p>
               <p>Q.There are few to whom folly is torbe for tenderly imputed, but I am not asking whether it was wife to do it or not; am I to take the fact to be that you never said so? - A. I never did; the whole conversation that passed between us was, he asked me in so arrogant a manner that I refused him; I thought I had done a courtesy to Mr. Thornton in telling him I had done a courtesy to Mr. Thornton in telling him I had such a warrant, and that there was no occasion to make the prosecution more severe by taking him into custody; and there was another motive, to let him plead to the indictment that Sessions, to prevent it being delayed.</p>
               <p>Q.It would have been an unhandsome thing to prevent a gentleman from his pleasure? - A. It was to prevent the prosecution being delayed.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Were you bound over to prosecute? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. Was it a part of the same conversation, where you said, no person could interfere between you and Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person710">Thornton</persName>
            ? - A. I certainly did object to any conversation with any person but him; I have refused it repeatedly, for I have experienced the dangerous consequences of conserning with people.</p>
               <p>Q.Would to God that Mr. Thornton had taken the same precaution; then all the money you ever received on the subject of this work was 118l. 6s. - A.That was the whole.</p>
               <p>Q.And you insisted that before you would deliver the remainder you would be paid one hundred pounds? - A. I had no remainder; I delivered the whole I had engaged for.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you had no manuscript work in your hands? - A. Yes, I had; but you will not perplex that point.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any manuscript to prepare by order of Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person711">Thornton</persName>
            ? - A. Yes, which he was at liberty to take or not; but there was 30l. due to me for the extra statement; my engagement was finished and delivered in, the 30th of January.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I shall prove the tender.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I admit the tender was made to get out of the hands of Mr. Martyn.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.You claim a sum beyond the one hundred and eighteen pounds which you received? - A. Yes; I delivered up what would come to one hundred and ninety pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q.What had you still remaining in your hands, for which Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person712">Thornton</persName>
             was to give you 100 guineas? - A. The strictures on his own Court Martial, that was all.</p>
               <p>Q. You have sometimes, by way of filling up a leisure moment, written the Thorntonian? - A. I wrote a journal of all the proceedings in this matter, between Colonel Thornton and me, when he was in the situation from which I extricated him.</p>
               <p>Q. It was exactly the fort of thing that a man of rank and taste would like to have published about him? - A. It contained such facts as I think the man who was guilty of them would not be ashamed of having published; I stated the way in which Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person713">Thornton</persName>
             treated me.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it not such a thing that any man would empty his strong chest to prevent being published? - A. No, I think not.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it not calculated to represent him as a man of dishonor? - A.As far as the facts that I stated went, no farther.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not that journal of facts, or pretended facts,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180212010071"></xptr>calculated to destroy his character as a man of honor? - A. No; every transaction between Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person714">Thornton</persName>
             and me, was explained in what I called Thorntoniana.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you not threated to publish it upon your oath? - A. There was no threat.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you not say, unless he gave you a sum of money, you would publish it? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. I will put it to you again, with a very remarkable expression for a Clergyman of the Church of England. Upon your oath did you not say you would publish it, and that you would send him to the devil and damnation? - A. Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q.Nor any such expression? - A. No, nor any such expression; I have heard such an evidence given, but I swear I never did use any such expression.</p>
               <p>Q.Or that you would blow him to hell? - A. Never; I never said I would publish it; I have said I would print it as an answer to the calumnies that Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person715">Thomton</persName>
             was throwing ever lastingly upon me.</p>
               <p>Q.In what event were you or not to print it? - A. I did it to give an opportunity to any person who told me the things Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person716">Thornton</persName>
             had said of me, instead of entering into a long explanation to shew what passed; there is all that passed between Col. 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person717">Thornton</persName>
             and me; I put things down as they arose; they were derogatory to a man of honor, but it was the behaviour I had received from him; if I had related any thing between you and Col. 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person718">Thornton</persName>
             that was derogatory to a man of honour, your objection might have been good; there were some very extraordinary circumstances attending it; and if my life had been depending upon it, I could not have been more careful in making that journal.</p>
               <p>Q.In relating such circumstances as no man of honour could bear to have stated? - A. I never printed it.</p>
               <p>Q.But you did a great deal worse; you threatened you would print it? - A. I said I would print it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then threatening or saying depends upon the tone of voice in which it is pronounced? - A. No, I don't agree perfectly with you; there I intended it for Col. Thornton's own inspection.</p>
               <p>Q.To reform his life? - A. No; I will tell you why; so many disagreements had arisen between us very early in the writing of the work, that we had every thing to run over again.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you begin your journal, I should be glad to know? - A. It was sometime in 1800.</p>
               <p>Q. In which there were many remarkable circumstances, as you have told us? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And many of them confidential? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Martyn, the Clergyman, having a knowledge of the Court Martial, and of the transactions of the West Riding militia? - A. That was not in the Thorntoniana.</p>
               <p>Q.Is there any part of the book that might not be the subject of an indictment for a libel? - A.I think so.</p>
               <p>Q. You think it a dispassionate statement of facts, not reflecting upon the character of Colonel Thornton? - A.It was a fair statement of facts.</p>
               <p>Court. You surely forget yourself; you are a man of great abilities, I know you are, and therefore one expects precision from you; you have said enough to convince any body, that you have stated that which no man of honour would wish to have stated to the public, and you must know that that is a libel upon him, because you are not an author of to-day; we have known your works long, your poems, and other writings, and therefore you can give a direct and positive answer.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I will help you, because, for old acquaintance sake, I should like to get you out of this scrape; did you do it in your best manner? - A. I don't know as to that.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was it poetry or prose? -</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It was prose, because that conveys the sting the better; the jingle of the rhyme sometimes throws one out of one's way.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing in the libel against John King that was more severe than this against Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person719">Thornton</persName>
            ? - A. A thousand times more.</p>
               <p>Q. The Stool and the Blacking-brush? - A. No; the Stool and the Blacking-brush were hypothetical.</p>
               <p>Q. To come to plain English, because, though we may have our laugh, this is a very serious subject to the gentleman who is brought here; I am really so ignorant of the ways of the world, that I wish to know what Thorntoniana means; I like to get information from a master, and upon the subject of libels from Mr. Martyn? - A. The meaning is an ideal one.</p>
               <p>Q. Give it us? - A. That I leave to yourself.</p>
               <p>Q. I want the fence you annex to it? - A. The fence is expressed in the book itself.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know the fence of the word; we have Diaboliads, and various other names in this fashionable world in which you and I have the good fortune to live; now I want to know the meaning of the word Thorntoniana? - A.Thorntoniana is in the manner of Walpoliana, publishing things produced by great men.</p>
               <p>Q.Great men have their biographers, and you in kindness to Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person720">Thornton</persName>
             did the same by him? - A. If I were to speak of your as an eminent Counsel, if I had opinions of your's to encounter, I should certainly call them Garrowniana; now you understand by that what I mean by Thorntoniana.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean my cross-examinations; perhaps you would call them Garrowniana? - A. No, I should not think them worth -</p>
               <p>Q. Not worth taking notice of? - A. There are so many things more worthy of the man, that I should not think of them.</p>
               <p>Q.Now one question more before we part with Thorntoniana. When you communicated its contents to Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person721">Thornton</persName>
            , did you do it as a matter of gratisication to him, or the contrary? - A. No; I did it to prevent our traversing the ground we had gone over 50 times before.</p>
               <p>Q. That is to deter him from permitting this Thorntoniana to be published? - A. No; my object was to give him a state of facts, that I am sure he would not approve in another, and to induce him to come to a fair settlement of the account between us, and that we might settle it amicably, I shewed him the particulars of all the transactions between us, that he might see the manner in which he had treated me, and that we might not go over the same ground again, but that we might come immediately to the point of settling the copy that was then before us.</p>
               <p>Q. Which copy you would not deliver without being paid one hundred pounds? - A. No, the copy was not agreed for then, and my purpose in meeting Colonel<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180212010072"></xptr>Thornton was to read the copy to him, and to agree upon the price.</p>
               <p>Q.The price of what? - A. The second part of the memoirs; Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person722">Thornton</persName>
             wanted me to state to a gentleman now in Court what I meant.</p>
               <p>Q. A gentleman of the Bar you mean perhaps? - A. A gentleman of the Bar; Col. Thornton said I had written a memorandum of the whole that he wanted to enter into conversation about, and desired I would either shew it to him or his friend; that it would save a great deal of trouble to us both, and would prevent altercation; I consequently read the copy of the memoirs.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you read them just by way of sample of this mirror, which was to be held up to Colonel Thornton, to reform his life? - A. I read a part of the memoirs.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you not read any part of the Thorntoniana? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q.To Mr. Sinclair? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose; it could not be calculated to reform the life of Mr. Sinclair, to hold up this mirror to him; was it to raise Col, Thornton's character in the opinion of Mr. Sinclair? - A.No; to acquaint him with all the transactions.</p>
               <p>Q.Then it was to debase Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person723">Thornton</persName>
             in his estimation? - A. I did not do it for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you mean to state that if Mr. Sinclair had read what was stated in that book, it must not have degraded Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person724">Thornton</persName>
             in his opinion? - A. I do not think it was so degrading as you represent it.</p>

               <p>Q. I see there are degrees of comparison - it might have been a little worse - you could have thrown a little more spice into it ? - A. There was nothing in the book that Mr. Sinclair did not say was less than he deserved ; he said, it would do him no harm .</p>
               <p>Court . Q. Perhaps he said, what was said by you would do no harm , because , by your own account , it was a very severe attack upon Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person725">Thornton</persName>
             ? - A. No, I don't think it so .</p>
               <p>Court . Q. You have said as much - in other words, you have said , no man of honour would wish stated what was stared in this work ? - A. I mean to say, if there is any thing improper , no man of honour would wish to have it said of him , and yet it might be no libel . Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person726">Thornton</persName>
             agreed to pay me two guineas and a half a week .</p>
               <p>Court . Q. How did you represent that in your book , as not being a man of honour , nor a man of his word ? - A. No; I represented that he did not fulfil his engagement . I was not in a situation to keep a work two years in hand , and receive nothing ; and I had other literary engagements , which I relinquished to do this. Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person727">Thornton</persName>
             never fulfilled his engagement in any instance ; and if I relate that , it is no libel .</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney . Q. At the time that Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person728">Thornton</persName>
             arrested you, had delivered as much composition as came to seventy pounds more than he had paid you? - A. Yes; I include in that the correction of the press.</p>
               <p>Court . Q. Was any body present at the agreement between you and Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person729">Thornton</persName>
             ? - A. Nobody was present , but I will prove the acknowledgement .</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow . Q. Who was present at the acknowledgment? - A. Mr. Bateson .</p>

               <p>Q. To you these matters in dispute between Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person733">Thornton</persName>
             and Mr. Martyn were referred ? - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon that reference , was Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person734">Thornton</persName>
             examined upon oath , before you? - A. He was. I will read from the notes I took at the time , all that Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person735">Thornton</persName>
             said upon that subject . ( Reads ), "We went in to Mr. Caton's chambers , Mr. Crawford , Mr. Caton , and myself , and we extracted from letters and papers , the sum which Mr. Martyn had received ; I thought , that having made a bargain with Mr. Martyn, and bargains , that Mr. Martyn had not delivered up the up the work complete to the time he had named, and being determined to bring this matter to a final issne, I thought I might with safety swear to his owing me one hundred pounds, and upwards." It had been previously admitted before me, on the part of Mr. Martyn , that he had received one hundred pounds , and upwards , I think, one hundred and eighteen pounds . I perhaps ought to state this, that the only way in which it could have been material for my attention to have been drawn to Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person736">Thornton</persName>
             , was with a view to any damages which Mr. Martyn might have been entitled to receive at the hands of Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person737">Thornton</persName>
             , for the arrest; I considered that as one of the subjects of difference between the parties; one Mr. Martyn's claims before me was damages for this arrest; but from the evidence which has been already alluded to , to have been given by Mr. Sinclair , before me, I did not think I should have been justified in giving Mr. Martyn any damages , in respect of that arrest, from the expressions he was sworn, by Mr. Sinclair , to have made use of, with respect to Colonel 
               <persName id="t18021201-99-person738">Thornton</persName>
             , I did not think him entitled to any damages from me upon that subject , and therefore I did not give him any .</p>
               <p>Court . It did not appear to you to be a malicious arrest ? - A. I was not called to look at it in that point of view, because there was a collateral ground upon which I felt myself bound to withhold damages ; in that respect the terms were much stronger than those which have been repeated to-day .</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow . Q. And I believe you gave orders , for the interests of the public , that the work should be burnt ; I am afraid that has not been done ? - A. I thought it right to order it to be burnt .</p>

               <p>Court . The Counsel has told you truly that they have a great number of witnesses to the character of Colonel

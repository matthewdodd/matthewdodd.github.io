On the 19th of July a man named (McPharland) came in, to sell some linen and handkerchiefs; he put a piece of linen down on the Bench; the prisoner and three other men were there; another man took up the linen, and put it into the prisoner's apron - he walked out with it. In about an hour I went up to Berkeley-square, and saw him and the others sharing some money - I do not know what money it was.</p>

The prosecutor, Owen McPharland, came to me, and said he had been robbed, and asked if I could take the man; I went with Gook, and took him; he denied it, but next morning, said,"Mike took the cloth, and put it into my apron;" that it was sold, and they had the money among them."</p>

It is false - they did not see me share the money; Gook said, "If you had told me of it I could have got you through it." I went for some water, and when I returned the man was accusing another man of it.</p>

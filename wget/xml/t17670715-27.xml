            . I keep the King's-head inn in Smithfield; the first time I saw the prisoner was on the 5th of June last, he had a blind bay mare stood tied to the rails at my door, with a bit of a cord round her neck; there was a man telling me he had bought her for two guineas, and the prisoner would not let him have her; he desired me to go and speak to the prisoner; the prisoner told me he had not sold her to him, but he had sold her to another man for three guineas; some time after I missed the mare from the rails, after that my man told me he had put her into my stable; (this was I believe near one o'clock) about four o'clock Mr. Spencer came to ask for the bay mare, and said he had bought her; I told him I supposed he was imposed upon, for here had been a man that said he had bought her a little before you for two guineas; then said Mr. Spencer, I will not have her, except the man will take two guineas; he left two guineas in my hands to pay for her, and went away; I then could see nothing of the prisoner, then I began to suspect she was stole; about seven or eight Mr. Saunders came and owned the mare, he gave me a receipt, and I delivered her to him; the next morning the prisoner came for the mare or the money; I said, old gentleman, I fancy you have made a mistake, I believe you stole this mare; he said he had not, it was his brother's; I said Mr. Saunders of Hornchurch had been and owned her, and I should keep you till you bring persons to give an account of you; he was taken to the Compter; I went on the Sunday for Mr. Saunders, he came on the Tuesday, then the prisoner confest he stole the mare, and owned she was Mr. Saunders's property.</p>

            . I bought a blind bay mare of the prisoner at the bar, at the rails where she was then tied, opposite the hospital-gate, on a Friday, the same day the gentlemen have mentioned, for three guineas; I went to the man to toll her, and he was not there; I then went and told the prisoner, I would call and pay him for her at three o'clock; when I came back at one, or half an hour after, I could not find the prisoner; I was with him when he put her up in the King's-head stable.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hill Did you see Mr. Spencer when the prisoner put up the mare in your master's stable?</p>

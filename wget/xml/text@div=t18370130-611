                  </hi>. I am hackney-man, and drive a glass coach—my stables are in Cambridge Mews. I lost a coat and handkerchief, and several things out of the stables—the prisoner was a policeman—on the 22<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of January I went to the Cape of Good Hope, in Albany-street, and I found a number of policemen there—the prisoner was there—I was sent to, to know whether it was my hat that he had got on—I said I could swear to it if I saw it off his head, as it was made at Thetford—it was taken off and shown to me, and it was mine—I did not see the jacket—he had the hand<lb></lb>kerchief round his neck—he said the hat was his; and that he bought it in Dublin—this is my hat and handkerchief—I swear positively it is my hat—I know it by the name inside, and by the stains round it—It was made at Thetford, in Norfolk; and it appears so in the hat—this it my handk er-chief—it is a remarkable small size; and I lost just suck a one at the tame tine as I lost the hat.</p>

I was at this public-home the prosecutor was sent for by another officer—on the night of Tuesday I heard these things had been stolen—I asked Motel if he should know the hat if he saw it on any one's head?—he said he thought he should—I atked him if he saw one like it?—he said he thought the prisoner had it—I asked if he should know it, if he saw it off his head?—he said he should; as it had the name of Thetford in it—I went in and called the pri soner out, and said there had been several things lost, and among the rest a hat and jacket—I said, "If that is your hat, you cannot have any object tion to show it"—he said, "Certainly not"—he took off the hat, and there was the name of Thetford in it—the prosecutor said it was hit; the prisoner said it was very strange, as he had bought it in Ireland—the prisoner was acquainted with the place because he had been onthat beat, and he was then on the adjoining beat—it was the last time he did duty at a police<lb></lb>man that these things were stolen.</p>

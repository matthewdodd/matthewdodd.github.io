Of course I knew there was nothing at the bank to meet it, my account having closed in 1870"—he then said, "I heard that Inspector Andrews had been inquiring about these cheques, and I gave Collier 51. to go and square Field"—Field was the man who cashed the cheque—he said, "As regards the book, Herbert Pugh has been in my employ as a clerk, his' brother Arthur has constantly visited him, and I believe one or the other stole the cheque-book; cannot I arrange the matter with you to destroy Field's cheque-book? come out and have a glass of wine"—I said, "No; it is just as well that people should not see us together"—I then said, "Shall I take down your statement?"—he said, "I will write ft down if you like," and he wrote down this statement, and said, "You can call me as a witness, and I can say what I have written down."

My supposition is that he took, or allowed his brother Arthur to take, the book") I said, "Have you any more of these cheques left?"—he said, "No, I have not"—on 16th January I read the warrant to him, and he was taken into custody—he then said, "Mr. Marshall, you have deceived me; I was fearful whether I should attend or not; I lay last night and considered whether I should bolt to Paris: had I not placed the fullest confidence in you, you would not have had me in this country"—on being charged he said he could only repeat what he said previously, that he drew the cheque and gave it to Collier—I went next day to the National Credit Co.'s offices—I found the desk had been broken open—I found this cheque for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of 2, Princes Court, Old Broad Street—I am defending Delmar—he was a client of mine before this—I paid Mrs. Harrisson 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and received back a cheque</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188003010136"></xptr>
               <p>similar to this produced, and handed it to Delmar with the receipt—I took up two other cheques before the prosecution was thought of, but I cannot say on what banks—they were not drawn by Delmar—one was drawn by his brother on his own bank, and marked "N. S.," and the other on some one whose name I had never seen before—Delmar gave me the money to take them up—he gave me a large sum to settle hit liabilities, but there were no more cheques.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. FULTON</hi>. I met Delmar in January last year, and asked him how he was getting on—he said pretty well, but he had been taken in by two or three cheques, and had been disappointed in some money matters, and scarcely knew what to do—I said, "If you like to see me, I will see what I can do for you"—he sent me a messaga in November, when I was very busy, and I sent him this reply, "I will with pleasure do my best for you"—I had an interview with him about 10th or 12th December, and received from his Mends a sum of money—he said, "I have heard among other people an unfortunate landlady has had a cheque returned to her; as she is a poor woman, see to her first"—I wrote to her—she came to my office and presented her claim, and I paid it—the document about Mr. Colburn is in my writing—he is Mr. J.S. Colburn, of Brighton, with whom Mr. Delmar has conducted some extensive transactions—he has nothing to do with the Colburn mentioned in this case; he is the Hon. James Colburn—I pledge my oath that this refers to him, and has nothing to do with these cheques—there were no other cheques signed H. S. Williams which I was instructed to settle except Paul's</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I fancy the cheques were payable to bearer only, not to somebody or bearer—Delmar said that he had been duped with Harrisson's cheque and Paul's cheque, which were drawn by Williams—the others were his brother's cheques—I also took two of his brother's cheques for him simply because it was a debt on which he was liable—he had paid them to tradesmen—if he had told me he wanted to get back cheques which were forgeries, I would not have had anything to do with it—he represented it to me as an innocent transaction, and I cross-examined him about it.</p>

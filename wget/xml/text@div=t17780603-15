On the 20th of May, about five in the afternoon, the prisoner came to my shop, and asked to look at some lace; they said, they wanted some lace for a cap; they wanted a cap made up. I desired my sister to wait on them; they said, they wanted some very nice lace; they looked over a number of laces; in ten minutes after, Mr. Moravia came into the shop about some business with me. I left my sister, showing the prisoners the lace,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177806030008"></xptr> and talked with Mr. Moravia in the farther part of the shop; I stayed there about ten minutes; he then went back, and spoke to my sister; he came back again to me in one minute, I believe; I went behind the counter again, and asked my sister if she could not please the ladies: she said, no, she could not; she seemed much confused; she wanted to pass me; I said, I believed, there was a lace that would suit the ladies; I looked in the box; I could not see it; my sister gave me a nudge on the toe with her foot, giving me to understand that she suspected them; I took a piece of lace from the window, and recommended it to Mrs. Hollis, and asked if that would not suit her: she said, no; it was not fine enough, and she hoped I would not wish her to buy lace that did not please her, that she would go else where and buy lace, and bring it, if we would make it up for her. Mrs. Hollis then ordered half a yard of gauze to be cut off, and paid a shilling for it; then they went out of the shop; my sister as soon as they were gone said, she was sure they had stole some lace. I went out, and took hold of one by one hand, and the other by the other, and desired them to come back again, for I suspected they had stole lace; I desired Mr. Moravia to watch that they did not drop any; he said he would, as soon as they came within the shop, Mr. Moravia said, here are two pieces of lace dropped; my sister immediately stooped, and picked them up. I did not see them dropped, but I saw my sister pick them up from the floor; I made them go into the back room, behind the shop, and sent for a constable, and searched them.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Did you find any thing upon Hollis? - Nothing.</p>
               <p>When you went out after them, and told them you suspected they had stole lace; Did Mrs. Hollis make the least objection to going back? - Not the least.</p>
               <p>ISRAEL MORAVIA sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 20th of May I went to the prosecutor's to settle an account with him; when I came in, I saw the two prisoners cheapening some lace; I did not take any notice of them; they were very genteelly dressed; I thought they had a mind to buy lace; I went to the farther end of the shop with Mr. Wateridge; I told him what my business was; we stood talking two or three minutes; he said he would settle with me presently; I went to the farther end of the shop back again, and the sister looked at me very earnestly, and said to me, did you tell my brother what I told you this morning? I observed she was rather confused. I went back to her brother at the other end of the shop, and said, your sister looks confused, as if they had stole lace; go round the counter. He said, no; he did not think they looked like any thing of the kind; he went round; I walked to the farther end of the shop; I saw them looking at one card and at another. Mr. Wateridge showed them several cards of lace; at last he took one from the window, and said, I think that lace will suit you very well. Mrs. Hollis said, no; I think this is not good enough; I think to have a very good lace, and you would not have me lay out my money without I could please myself. Before she went out, she said, she would go and seek for lace somewhere else that might please her better, and if so, she would come back again, and she supposed they would have no objection to make the cap for her, if she got the lace elsewhere. He said, no; he said to Mrs. Mitchell, don't you want any thing? she said, yes; she wanted half a yard of gauze; they purchased that, paid for it, and then went out; as soon as ever they were gone out, the sister said, she believed they had taken some lace away. He asked me to go with him, and see that they did not drop it; we went out, and he caught them both by the arms; he desired me to keep behind, and see that they did not drop it; they made no objection to coming back to the shop. Hollis went in first, Mitchell followed her; as Mitchell was going in, I saw a piece of lace upon a card, and the other piece that is loose drop from under either her cloak or gown. I said to the prosecutor's sister, there, they have dropped the lace; she picked it up; they were taken backwards into the back room that adjoins the shop, and I went for a constable; the constable came, and they were both searched; there was nothing found upon them, but two or three bits of ribbond concealed under Mitchell's stays;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177806030009"></xptr> they seemed to be very easy; they said, they knew they were very innocent, and not guilty of what they were charged with. The constable found but 7 d. or 8 d. about them, though they were bargaining for lace of 7 s. or 8 s. a yard.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>The lace they were about buying, if they had met with any to the liking of Mrs. Hollis, was to have been put upon a cap, was it not? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Then there was no occasion for money to pay for it then?</p>
               <p>Witness. This is the lace I saw drop from Mitchell.</p>
               <p>What is it worth a yard? - Five shillings. I import lace. I sold this lace to Mr. Wateridge the day before.</p>
               <p>MITCHELL's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I never had a bit of lace in his shop. I met Mrs. Hollis accidentally; she said she was going to bespeak a new cap, so I went in with her.</p>
               <p>Hollis was not put upon her defence.</p>
               <p>(Mitchell called five witnesses, who gave her a very good character.)</p>

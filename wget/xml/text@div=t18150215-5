            . I live in Fleet-place, Hackney-road. In the early part of November last, I went to the <placeName id="t18150215-5-crimeloc23">Caledonian coffee-house, in the parish of St. Leonard Shoreditch</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18150215-5-crimeloc23" type="placeName" value="Caledonian coffee-house, in the parish of St. Leonard Shoreditch"></interp>

I sat down in the coffee-room, pulled off my great coat, and placed my great coat and my umbrella on a table in the coffee-room. After I had taken the coffee, I desired the master of the house to bring me the great coat and umbrella. He returned, and told me it was not there; I did not go myself, I sent the landlord; I then suspected the prisoner, who was sitting by me; I went immediately with the landlord in search of the prisoner, suspecting he had gone off with the great coat; I did not find him. I did not see him afterwards until the 9th of January last; I have never seen my great coat and umbrella in the mean time; I have not seen it since. On the 9th of January, I saw the prisoner, he was apprehended on that day; he was brought into the City; I charged him with stealing my great coat and umbrella. I asked him what he had done with my great coat; I gave him no encouragement, nor any body in my presence; he said he did not know what he had done with it. On my repeating that interogatory, he said he did not know what he had done with the coat, he was so much intoxicated immediately he was taken to the public office; I went with him to the public office, and stated to the magistrate; I stated to the magistrate what I have stated to you. Mr. Chapman, the master of the coffee-house, gave his evidence, he will speak to you. When I told the prisoner he was not intoxicated, Mr. Chapman was present at the time; he told the magistrate that Mr. Chapman told him to say so. He acknowledged taking the great coat and umbrella, and pleaded intoxication, and said he did not know what he had done with them; he only denied it when he first came before the magistrate. I have never found the great coat and the umbrella.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the prisoner stay in the coffee-room - A. About twenty minutes or a quarter of an hour; he went before me.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the coffee-room part of the house - A. Yes, it is part of the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Where did you fall in company with me first - A. At the George.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, or did you not, go into Sadler's gin shop - A. I have no recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. The landlord asked you to go into the back room - 
               <persName id="t18150215-5-person107">A. </persName>
            He did.</p>
               <p>Q. And me also - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. You left your great coat and umbrella in the front coffee-room - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 13th, you was not transacting your business at the Bank of England, were you - A. No. From the 11th to the 13th I was confined to my bed.</p>
               <p>ROBERT CHAPMAN. I keep the Caledonian coffee-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the prisoner and Mr. Rickard being at your house in November last - A. Yes, I do, in the early part of November, I think about the 12th; the prisoner and Mr. Rickard came in together. The prisoner said he had brought in a gentleman to have a cup of coffee; the prisoner came to me again, and desired me to make him a cup of coffee, and a cup for a gentleman. I desired him to ask the gentleman to walk into the parlour; another gentleman was in conversation with Mr. Rickard, and while that gentleman and Mr. Rickard were engaged in conversation, the prisoner walked out through the coffee-room out of the street door. After sitting some time, Mr. Richard wanted to go, he asked for his great coat and umbrella; I said, I knew nothing about it. He said, he brought a great coat and an umbrella in? where was the man that came in with him; I said, I did not know; I did not see the great coat and umbrella; we went and enquired in the coffee-room; we could not see the great coat, nor the umbrella in the coffee-room. I never saw either of them; I had not an opportunity of seeing them. I found the prisoner one day when I was out, in Whitecross-street, about six weeks afterwards, I stopped him in the street, I asked him what he had done with the great coat and umbrella that he took from my house; I told him I was determined to take him to the gentleman. He asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181502150007"></xptr>me if I was determined upon it; I said, I certainly was; I told him he had better tell the truth to the gentleman when he saw him,</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You told me the prosecutor would not prosecute me.</p>

            . I live in Hackney-road. I was at the Caledonion coffee-house, in the early part of November, I remember seeing Mr. Rickard and the prisoner, they both came in together; I was sitting in the right hand box by the door. Mr. Rickard had a great coat on, and an umbrella; he took his great coat off, laid it on the bench, and the umbrella, he put on the right side of the room. After the two had been in company together a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, the prisoner came out of the inner room; he took the umbrella, and the great coat he folded up, and took it off the bench. That is all that I recollect, that I saw with my own eyes. I said nothing to him, I thought the gentleman might have sent him home with it. I never saw the prisoner before he came into the room that night.</p>
               <p>COURT. to Prosecutor. What is the value of this great coat - 
               <persName id="t18150215-5-person109">A. </persName>
            Forty-eight shillings, it cost me seven pounds, the umbrella we will say seven shillings.</p>

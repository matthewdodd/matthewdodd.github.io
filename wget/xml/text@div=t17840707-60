            , he is at sea; on Saturday the 26th of June, about two at noon, I lost the things mentioned in the indictment, they were in my box which was locked when I went out, which was about ten in the morning, they were in the room which I rent on the ground floor, there is no lock to the room, but a lock to the box, there is a button to button it with-inside; I found my things upon the prisoner when I returned about two, who came on the Monday night to lodge in the house; I left her in the house by herself, she said she was going a washing, and when I returned she was talking with some people, I saw she had my petticoat on under another, it hung below her's.</p>
               <p>Is that a Marseilles petticoat? - It is what they call a mock Marseilles, it is not a right Marseilles.</p>
               <p>Is it what is generally called Marseilles? - Yes; I did not challenge it then, I went to see whether it was in my box, and I found my box open, the nails were drawn<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070087"></xptr> up, and the gown was gone; when I came out of my room and said my box was open, she was gone, and a witness went in pursuit of her, and found her; I know the petticoat, I have had it three months, there is no mark on it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you lend me the gown and coat to go to the tower? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that positively? - I will.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. Have you heard from your husband lately? - I have heard from him about nine months ago.</p>
               <p>You have no reason but to think he is alive? - No, I hope so.</p>

               <p>I am a carpenter, on Saturday last was a fortnight I pursued the prisoner, and I found her in the house of Mr. Cooper, a painter, in Shakespear's walk, I went in there by information, I went into the yard and found her in the necessary.</p>
               <p>Court. Are there many streets between? - Only one, I first saw her in the necessary with the door wide open, and I saw her turn round from the seat, I said you have got Bet Walter's petticoat, says she you may search me. I have not got any thing, I looked down the vault and this gown was there and I took it up, I saw her hand over the vault, but I did not see it go from her hand, this is the gown I took out of the vault, I know it by being all soiled, I took charge of the prisoner, and gave her to the constable, she said we might hang her if we pleased, the gown was left with the constable, (Mrs. Walker deposed to the gown) the prisoner left these cuffs behind her which I have in my pocket.</p>

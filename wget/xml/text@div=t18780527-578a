                  </hi>. I am a dairyman of 98, Portland Road Notting Hill—the prisoner had been a customer of mine for two or three years up to July, 1877—he resided at 50, Addison Road North—in July he owed me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for milk—I applied to him from July to March several times for payment, when I met him in the street—I went to the house and found he had gone away and left an address where letters were to be forwarded—I made inquires but could never get a fixed place of residence where I could apply for the money—when I asked him for payment he would say "I cannot spare it now, you shall have your money"—on the 26th March I saw him outside my shop, and I asked him if he could oblige me with my account, as I was very short of money, or could he give me half a sovereign—he said "No, I can't I am short, of money, but I have a cheque at home, how long will you be before you go out again?"—I answered "About two hours"—he did not come that day, but next day he came about 1 o'clock—he said "I have got a cheque of my own, I thought it would be best"—I said "I hope it is all right," and he said "Yes, you needn't fear about that, my boy," and put his hand on my shoulder; he then wrote out this cheque for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., on the London and County Bank. Hammersmith branch, dated 30th March; he asked me to hold it over till then—he said "I am going to receive a large sum of money, and I am going to pay away money"—I said "I don't mind; I am not going to pay no money away till the 30th; I have 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay away then; I shan't want the money before, I hope it will be there then"—he said "Yes"—he said "I have a small balance at the bank, more than enough to meet that cheques"—I then gave him four sovereigns—he said he couldn't spare more and he would have 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. owing—he then left—on Saturday, 30th March, he came up in a hansom cab about the middle of the day, and asked me not to pay the cheque—I grumbled and said "I have not got no more money to pay away, I thought it would be there to-day or I shouldn't have parted with my 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I have got a bill to meet this afternoon"—he said "You needn't fear, the money will be all right," and he drove away—I shortly afterwards on the same day paid the cheque away to Mr. Cook, Mr. Wright's servant, for milk I had that week—on Monday I received this post-card from the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "I will pay into bank to-morrow about 1 o'clock, so don't pay in till 2 o'clock, shall call as I pass to-mor<lb></lb>row, about 9 o'clock.") I did not see him that morning but he called about 4 in the afternoon and said "I have been disappointed of some money, will you hold the cheque over for a few days longer?"—I said "I cannot, I have paid it away to Mr. Wright, 91, Euston Road"—I wrote the address down for him, and he left, saying he would go and take it up—on the following morning I received this note. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "146, Lad<lb></lb>broke Grove Road, Notting Hill. Dear Sir, I was unable to take up</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. The prisoner, when he called on Monday, did not say he was going to the bank—he asked that the cheque should be so dated—I laid an information at the police-court about a fortnight afterwards—I could not find out no place of residence—I received the cheque back about the 3rd or 4th April—the Wednesday or Thursday—I have never received payment of the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I kept a small balance there for the purpose of keeping it open. On Monday or Tuesday, the day the cheque was to go in, I called on the prosecutor and said I was waiting to pay in to meet his cheque, and he told me he had paid it away on Saturday; he had promised to keep it. I had money at home, and I said I would give it him if he would give me the cheque, but he could not do so as he had given it away. He gave me the address of the party he gave it to. I had no intention to defraud."

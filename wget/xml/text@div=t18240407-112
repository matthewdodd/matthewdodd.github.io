            . I am a glazier, and live in Bird Cage-walk, Hackney. On the 21st of March. I was coming from Leather-lane down Old-street-road, and saw the boy Williams with this bag in his hand, and the prisoner following close behind him - he tapped him on the shoulder and stopped him as I passed; he leaned down to him, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182404070052"></xptr>said,</p>
               <p>"What did they say to you;" the boy made no answer. I then walked on a few paces, turned up for a necessary purpose, and saw the boy give the prisoner this parcel out of his bag - they crossed the road to go up a turning, and suspecting something I went up to the prisoner, and said,</p>
               <p>"You will excuse me, but is this your boy?" - and in the interim, he said,</p>
               <p>"No, Sir;" and gave the parcel back to the boy. I asked the boy if his master told him to give it to anybody; he said, No. I took them into a public-house, and said to the landlord,</p>
               <p>"I suspect something between this man and boy, and have brought them here to investigate the business." The prisoner said</p>
               <p>"It is perfectly correct, I have come from Mr. Luke, for the parcel back again;" I said I should not be satisfied till he went to the boy's master. The boy told me readily where he lived, and on the road there, the prisoner met a man; who asked him to go and drink; the prisoner asked me to stop a few minutes, and he would be back again - I said No; and on the way he said,</p>
               <p>"Perhaps I may be mistaken in the boy; I hope you will not attempt to injure me if it is so." I took him to Mr. Scott, who said he knew nothing of him, and gave him in charge; he said a man told him to meet a boy of that kind.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do not you go by the name of Fuller - A. Never. I was never tried here.</p>

            . I sent my boy to Mr. Luke's with a watch case, to get a morrocco case. Fell brought him and the prisoner back, and asked if I knew him, and said I might thank him for saving me from being robbed - the prisoner said he had been sent by a young man after the boy. My boy has since lost a gold case, and given two different accounts of it; I took him to the office. The Magistrate committed him in order to save my recognizance, as I am bound for his appearance here.</p>

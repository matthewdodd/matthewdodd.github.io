               <p>Prisoner. Q. When did I come in? A. Not till ten o'clock in the morning; I had left the room locked, and the window shut; the carriage would not allow the coach-house doors to close - nothing of yours was gone but a pair of boots; the Policeman had told me he had seen some suspicious persons about there, a few days before.</p>

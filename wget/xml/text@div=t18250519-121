On Thursday, the 28th of April, I got home about seven o'clock in the evening, and put my pony up in the stable - I went to the stable about six o'clock in the morning and it was gone, and a bridle and saddle - it was a brown gelding - I saw it again on Saturday, the 30th, at Enfield, in the possession of Young, with the bridle and saddle. I had only had it eleven days, and gave twelve guineas for it - I am sure it is mine; the prisoner had been in my service about three months and left the day before it was stolen.</p>

            . On Friday, the 29th of April, I was going by the Nag's Head public-house, at Enfield, some people called me, and I saw the prisoner at the door offering this pony for sale - he asked me 12 l. for it, and said it belonged to his father? I think I asked him who it belonged to - I asked him to allow me to try it - he said "Ride it where you like;" I rode it about a mile, to Mr. Smith's, who I knew wanted one: I shewed it to Smith, then rode it back, and asked if he would go in harness - he said yes, I might try it, which I did, and bought it of him, with the saddle and bridle, for ten guineas. As I went out of the yard I saw a very respectable man who lived at Tottenham - he said he knew the prisoner, and I was satisfied that all was right. I went back to the public-house and paid him for it: we had some ale together - a person called me out and said something which rose my suspicions; I then told the landlord to keep his eye on him; I rode to his parents at Tottenham, and inquired of his mother about it, then returned, and gave him in charge - I went to Islington, and left word at Howe's about it; he came to me on Saturday and claimed it.</p>

            . I was at the Nag's Head, and saw the prisoner and Young there, trying the pony - they came into the parlour where I was, and had a pint of ale - he paid him for the pony - Young went out for half an hour and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182505190043"></xptr>when he returned I took the prisoner in charge; I said he was my prisoner for he had stolen the horse; he put his hands together and said "Oh dear, I shall he hung;" I asked whose horse it was - he said it belonged to Mr. Howe. I asked how he could be guilty of such a thing? he said it was all through a young woman that he did it, and he was tipsy at the time. I searched him and found nine sovereigns and 22 s. 6 d. on him, and a ticket of a turnpike.</p>
               <p>ROBERT HOWE. I am quite sure it is my pony - it is a remarkable one - has a very short tail and is a crib biter. I have no doubt of it - I saw the prisoner drunk that night.</p>

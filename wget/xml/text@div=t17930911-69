               <p>On the 25th of July I lost a linen gown, five cotton stockings and two muslin caps; I missed them off the line in the garden, in the yard belonging to the house where I lodged, it was half past twelve at night when I missed them; I live at Mr. Ussington's library, in <placeName id="t17930911-69-crimeloc380">Church-street, Hackney</placeName>

               <p>Q. What did you do to find out where these things were? - I looked out of my window and missed them off my line, and I went down and I found them took off the line, packed up in a bundle laying on the ground, underneath the line in the yard; I know no more than that; taking up my bundle I found my things in it, and in going in, the prisoner at the bar brushed by me, and bid me go in doors.</p>
               <p>Q. What you went out into the yard? - I went out into the yard; he came out of a little washhouse, joining to the house, in the yard; I went in doors and gave the alarm for the watch to be called, and he was taken immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who took him? -

               <p>I am one of the patrole of Hackney. About half past twelve I was standing at the watch-house door, and I heard the alarm of calling out thieves! I immediately<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110120"></xptr>ran across a bridge, which leads to a brook, and I saw the prisoner come out of the brook, run across a foot path that leads into the road; I called on him to stop, or else I would fire on him; he ran the space of five or six hundred yards before I took him, in that time I catched hold of him, and brought him back to the watch-house; the lady came into the watch-house soon after, within the space of a few minutes, she said he was the man that was in the watch-house, before his face; I searched him; he had no stockings on, he had his stockings in his pocket; I found nothing on him but a screw driver and a pair of clasps, and his knife.

               <p>I went down into the same wash-house after hearing the alarm given, and I found a gown and a child's frock were gone out of the basket where I had left them. I did not see the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. On the 24th of July I was in Whitechapel, these tools we always have about us; and I saw an acquaintance of mine; he asked me if I was out of service? I told him I was; says he, if you will go along with me I will recommend you, my master wants a man to drive the Woodford stage. I went with with the man and I stayed there till past ten o'clock, and then I came away; I came as far as Hackney, and then I took my stockings off, and was washing my feet, and the while I heard something plunge into the water; I took up my stockings, knowing that Hackney parish was a very strict place, and I went on; and the gentleman overtook me, and brought me to the watch-house</p>

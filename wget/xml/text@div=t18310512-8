             keeps the house; I have lodged there almost six months - I play an organ; I have known the prisoner eight or nine months - he tunes organs, and had tuned for me three or four weeks before this happened. On the 12th of April, about ten or eleven o'clock in the morning, he came to me, and said, "Will you be so kind as to lend me 1s., to get some dinner," which I did - on that day my brother brought my organ home, and put it in the front parlour, in a kind of passage; I did not see it in the room, but saw my brother bringing it home - I missed it about eight o'clock in the evening; it was afterwards found by my brother.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. At what time did you see your brother bring the organ home? A.About a quarter to eight o'clock - I saw him in the street, coming home with it; my brother has an organ, and another brother another - I sometimes let one out at 6d. a day- I employed the prisoner to alter the tuning of the organ about a month before; he came to my house almost every week - he had no right to the organ; I never said that it was my opinion that he did not intend to steal it; I did not suspect him till it was found, for he was like a brother to me, but I heard he had some money, and then suspected him - somebody said, "Jack took your organ;" I could not say it was him until it was found - I did not say whether I did or did not believe it was him.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's brother. On the 12th of April I brought the organ home at half-past seven o'clock, and put it into the front parlour, by the side of the bed - I locked the door, and opened the window; my brother came home five or ten minutes afterwards, and the organ was gone - it was worth 20l.; I afterwards saw it at the pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body about the place? A. No; it would fetch 20l.</p>
               <p>JOHN BENNETT. I live with Mr. Clark, a pawnbroker, in Old-street. On the 12th of April a person brought an organ in; we are not in the habit of taking them in, and I asked him if it belonged to himself - he said No, the person belonging to it was outside; I told him to fetch him in - the prisoner came in, and I knew him as a customer; I asked if it belonged to him - he said it did; "I said,"Why did you not come in yourself?" he turned to the man, and said, "Why did not you tell me I was wanted?" I lent him 3l. on the organ, and gave him the duplicate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was a regular customer? A. Yes - I had taken an organ in from him before - he did not give his right address; he pawned it in the name of Clark - I understand his name is Langshaw.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BARRETT. I live at No. 6, Tothill-street, Clerkenwell. On Tuesday evening, the 12th of April, I was coming down the street, and saw the prisoner and a man stouter than him; one said to the other "Come along, Jack;" they had the organ, and went down Gray's Inn-lane with it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had you observed them? A. Not above two minutes - I thought the other was a man named Marsh; he was taken on suspicion, but I did not swear to him.</p>

On the night of 20th December I was in company with Green, another officer, in Fenchurch Street—I saw the prisoner and watched him—I saw him follow a gentleman across the road, and as he got to the pavement he was close up to him, and when he drew his hand away from the gentleman I saw this handkerchief in his hand—the gentleman turned short round—I kept the prisoner in sight and told Green to get the gentleman—I followed the prisoner some little distance, and I saw him hold up the handkerchief, double it up, and put it round his neck—at that time Green came up to me—the prisoner walked on directly, turned round, and saw me and Green together, and ran away—we ran after him through different streets into Camomile Street—I hallooed, "Stop thief!" a gentleman who was coming along went to stop him, and he up with his fist and knocked him down; the gentleman got up again, caught him, and held him till I came up—Green came, up, we had a struggle, he tried to get away, we had to get the assistance of a constable in uniform, and the prisoner bit him through the coat—we at last got him to the station.</p>

On 20th December I was in St. Mary Axe—I heard a cry of "Stop thief," and followed the crowd that was following the prisoner, he was captured in Bishopsgate Street—he was very violent and tried to get away from the officers in plain clothes—I laid hold of him by the collar, and he turned round and tried to bite my hand—he did lay hold of my coat-sleeve, and I was obliged to strike him to make him loose his hold.</p>

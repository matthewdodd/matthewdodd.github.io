                  </hi>. I am a cabinet maker, occupying a dwelling-house and shops at 2, New Nichol Street, Bethnal Green—the prisoner was in my employ, off and on, eight years—there had been continual differences between us since I took him on the last time, six or seven months ago, principally about neglect of his work—I had occasion to scold him about it; and he used insulting language—he had drawn money on account the very day the fire took place, or the day before, and went away, and never came back to his job—we had words about it, and I said, "You generally manage to come in an hour or two before dinner time, so as to manage to draw a little money of me, and I am getting tired of it"—he was very off-handed about it, and said, "I cannot work without food; I must have</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186907120091"></xptr>
               <p>money"—he drinks very hard, and on the day of the fire I mentioned it, and he said that he earned his money—he went to dinner about 1 o'clock and I said, "Now, <hi rend="italic">Jim</hi>, you have taken a lot of micro on this job, and you know what a fix I am in for it"—he promised me that if I would give him ls to get something to eat, he would come back to work, and I gave him Is.—he then left for his dinner, and should have come back at 2 o'clock but did not—I did not see him again till the evening, when the fire was raging—I only managed to save my pocket-book, and then the roof fell in which turned me so sick that I went up to the Admiral Vernon, six doors off, where I met the prisoner—he said, "Here's a job, governor"—I said, "Oh, you villain!"—he said, "What for?"—we both got very excited, and he took off his coat to fight me—I said, "I am not in a position to fight now, I am in too much trouble"—he knew that I was not insured, because I used to beg all the men to be so careful about fire—the lease cost me 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and I have also lost my tools, and the covenant of the house—when the company found the inflammable nature of the materials, they did not actually refuse to insure, but they wanted such a lot of improvements that I could not carry them out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's errand boy—on 8th June I was sitting waiting for him on the step at No. 2, Nichol Street—all the work-people had left, and it was as near as possible 9.30—I saw the prisoner in the prosecutor's yard, buttoning up his coat, as he came up the passage leading to the street, on his toes—he did not go into the street, but went up the stain two at the time, on his toes—I lost sight of him when he got to the first flight—the stairs lead to the workshop and to the dwelling-rooms—the workshop is the second floor—I could see the window of it if I went into the street—two or three minutes afterwards I heard the door creak (I had noticed that the workshop door creaked before that), and directly after that I saw him come down stairs; he came through the passage, and when he got to me, he said, "Is the master at home?"—I said, "No, he has not come home yet"—he said, "I shall say good-night; I will go up stairs and see the <hi rend="italic">missue"</hi>—she was in No. 1, and he went to No. 2; and as soon as he got into the passage of No. 2, I saw the reflection of a light on the other side of the street—I went across the road to look, and saw long flames rising up against the workshop window, inside—they came from the middle window—the windows are in front of the house, and the fire-place at the side—I called out, "Fire!"and the prisoner came out directly, and said, "Well, good night, I'm off"—he walked up the street, and when he got to the beer-shop he ran—he could see the fire where he was, he looked up at it—the mistress was in the workshop after he left, her name is Marks—the lodgers were at home—I gave the alarm, and they came out—I did not stop to see whether any engines came, I was too glad to get home after I had got one or two of the things out of the down stairs room.</p>

                  </hi>.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was it the constant practice for your master and your-self to smoke in that room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, all day long, whenever we liked—the workshop was sometimes open till 12 o'clock at night in winter, but not in summer—the fire was about three feet from where the shavings would fall from the benches of the work-people—the fire-place was a little out of repair, it burns shavings and dust—it is a bricked fire-place, 18in. from the ground—the place was not fuller of shavings than usual—I never suggested that they were dangerous and ought to be turned out, that I am aware of—I was informed that the workshop chimney was on fire two months ago.</p>

               <p>it bowed up against the windows—on the 10th I saw the prisoner at the London Depot, in the Curtain Road, sitting down having a glass of ale—I asked him if he would be kind enough to tell me where he was from 8 to 10 o'clock on the evening of the fire, Tuesday night—he said. "What do you ask me this question for?"—I told him it was a very serious matter for me, and then he said, "I was not out of this house from 3 o'clock till 10 o'clock, only twice, to go to the Blue Last to get a drop of gin "—the officers heard what he said, and requested him to go to the station—my workshop has been burnt down, too.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a box maker, of 5, Crown Court—on the night of the fire I was at the London Depot beer-house, Curtain Coad—I got there about 7.60—the prisoner was there then, I was in his company—friends of mine were with him, our conversation was about tools and about the Irish Church Bill, which was always usual when me and the prisoner met—while I was talking to him I heard a cry of "Fire!"—he had not left my pre<lb></lb>sence, to my knowledge, from 7.50 till then, I was in his presence the whole time—I asked him to go to the door, to see if he could see where the fire was; he went, and came back to his seat, where he was before, baring been away about a minute—we had several reports, and it must have been forty minutes before we got it correctly where the fire was—I then went to the Admiral Vernon and saw the prosecutor, it was very full—the prisoner went up and spoke to him, and he said, "I have only one man to thank for this, and that is you"—the prisoner replied, "What for, sir, because I have not finished the tables 1"—the prosecutor said, "If you do not get away from me, I will knock you down"—a female took the prosecutor away, and I took the prisoner home—I have been in my present service eleven years.</p>

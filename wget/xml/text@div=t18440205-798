I am an unfortunate female, and live in Vine-yard, Tooley-street, in the prisoner's house, and have done so five months—on this Thursday night I saw the prosecutor in Vine-yard—he went home with me to the prisoner's house and into the top room—the prisoner came of stairs along with me into the room, and asked the prosecutor if he was going to stop all night—he said, "Yes," and he asked him for the rent of the room—he said, "Do not be so fast," he would send the money down stairs along with me—the prosecutor had a poker in his hand swinging it about, and saying, "Sprig of shillalah and shamrock so green"—he did not make any attempt to strike any body—the prisoner went down stairs, and came up with his sword in about five minutes—he appeared very angry, and said, "Here's for Erin go bragh," rushed forward at the prosecutor, and struck him in the breast with the sword.</p>

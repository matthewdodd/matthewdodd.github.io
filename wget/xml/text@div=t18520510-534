                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Edkins, of 9, Borough-road, clerk to an attorney. On 3rd May, about 5 o'clock in the evening, I was passing through Smithfield, and saw the prisoner close by me—I am sure she is the person—I saw a man fall down before me, and he was raising himself when I felt a tug at my pocket, and missed my purse—it contained a sixpence, a halfpenny, a receipt for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and, to the best of my belief, a shilling also—the prisoner walked away, and afterwards ran, and while she was walking before me, she pulled the purse out—while I was endeavouring to follow her, ano<lb></lb>ther man, not the one who had fallen down, attempted to interrupt me—the two men ran after the prisoner; she went through a court, and I saw the man who had fallen down pass something to her hand as they crossed the path, and the woman passed her hand to him, and I saw something pass which looked like a purse—I cannot swear it was mine; they were about a dozen yards off me—before the prisoner passed the purse to the man, I saw her look into each corner of it—I followed her for a quarter of a mile into a public house, where I was told she had gone, and I found her there.</p>

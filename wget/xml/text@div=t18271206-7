The prisoner was occasionally employed by us, and on the 6th of November he was employed to pass down one hundred sacks of flour into a barge; I had suspicion, and discovered that a crate of glass and other things were broken open in our warehouse; I had not seen the crate before the discovery - I saw it opened about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, and, on examining it, missed some articles; the prisoner was then gone. I sent for an officer, with whom I went to his brother's lodging; we found him and his brother together, and five cut-glass tumblers on the drawers before them - they were very handsome tumblers; I asked whose property they were - neither of them could tell me; they said they knew nothing about them; nobody else was in the room. The prisoner's brother said, if I waited a few minutes his wife would be in, and might be able to tell me about them - the wife came in, and said, in the prisoner's hearing, that she had been out all the morning, and the tumblers were not there when she went out - that she had been in at five o'clock, and they were not there then, and she knew nothing of them. I then gave charge of the prisoner, and the officer took the tumblers - they matched exactly with those in the crate, and we found them in a piece of red cloth, of the same sort as those in the crate were wrapped in; they are worth about 2s. each; we have employed him repeatedly; he did job work at times - he might earn 7s. or 8s. a day.</p>

            . I am warehouseman to the prosecutors. On the 6th of November the prisoner was employed, with three more, to ship some flour - he only carried one sack, and lurked about the warehouse, which made me suspect him, but I saw nothing done; I saw him in that part of warehouse where the crate was deposited, and when I went to lock up, about half-past seven o'clock, I found a broken tumbler wrapped in a piece of red baize; I directly went to the crate, and found it had been broken open; I had seen it in a perfect state at three o'clock that afternoon- I directly went to Mr. Frazer, to make inquires, and reported my inquires to the prosecutors: the goods in the crate were in red baize.</p>

            . I am a porter, and occasionally work for the prosecutors. On the afternoon this happened I was up stairs, landing flour, and after we had done I came to the top of the ladder where these men were at work; I staid there a few minutes, talking to one of our own men, who was letting the flour down on those men's backs, for them to carry, and while there I heard glass fall- at this time those men were at the bottom of the ladder; I cannot say whether the prisoner was there, as it was dark in that place; we took no further notice of it, thinking it might be a bottle - but in about ten minutes I came down stairs, stood a few minutes, and saw the prisoner coming from that part of the warehouse where the crate of glass was - he said he had carried a sack of flour, and he would settle, meaning that he was tired; I said nothing about the glass, not knowing of the robbery till the next morning.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was desired to take the prisoner into custody. I found five tumblers on the drawers - Mr. Howell asked how they came by them; they both said they did not know how they came there; Mrs. Holloway came in, and declared, in their presence, that they were not there when she went out; I went back to the warehouse, and discovered another glass broken there, in the same sort of red baize, and the packages in the crate<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060011"></xptr>were in the same sort of baize; I have no doubt of its being the same; it is broken, but the bottom matches.</p>
               <p>MR. CRESWELL to MR. HOWELL. Q. Was one Walker in the lodging as well as the prisoner's brother? A. Nobody else was there; there may be such a man as Walker an occasional porter. The prisoner appeared to have been in liquor.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you know the contents of the crate? - A. Not before this happened; we have had an invoice since, and these six tumblers are the only things missing.</p>

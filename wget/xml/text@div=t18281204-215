On the 19th of October, about half-past one, o'clock, I was sitting up for my lodger; I heard a rattle spring, and went to the door - the watchman was bringing a man along; I heard a scuffle among the Irish people at the corner of Broad Arrow-court - I went over; I saw the prosecutor, and observed them give him a violent blow - I saw him fall; another one put his foot across him, and began kicking him - I immediately went for assistance; I cannot swear to any particular man. for I ran to fetch a watchman - I met Sackerson, and sent him into Grub-street; he ran - I ran on to the watch-house, to fetch more watchmen, and as I came back they had the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a watchman. A man was given into my charge, about one o'clock, on the 19th of October -I was going to the watch-house with him; Hearn came to the watch-house, and fetched me - I went down to Grub-street, and saw Perrott lying on the pavement; I assisted him up - he was quite unable to tell me the cause of it; I left him leaning against the public-house, and went in pursuit of the prisoner, whom I was given to understand had gone down the street, with the hat; I followed a short distance down Grub-street, and met Sackerson about fifteen yards from the spot, coming back with the prisoner and the hat.</p>

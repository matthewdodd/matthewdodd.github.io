On the 12th of June we had to solder the lining of a cistern at the Lord Nelson public-house, at Poplar—about five o'clock that evening they began to solder the bottom—I was standing by the plumber, whose name was Dutch—there came a hole in the cloth he was using—he asked me to give him another cloth out of his bag—I went to the bag to get one, and burnt my hand, against a ladle-cake of hot metal that was in the bag—at six o'clock the bag was brought into the work-shop, and I looked in, and the solder was gone—I went to the plumber, and said to him, in the prisoner's presence, "I have got a very unpleasant thing to tell you; when you sent me to your bag I burnt my hand against a ladle-cake of metal; that is not right, is it?"—the prisoner said, "No, it is not right, don't make a noise about it; come with me, and I will try and find it"—we went and hunted about amongst the barrels, it was not there—he said, "It is here, come on"—he went to a privy—I went, looked in, and came out"—he said, "Here it is," and he had it in his hand—he said, "Don't make a noise, somebody will hear"—I said I would fetch the surveyor, which I did, and he gave him in charge.</p>

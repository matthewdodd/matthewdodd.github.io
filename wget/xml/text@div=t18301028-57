At half-past two o'clock the prosecutor said he had been robbed by a woman, whom he described - I knew her, and went about six in the morning; I waited where she lived till she came home - she wanted to go up stairs, but I would not let her; I took her to a public-house; she said I was welcome to search her - she pulled off her shawl, and this purse fell from it, which contains 2l. 16s. 6d.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told you the gentleman gave me the money and purse. Witness. No, she did not - I should not have searched her if she had; when I found this she said it was given her.</p>

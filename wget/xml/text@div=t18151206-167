            . I and another officer, were in company together, on Sunday, at about nine o'clock in the morning; a coach drove up to the prisoner's door, and his door opened; we saw a large green bag full of something thrown into the coach, and the prisoner got in after it. The coach drove away, and we followed it, and stopped it; upon opening the bag, we found pieces of kerseymere, and broad cloth. We asked him where he got them; he said, he was going to take them to Portsmouth, with jewellery goods. He told us when he got to the watchhouse, that he had bought the goods in the City, and could shew us bills of parcels; we let him go. He promissed to appear before the magistrate the next day; but he never came: nor did I see him afterwards until he was taken into custody,</p>

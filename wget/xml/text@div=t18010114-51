               <p>Q. How did it appear to have been opened? - A. The staple that the lock shut into was wrenched back, as it were with a chissel, or something of that sort; I missed a purse out of the chest, containing twenty-three guineas, four seven-shilling pieces, nine one pound notes, a two pound note, and a thirty pound note, a pair of silver shoebuckles, and a calico sheet; I did not get a warrant till Thursday following, I did not know how to go about the affair; on Wednesday I went to Guildhall, and could not get in, there were so many people there.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know who you received the thirty pound note from? - A. I do not recollect his name, he is here; on the Thursday night I went to the prisoner's apartments with Tipper and Cartwright, he was not at home at first; I went about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140058"></xptr>to several public-houses to find him, but could not; he came home very soon, and we began to search; we found him sitting in his own room by the fire; we all went into his room, and I told the officers that was the man; they then searched him and the room, and found a purse, which was one of my own making at Calcutta, which contained the money and notes that I had lost, they found two guineas in his wife's petticoat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing? - A. He called me some name, I don't know what, and then the officers took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt of it's being your purse? - A. No; if there is such another in England, I will suffer being put in his place.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you given permission that evening to any person to go into your room? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner and you been upon terms of intimacy? - A. No, I have not spoke to him since I came home from the East-Indies; I knew him before I went, his wife had been several times in my room before this.</p>
               <p>Q. During the times that she had been in your room, do you know whether the chest had been opened? - A. Yes, several times.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever charge Curran with committing the robbery? - A. No; he has been changing some of the notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the oath you have taken, have you never charged Curran with robbing you? - A. No; I asked him if he had been changing the notes for Coffee.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you never charge Cockran with robbing you? - A. I did not.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a constable of the city of London; on Thursday the 15th of December, I went to the prisoner's apartments with Tipper, Cartwright, and the prosecutor; the prisoner was not at home the first time I went; he came in in about three quarters of an hour; when we went into the room, there was his wife and child asleep in the bed; we all went in; Hickie, the prosecutor, said, that is your prisoner; I said, my friend, I have got a warrant to apprehend you for a felony; I shewed him the warrant: I searched him, but could find nothing about him; we searched, and finding nothing, we desired him to take his wife and children off the bed, which he did; I then took the bed off from the bedstead, and between the bed and the sacking of the bedstead I found these new things not made up, and between the bedstead and the wall, I found a purse, (produces it); when I pulled the bedstead a way it fell upon the ground; Hickie saw it, and said immediately this is my purse; I asked him what he knew it by before I let him see it, he said there was a hole at each end that a half guinea or a seven-shilling piece would tumble through; he said he made it himself on board a ship at sea, and that it was a worsted purse; I looked at it, and found it so; the prisoner said his child had had it for two or three days throwing about the room: I don't recollect that he said any thing else; we then took him to the Compter, and I went back again and searched her, and in her petticoat, in the plait sewed up in the back part, I found two guineas.</p>

               <p>Q. You are a witness upon this indictment, and a constable? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you contribute towards the expences of this prosecution? - A. The prosecutor has got some money owing to him, he could not raise money enough, Tipper laid down some money for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the prosecutor ever since that repaid the money that was paid down? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever tell the prosecutor, or any body in your presence, that there was a forty pound reward? - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What part of the money did you lay down? - A. Fifteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did the other constable lay down? - A. The same; and Tipper laid down the same; he got all he could himself.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did he bring? - A. He brought a guinea, and some shillings afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. If it has been said that he advanced all the money for the prosecution, that is not true? - A. It is not true.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never heard any of the officers hint to him any thing about a reward of 40l.? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. You and he were old acquaintance, I suppose? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you were kind enough to advance this money to a stranger, merely upon the strength of his word? - A. We made up what money was to pay to carry on the prosecution; we knew he had that five pounds owing to him on board the ship, and he bears a very good character at the India-house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found this purse, the prisoner said his child had been suffing it about the room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140060"></xptr>Q. Did he not add, that Cochran had given it to the child to throw about? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. And that you swear? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There were holes in the purse? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore a very likely place for a man to put seven-shilling pieces in? - A. His money was in a bag.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Before you laid down this money, you enquired what was his character at the India-house? - A. Yes; Tipper was there two or three times.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you contribute towards the expences of this prosecution, or lend him money? - A. I lent him the money; if he got the five pounds before he went to sea, he was to return it to us; if he did not, we were to stand to the loss of it.</p>
               <p>

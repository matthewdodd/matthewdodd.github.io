                  </hi>. I serve in the shop of Mrs. Bute, a confectioner, of Great Turnstile—on 7th October I served a man, not the prisoner, with a sponge cake—he gave me a half-crown; I told him it was bad, and gave it back to him—he said, "Oh, is it?" and gave me a penny and left—Walter Bute followed him.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in my mother's shop and paw a man tender a bad half-crown to the girl—I knew it was bail by the sound of it on the counter—he paid with a penny and left—I followed him to a public-house about five minutes' walk off, and joined the prisoner and a third man—they passed something between them, and I followed them—they walked together on the other side of the road—they saw me speak to a constable—we followed them to Bow Street—two of them ran up Oxford Street and the prisoner went down a court—I went round the other way and met the constable with him—the other two got away.</p>

Bute pointed out three lads to me in Holborn about 20 yards off—I saw them pass something—they turned, saw me, and ran away—the prisoner went up a street towards the British Museum—I ran after him and told him to stop—he put his hand in his pocket; I took it out and found a half-crown in it—I held his hand and he gave it to me—he was searched at the station, and a good shilling found on him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you know, of your own knowledge, where it came from? A. I received three chests, and by the note brought with them I found they came from Thorman's. I did not see them opened.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. From whom did you receive them? A. Rutt.</p>
               <p>MR. JOHN HOWELL. I am a wharfinger, in partnership with James Randall and others. The dwelling-house joins the warehouse, and is under the same roof. I live there with my family. It is in the parish of St. Michael, Queenhithe.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Who pays the rent and taxes? A. The firm - the house belongs to us all - it is agreed that the firm should pay the rent and taxes - they come into the profit and loss account; James Randall is never called senior.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. If any other partner had occasion to sleep in town, he would sleep there? A. No; the house is made over to me in the articles of partnership - none of the trade servants sleep there; one of the partners may have slept there once within the last ten years, but it was by invitation; they have no right to sleep there. I remember Mr. James Randall sleeping there, when I invited him to dinner.</p>

            . I live at No. 6, Queenhithe, with my mother. On the 6th of July, I saw all the three prisoners pass my mother's door; the house is two or three yards from the corner which turns round to where the prosecutor's house is; it was six o'clock in the evening as near as I can judge: I saw them pass the door where I stood; one of them had a chest of tea on his back; that was Frederick Williams (pointing him out,); they came in a direction from the prosecutor's house; I followed them to Mr. Riley's, the Blue Last public-house, Distaff-lane, and saw Frederick and Henry go into the house; Frederick still had the chest, and Henry carried his hat; Michael crossed the road, and I directly went and gave information to Jackson, the officer, who lives close by; before I came out of Jackson's, Michael and Frederick were gone; Henry ran a little distance and was taken. Mrs. Coesar, who lives two doors from me, came out and joined me in the pursuit.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you know any of their names before that day? A. Yes, I knew the Christian names; Henry and Frederick went into the public-house; I do not know whether they are related - when I came from the officer's, Henry stood opposite to the public-house - the other two had gone away; Henry had come out of the public-house and stood opposite. I swear that he was with them carrying Frederick's hat in his hand - the public-house is about as far as from here to St. Paul's church-yard; I get my living by servitude; I had just left my place; I knew them all personally.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had no quarrel with Frederick? A. No, no quarrel - if he chose to abuse me I could not help it; I do not think such characters worth quarrelling with - he has abused me several times, but I never quarrelled with him; I did not answer him.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you get your living, when out of service? A. I was with my mother who keeps a mangle.</p>
               <p>Q. The words you had were entirely on the prisoner's side - were they before this charge? A. Yes; I was not at all angry; after I left my situation, I thought no more about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave in consequence of the dispute? A. I left when I found what characters frequented the house; it was at Mr. Dyson's, a public-house; I took the place not knowing what a set used the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a little chastity quarrel? A. He thought proper to abuse me; I thought it best not to answer him; I took no notice of him - it happened twice.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after that did you discover the tea on his back? A. I believe it was three months after - I frequently saw him in the day time. I do not now know what he quarrelled with me about.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you know Michael? A. I know them all by serving them with liquor at the bar, nothing more; there was nothing to hinder Michael from going into the public-house, except that I think he saw me - he saw me going and might suspect that I was going for the officers, and he could beckon the others out, which he did, and they came out.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he not full time to go into the house? A. Yes, if he chose; I brought the officer in about a minute after I saw them go into the public-house - the one who carried the hat had the same opportunity of seeing me as Michael, but the one with the chest had not; I told Coesar of it before I went to the officer; she lives next door to me; I told her of it as I passed her door behind them; she and I followed them to the public-house, and then I went to the officer; they could have heard me acquaint her, and I have no doubt but they did, for two of them looked back, the one with the chest could not look back - they went into the public-house after I called her.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to Coesar? A. As I was standing at the door seeing the men pass, I gave the alarm, having known them before. I said to Coesar that I thought those men who had gone on with that chest, had not got it honestly, and we followed them: Coesar was in her front room - she could see them pass; she heard me speaking, and came out; I directly told her and we followed them - I spoke loud enough for her to hear me in her parlour - I do not know whether she heard the words, but she heard me speaking; the prisoners heard me - I have no doubt every one in the street must have heard me - no one was passing at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were you speaking to then? A. I stood at the door and said so - my mother's is next door but one to Coesar's - the men had just turned the corner - the place was so public they could not get rid of the chest without going into the public-house - for though no one was in our street, they turned into Fish-street, and there are all shops there. Coesar is a married woman - my mother and her's live in one house, and she herself keeps the house next door but one, but her mother lives in my mother's house; Coesar's husband lives with her and was at home, but did not come out. I am acquainted with Coesar, she did not know the prisoners before, that I know of - she never told me she was acquainted with them or any of them - when I called, she said we will follow them and see where they take it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, did not you at the time let Coesar know that they were the William's? A. I mentioned their names to her at the time - she did not give me to understand that she knew who they were before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you say that you saw Michael speak to the other two persons? A. I saw him beckon them out - I might not have told the Magistrate so - I do not recollect whether I mentioned it or not - I never saw either of them speaking to Coesar - I told her they were men whom I had served many times with liquor - I do not know now that she was acquainted with either of them.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. You have no doubt of their persons? A. Not the least; Coesar took notice of them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Which was the man who remained behind? A. That is him, Henry - he carried the hat - I first heard his name was Henry when he passed the door. I had no acquaintance with any of them before - I swear that.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you when you first heard of this? A. Sitting in my own place. I saw them pass my door - I live close up in the corner; Henry was coming towards us when he was taken - Jackson was with us - I said "That is one of them;" there might be more persons call out besides me, as a good many people had assembled by that time; I do not know whether the last witness called out that he was the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where do you live? A. At No. 8, Naked Boy-alley. Ketling's house is not in the alley - I live two doors from her; I was at tea in a lower room adjoining the street - I came to the door, seeing a genteel dressed man run up the place with a hat in his hand, as if to see if it was a thoroughfare - my husband was at tea with me, and saw me go out - he did not leave the table.</p>
               <p>Q. You were astonished at seeing the man pass? A. No, not till I saw the tea chest pass, I then came out - I did not tell my husband why I went. It was more than half an hour before I returned - he was not there when I came back. When I got out I first saw Henry, who carried the hat, then the one with the tea - I do not know his name; I then saw the other with his arm in a sling, and an umbrella in his hand. I never saw either of them before to my knowledge - I did not know the one who had his arm in a sling.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, for fear of a mistake, his name is Michael - do you persist in saying you never saw him before that night? A. Not to my knowledge. When I came to the door Ketling came up - she had got to my door at the time - I had not heard her saying any thing - it was not her voice that brought me out - the first thing I said to her was to ask if she knew where the tea came from; I do not think that she spoke to me first; she said she did not know, but she knew the three persons who were carrying it, and mentioned all their three names directly - I said "We will follow and see where they go." I knew Ketling by her living in an apartment two doors from me - her mother, whose name is Johnson, lives there, and my mother also lives in the same house; it might be ten minutes after I came out before Michael went away. The officer lives close by.</p>

            . I keep the Blue Lasts, Distaff-lane. On the 6th of July, between five and six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner Henry came to my house - I do not know either of the others - he came with another who I cannot speak to - I was at tea in the bar - something came lumping into the passage, I looked, and it was a chest of tea - they had a glass of gin each at the bar, and did not remain more than five minues - only while they drank it - they went out, leaving this chest of tea behind.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did any body else come to your house about the same time. A. Not a creature came to the bar but them. Jackson apprehended Henry and brought him by my house - he asked if I knew him - I said he was the person - he denied it; Jackson took him away with the tea.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Which carried the tea you do not know? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the other man give Henry a glass of gin, saying it was for his trouble in carrying the load? A. I heard nothing of the sort - each drank a glass and went away; Henry did not go out till there was a noise about the tea - he then walked off about twenty paces, and then ran. I went to the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Could you see whether either of the two had his arm in a sling? A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL BUDD. I was in Distaff-lane on the evening of the 6th of July, and saw Jackson. I saw the prisoner Henry standing at the door of the Blue Last, public-house; he walked from the door, and afterwards ran away into Friday-street; I ran after him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. He was doing nothing? A. He was walking alongside another who was carrying a chest of tea. I saw the tea go out of their hands into the door of the public-house - he took it off the man's shoulder, and helped him to pitch it down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the other invite him to take a glass of gin for his trouble? A. No. I saw him go to the bar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You only saw two go into the house? A. I saw them at the door.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the evening of the 6th of July Ketling called on me, and gave me information - I went out to Riley's passage, and saw the chest of tea there. I said, "Who does this tea belong to;" (Henry was by at the time) he crossed the way, and somebody said, "That is one of them" - I called out, Stop him! he directly ran; I followed him up Friday-street, towards Cheapside - I was caught hold of by a dog, by which he got a head of me, but was stopped by somebody, and turned back. I took hold of him, searched, but found nothing on him. I took the tea into my possession.</p>

            , and live in Benbow's-rent. I have known Henry Williams eight years, as a boot and shoe-maker. The witness Ketling was in my room on the 4th of May; I know she had quarrelled with the prisoner Frederick: she said she would have her revenge on him, and should like to see him hung, and if she had her will she would hang him, for revenge was sweet - she said that three or four times in my room.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How came you to recollect that it was the 4th of May? A. Because it was exactly a month before my child died, which was on the 4th of June. I told Frederick's wife of this, and was subpoened here.</p>
               <p>One witness gave the prisoner Frederick a good character, and one appeared for Michael.</p>

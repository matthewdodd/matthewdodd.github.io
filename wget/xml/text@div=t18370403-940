                  </hi>. I reside in Commercial-road, and am master of the brig, Don. On Saturday, the 19th of March, I was at the Brunswick Tavern, Black wall, from ten till half-past eleven o'clock—I did not see the prisoner—I saw my watch safe at half-past eleven o'clock, when I left—I was sober then, but when I got into the air I got drunk—I was retailing home, and how I lost my watch I cannot tell—I grew insensible—when I awoke I found myself, I think, in Poplar watchhouse—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the watch</hi>)—I have no marks upon it, but I know it altogether—the ribbon is not the same—it has been taken off—there was not this crack in the glass—the maker's name is M'Lachlan—it had a brown face, like this—I can swear to it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Upper East-Smithfield, and am a watch and chronometer maker. I put a new inside to this watch, for Captain Morton—I know it is his watch—the prisoner came to me about ten o'clock in the morning, on the 19th of March, and asked me to buy this watch—he said, "It cost me a good deal of money, I bought it two years ago, in the City; I was mate of a ship then"—I then opened it, and per<lb></lb>ceived my own name inside it—after looking at it a little attentively, I recollected whose it was—I said "I suspect you stole this, I must detain it, and you too"—he went out—I went and spoke to a policeman—he ran off, and I sent my son after him—I asked his address—he told me "No. 4, Cannon-street, Poplar, and that his name was John Dykes"—I did not go there—the policeman took him afterwards.</p>

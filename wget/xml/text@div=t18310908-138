The prisoner was a year and a half in my service - when he receives money on my account, it is his duty to give it to me the moment he sees me- on the 17th of August the witness fetched this hay; I was not there - the prisoner never gave me this 2s.: on the Saturday I told him of it, and he said he meant to have given it to me - I discharged him, because I suspected this had been going on for some time; he had 1l. a week.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you mention the 2s. to him before you discharged him? A. No - I discovered it on the Saturday morning, when Tyzack came and asked for a better truss than he had on Wednesday; the prisoner did not tell me he had received 2s. from a fishmonger - he never paid me money, saying he had had it two or three days; I had a visit from the Excise on Monday evening - the prisoner was taken on Tuesday; I did not suspect he had sent the officer.</p>

            . I was in the prosecutor's service, minding his place, when this happened; I was present when the prisoner was settled with on Saturday night - Mr. Watney mentioned the truss of hay; the prisoner said he would pay him, and told him to take the money; he said he had sold the truss to the fishmonger's brother - I saw him pay it into Mr. Watney's hand, with 1s. 9d. which he owed besides.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Then it is all false that the 2s. have not been paid? A. Mr. Watney will take a false oath - I was there about three weeks, merely to mind the place while the man went out with the cart.</p>
               <p>Q.Was the prisoner the first to mention this truss of hay to his master? A. He was - he said, "Here are 2s., which I forgot to give you:" it was settled in full of all demands - I was suprised to hear of his being taken up; they kept me back from going to the Magistrate - nobody stopped me from going in, certainly, but I was ordered out of the Court-yard; I cannot say who by - the prisoner's wife asked me to go there; she asked me if I did not remember his paying the 2s.</p>
               <p>Q.What time were you discharged on the Saturday night? A.About half-past seven o'clock, when the account was settled.</p>

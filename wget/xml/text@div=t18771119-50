                  </hi>. I am 83 years of age—I live at Slurry, near Canter<lb></lb>bury—on Saturday afternoon, 27th October, I was at Canterbury, and went with a friend into the Kentish Arms public-house to have a pint of beer—I remained there about half an hour—while there I took out my watch to see whether it was time to go home—I left about 3.30—at first there were two or three people in the tap-room, but when I came out there was only one, the prisoner—I am not. quite sure that it was him, I should not be able to swear to him there—when I left the house I went towards home—a man who drove a van overtook me, and I asked him to let me ride—before the van overtook me I was joined by a man, about half a mile out of the town, and he got up into the van also; he asked me the time before we got up into the van, and I said I had not got my watch—we rode in the van as far as Broad Oak Hill, there we both got down—he followed me up the hill—it was raining, and he wanted me to stand up under a tree for shelter—I said no, I wanted to get home—we got on a little farther, and then he knocked me down and knelt on me, and took my watch and went away—I got up as soon as I could and halloed—I did not see anybody—it was within 20 rods of a house, and I ran into the house—this is my watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there is a mark on the face between the 10 and 11—I have had it eight or nine years—I am sure it is the same watch that he took out of my pocket—there is a brass button on the chain—I had the watch mended on that Saturday morning, and the man put this paper on it with his name—I can swear to the watch—while I was walking in the Shalloak Road, I saw Mrs. Nicholls and a man: that was before I got up into the van.</p>

               <p>I went with Mr. Clark to Bunhill-row, to a room up two-pair-of-stairs forward; I found the door locked; we broke it open; Ball the landlord was with us, and I found under the chest of drawers a great quantity of halfpence, and amongst the litter there was a little leaden pot like a snuff pot, and in that a parcel of puncheons and halfpence. Under the drawers I found some shillings, and some half crowns upon the tester of the bed.</p>
               <p>Clark. There were some bad guineas found in this pot; the puncheons are completely finished. It might be necessary to have a tail made, but that would be more trouble and expence; and therefore only the head side is represented, and not the tail. I do not take upon myself to say, that the impression upon these shillings was made from the puncheons found, but it has all the appearance of it.</p>

               <p>I am the landlord of the house in Bunhill-row. The prisoner had lodged with me about a week. I had seen him an hour before his lodging was searched; he had himself the key of his room. I believe he hired the lodging for himself and a woman who lived with him. I generally rose about six or seven, if he had made use of any instruments that made any noise, I think I must have heard him. I was present when the things were found.</p>

               <p>I apprehended the prisoner on the 8th of October. I found no counterfeit money upon him, but there was found a piece of paper, which imported to be a notice from him of his intention to surrender; it was dated the 30th of September.</p>
               <p>Mr. PINGO sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an engraver of the Mint; the prisoner is not employed by the Mint; the puncheon makes the die, and the counter puncheon is the die when it is made; the machines produced are puncheons, but not puncheons made at the Mint. The method by which these are made is, that they first take a true shilling, and cut it away to the out-line of the head; when they have done that, they take a piece of steel, on which they fix this outline, and then they file or cut the steel close away to that outline till the steel is exactly the shape of the head, and that is what is called a puncheon; these particular puncheons are all ready for use, for they are hardened, and they never are hardened till they are ready for use, that is the last operation they go through. It is impossible to say positively whether the shillings found in the prisoner's lodgings were made from these puncheons, because they are so imperfect, but they have all the appearance of it. In a new die or counter puncheon, the letters are always engraved in the counter puncheon after it is struck; there is no occasion to have any letters on old coin, it will pass without. The letters are put on afterwards, and a puncheon is complete without any letters at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177812090052"></xptr> all; a puncheon may have letters made upon it, but they never use such puncheons at the Mint from the inconvenience of them, because they would be so liable to break, and would require so much nicety to represent all the little angles and corners of the letters, that is the reason that we engrave the letters afterwards upon the counter puncheon; but for making base shillings nothing else is necessary but this puncheon; these puncheons which are produced, barely as you see them, though they might be for the making base shillings, yet they may be made use of for other purposes; namely, for making seals, buttons, medals, or other things, were such impressions are wanted.</p>

I frequently went up into the center room next to the prisoner's-room, during the week that he lodged there, his room was never locked; for though there was an old rusty lock on the door there was no key to it, and he was obliged always to go through the center room to get into his; in that center room nobody lodged, though there was a bed in it, and a lodger did lie there two nights in the course of that week. The prisoner had the key of the center room the morning that his lodgings were searched; he had it by my desiring him to lock it up when he went out, because I had washed, and there was linen in the room.</p>

             came to me in the middle of last May, and asked me if I worked for any of the silversmiths in that neighbourhood; I said I did for a good many; he said will you do a favour for me; I asked what, he put his hand into his pocket and pulled out a little dirty bag; he said he had picked up a parcel of bad shillings, sixpences, and counterfeit guineas, and if I would show them to some of my acquaintances he should be glad to have them valued for him; he opened the bag, and there were to the value of thirty or forty shillings. There were some sixpences, two half-crowns, several halfpence clapped together as if they had been run together; and there were thirteen counterfeit guineas, or thereabouts, and a leaden thing punched in at the top, with some iron images at the bottom; and at the bottom of these things there was some very clean cotton. I had three or four images in my hand. Mr. Fisher was in my room at the time, and after the man was gone he looked at them every one.</p>
               <p>Were they such images as these (showing the witnesses the puncheons)? Yes, if I had picked them up I should have thrown them away, I believe, for I never saw such things before. Mr. Ridgley came the next morning to my house; I said, Lord drown it, you can get these things valued for me; he looked at them, and said, to oblige me he would get them valued. I said, bring them soon because the man may want them again. He took them away, and I never saw him any more till he was in prison.</p>
               <p>Then you positively swear the bag now produced was delivered by you to the prisoner? - If I see the bag and the leaden thing at the bottom, I should know it again. The images and puncheons were in that bag. I never saw such things before.</p>
               <p>Court to Morant. Do you remember seeing any cotton? - Yes; at the bottom of a little pot.</p>

                  </hi>. I live on my property, and reside at 84, Waterloo-road. About 22d Sept. my son was in custody on some criminal charge—on that evening I met the prisoner at Mr. Butcher's shop, in the Waterloo-road—I told him my son had unfortunately got into trouble—he said, "Well, what is it?"—I told him I understood it was for stealing a looking-glass, and I believed it was at the West-end—he said, anything he could do for me he would—I said, "I have known you some time as an attorney, I suppose you are an attorney?"—he said, "Yes, I am, living at 10, Clifford's-inn"—he said nothing about being a clerk to Mr. Townshend—I never heard that name till I was at the Police-court, when the prisoner was there on this charge—I said I was very much inclined not to do anything for my son, but for the sake of my own conscience I must employ one of you gentlemen (<hi rend="italic">the Counsel</hi>), and I asked him what money he wanted—he said 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or not exceeding 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the present—he said there would be 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the counsel, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the clerk's fee—it was afterwards decided that he was to have 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he was to meet me at Mr. Butcher's the next afternoon, when he was to make out a brief—I did not meet him the next day, I was very ill of the cholera, and was advised to go into the country till the trial was over—I went to Mr. Butcher, told him to let the prisoner have 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., whichever he wanted, and I went into the country—Mr. Butcher did not owe me any money—I returned on the evening of 25th, the day the trial took place—I knew the trial would come on that day—I called on Mr. Butcher that evening, to inquire what my son was done to—Mr. Butcher told me he had got twelve months, and produced this letter to me—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—" 10, Clifford's-inn, Tuesday afternoon. Dear Butcher, I wrote yesterday to Mr. Palmer, and gave him all to-morrow (Wednesday) to pay the bill, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. expenses. Will you tell Mr. Vincent his son was tried in the name of John George, and was got off with only twelve months—what think you of that? Yours truly, R.

Yorston")—I repaid Mr. Butcher the money, and went to 10, Clifford's-inn, asked for the prisoner, and he was not at home—I went a second time, and he was not at home—I then found out that my son had not been defended, and was told that Mr. Meller had defended the others who were tried with him; and I went to Mr. Meller's office—on 7th Oct. I went to 10, Clifford's-inn, with a policeman, and saw the prisoner—that was the first time I had seen him since the 22d Sept.—he ordered me out of the place—I said to the policeman, who was with me, "This is the person; I give this man in charge"—when he told me he was an attorney I believed him, or I should not have given him the money—I had known him to do business for Mr. Butcher for about ten months, and saw him with papers tied up with red tape, and he was always talking of law—he said nothing on 22d about being clerk to an attorney.</p>

Mr. Winston came to my shop on Sunday, 23d Sept., and asked me to give Yorston 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to ask for a mitigation of the punishment of his son—they had been talking about it in my shop on the evening before—Yorston came on Monday, 24th—I gave him 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he gave me the receipt, which has been produced—I do not recollect whether I showed that to Mr. Winston—I did show him the letter—the name in the receipt is Vincent, but we call him Winston—I told Yorston he was to go to Clerken-well, and find a policeman, whose number and letter I told him, and he would tell him all about it—I did not tell him where the trial was to take place—he said he had a cause to attend at the Insolvent Debtors' Court, and he would attend to this if he possibly could—on the Tuesday evening I received the letter from him which has been read—the prosecutor called on me on the Tuesday evening, and again on Wednesday morning—I gave him the receipt and he paid me the 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

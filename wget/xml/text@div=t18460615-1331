               <p>On the 1st of June, about nine o'clock in the evening, I was in Park-street, by the side of the prosecutor's house, and saw two men pass before me—one of them took the bag, and hoisted it on the other's back—they walked down the street—it was a bag like this, supposing this to be filled£one of the men was rather taller than the prisoner, and one rather shorter.</p>

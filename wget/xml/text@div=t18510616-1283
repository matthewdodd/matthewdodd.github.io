                  </hi>. I am apprenticed to Mr. Blake. I was on his premises at Enfield on Saturday evening, 17th May—there is a stage in the brewery, and a hopper, where the malt is when it comes from the mill previous to its going into the mash-tub—I saw the hopper that night, between 8 and 9 o'clock—there was then about eight quarters of malt in it, and the surface of it was level—it was to be used in business on the Monday morning—on Sunday morning, between 11 and 12, I went with Collins to examine it, and about a bushel was gone, and the surface of the malt had a hole in it—it was not in the even state that it bad been before—the prisoner was in Mr. Blake's employ, as under-stage man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am under tun-man at the brewhouse. On Sunday morning, 18th May, I was in the brewhouse, about 9 o'clock—I went up to the stage to weigh the beer, which is done by an instrument—the hopper had then about eight quarters of malt in it—the prisoner was on the stage with a man named Hummerston—I have not seen Hummerston since; be had been on the premises the day before to assist the prisoner—the upper stage-man was not there that morning—he had been there late at night, till about 4 in the morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brewer and maltster, and live in Baker-street, Enfield. The prisoner was in my service about eighteen months—a man named Hummerston was employed there as a casual man—the prisoner asked me, before I went out on Sunday morning, that Hummerston might be there to assist him—the prisoner had no right to take any malt out of the hopper on that Sunday morning, it was not wanted; I saw him about eight o'clock on the Sunday morning, and again next day at the Magistrate's office.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. My house is next to Mr. Blake's brewery—on Sunday morning, 18th May, I was in one of my rooms between 10 and 11 o'clock—there is a field belonging to me at the back of my house—a person could get from Mr. Blake's back premises into that field—I saw in that field a man carrying a sack, with some heavy material in it, over his shoulder, and he was running gently—he had no business there—he was coming in a direction from Mr. Blake's, and going towards a lane running parallel with my house—I sent my servant after him and I went out at my front-door, and turned up the lane—I saw the same man with the prisoner in the lane with the sack—the prisoner had never been in the field; I asked the man what business he had to carry the sack across my field—they both re<lb></lb>plied that it did not belong to them, but to a man who had run across another field—I said, "I shall keep the sack and its contents myself, if you disown it"—one of them then said he should take it to his master, a farmer close by, Mr. Woodhouse—at that time, Mr. Woodhouse was coming down the lane, and then the other man said he should take it to his master, Mr. Knight—just as Mr. Woodhouse came up, I believe they saw him—they then reclaimed the sack; and as they did so, I challenged them with the contents of it, and one of them said it was sawdust—the prisoner then said, "It is nothing but pig's victuals"—he put his hand in, and pulled some out—it was ground malt, or barley—I said I should follow them no further, if they would give one their correct names—one of them gave me a name which I cannot recol<lb></lb>lect, it was not Hummerston nor Pennick; and the other gave the name of <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Challis—they went away together—I know Churchberry-field—there is a bridge there, called the river-bridge—I lost sight of the men after they left me, from the road winding; but I afterwards saw two men, whom I believe to be the same men, with the sack—as near as I could tell, they were near the bridge which is over the New-river.</p>

On Sunday morn<lb></lb>ing, 18th May, he called my attention to a man crossing the field with a sack—I went after him, out of the door facing the field—I had to cross the lawn first; when I got in the field the man was just getting over the palings—I went up to the palings, and I saw the man with the sack, and another person, I cannot say whether it was the prisoner—I asked the man with the sack what he did on our premises—he said he had not been there—I said, "Nonsense, I saw you carry this sack, and drop it here to this other person"—he said, "No such thing; the man who dropped this sack is gone round the corner"—at that moment my master came up and told me to go for a policeman, and I went away.</p>

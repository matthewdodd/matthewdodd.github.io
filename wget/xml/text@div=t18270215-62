On the 8th of February, about half-past two o'clock, I was in the kitchen with three other servants - I heard a ring at the front gate - I went up, and as I passed the pantry door, I saw a man getting out at the window into the area; I opened the door, and ran out, calling "Stop thief!" - he ran up the area steps, and through the front gate - I followed him down Lordship-lane about a quarter of a mile, but did not overtake him; other people were pursuing - I cannot say that I saw him stopped - I became so frightened, I went back when I saw two or three men following him - a strange basket was left behind in the pantry, with oranges in it - I had left this plate on a tray - and before I returned, it had been taken out of the basket, and re-laid on the tray.</p>
               <p>SUSAN GARLAND. I am wife of William Garland. I was in Mr. Lindo's kitchen about half-past two o'clock, and heard a noise in the pantry - the bell rang, and Westmacott went up - she gave an alarm; I went into the pantry - the window was wide open, and this basket on the floor - I found these spoons in it, with some oranges - I took the spoons out, and put them on the tray which they were taken from - it was Raine who rang the bell; I cannot say whether the area window had been fastened.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Friend, who lives next door to Mr. Lindo; I went there with a message - I rang the gate bell, then pushed the gate open - and when I got on the steps, I heard a noise in the area - I looked down, and saw a man getting out of the window - he ran into the street - Westmacott pursued him - I delivered my message, then walked up the street the same way as the man had run, and saw him coming down the lane with a constable; I was about four yards from him when he ran up the steps, and am certain he is the man, from his dress and appearance; he was dressed in a close jacket and blue trousers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This is a public street? A. Yes; he ran very fast; he had an apron on - I cannot say whether it was black or blue - I saw him getting out of the window, and thought he was a workman there - the servant followed him within a minute.</p>
               <p>F. WESTMACOTT re-examined. I had been in the pantry ten minutes before, and put these spoons on the tray; the window was then shut and hasped - I cannot say whether I left the pantry door shut - the window must have been opened from within - I did not see the prisoner when the constable brought him back, and cannot say he is the man - he had blue trousers on, and a light close jacket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you fasten the window? A. Yes; none of the glass was broken - there was seven of us in the house - there is an area door - I cannot say whether that was open or shut - it was not wide open, but it might not be latched.</p>

About two o'clock on the day in question, I passed a person in the street - he wore a waistcoat with sleeves, and dark trousers, and had a frail basket in his hand; the prisoner is that person - I saw him the night he was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You merely think the prisoner's features resemble the man? A. I really think him to be the man whom I passed in the street; he does not look exactly the same now as he did then.</p>

            . I live at Mrs. Snaith's, on Stamford-hill; my wife lives in Lordship-lane, about one hundred yards from Mr. Lindo's. On the 8th of February, between two and three o'clock, I was in Church-street, Newington - Westmacott ran after me, and told me to stop the man - I asked what man, as I could see none; she said he was gone down there, pointing down Red Lion-lane; when we got into the lane, she pointed to a man who was coming from behind the gardens of Lordship-terrace, apparently to see if any body was following him - the instant he saw me running, he turned back, and ran across the field - I followed, and Shepherd took him; he had been out of my sight a few minutes - I will not speak to his features; but by his dress certainly the prisoner is the man; I told him he was wanted in Church-street, and understood him to say, he was sure he could not be wanted - he was much agitated at the watch-house, and said he hoped the constable would do what he could for him.</p>

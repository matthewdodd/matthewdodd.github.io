Last Monday fe'nnight I assisted my man in bringing some beasts into the market in the morning, and, about nine o'clock, I sold Mr. Alexander several beasts, among which was the ox in question, for 24l. 10s; when I sold him, he was with thirty-four others in the drove; he was about eight years old, a fellow to six other beasts that had been all worked together for several years, single in harness, as horses draw.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a gamesome ox, likely to stray? - A. Quite the reverse; he was very much cut up by his journey; if he had been taken away, and had been at liberty, he would certainly have returned to his fellows, from his attachment to them, if he had been at a small distance. About half an hour after I had sold him, Mr. Alexander's drover came to fetch him, and the others from the drove, and he was missing. The prisoner, Slokam, is a master drover in <placeName id="t17960217-60-crimeloc351">Smithfield</placeName>

On missing the bullock, I turned round, and offered 40l. reward for the person that had taken him upon conviction.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen Slokam that morning? - A. Yes, and was insulted by him as usual; I used to employ him, and turned him off.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the Bear and Ragged Staff? - A. Yes; it is about one hundred and fifty yards from where I was, the other side of Smithfield. Slokam came to me about half an hour after the beast was missing, and said, I must either drop, or come down a Quid before I could, or then I might have him again, or some such expression; I perfectly understood his meaning; it is a cant name for a guinea in Smithfield; I took no notice to him, but I was determined to lose the bullock rather than give a guinea to reward villainy; in the afternoon, he asked me it I had found my bullock; I told him I had not; he said, if I would give him a guinea, he would endeavour to find him, having heard of a bullock at Hackney, and that he would saddle his horse immediately and go after him; I made him no reply, but went to Bow-street; I directed my book-keeper, whose name is Bovill, to go and offer Slokam half a guinea to look for the bullock; I went to the prisoner, Slokam's house, in Bowling alley, Cow-cross, and found him in bed; I offered him half a guinea to find it; he said he would do nothing for half a guinea, but for a guinea he would, I told him I wanted to go out of town early next morning; he said I might depend upon it he should be found, and I might go; I told him to take him to Mr.

            's, No. 120, Goswell-street; he said he had no doubt but he should bring him as soon as it was light; I told him, upon delivery to him, he would pay him a guinea; I lodged an information at Bow-street, and the next morning, about seven o'clock, the Bow-street officers took the two prisoners standing with the bullock at Mr. Smith's door, and they were taken to Bow-street and committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the same bullock that you had missed? - A. Yes; it had both my mark and Mr. Alexander's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You have known Slokam many years? - A. I suppose five years; he has been a drover all that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Alexander bought the bullock, you know; - A. Yes, for 24l. 10s.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a good bargain for you, you know? - A. The bullock was worth the money, and the money was worth him.</p>
               <p>Q. If it was Mr. Alexander's bullock that he had paid for, how came you to order him to be sent to Mr. Smith's, in Goswell-street? - A. Because I must have given Mr. Alexander back the money, and Mr. Smith had got a convenient place to put it in till the next market day, when I could sell it again, if Mr. Alexander did not chuse to take it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not usual to deliver the bullocks in Smithfield as soon as they are paid for? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you suppose Mr. Alexander would not take it? - A. I did not know, but my not delivering it to him the day he bought it, he might be obliged to buy another.</p>
               <p>Q. You found it at the very place it was ordered to be taken to? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether slokam was by when you offered 40l.? - A. I cannot say, but, in my own mind, I don't doubt it, because I made it as public as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. He said you must come down a Quid, that is a guinea? - A. Yes, before I should have it again, that after I had offered 40l. reward; I come up to Smithfield once a fortnight, generally from Christmas till after Lady-day; I am not very regular.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard of a stray bullock? - A. Yes, in that stile.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard of a stray bullock being recovered? - A. I have heard of their being recovered in that way, but I would scorn to recover any of mine in that way.</p>
               <p>Q.Is not the Bear and Ragged Staff a usual place for stray bullocks to be taken to? - A. It is very<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170098"></xptr>possible, but it is a house I never went to in my life; I have heard since that it is; it is a place, like many others round Smithfield, when butchers cannot pay for their beasts, they are locked up there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you understand any thing more than that he would use his endeavours to find him? - A. I understood that he knew very well where he was.</p>

               <p>Q.Where is this place of your's, is it up a yard or in the street? - A. Right up the yard backwards; it is a noted place for beasts; a long place that would hold fifty, I dare say.</p>
               <p>Q. Is is open over-head? - A. Yes; there are several doors to it; some that you can see through, and some that you cannot; some with pieces of board cut out for light to look through, or put your hand through.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see Slokam there? - A. No; I did not.</p>

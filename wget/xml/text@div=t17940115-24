               <p>Q. Was you sober? - I had got a little liquor, but not much.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it? - It was gone twelve at night. I never missed nothing at all, before four o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to bed? - Yes, I gave the girl that was in the room, Rebecca Carter, it was the servant girl, I understood her to be at that time; I gave her half a crown, two shillings for the bed, and to fetch me six-pence back; it might be nearly one o'clock; this was before I went to bed; then she fetched the sixpence, and it was not a good one, I would not have it, and she went out again; when she came back I was asleep with the person in bed, that slept along with me; we were both in bed together.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was this other person? it was a girl, she was in the room when I came in.</p>

               <p>Q. Before you went to bed, what had you done with your clothes? - I put my breeches under the clothes of the bed where I slept, and the coat and waistcoat on the bed. So I examined my breeches as soon as ever I awoke, and I found myself robbed; there were three dollars and a shilling taken out of them; I put them under my head, and I found them under the bed; and I examined the pocket-book, and nine guineas and a half were missing from there in gold; so I went and got an officer the next morning by nine o'clock, and took three of them into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen your money before you went to bed? - About half an hour before I went to bed, the gold was in a pocket-book, and the silver was in a breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this pocket-book? - In my coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen your money before you missed it? - At the very last house I was in, the sign of the Angel, Old Gravel-lane, one Mrs. Wilson keeps it. I saw it there about five o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to see your money there? - I had something to pay there, and I changed a guinea, and had just half a guinea, a shilling, and half a crown out of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you half a guinea? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many guineas had you left then? - Nine whole guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether you saw your dollars then? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to part with your dollars then? - I kept them for memorandums.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see your dollars at that time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you missed all this property, what did you do in consequence? - I went and applied to an officer, and he came and searched the room, and he found three guineas, and three dollars on the mantle-piece; the officers name is

             into bed, because she was in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Madden live in the same house? - Yes, she lived with Mrs. Johnson in the same house. Then I took a candle in, and put it on the table; she went in with me, and went to the bed-side, and took a few halfpence out of the waistcoat pocket, it was in the room where this gentleman slept.</p>
               <p>Q. He was sleeping with another woman, was not he? - Yes, but there were three beds in the room. And then she went, and put her hand into the gentleman's coat pocket, and took out a pocket-book. I cannot say for how many guineas she took out, I saw three guineas; then she went and took his breeches from under his head, from under his bolster; and then she had the three dollars, and three guineas in her hand; after that, she told me to stay in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. All this past in the room where this gentleman slept? - It did. I wanted to go out to the other house to Mrs. Johnson, and she told me to stop there; she left the room, and went into the next house, and I stopped in the room till she was gone; then I took the candle up, as I found she did not come back, to go to bed, and went out of the room, and locked the door on the outside, and went into the other house too; then when I went in to Mrs. Johnson's, she told me to go in, and go to bed; and I went into this room where this gentleman slept, and bolted the door with two bolts on the inside.

             did not lay in the room all night. In the morning when the gentleman awoke, about four o'clock, he found his breeches was gone from under his head; and when he found them, he said, he was ruined for ever, for he had no money in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner Madden, come into the room any more? - Yes, she came in the morning, and brought a candle for the gentleman to look for his money, about eight o'clock.

               <p>Q. Was any thing found afterwards? - No, nothing, but the three dollars, and the three guineas. I did not see the money found. I did not know the money was found till Mr. Riley told the Justice.</p>

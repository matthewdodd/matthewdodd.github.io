A gentleman came and took them at 15 s. per week. I cannot swear to him, but another was with him whom he said was his brother. The gentleman said he was a doctor, and attended the London Hospital. He said his brother was a seafaring man, and asked if I could allow him to come and spend an hour or two with him in the evening, as he had not seen him for a long time. I said I had no objection. They came about eleven o'clock in the morning, went away, and came again about five in the evening both together. My daughter let them in. They went into the parlour. Soon after a porter came with a parcel - they were both in the room then. I went into the room to the cupboard, and took a spoon out of a silver cream-jug, the watch hung over the chimney-piece then. I went down stairs leaving them in the parlour with the porter. In about ten minutes I head Pulaston, the porter, go out. I heard the door close to.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your daughter - A. She was down stairs with me. When Pulaston came back I opened the street door to him, he said he wanted the two gentlemen. I opened the parlour door and they were gone. I missed the property as stated in the indictment, which is worth 7 l. 17 s. Thompson was one of the men, I talked a great deal to him. He said he had been to the Mediterranean, the other said he was a doctor. I can swear positively to Thompson.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Do you live in the same house now - A. Yes. I did not see Thompson again till he was taken. He did not come till the evening, they then both came together.</p>

            . On the 28th of November, 1818, I took some tobacco for the prisoner Thompson, to the prosecutrix's house, he ordered it to be there by six o'clock. A little boy let me in and told me to go into the parlour where the prisoner Thompson, and the doctor sat together. I am sure Burke is the man who called himself the doctor. They were drinking grog. They told me I was half an hour too late, for the captain was gone to the Anchor-tavern to smoke his pipe. Thompson called himself the mate, and asked me for the bill and receipt, which I gave him. He asked me to take some rum which I did, and he wrote at the back of the bill</p>
               <p>"Please to pay the bearer, as I have received the tobacco." They sent me with a boy, who they called Jack, to the captain, who he said was in the parlour of the Anchor-tavern. Jack shewed me the parlour door and left me, saying the captain was there. They told me to enquire for Captain Thompson. I found no such person. I enquired at the bar - they did not know him. I went out, found the boy gone, ran as fast as I could to the house, and found the prisoners were gone, and the tobacco also. I had taken them forty pounds of tobacco. I did not see them again till they were apprehended.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who bought the tobacco - A. My master took the order, I am certain they are the men.</p>

            . The doctor came about eleven o'clock, and took the lodging, and said he had a brother who was a seafaring man, and he wished to spend his evenings with him. He went away. He came again about five o'clock with Thompson, and a boy whom they called the cabin-boy. They sat in the parlour smoking till the porter came with the tobacco. When he returned and asked for the captain, I went into the parlour and they were both gone with the boy, then I missed the plate, which was safe when they went into the room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you attend before Sir

            , the magistrate - A. Yes; I said I was not certain the doctor was the man who took the lodging, because he was so disfigured and dirty. I thought at the office that as my mother swore to the other, it was not necessary for me to say more. I am now certain it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120011"></xptr>him on seeing him now. I did not see the doctor till the second examination. I then said I was positively sure he was the man, but did not like to sware to him as my mother was not present.</p>
               <p>BURKE'S Defence. I was never in the house in my life, and never saw her daughter. When they came to identify me they said positively they had no knowledge of me. I was not committed on this charge, but for the tobacco, and had no idea of having to meet this charge. It is near two years ago. Mrs. Bond must certainly have a better opportunity of recollecting me than the porter.</p>
               <p>THOMPSON's Defence. I knew nothing of it. I was invited to the house by a doctor who was an acquaintance of mine. I left the house before he did, and knew nothing of the plate. It is more like a bad house than any thing else. That is the man (pointing to A. Seal), who persuaded her to swear to me.</p>

            . The prisoner, Thompson, ordered some tobacco of me on the 28th of March, 1818. It is not true that I persuaded the prosecutrix or her daughter to swear to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Did you hear the prosecutrix examined at the office - A. Yes; I understood her to say she could not swear to the doctor, but she believed he was the man. She swore to the man, and her daughter after looking at him, said she thought he was the man.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 25th of Aug., about half-past four o'clock, I was on duty near Bethnal-green, and saw the prisoners and a woman, the wife of one of them, in Manchester-street—William appeared very tipsy—he was able to walk—the others not so much, but all had been drinking—I saw him jostle his arm against a door—I then told Reuben, his brother, if he did not go home quietly I must take them to the station—I told the woman the same thing several times—I understand she is William's wife—they then went up to the next door, Pardoe's—William knocked with his hand at the knocker, and began kicking—Mr. Pardoe opened the window and desired me <hi rend="italic">to</hi> take them in charge—I said, "Yes, and you come down to the station with me to complain against them"—he then put down the window—I took hold of William to take him away—he immediately raised his hand with hit fist clenched, and struck me a very violent blow on the eye, which knocked me back about two yards from him—I then put on my rattle to spring it—he raised his hand to strike me again and ran away—I ran after him some distance, springing my rattle—Hussey came up—I said, "This man has struck me"—he was then standing against a door—we both ran down towards him—he then ran out to strike us again with his hands clenched—when he came very near us I drew my staff, and as I ran in towards him he was going to strike me—he caught the staff and wrenched it out of my hand—I was about a yard from Hussey, who was going to take him—he struck Hussey upon the forehead—he first attempted to strike him with the staff—the blow knocked him down on the road—he got up in a short time—I did: not see anything happen to him while on the ground—I kept springing my rattle, but in a moment William Bray was on the ground, and Hussey over him—William had my staff—I went to get it out of his hand but could not—Reuben then came behind, collared me, and dragged me from him—no policeman came—I remained there five or ten minutes springing my rattle—I then ran off to the next beat to find the policeman—Hussey's face was covered with blood.</p>

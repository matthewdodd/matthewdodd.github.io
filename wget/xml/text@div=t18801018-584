                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The first interval when I left it off was about 10 weeks, that was seven or eight months ago; after that I continued supplying him for three months, and then I gave it up for about 10 weeks to the best of my recollection—I think I once took some to his private house—I was not in the habit of taking spirits to any other person—I left my employment at 9 o'clock two weeks, and at 8 o'clock one week—I can't fix any time when I was at his house; I live at 61, Tothil Street, Old Ford—I forget my landlord's name—I never took him anything or gave him anything, nor has any one in my presence—he had nothing from Mr. Hill's with my knowledge—Durell's son has seen me there, and he has taken the stuff of me which I have left; he saw me plenty of times—I cannot fix the time, because it has been so often—I won't be sure, but I believe the son was there when I left the brandy and tent—I once saw Durell between Houndsditch and Aldgate pump when I was going to the West India Docks—he was alone, and I was alone; he took good care no one should be with him—I went alone with him to a public-house at the corner of the fourth turning on the left; I don't know the name of the house—we had never spoken, when he opened the conversation by saying "Can you get me anything?"—the police wrote to me, I think, last Thursday week, but I had made up my mind ever so long to tell this story—I won't swear whether I made my statement to the police before or after I was committed for trial, because I saw them both before and after—I was in Newgate when Mr. Hutt wrote out my statement—I made one statement about a week after the other—I have never seen either of those statements since—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I made no copy—I may have thought over my conversation with Durell once or twice—I never said to him that I had a good master, and how could he suggest to me to rob him—it never occurred to me—I was 15 or 18 months in my master's employ—my wages were 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week; I am single.</p>

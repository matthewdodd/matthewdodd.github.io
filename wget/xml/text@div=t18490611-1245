                  </hi>. I am a letter-carrier, employed at the Charing-cross Branch Post-office. On 6th June, about thirteen minutes past six o'clock, I went down into the vaults underneath the building, where there is a cistern that supplies the water-closet, behind a partition of which I had hid my pipe, as we are not allowed to smoke; when I put my hand up to get my pipe, I felt a paper stuck behind the partition, which turned out to be this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was then sealed up, but has been opened since—it was im<lb></lb>possible for any one to see it unless going to the spot for something—it appeared to contain coin, and I put it back again—I went up to the sorting-office, and communicated what 1 bad seen to Mr. Heath, the inspector on duty—he went down with me to the place, and he took possession of the letter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of letter-carriers at the Charing-cross Branch-office—the prisoner has been a letter-carrier at that office four or five months—about six o'clock on the evening of 6th June, I received a commu<lb></lb>nication from Lawrence, in consequence of which I accompanied him to one of the area vaults, I put my hand behind the partition of the cistern, and found this letter there, which appeared to contain money—I took it up stairs—I then sent for William Benning, the porter, and after I had spoken to him returned with him down stairs, and placed the letter in the place I had found it—about half-past seven I went to the vault, and Benning said to me in the prisoner's presence, "I have caught him in the fact, and he has thrown the letter into the cistern"—the prisoner made no answer—Benning brought a candle, and I saw him take the same letter from the cistern that I had seen in the vault—the seal had not been broken—I afterwards sent Benning with the prisoner to the chief office, St. Martin's-le-Grand—the letter bears the mark of the chief office, and the hour when it? was sent out, four o'clock, June 6—in its regular course it would go from the chief office to the Charing-cross office, and would arrive there about eighteen or twenty minutes past four—the prisoner was then on duty there—it was part of his duty to sort the letters which came there from the principal office—if the letter was potted in Oxford-street at two, or after two, it would leave there at three for the chief office, and would leave there stamped "Four o'clock"—it was not in the prisoner's delivery—(<hi rend="italic">the letter was directed to "Robert Elder, Fusileer Guards, Vauxhall Hospital"</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the presidents of the London district office, at the chief office. On the evening of 6th June tie prisoner was brought to me by Benning, who delivered to me a letter, and, in consequence of what he told me, I asked the prisoner what explanation he had to give—he said he did not place the letter there in the first instance, that he went down to the water-closet about four o'clock, saw a piece of paper through the partition of the cistern, put his hand there, and found it to be a letter, that he felt it, and noticed that it contained money, and he put it back for an improper purpose, and when he came in at six, he went down for it, as he intended stealing it, and threw it into the cistern—I then gave his into Peak's custody, and gave him the letter—I wrote down what he said.</p>

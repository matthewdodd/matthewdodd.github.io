                  </hi>. I live at Pierrepoint Row, Wandsworth—on Sunday night, 5th April, towards 11 o'clock, I was drinking at the Princess of Wales public house—one man was making a disturbance, and he was put out by</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186806080089"></xptr>
               <p>the potman—he was the only one put out—the landlord afterwards told us it was time to go, and we all went out—I was talking to Joseph Neale, and as I got to the top of the Jew's Road an elderly gentleman said, "Good night"—I said, "Good night," and as I turned round a man came up, shoved his hand to my side, and ran towards York Road, Battersea, saying, "Come on"—another one ran with him, and the elderly gentlemen stopped—I then felt a pain in my side, rubbed it, and found my entrails out in my hand—I was in severe pain for a good while—I was laid up for seven weeks—I had had a little beer, but was quite sensible—I cannot swear to the prisoner, it was done in a moment, and I only saw the man's back—I had not quarrelled with anyone.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was there any disturbance in the house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was a quarrel, but no disturbance connected with me—my opinion is that it was a taller man than the prisoner—I have no recollection of seeing the prisoner that evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waterman, of 2, Catherine Terrace, York Road, Wandsworth—I had been in the public-house, and when I was opposite the Jew's Road I saw Neale and Finnigan, eight or nine yards from me—I saw the prisoner draw a knife or a dagger out of his pocket, stab it with force into Finnigan's side, and run away, and another man with him—Finnigan called out, "I am stabbed,"—I undid his trousers, found blood there, and assisted him—a surgeon was called—I was sober—I swear it was the prisoner who did it—it was Betteridge who was put out of the public-house.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I live at Chapel House, Lower North Street, Wands<lb></lb>worth—I was with Futer, and saw the prisoner strike Finnigan with some weapon, and then run away, and another man with him—I am sure it was the prisoner—I saw something glitter, and Finnigan said, "I am stabbed"—I had not been in the public-house—the prisoner and two more men came out of the public-house before Finnigan—I was about two yards from Finnigan when he was stabbed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How many yards do you think you are from the prisoner now? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About five—he was so much altered on 12th May that I could not swear to him—I have said "I did not know the prisoner before, I cannot be on my oath that the prisoner is the man, I have seen so many more like him"—that is true, he was so much altered—he is not altered now—I have said there were two men with the prisoner, Betteridge is one, and the knife was in the hand of the one who ran away—I swear now that the knife was in the prisoner's hand, although I could not swear it when my memory was fresher.</p>

               <p>him, but I knew him when I saw him—Futer said, "That is the man, but he had some hair on his chin"—I said to the prisoner, "Had you any hair on your chin on Sunday?"—he said, "Yes, I had, and I was in Wandsworth on Sunday"—I had told him the charge before that, and he said, "I am innocent, I never used a knife or dagger in my life, I shaved off my hair to cool it"—I took him in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Battersea Rise—I saw Finnigan in the Wandsworth and Clapham Union, on the morning of 6th April—he had a punctured wound in his belly, such as might have been done with a knife or a dagger—it was near the right groin, three-quarters of an inch long, from which part of the bowels protruded—I had to enlarge the wound to return the bowel—I then strapped him up, and he is quite well now—I considered him in danger—he was under my care for a good while.</p>

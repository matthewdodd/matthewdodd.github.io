                  </hi>. I am the usher in the Second Court at the Middlesex Sessions—I was present when William Bolton was put on his trial upon the indictment which has been produced—the prisoner was a witness on his behalf—I administered the oath to her in the usual form—a pencil-case and two copper coins were produced, and shown to her—she said they belonged to the prisoner, that she had given them to him—she was asked whether they belonged to Buckingham, and she said "No"—she said that the pair of trousers which Bolton had got on she had given him, before she had had time to look at them—she said they were her husband's property, and she had given them to Bolton—she was asked whether they belonged to Buck<lb></lb>ingham, and she said "No"—she was asked as to her relations with the prisoner, and she said he was only a lodger—she was repeatedly asked whether she lived with him as man and wife, and she denied it—she repeated on more than one occasion that the different articles were the property of Bolton, which had been given by her to him—I understood that she said she had given the trousers to Bolton, not that Buckingham had given them to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coachman—in July I was living at 4, Abbey Garden Mews—I knew William Bolton, and had employed him occasionally—I left town on 26th July with my horses by the Great Western Railway; Bolton knew of my going—my wife joined me on 29th July—when I left town, I left in the place where I was residing a pair of trousers, and two coins and a pencil-case were safe in my wife's work-box—I returned on 6th September, and missed those articles as well as others—I next saw those things on the 8th, when I gave Bolton into custody, and he was searched at the station—I saw him searched, tad saw several coins taken from his pockets, out of which were two which I identified, and the pencil-case—next morning at the Police Court I saw that he was wearing my trousers—I identified the articles—the pencil-case was taken from Bolton when he was searched—my wife had had the coins previous to my marrying her, and we had been married fifteen years—she has had them all that time—she had the pencil-case at the time I was married, and there was a little toothpick, and that was not found—I had had the trousers about eighteen months I should think—I never gave them to Bolton—I gave him a light suit which he had at the time he was apprehended; but these I did not give him, neither had he any right to take them away—I was present when Bolton was tried before Mr. Barrow, and when the prisoner gave evidence—she was at the Police Court on both occasions, but she did not give evidence there—before Bolton was sent for trial he pleaded guilty, and wished the Magistrate to settle it—the prisoner was there—I listened attentively to what she was saying on the trial, and I heard her give evidence about the pencil-case—to the best of my belief, she said that some friend had given. it to her husband, but who that friend was she could not exactly account for, and the coins were the same, but how she got them he could not say; she said she gave them to Bolton, and he had had them about six weeks at that time—she said the trousers were her husband's, I believe, and she had altered them; I would not say exactly what she said about that—she said they were hers, I believe—I don't think she looked at them before she gave evidence upon them, she looked at the prisoner, but in the position he was, she could not see what trousers they were—she said that Bolton was merely a lodger—it was put to her repeatedly, and she said she had no more interest in him only as a lodger—after the trial and Bolton's conviction she was ordered into custody.</p>

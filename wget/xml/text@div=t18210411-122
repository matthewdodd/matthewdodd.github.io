I met the prisoner, and went home with her to her house, as she called it. I gave her half-a-crown for the lodging - she left the room after I got into bed, and I saw no more of her. I fell asleep and awoke about an hour afterwards - when she came up, and told me to turn out for her husband had come up from Gravesend; she insisted on my getting up - I got up, went to my pantaloons, and missed 13 s. out of the pocket. I looked in my pocket-book and missed a 1 l. note out of it - she denied taking it - I asked her name, she said it was

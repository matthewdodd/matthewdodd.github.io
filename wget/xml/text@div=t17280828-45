               <p>The Prosecutor depos'd (by an Interpreter) That he having lost his Pocket-Book, was inquiring for it at a House where the Prisoner was, and that they giving him some Encouragement, he called for Punch to make them drink, that presently the Prisoner took an Opportunity to pick his Pocket, and he finding his Money gone, charg'd her with it, when she jump'd out of the Window; and being afterwards taken and carried to the Round-house, he offered her a Guineas to let him have his Seal again, which was likewise taken from him at the same Time as his Money was; this, he said, he did to trap her, that he might fix the Fact upon her by some Evidence and accordingly his Scheme had the desired Effect, for she produced the Seal, and tho' she afterwards denied receiving a Guinea on such Account, yet they found the Guineas upon her in her Hair. It further appeared, that one Harvey, whom one of the Witnesses was so hardy as to call the Bawd of the House, said, they would live well with the Money.</p>
               <p>She said in her Defence, That the Prisoner wanted to lie with her, and she refusing him, he began to Curse and Swear at her, and to avoid his Insults she got out of the Window; but this Artifice had but little Effect, for it appear'd she could not speak his Language (French) nor could he speak English.

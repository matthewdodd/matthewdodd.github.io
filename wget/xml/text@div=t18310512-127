               <p>WILLIAM STEVENS. I was in <placeName id="t18310512-127-crimeloc749">James-street, Covent-garden</placeName>

               <p>"Give me my watch;" she said she had not got it - I held her till the officer came; the watch had a gold seal and key to it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He was very tipsy, and he gave it to me as I was coming by the Piazza, to go to a brothel with him. Witness. No, I did not - I was not so tipsy but I knew what I was doing.</p>
               <p>JOHN MAGRATH. I am a Police-constable. I came up to the assistance of the prosecutor, at a quarter-past nine o'clock - I took the prisoner, and found this watch, seal, and key in her bosom.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. We walked from the corner to James-street - we met two females, and he pushed up against a little girl, and took hold of her in a very indecent manner; he had given me the watch, and we were going to a house, where I was to leave it all night - he said he could get it in the morning.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM STEVENS. I did no such thing.</p>
               <p>JOHN MAGRATH. No one told me to feel in her bosom for the watch; a little girl came to Bow-street, and gave her evidence that the prosecutor gave the prisoner leave to search him for money - she gave that evidence the first day, and the case was remanded, but she did not come again; the prosecutor was the worse for liquor, but he had hold of the prisoner, and some persons said he had kept her ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He gave me the watch to leave at the Crown, and said he had no money; I said, "I don't like to go with a gentleman who has no money - let me search you," and he said I might.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM STRVRNS. Though I said I had no money, I am certain I did not use the expression that she might search me; she did not say what she asked me for money for, but I suppose it was to go with her.</p>

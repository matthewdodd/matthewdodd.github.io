                  </hi> I am servant to Mr. James Green, a publican, of Islington. On Saturday night, the 19th of Dec., about half-past eleven o'clock, the prisoner came to the kitchen door—I put my beer on the tap-room room hog to warm—the prisoner said, "Some one has drank your beer"—I said I did not care, I could get more—the parlour bell rang—I went, and it was for half a pint of ale—I took it in, and the prisoner went into the</p>

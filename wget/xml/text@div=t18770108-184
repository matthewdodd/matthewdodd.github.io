                  </hi>. I live at 12, Bell Court, Gray's Inn Road—the prisoner lives in the second floor of the same house—on 23rd December between 11 and 12 o'clock I heard her coming downstairs using violent words and saying that she would do for me; that she had had six months but did not care for that, she would have my b——life—then she came into my room with a long-bladed knife in one hand and a piece of iron in the other—she struck me in the forehead, and cut my finger, and bit my middle finger—I fell on the floor and lay in a quantity of blood—I went to the hospital—I had not been drinking—my wounds are not well—I have lived in the house three years—the prisoner has been quarrelsome about six months—she has been imprisoned for six months—I did not strike her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at the Royal Free Hospital—on Sunday morning, 24th December, about 4.30 a.m., the last witness came to the hospital—she was suffering from an incised wound over the right side of the forehead, a quarter of an inch long, and half an inch deep, leading down to the bone, which was slightly damaged—if the wound had gone on badly it would have been dangerous—when the bone is injured it is more likely to be dangerous—a fist could not cause it; a table knife would—she left the hospital of her own accord—I saw her ten days since, the wound had nearly healed; it only required a little lint on it—a pail could not cause the wound unless she fell on the edge of it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> On Saturday night I was coming upstairs; the complainant was the worse for liquor, and we had words and then blows, and she went away very drunk. She gave me a dreadful bite, and on Sunday morning I found her under my bedstead. I called to Mr. Edwards and said "Why don't you let her go downstairs." She went downstairs and I saw no more of her till 8 o'clock on Saturday.</p>

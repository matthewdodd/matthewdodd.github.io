            . I keep the Basing-house. On the 30th of October I saw the prosecutor there - I remonstrated with the coachman for leaving him, and desired a person to assist him, as he was too drunk to be taken off the coach; I recollect his sending for the coach - I did not hear him charge any one with robbing him; Wilson changed a 5s. piece with me, but I think it was before the coach was sent for - I understand it was for 1s. to pay for the coach, and 4d. for a quartern of gin for fetching it; I suppose this was in allusion to a circumstance that occurred the night before, when a man fetched a coach, and the person it was got for had walked off, and the man was taken to the watch-house for fetching it, because he had not the 1s. to pay for it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you known Wilson before? A. I had frequently employed him, and always thought him honest - he has frequently taken out parcels; the gin was had - I do not know whether the prosecutor had any of it; after the prisoner had left the house I heard something fall, and went into the tap-room - I saw the prosecutor laying on the floor; it did appear by the marks on his face, as if he had fallen off the coach - he did not complain to me that he had been robbed; it was from Sanctuary's information that I thought it my duty to have the Policeman, and to send him out of the house - I should say he was as drunk as a man could be.</p>

            . I came up with my coach, and saw the prosecutor very tipsy - I assisted him on my coach; I had great difficulty in getting him up, and should not have taken him but for Mr. Wood; his conduct was very bad, and very annoying to a female on the coach- I told him to be a little circumspect or I would order him off the coach; he had paid his fare 1s. 6d. - he offered 1s. first; he was assisted off the coach, but he was not on the ground long before he sat down on it - I set him down at the Basing-house, as he was so tipsy I thought there would be some danger in getting him over the stones - he had a bundle.</p>

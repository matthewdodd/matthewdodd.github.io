            . I am in the service of Mr. Were. On the 22d of October, between five and six o'clock in the evening, this cheese was about two yards within the shop - I had seen it safe about two minutes before it was taken - I saw the prisoner take it; he sat down on the iron-railing under the window - I saw him reaching the cheese with his left arm; he got it on his right thigh, and under his right arm, and ran off with it - I went after him, and never lost sight of him - I stopped him against Botolph-alley with it under his arm.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was I not close under the window when you saw me, and I had fallen down on the cheese? A. No, that is impossible.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Monday evening I had been to Walworth, to see my sister, who is in service; a cart was loading at the warehouse, and the ropes were on the pavement; there is a cellar window, which leads into the warehouse - I fell over the ropes against the cheeses, which were close to the window; it fell off the step - I was just taking it up to put it on the pile; this man came and collared me, and said, "I have just caught you at it"- I was not in Botolph-alley.</p>

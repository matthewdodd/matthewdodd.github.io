                  </hi>. I am a silk-manufacturer, and live in Phoenix-street, Spitalfields. On the 13th of July my house caught fire, and I lost a great deal of silk fringe, which I have reason to believe was not burnt, as the fire never reached the room it was in—there were a great many people about—I received information, and went with the officer to No. 8, Quaker-street, where the prisoner lives—nothing was found there; but one of my work<lb></lb>men was there, who has since absconded—the prisoner was asked if he had sold any fringe—he said "No"—I asked if he had manufactured such fringe as this—he said "No"—I examined some fringe which I knew to be my manufacture—I had not sold any like this.</p>

                  </hi>. On the Wednesday after the fire, which had been on the Saturday night, I was at the Phoenix public-house—the prisoner came to me with these goods in a flag basket—he called me out, and asked me if I could sell them for him—he said he came honestly by them, and no harm would come of them, as he received them from a man who came out of the country—he said the goods were worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said I could not tell the price, as I had not made or sold any; but if he would go with me to a man, he would tell me the price—we went to Loggerhead-lane—in going along, he gave me the basket—I went to Mr. Bunce, and told him the mass wanted 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them—he said he would give 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—I left the goods—I went out and asked the prisoner—he said, "Do you think the money is sure?"—I said "Yes"—I went back, and was to go at two o'clock for the money—I did not go at two o'clock, but went between four and five o'clock—I met the prisoner, and we went to Mr. Bunce's—I left him out<lb></lb>side—Mr. Bunce bought the goods, and gave me one sovereign and two half-sovereigns, which I gave to the prisoner—Mr. Bunce said, "Go and ask him if this money will do"—I cannot say if those produced are thi goods I sold, because I did not take particular notice of them—after I had given the money to the prisoner, he said, "Go and ask Mr. Bunce if such a thing as <hi rend="italic">bolio</hi> will do?"—I did so, and was to go again in the morning.</p>

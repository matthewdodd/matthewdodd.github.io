               <p>I am servant to Mr. Graham, of Duke-street, Saint James's; I met the prosecutor on the road, he said he had been robbed, and he begged my master and me to ride on; and we did, and after we had rode some space of ground we overtook the prisoner; Mr. Raynes described them as two soldiers in regimentals; I dismounted and seized the prisoner; I came up with the prisoner about three minutes after I had spoke to the prosecutor; I only saw this prisoner.</p>
               <p>Had this prisoner any weapon with him? - No, I never saw any.</p>
               <p>Was this man searched? - Yes, at the turnpike.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He was not regularly searched at the watch-house; one of Sir Sampson's men produced a stick, but in fact, I did not believe it to be one of the sticks.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I heard a noise in the road, and I looked over the wall to see what was the matter; I was in the park, and got over the wall and stood in the road, and they took me; I have no friends in town.</p>
               <p>Nobody from your own regiment nor your company? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Jury to prosecutor. Had you lost sight of him? - I had lost sight of him certainly.</p>
               <p>Was any of your property found upon him? - Not on this man, there was another man escaped.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There were three other soldiers came by.</p>
               <p>Court to Woodcock. Were there any other soldiers came by? - I saw no other but the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The other witness said he saw the other soldier.</p>
               <p>Court to Fisher. Did you own you saw the other soldier upon the road at that time? - No, I did not see any body at all on that side of the road.</p>
               <p>Did you see any body in regimentals on the road, within five or ten minutes? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you ever say you did? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Yes, my Lord, he did say so.</p>
               <p>Court to Fisher. Did you see two men together? - Yes, I did when the horse was standing, then I saw them about three or four yards distance; he rode on the pathway, and I thought he had taken the other; I never saw the other when he went off; I saw him run before me; I only saw them men and nobody going up that side of the road; I was in the middle of the road, and there were some people walking on the other side of the road, but nobody coming towards the turnpike.</p>

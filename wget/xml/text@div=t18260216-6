            . I am an officer. I searched the basket and found a bag at the bottom of it, containing a chisel and screw-driver, which I applied to some boxes which were broken open at this house - they exactly tallied with the marks - there was also a dark lantern, phosphorus box, and matches, in the basket.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am a stranger in London. I met a man in Smithfield who asked me to meet him at this place in the road, and take the property for him to his vessel at London-bridge - I accordingly took it - the watchman asked what I had got there - I put the basket down, and said I must meet the man at London-bridge by half-past seven o'clock.</p>

            . - Mr. Pitcairn. Were you in the service of the prisoner in December 1805. - A. Yes, as chamberlain.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been in his service in December 1805. - A. I was nearly three years in his service then.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you chamberlain in 1803. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you leave him. - A. I have left him about three months.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember on the 29th of December 1805 any fire happening. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you when the fire broke out. - A. I was at a friend's house in Fleet-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you leave the Swan on that day the fire broke out. - A. I think between one and two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first hear that the fire broke out. - A. About six in the evening, the chambermaid sent her son to me; she knew where I was gone, she sent to me, to let me know the house was a fire; I took my hat and came as fast as it was possible the boy could go with me. When I returned I found the fire at the extremity of the building, called the wood-room.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned did you see your master. - A. I saw him in the passage when I came in.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he doing. - A. I do not know that he was doing any thing particular. I think I said to him, sir, where is the fire, he said it is in the wood-room; I went up immediately to my own room, I threw off my coat, I went up the gallery stairs, I took a bucket or a pitcher of water with me; when I came to the top of the building, the fire was flaming along that passage where the chimney was; I found it was of no use throwing the water down on that passage; I came down immediately, I saw Mr. Williams in the passage; when I came down again, he says to me, the fire is very bad, you had better take care of your things; I went up into my own room, and packed up what belonged to me.</p>
               <p>Court. Was your room distant to where this fire was. - A. About one hundred feet distance. I took my things to the Castle in Queen-street; I came back and assisted the chambermaid, I took her things to the coach office. I then assisted in getting Mr. William's beds and things out of the rooms; I took them into the coach office; I took the luggage which gentlemen had left out of the store-room, and put them in the coach office; it is attached together under one roof; but some distance from the wood-garret.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pitcairn. What time was this fire in the wood garret extinguished. - A. I suppose it was completely out between ten and eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it got under. - A. In an hour and a half or two hours; the roof fell in, and it burried the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after this fire was extinguished did you perceive any other fire. - A. About eleven o'clock; I was standing opposite a small stair case, direct opposite the bar accompting house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that after the fire in the garret was extinguished. - A. A very little while; it was a little after eleven when I was standing in that situation.</p>
               <p>Q. When you was standing in that situation, what did you see. - A. It appeared to me there was some smoke coming down that stair case, and there was a candle and candlestick which stood in the dish larder, within about a yard of the stair case; I took the candle and went up stairs, I thought there appeared to be a great deal of smoke coming down there; I concluded that there must be a fire about that spot; I looked in the lower rooms, I found all was perfectly safe; then I went into the second flight, which was four rooms, 27, 28, 29, and 30; I opened the room door, No. 30, I saw Mr. Williams in No. 30, his back was towards me when I went into the room, and the window was a little pushed up.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any light with him. - A. No, he had none; the door was shut, I opened the door.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any light of any lamp, or candle, or fire burning, so as to light the room. - A. No, it was a back room, it was perfectly dark; there was a great deal of smoke in the room where he was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pitcairn. You say you saw Mr. Williams there, describe the manner you saw him there. - A. I saw Mr. Williams there; I will not swear whether he was sitting or standing, his back was towards me; I said as I went into the room, who is here, I saw it was Mr. Williams. I said, sir, here is a great deal of smoke here; he said all is very safe, go and get something to drink; I said sir I will throw the windows up and let the smoke out. Mr. Williams replied I have opened the windows myself; I did not notice that, I opened the window of the room adjoining 29; Mr. Williams was in No. 30, that window was a little open; there was a little smoke in No. 29; I then went into No. 28, there was a little smoke there; in that room there are three panes of glass that pull down; I pulled them down myself; then I went to No. 27; when I opened the door, the flames rushed out immediately; the flames came out so rapid, that I was obliged to drop on the ground to prevent myself from being burned. I went down immediately, and gave the alarm to the firemen that No. 27 was on fire, and they came up in the course of a minute or two.</p>
               <p>Q. The firemen were in the house, and several engines there when you discovered this fire in No. 27. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to your master. - A. No; I did not see him when I came up again; the foreman of the Sun fire office came up stairs, and the first thing they did, they pulled the bestead to pieces, threw water over the room, and got the fire under:</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180704080052"></xptr> Q. After the fire had been extinguished in this room had you any opportunity of observing the state of it. - A. Yes, I saw that every thing was burned to pieces, and a candlestick was found under the bed; the fireman of the Sun fire office brought it out of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the candlestick found under the bed. A. No, I saw the candlestick brought out of the room; the fireman said he had taken it from under the bed; I did not see him. Some little time after that fire was extinguished I saw my master in the passage walking about; he said nothing to me, nor did he make any enquiry about that fire.</p>
               <p>Q. This was the fire in No. 27. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you discover any other fire. A. There were several more discovered after that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what became of your master after this fire in No. 27. - A. I do not know: I saw him about some time after in the passage; he came to me, and desired me not to put any body to sleep on that side of the house. There was another fire at No. 16, the top gallery on the right hand as you go up the staircase, the same side as No. 27, and separated by a brick wall; that fire was discovered near three o'clock in the morning. Mr. Williams came to me about half past one, he said if any thing should happen, I am going to bed at No. 62, you come there to me. After he went to bed the firemen gave the alarm that the top gallery was on fire at No. 16.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was this after your master had gone to bed. - A. I suppose about an hour; I went up first with the firemen to see where it was, and at the top room, No. 16, the fire was flowing out of the room over the doorway; it is a thin partition over the door, and it is a narrow passage; the door was shut to, the firemen split the door open to let the fire out; they played in water upon the room and put the fire out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you in consequence of what your master had told you alarm him. - A. I did, I knocked at No. 62, I told him the top gallery was on fire, No. 16; he came out immediately, whether he had his clothes on or off I cannot say; he came out in the passage. I did not observe any thing particular in his manner at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of seeing this room, No. 16, after the fire was extinguished. - A. Yes; No. 98, which was a room adjoining to 16, it appeared as if there was a large hole through, which I thought the fire came from 98; I found every thing in 16 burnt, the two beds, bedsteads, and the clothes, and it burnt through the ceiling into the coffee room.</p>
               <p>Court. You say you thought the fire came from 98, was it on fire. - A. Part of the partition was on fire, a large place was burnt through.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any other part of 98 burnt. - A. Not any.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pitcairn. After this fire had been extinguished, did you see any thing of the prisoner. - A. Yes, I saw Mr. Williams after the fire at 16 and 98 was extinguished, several times in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any enquiry respecting this fire. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner again. - A. About four o'clock in the morning; the chambermaid Simpson, and me, were drinking a cup of tea in the chamberlain's room; it is very near to the bar, and faomg it on the same passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were there. - A. Mrs. Simpson, the chambermaid, Mr. Tourzey, and the cook and myself; while we were drinking tea Mr. Williams came past with a candlestick and candle in his hand, he says why do not you go and get yourself something to drink; the chambermaid and myself made reply, we did not want any thing, we were drinking of tea; Mr. Williams passed us and went up a flight of stairs that led to No. 66, 67, and 69; in about ten minntes afterwards Simpson and myself went up stairs, and followed him to see if every thing was safe; it was expected that he was going to do some mischief.</p>
               <p>Court. Some suspicion in your mind led you to go there. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You went up where he had gone with the candle and candlestick. - A. We did; I looked in room 69, I found every thing perfectly safe, and 67 every thing was safe; I then went to 66, every thing was safe there; in the passage opposite there is a cupboard, it formerly was a water closet.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pitcairn. Is there any chimney in it. - A. None at all; it had been fitted up by Mr. Williams to put fruit in to keep it from freezing; at that time there was nothing in it, it had been emptied a long time. When I opened the door, Simpson said, good God, Triggey, here's fire; there were two shelves in the cupboard, the lower shelf was all in a blaze, it was totally alight. It appeared to me by the fragments that were left, that there had been some paper there; there were some of the little pieces of the paper in the cupboard, and it appeared as if they had flew about; the paper was all burnt, there was the cinders of the paper left, and a quantity of ashes. On the upper shelf, which was of the same size, there was a decanter with brandy in it; I think it was a pint one. 
               <persName id="t18070408-90-person848">Simpson</persName>
             the chambermaid took it from the shelf herself.</p>
               <p>Q. How much of the shelf was burnt. - A. The lower shelf was burnt; the upper shelf was not, it was very hot. but not burned.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there was brandy in this decanter, how do you know it was brandy. - A. I tasted it.</p>
               <p>Q. You put this fire out. - A. Yes, there was a mahogany flap to a table and green baize in this cupboard; I took the green baize, rolled it up, and put the fire out with it; they both were placed against the fire. In about a minute after I had put the fire out, I saw Mr. Williams coming from the Sun tavern room, he was coming towards us (the tavern rooms have all distinct names); as he came towards us he said I have put that fire out; I told him that he had not put it out, we had put it out, meaning the chambermaid and myself; he made no reply, but went away.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see no more of him after that time. - A. No, I heard he had gone to bed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pitcairn. When did any person come from the Sun fire office after this, and make any enquiry. - A. Mr. Hall came in a few days after this.</p>
               <p>Q. About the time of Mr. Hall's coming, or previous to it, did any conversation pass between you and the prisoner on the subject. - A. Yes; previous to Mr. Hall's coming, Mr. Williams slept at Islington after the fire, he used to come home in the morning, I saw him in the passage, I told him there had been a gentleman enquiring if I knew any thing concerning the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that gentleman. - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there been a gentleman previous to Mr. Hall coming. - A. Yes; I went into the parlour and told Mr. Williams of it, a day or two after the fire: I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180704080053"></xptr> told him I would point out the gentleman to him when I saw him again; I said sir, if the fire office knew of the fire in the closet opposite 66, your insurance would not be worth a farthing; he told me to knock the boards down and put them out of the way. That was all that passed at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that you knocked them down. - A. I did; I put them away in the store room for some time, and put trunks upon them; after the storeroom was cleared of the luggage, I took the boards out and put them under a large dresser where we put foul clothes in in the chamberlain's room; I nailed a skirting board before them, so that they were completely out of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you find the boards again. - A. Mr Nalder, the city marshall found them; he knocked the skirting board down and took the boards from under the dresser, and soon after this Mr. Hall from the Sun fire office came.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after the fire was this. - A. Some few days.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention any circumstance of the fire in the closet opposite 66. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention any circumstance of finding your master in room No. 30. - A. I did not, and the reason why I did not mention it, Mr. Williams came up to me in our own room, I believe it was the day Mr. Hall came; before Mr. Hall examined me, he desired us to say if we were asked, that he made all enquiry respecting the fire that he could. The fact is, he never did to me neither at the fire, nor any other time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after this did you continue in Mr. Williams' service. - A. I left him near five or six months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the cause of your leaving him. - A. A dispute between Mrs. Williams and my wife respecting a gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not mention the circumstance of the fire in the water closet while you lived with him. - A. I did not; the first time I gave the information, was to Mr. Wilson the coach-proprietor, and the Sun fire office, a fortnight after I left the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the Sun fire office. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant Best. You came to the situation of chamberlain in 1803. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you been before. - A. I had been a labourer in the India house seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. What situation are you in now. - A. A publican.</p>
               <p>Q. You left Mr. Williams in consequence of a dispute that took place between Mrs. Williams and your wife. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon that dispute you were very willing to leave that situation as chamberlain. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not like to stay in a family that you could not live easy and comfortable, you are quite sure that you did not desire to stay. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor to offer any terms for which you would stay, nor make any threats in case you were to be turned away. - A. No, I made no threats.</p>
               <p>Q. You went most willingly away. - A. No, not till my books were settled.</p>
               <p>Q. The first person you disclosed it to was the coach-proprietor. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. I should be glad to know whether Mr. Wilson is the owner of the house. - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any idea of taking this house yourself - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean to swear that. - A. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not there when the fire broke out, you came in about six o'clock in the evening. - A. A little after six.</p>
               <p>Q. In what room did the fire begin. - A. It was in a wood room where the fire began.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a great deal of dry wood in that room. A. All sorts of wood, it was mixed wood.</p>
               <p>Q. There was some very dry. - A. I do not know that; it was not my business to examine it; there was old chairs and wood of every description almost.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any wood kept in that room for the purpose of firing. - A. It was kept for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether you do not know that there was dry wood there. - A. It was not my business to know that, it did not concern me, I concerned myself only with the beds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not a great many people make enquiry that night how this fire happened. - A. Not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Endeavour to recollect yourself. - A. They could only judge by the same as I did myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I should like to know your judgment of it. A. I gave my judgment that it was wilfully done.</p>
               <p>Q. And that you gave that night. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And you gave no other judgment that night. - A. Not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of King Thorn. - A. I do not know any such person; I know Mr. Thorn of the Freemason's tavern.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you never a potboy to Mr. Thorn that kept a public house, to Mr.

               <p>Q. Did you never say so to him. - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Waterhouse is a gentleman that has a large concern, he is the owner of the horses that are kept at this house. - A. I believe he is.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether you did not say to Mr. Water-house, with respect to the other fires, that they happened through the carelessness of the other servants moving<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180704080054"></xptr> the goods, and leaving the candles in the rooms. - A. I do not know that I did; I was desired by Mr. Williams to say many things.</p>
               <p>Q. Your opinion was the direct reverse to this; you think you never could have said this. - A. My opinion was averse to this, I had my doubts upon me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that the next morning after this fire happened, you were examined by the officers of the Sun fire office, and that you never hinted to him that these places were set fire to by any body. - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say to him that they happened by accident in your judgment. - A. I do not know but that I might.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say that the account you had given to the Sun fire office was a true account. - A. I said so to Mr. Hall.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say so to other persons. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You never abused the servants for removing the things from one place to another. - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you wish to state that positively. - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. And you are quite certain that at the moment they wanted to get rid of you, you did not want to stop. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Miss Mather. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She is the sister of Mrs. Williams. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with Miss Mather the night before your master turned you out of doors. - A. No particular conversation.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you use these words I am going to say, remember these words are taken down; did not you say, Miss Mather, Mr. Williams and I had better part friendly. - A. I believe them are the words exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. You did say that. - A. I believe I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing more. - A. I do not know, in the general conversation something else may come in.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect yourself, I can bring proof what you said; did not you desire Miss Mather to intercede with Mr. Williams, for Mr. Williams to suffer you to stay. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you before you was turned away, threaten Mr. Williams. - A. I told him I certainly would discover something that would be very serious to him. I never asked him to stop.</p>
               <p>Q. He turned you out that night. - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. He persisted that you should not stop. - A. Yes, he was very tipsey.</p>
               <p>Q. How many days after he turned you away was it before you found your way to the Sun fire office. - A. A fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been to Mr. Wilson first. - A. I saw Mr. Wilson in the coach yard, I believe that was about a fortnight after, and then I mentioned it to him; that was before I went to the Sun fire office.</p>
               <p>Q. I will now take you back to No. 27, when you discovered the fire in No. 27, Mr. Williams was in No. 30; you are quite positive of that. - A. Quite positive.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him in the room. - A. Yes, I spoke to him.</p>
               <p>Q. The door was shut, and the window was open. - A. A little open.</p>
               <p>Q. So that a person sitting there with a light, and any person going in there and opening the door, the wind might blow it out. - A. It might.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him in 62, you went and called him when the fire broke out at No. 16. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was he from 16. - A. I suppose sixty, eighty, or one hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. To go from there to No. 16, they must go down one stair-case and go up another. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He must have got out of his bed at No. 62, passed down one staircase and gone up another, and must have passed through where the firemen were; were they not stationed there. - A. They were in the rooms adjoining; he could have gone through a long stone passage, without coming where the firemen were; the two rooms where the firemen were, were at the bottom of the staircase; the firemen were in the Manchester and Liverpool rooms as they call them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there no other firemen in any other rooms. - A. Not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever threaten Mr. Williams if ever he turned you away. - A. I mentioned it to him when he discharged me.</p>
               <p>Q. You never did mention it to him till after you was discharged, that was near a twelvemonth after. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you said that you could hang him, and that you was sure you could do it. - A. I do not know that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it. - A. I will.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never threatened to accuse him of any thing else. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you swear to that. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no doubt about that. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not you threaten him to charge him with an unnatural crime. - A. No, I never mentioned any such thing, not to Mr. Williams.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never hint to any other person, that you could charge Mr. Williams with the commission of an unnatural crime. - A. No, I never did.</p>

            . - Mr. Gurney. You are one of the city marshalls. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. About the time that Triggey was examined before the lord mayor, did he go with you and point out where the boards were. - A. Yes, he stooped down and took out the boards himself and gave them to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he occasion to knock down any thing. - A. Yes, there was a small skirting board before them; he knocked that down, and then he pulled out these two boards (producing them), they have been in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Triggey) How were these shelves. - A. That part that is scorched was on fire in blazes; that is the lower shelf, the fire was upon that shelf, the shelf above it was hot, and it had the decanter of brandy upon it.</p>
               <p>Court. You did not say what quantity. - A. I did not know exactly the quantity.</p>
               <p>MRS. SIMPSON. - Mr. Gurney. In December 1805, you were chambermaid to the Swan and Two Necks. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. In the course of that evening did any fire take place in No. 27. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180704080055"></xptr> Q. How lately before that fire broke out had you seen your master. - A. I saw him at various times in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember whether you had seen him shortly before the fire in No. 27. - A. I cannot justly say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember your master going to bed. - A. I heard he did go to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you and your husband go to bed. - A. Yes, between eleven and twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the house did you sleep in. - A. In the bed room adjoining the chamberlain's room.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not far from the bar - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. After you went to bed, was you alarmed by the cry of fire again. - A. Yes, I heard there was a fire in No. 16.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get up in consequence of that alarm in No. 16. - A. Yes, I heard of it, but I did not see it.</p>
               <p>Q. After that fire was put out, what did you and your husband do. - A. We went into the chamberlain's room and took a cup of tea.</p>
               <p>Q. While you were taking tea in the chamberlain's room, did you see your master. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come into the room after the fire was put out. - A. Yes, between three and four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in company with you at the time that you saw your master come in. - A. There was my husband and Triggey.</p>
               <p>Q. When your master went through the chamberlain's room, where did he go. - A. He went up stairs towards No. 69; he had a candle and candlestick in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you and Triggey follow him at any time afterwards. - A. In about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you follow him. - A. To see if all was safe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go up the same stair-case that he had gone towards 69. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you and Triggey look in 69. - A. Yes, and we looked in 67 and 66; we then looked into the closet.</p>
               <p>Q. When you looked in the closet in what condition did you find it. - A. There was some fire in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see apparently any paper burnt down to an ash. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that paper. - A. On the shelf, and the shelf was some of it burnt.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it on fire and in flame. - A. I cannot recollect any flame, the shelf was black.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any smoke. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Who put it out. - A. It was put out by Triggey, with the green baize, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that green baize. - A. It laid under the shelf.</p>
               <p>Q. How came that green baize there. - A. It was out of use, it had been used over a carpet.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any fire near that closet that day. - A. No; we found the door put to it, it had a lock, but it was not locked.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay there. - A. A very few minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you return down the same stair-case that you came. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing on the other shelf. - A. Yes, a decanter.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing in that decanter. - A. No, except the drainings; there had been brandy in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take it off the shelf or Triggey. - A. I cannot say, I brought it down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q Then you mean to say it was empty when you found it. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw no appearance of any brandy having been spilt there. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. None of the paper was wet. - A. It was burnt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at all go into the room called the Sun below that. - A. No, I found Mr. Williams in the Sun after we had found the fire in the closet; Triggey spoke to him, but I do not recollect any of the words that passed. I brought the decanter with me, and the next day Fletcher, the head waiter, smelt the fire and saw it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you point it out to your husband. - A. Triggey shewed it to my husband. I went up when Fletcher was there, and Tourzy the cook.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Mr. Hall the surveyor coming and examining you and the other persons in the house. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Mr. Hall any thing about that fire in the closet. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you. - A. I had no particular reason for not telling him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your master make any particular enquiry respecting the fire the night it happened. - A. He said he did not know how it could happen in the wood garret.</p>
               <p>Q. On the day following the fire did he ever question you about the manner, or which way this fire could possibly have happened. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you the next day discover that there had been a fire in No. 27. - A. I found there had been a fire in 27; I did not discover it myself.</p>
               <p>Q. That is two stories under the wood garret, and accessible by a passage; did you go into that room. - A. I did; the bed-furniture was perfectly burnt; the mattress and coverlid was burnt round.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever mentioned the fire in the closet opposite to No. 66, till you was examined before the lord-mayor. - A. To no one but Touzy, Fletcher, Triggey, and my husband.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Dancy. What situation were you in that house. - A. Chambermaid, and Triggey was chamberlain.</p>
               <p>Q. He was out that day. - A. Yes; my son boarded with him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did Mr. Williams come in the house - A. Mr. Williams came in the house on the 5th of April, and the fire was on the 9th of December.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has Triggey been there. - A. Triggey was there a few days before Mr. Williams was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he chamberlain when he first came: - A. No; he acted about the house. He came, I fancy, in expectation of having the place.</p>
               <p>Q. The fire broke out about six o'clock. - A. About a quarter after six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect where Mr. Williams had dined that day. - A. To the best of my recollection in the parlour with company.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time. - A. The usual time is between three and four o'clock, but the particular time on that day I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you are able to say who dined with him. A. I believe captain Dickson and Mrs. Williams.</p>
               <p>Q. They went out after dinner. - A. Yes, I understood<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180704080056"></xptr> they went up to Islington.</p>
               <p>Court. Who was in the parlour at the time the alarm of fire was given. - A. I understood, Mr. Williams, captain Dickson, and another of the company were in the parlour. I had not seen them, nor had I been in the room.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dancy. When the alarm of fire was you saw them. - A. Yes, Mr. Williams ordered me to get the keys; I told him that I did not know that I could; I would get somebody to get them, and before I had got to the door the people had got the keys, and they were removing the goods; I saw every one about the house using the greatest exertions they could, and I saw Mr. Williams about in different parts of the lower part of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose this fire created no small confusion. - A. A very great one.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the things removed in that hurry that that confusion would create. - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon were the firemen there with their engines. - A. It might be three quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. The fire was got under in this wood garret. - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the firemen came were there other persons assisting in getting this fire under. - A. Yes, all of the servants were carrying up water.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if any one said it was impossible for any one to carry water there, it is not true. - A. It is not; the fire in the garret was partly out when Triggey came home.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was possible for any one to throw water there. - A. I was not there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see persons carrying water up. - A. I did; the waiter, and the housemaid Jane,

               <p>Q. Perhaps Triggey was afraid of fire, did he go near it. - A. He went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he carry up water and throw it on. - A. I do not think there was any occasion then.</p>

               <p>Q. Then if Triggey has said that if Mr. Williams went through, that is not true. - A. It is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go through before or after you was drinking tea. - A. I do not know whether it was before or after; it was not at the time that we were drinking tea.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was the second fire. - A. At No. 27.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Williams at any time before there at No. 27. - A. Yes, he was at the bottom part of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you think Mr. Williams was absent when he went to inform Mrs. Williams of the accident that had taken place - was it an hour or more. - A. I think it must be that before he returned.</p>
               <p>Q. After he went through the chamberlain's room, you yourself went up stairs to that place that led you to No. 66 - did you open the closet door or Triggey. - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you do not recollect there was any flame there, the shelf was black and smoking, it appeared as if paper had been burnt out, as if it had been extinguished and gone out. - A. It was burning then on the decline, it was black and smoking.</p>
               <p>Q. You said the green baize laid on the ground underneath the shelf. - A. I think the baize was on the ground; I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it put up before the door to hide the fire from you. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a decanter there, it had the drainings of brandy in it, and as Triggey might be alarmed, he might take a little brandy at that time. - A. I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. You stood by and never saw him. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The decanter was cold, it did not burn your fingers. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember whether it was any time in contemplation for the office of chamberlain and chambermaid to be united. - A. Mr. Williams offered me the chamberlain's place in addition to mine; I mentioned it to Triggey the same evening.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this after the fire. - A. About May or June after.</p>
               <p>Q. When you mentioned it to Triggey was he pleased or angry - A. He was not pleased.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I may venture to say he was angry. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing him do any thing particular after this anger of his, do you remember his taking a rule and measuring the distances of places afterwards. - A. Yes, the same evening he got a rule and line measuring; he was an hour and a half measuring the distance about different parts of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. He was measuring distances afterwards, and putting down his distances upon paper. - A. I did not see what he wrote.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he write. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not take that situation. - A. No, Triggey continued as chamberlain; I left the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his tearing a leaf out of a book. A. Yes, the bed-book.</p>
               <p>Q. That leaf that he tore out enabled him to know all the numbers of the rooms. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether Mr. Williams went to bed that night. - A. He did, in No. 62.</p>
               <p>Q. That is one pair of stairs higher than the Liverpool and Manchester; were the firemen stationed in the Liverpool and Manchester. - A. Yes, and in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Then to come down from Mr. Williams's room No. 62, he must come along the same passage where the Liverpool and the Manchester rooms were - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you cross the yard after you come by the Liverpool, to go where the fire had been. - A. No, there is the passage, and then the stairs front you; it is near the bar; the bar is of one side of the passage, and the stairs of the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Then all the people who are in the bar, if they look that way, would see the persons who went up that stair-case. - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. So then he must come by the Liverpool and Manchester, where the firemen were, and by the bar;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180704080057"></xptr> where any body might have seen him. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You never went up stairs while the fire lasted. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then whether you could get at it to throw water upon it you do not know. - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Now at the time your master went to bed at 62, do you know whether the door of the Manchester or the Liverpool was open or shut. - A. I do not know.</p>

               <p>Q. If they were shut he might pass without any person seeing him. - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>MR. HALL. Q. You have told us you was a surveyor in the Sun fire office. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. On the day after the fire was, did you go to the Swan and Two Necks to see what damage the fire had done. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the appearance of fire in these different places. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see all that is now mentioned, or was there any exception. - A. I saw all that is now mentioned, with the exception of the closet.</p>
               <p>Q. Does this model describe the form and manner of the house in the best purpose. - A. I think it does.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the access to the wood garret up the staircase, and through that narrow passage. - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Would it have been an easy thing for persons to go along that narrow passage and throw water. - A. I think not, presuming it was full of smoke.</p>
               <p>Q. You examined the remainder of the wood garret. - A. Yes; the floor was burnt very much, the room had fallen in; that part of the building was considerably injured. I examined 27, the fire left a very strong mark there, there was a burnt place in the floor, just at the end of the foot of the bed; the floor of 28 was very much burnt indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any means by which the fire of the wood loft could be communicated to 27 and 28. - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Would any persons bringing wood out of that garret, come past there. - A. I should think it highly improbable, it is an hundred yards distance.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a party wall between them, is there not. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that wall injured by fire. - A. Certainly not, the wall was perfect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards examine the rooms 16 and 98. - A. Yes; 16 was very much injured; the floor of 16 was burnt through into the coffee room; 98 was as if the fire had come through 16 to 98, and not as if it originated in 98; in 21 the curtains and vallens were consumed, and the panes of glass in the windows were cracked; it evidently shewed that there was a great degree of heat; glass that has been cracked by fire, the lines have a different appearance from those effected by a blow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see a candle in the room. - A. I cannot take upon me to say at this distance of time whether I did or no.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any communication that you could trace between that fire and any of the others. - A. None whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. From what you have seen of this closet, was there any thing that this fire in the closet could be communicated by any of the other fires. - A. I think certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what you saw there did you ask any questions of Mr. Williams, and did he give you any account of the fire. - A. He did; which account I took down in writing at the time. I have now the original writing in my hand.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you take it down so that Williams saw you were taking it down from him. - A. Certainly; we were at a table together, and I had pen, ink, and paper from the inn. That was on the morning of the 30th of December, the morning after the fire. (The examination read.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Did he at that time mention to you about the fire in the closet. - A. Not a word.</p>
               <p>Q. You also examined some of the servants. - A. I did.</p>

               <p>Q. Who dined in company with you. - A. Mr. Muiret, his wife, and two ladies; we sat down to dinner at half after two or three o'clock, in the bar parlour.</p>

               <p>Q. Is the bar parlour a great distance from the garret where the fire was. - A. A great way.</p>
               <p>Q. From the time that you dined till the alarm of fire was given, was the prisoner at the bar out of the room time sufficient to have gone to that place. - A. I do not think he left the room for two minutes; when he did leave the room some gentleman called out where is the master of the yard; he was not out more than a minute or two minutes at any time; I am certain of it, or else I would not say it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the alarm of fire being given. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect by whom the alarm was given. A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the alarm of fire being given, what was done. - A. Mr. Williams and me went up, and we did every thing that possibly could be done; Mr. Williams was very much agitated and hurt.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time you were at dinner, till the alarm of fire, did you perceive any agitation upon him. A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Williams give directions for putting the fire out. - A. He assisted, as well as myself; he ordered the engines, and he asked for the keys of the church, I fancy to put his goods in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe Mr. Williams during the fire, till it was put out. - A. Most of the time.</p>

            . - Mr. Dancy. Do you know the prisoner at the bar, Mr. Williams. - A. I have known him nine or ten years; at the time the fire happened I was an inmate of his family.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been so. - A. From the time that he separated from his partner. Mr. Simpson. the July preceding; at that time it was his particular request that I should reside in it, having leisure hours in my own business, which I could be of service to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect at what time you dined on that day, when the fire took place. - A. About three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What company dined there. - A. Mr. Dickson, his wife, myself, Mr. and Mrs. Williams, and another gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. From the time of dinner did your company continue till the fire broke out, did the ladies continue with you or go else where. - A. The ladies continued till between four and five.</p>
               <p>Q. The company consisted of yourself, Mr. Dickson, and Mrs. Dickson, Mrs. Williams, and the prisoner; at what time did the fire break out. - A. About six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect Mr. Williams being absent during that time. - A. No more than going into the bar to put any thing down, or when he was called out, then he returned immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. You call this room in which you dined, the bar parlour. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you see from the bar parlour into the bar itself. - A. Yes, the division is of glass.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he with you at the time the fire broke out. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there been any thing in his manner, that any thing extraordinary was likely to take place. - A. Nothing at all; he was perfectly cheerfull and paid attention to his guests.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it was about six o'clock when you first heard the alarm of fire. - A. Yes, on or about six when we first heard any alarm.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect who made that alarm to you. - A. No, one of the servants came in very much flurried; I do not know which it was; the fire was at the back of the premises.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Mr. Williams do on that occasion. - A. Nothing more than anxious to render any assistance, giving directions for water to be taken up. He appeared to act perfectly as he ought to have done; I carried up water myself.</p>
               <p>Q. How near might you go with the water to where the fire was. - A. I went into the narrow passage where the fire was; it was so full of smoke I was obliged to leave it; I threw the water along the passage, in hopes of it getting to the fire. A great many other persons carried up water; there was a great quantity of water carried up, but I do not think if the engines had not come, it would have put it out. Mr. Williams placed himself in the bar, from whence he could see what was done, and he gave directions.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there many persons engaged in getting the fire under. - A. Yes, all the servants, and I think as many as twenty, rendered every exertion possible.</p>
               <p>Q. How long since you first heard the alarm of fire, before the engines were brought. - A. I was so busy employed, I did not observe when the engines came; the firemen were in the house and got the pipes up before I observed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Until the engines came, did Mr. Williams continue to act in the way you have described. - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. When that was got under, do you recollect what became of Mr. Williams. - A. Mr. Dickson and I went up to his wife, to break out this intelligence to her.</p>
               <p>Q. You did go and break this intelligence. - A. I did; she was at her father in law's. Mr. Williams said he would follow as soon as he could get things in order. He came, and returned with him and Mr. Dickson to the inn.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any exertion made with respect to the furniture, what was done with that. - A. I saw a quantity of furniture taken out of the house; I was told it was taken to the church, particularly the plate, of which Mr. Williams had great quantity.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a considerable confusion during this business. - A. A very great confusion indeed, the servants were flying in all directions.</p>
               <p>Q. It was after day, it was dark, so as to require candles. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the servants got candles with them. - A. I do not recollect seeing persons with candles, I was principally in that part of the house where the fire began.</p>
               <p>Q. There were a great many rooms about this place. - A. Near one hundred.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you continue at the inn after the time that you returned to it. - A. I think I might stay up about an hour, then I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Then had any other fire taken place in any other room than that garret. - A. I understood there had, I saw it in the morning, at No. 27; I slept at the further extremity from the fire, I heard nothing of it till the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me how many firemen there were. - A. Thirty or forty I think; I left them there when I went to Mrs. Williams, I think they were encreased when I came back; and when I got up in the morning the firemen were there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Williams seem anxious of extinguishing the fire. - A. He did; when I came to him in the bar, to ask him to let the firemen have a little liquor, he told me to do as I like, and take it to them to increase their exertion, which I did.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of seeing Mr. Williams' conduct. - A. Yes, he seemed very fatigued in assisting to get the fire under. The next day I saw Triggey, I asked him if he could ascertain by what means the fire happened, his answer was, he did not know, he was not there when the fire began; I asked him how the second<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180704080059"></xptr> fire began, he said it must be by removing the furniture from one place to another.

               <p>Q. On the evening of the fire were you at the Swan and Two Necks. - A. Yes, I attended my father about eight o'clock in the evening; I heard the alarm of fire at the inn, I went as a friend of Mr. Williams; I found the house in great confusion; the first fire had been put out. I was in the bar, I saw persons carrying things backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether they had candles or lights in their hands. - A. There was a great many lights carried about; when the fire was said to be extinguished Mr. Williams seemed exhausted by fatigue; there was a second alarm of fire when I was there; when that second fire was extinguished, Triggey came into the bar, he was warm, and appeared as if he had exhausted himself on the occasion; he complained of persons moving the goods from one room to another, and he thinking it his duty, had gone into several rooms, and by accident saw the second fire; he said it was by the d - d foolish conduct of carrying the things from one room to another.</p>

               <p>Q. Who gave the alarm of fire. - A. I think one of Mr. Williams's servants, he hallooed out to me he believed the stables were on fire; I told him it was impossible to be there, because I had just left the stable; I looked into the front yard which adjoins the stables, I discovered it blazing out; I then said it is in the house. Mr. Williams's waiter or porter, I don't know which, he run in the house and called Mr. Williams from the bar parlour; he came running to me, and said my stable was on fire; it did appear to a person coming from where he was, as if it came from the stable; it is a double roof.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Williams take any pains to put the fire out. - A. He immediately called his servants together, and told them to get the keys of the church to put the best of his plate and furniture in.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you have some interest in this concern. A. Yes, I should have been ruined had not the fire been got under, I am not half insured.</p>
               <p>Q. Who gave the order for the engines. - A. Mr. Williams and myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember of there being any failure of water for the supply of the engines. - A. We are supplied with water from two companies, the New River and the Thames; the New River pipe failed. I communicated it to Mr. Williams, he said that he was afraid that we should all be burned down and ruined.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Triggey. - A. I saw him the next day; I wished to see where these fires had been, and what damage had been done; he took me to the wood room garret.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take you all round. - A. No, to no other place than that; I asked him how he could account for that, he said God knows how the first began, he said he could not account for the other, no way but this, but by the confusion of the servants leaving candles in the rooms too close to the bed furniture.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you getting it under then - A. Yes, it had begun to decrease at the back part, after the sky-light had taken fire, it was near seven o'clock when the sky-light had taken fire.</p>
               <p>Q. After the engines did arrive was that fire got completely out. - A. I believe it was; I did not see the second fire till the next day, that was in No. 27; Mr. Williams went to bed soon after one o'clock; he gave me the keys of the bar, he said I might as well set up during the remainder of the night. About three o'clock in the morning the firemen came to the bar door and knocked, they told me they thought it was not all safe; they asked me to give them candles, I did. That fire was in No. 16.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of the alarm of that fire; did you call Mr. Williams. - A. I did, I found him in No. 61, or 62; he was in bed.</p>

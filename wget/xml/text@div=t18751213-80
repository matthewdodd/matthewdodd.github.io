                  </hi>. I am a labourer living in the Waterloo Road—on Sun<lb></lb>day morning, 21st November, after 12 o'clock, I was walking on Waterloo Bridge with a woman who lives with me, and who had lived with the prisoner—her sister and her sister's husband were also with me—the prisoner was standing on the bridge—he said "You see I am here"—I said "Yes"—he came to my side, and asked me if I was a man—I said "I am"—he said "I will let you know," and I was knocked down and fell sense-loss—there was nobody but him to knock me down—I had had some drink—I received a wound, and my head was plastered up.</p>

               <p>I lived with the prisoner three years ago, and had two children by him, but I have had nothing to do with him for three years—on the morning of 21st November I was on the bridge with Jones, and heard the prisoner say to him "I am here"—he said "Yes, I see you are; what if you are here?"—the prisoner said that he would let him know—I asked my brother-in-law not to let them fight, and while I was doing so the prisoner ran at Jones, and I saw Jones fall, but I did not see any knife.</p>

                  </hi>. I was house-surgeon at Charing Cross Hospital—Jones was brought there on Tuesday morning, suffering from two wounds in his right temple close to each other; one was superficial and one deep—I think they were caused by an instrument, and not by falling on the coping stone—if he had fallen on a broken bottle it would have been a clean cut.</p>

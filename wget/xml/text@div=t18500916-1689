                  </hi>. I am a gardener—I live at Camberwell—on 16th Aug. the prisoner came and asked me to lend him my barrow to get in a little gravel—I said I did not know—he said Mr. Burwood was at work in the New-road, and if I would lend it him he would be obliged to me, and he would bring it back that evening, or in the morning—he took it, and never came back—I never saw him till he was at the station—I found the harrow about four days afterwards, at Martin Boddy's, I can swear it is mine.</p>

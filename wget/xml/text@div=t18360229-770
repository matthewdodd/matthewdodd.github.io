                  </hi> I am a farrier, and live in Cutler-street, Houndaditch. I let out trucks—last Saturday evening, at a quarter to seven o'clock, I found my yard door broken open, and a truck gone—on the morning of the 29th of February, a policeman came to me—I went to the station-house, in Featherstone-street, and there I found the truck—it is worth 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I left it safe at twenty minutes to nine o'clock, when I went on the Jury to Court of Common Pleas.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable G</hi> 62.) On Saturday, the 27th of Feb<lb></lb>ruary. I met the prisoner drawing the truck, in Whitecross-street—I asked him what he was going to do with it—he said he was going to take it to the Green Yard; that a woman in a white straw bonnet had given him 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to take it to the Green Yard—I said, "The Green Yard is over the way"—I went part of the way with him, having suspicion is was stolen—I called my brother officer, asked his advice, and took the prisoner into custody with it—he appeared to have been drinking—he stated at the police-office, if he had not been drunk, he would not have taken the truck.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. Did not you show me into the Green Yard, and tell me to stand at the door while you fetched the key?

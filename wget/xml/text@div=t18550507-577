                  </hi>. I am a groom, employed at the Crystal Palace stables. On 2nd Dec. I was in the service of Mr. Hugh Worthington Statham, of No. 16, Belmont-place, Wandsworth-road—on that evening I was at the Queen's Arms, in Nine Elms-lane—the prisoner came to me there about 10 o'clock—I knew him before—he said, "<hi rend="italic">Dick</hi>, will you lend me the key of your stable for a minute? I have got a saddle and bridle at your stable door, and I want to leave it there"—I lent it to him, and he went out with it directly—he said he would bring it back in about five minutes—he did not come back—I waited for about a quarter of an hour, and then went round to the stable, which is in Lawn-lane, South Lambeth—I found the stable door pulled to—I pushed it open—it was dark—I felt in the stall, and the horse was gone—I struck a light, looked round, and found the key thrown just inside the door—the horse was my master's, and was worth about forty guineas—there was no saddle and bridle left in the stable—I went and made inquiries at the toll gate, and then informed my master about three quarters of an hour afterwards—I lost my situation in consequence of this, and left about a month afterwards, when my master was suited—I then worked on the South Western Railway, and then went to the Crystal Palace, and while I was there, on 20th April, I saw the prisoner there—he was employed with a great many more men that were taken on that day—I said nothing to him, but was turning round to go for a policeman, and the prisoner said, "For God's sake, don't go and get a policeman!"—I had not said a word to him about a policeman before that—I said I should go and fetch a policeman—he said, "For God's sake, don't! for I have seen Mr.</p>

               <p>Frail, and he has forgiven me, and I hope you will do the same; if you get a policeman they will send me to prison, and it will be the ruin of me"—Mr. Frail was the prisoner's master at that time—I did not know then that he was in Mr. Frail's service—I had not seen him for three months—I did not give him in charge, because he said he had seen Mr. Frail, and Mr. Frail had forgiven him, and he hoped I should forgive him; that he was sorry he had done it, and he could not think how he could be such a fool as to do it—my master got back the horse on the Tuesday evening following.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a veterinary surgeon, at Croydon. The prisoner was in my service for a short time—on Friday, 1st Dec., I sent him to Tattersall's with some horses to sell, and to attend to them while they were there—he had a saddle and bridle with him—he was to remain there till Monday night, the day of the sale, and then to come back again—it was his duty to bring back the saddle and bridle—on the Sunday morning following 3rd Dec., I found a horse in an odd stable in the yard—it is a public yard—there had been no horse in that stable before, that I know of—there was also a saddle and bridle on the corn bin—I believe it was the one I had sent with the prisoner, but I could not swear to it—on that Sunday evening the prisoner came to the King's Arms, adjoining the yard, where I was, and wished to see me—I went out to him, and he asked me whether there was not a strange horse come down for me to see—I told him there was a horse come down, but I could not think where it had come from—he said it belonged to a farrier who had got it for sale, and he had also got a pony—he said he thought the horse would suit me, and whether I would buy it—it was there with the understanding for me to purchase it; I understood him so—he said he thought it would suit me, from which I understood he meant to ask if I would buy it—I tusked him what he thought they wanted for it—he said he should think about 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said I thought it was</p>

               <p>very cheap, and he had better let me see the man it belonged to in the morning—he said he would bring him down in the morning about 10 o'clock—I stayed at Croydon till half past 10 or nearly 11, and then I started for Tattersall's—I had ordered the horse to be locked up before I started, and next day I delivered it to the constable, Dendy—I never saw the prisoner again till he was in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Pett, of Duke-street, Lisson-grove. On the 10th of August I was standing at our shop-door—the prisoner passed me without any thing, and went in at the private door—she had no right to go in there—she came out with something in her apron—I had had my petticoat hanging in my yard—I went up stairs, looked out of my bed-room window, and missed my petticoat—the pri<lb></lb>soner went to her lodging, in Bell-street—I was looking about for a police<lb></lb>man, and she came out of there—the policeman came up, and found it hanging if her yard—nobody could have taken it but her—I saw it safe five minutes before.</p>

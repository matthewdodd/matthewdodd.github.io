                  </hi>. I am assistant master of the East London Industrial Schools, and live on the premises, 96, Mansel Street, Goodman's Fields—I teach the pupils brushmaking and paper-bagmaking—I had been unwell three months; I kept my physic in a cupboard in the store-room, which was accessible to the boys, as they kept their slippers there—on Tuesday, 7th January, I took a dose of physic, and found it more bitter than before—on the following Friday I again took a dose, and it caused a dryness in my mouth, and a burning sensation; I looked in the bottle, and saw a white sediment—I at once handed the bottle to Mr. Pitt, the superintendent of the school—I made inquiries in the school, and next day asked the prisoner what he had been doing to my physic—he said he had put part of a white precipitate powder in it, and threw the other away—I asked him about it again on Monday, and he said, "I put the whole of it in"—I spoke</p>

               <p>to Loughton, a non-resident boy, on the Monday, and he made a statement to me—I have had occasion to correct the prisoner for schoolboy tricks, but only once—I took him by the ear, pulled him off a stool, and put him to his work—that was in June; he was then eleven years old—by a sediment in the bottle, I mean a scum floating at the top.</p>

                  </hi>. On Friday night, 10th January, Mr. Pitt brought me a bottle half-full of liquid—I found a precipitate in it, and a deposit, which I examined and found to be white precipitate, ammonia chloride of mercury, that is poison—if the whole had been taken at one dose it would kill a person, but it causes vomiting, and therefore it is its own antidote—it causes a burning sensation in the mouth.</p>

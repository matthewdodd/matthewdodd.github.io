On the 1st of May, I left the garden and green-house quite secure, about seven o'clock in the evening. About six o'clock the next morning I found it plundered of the articles stated in the indictment, which were all safe the night before; I observed the foot marks of two different persons, one of them had nails in the sole of the foot. I was present when the prisoner's shoe was fitted to the marks-it tallied.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to the prisoner's house, in Fulham-fields, about half a mile from Mr. Druce's, and found the prisoner in the garden hocing-the moment he saw Welch, who was with me, he threw his hoe down, and ran off towards the back of the house. I secured him, and asked him why he ran away? he said he was going to the fair; we searched the house, and found eleven rabbits-there were more, but we could not catch them; we found the seeds in the house. When Welch was taking them down, the prisoner said," there is nothing there belonging to you." We found about 400 cauliflower-plants concealed under some rubbish in the garden, and some flowers; the rest of the things were concealed about the garden. The next day we went to Mr. Druce's to look at the foot-marks, and the print of nails in the sole of the shoe. I took the prisoner's shoe and compared it, it exactly fitted.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The prisoner's father, who lived in the house, has absconded. I did not count thenails in the shoe.</p>

            . I am an officer, and was with the last witness, on the 2d of May, at the prisoner's father's house, and saw the prisoner hoeing, he ran off - We secured him; he said he was going to the fair. Brookgreen fair was held at that time. We found the things as Westcoat as described. The next morning I compared the prisoner's shoe with the foot-marks where the cauliflowers had been taken from, it exactly corresponded with one set; there were some nails in the marks, and the nails in the shoe fitted them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I did not count the nails.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WELCH. I am a gardener. I went with the officers. The prisoner's father rents the house and land. The moment the prisoner saw me he ran off. I saw the things found as described.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. His father lives in the house - I did not know that the prisoner lived there.</p>
               <p>EDMUND PAVNTER. I am a gardener, and live at Fulham. I knew the prisoner lived with his father. I have been in his garden - He has no means of raising young potatoes at this early season.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I see the ground every day; the potatoes could not be raised in natural ground.</p>

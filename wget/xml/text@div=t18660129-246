I am 17 years of age, and live at 19, Princes-street, Lambeth—shortly after nine, on the night of 24th January, I was at the top of Anderson's-walk—I saw all three prisoners there—I cannot swear to Clark, I swear to the other two—I have known Warren and Abrahams well by sight, and when I saw them this night, they were close to a lamp, walk<lb></lb>ing towards the Railway-arch—after they had gone about six yards from the lamp, Warren said, "We must have him quick, or else we shall lose the chance"—they were walking behind the prosecutor about five or six yards—when they got to the railway-arch, they attacked him—there were three of them—I heard him call out "Robbery," and I went for a constable, but could not see one—I went about ten yards round the corner, and then went back—the prisoners saw me coming, and they jumped up and ran away—the third one had a light coat on, but I could not swear to him—Clark is like him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable M</hi> 89.) I saw Williams on the 16th of Aug., about eight or nine o'clock in the evening, carrying a bag—he went into Pim's shop—Pim was behind the counter—Williams opened the bag, and took some paper shavings out of it—I saw Pim handle these book covers as the bag was on the counter, after the paper shavings were weighed—I should say there was from 6lbs. to 7lbs. weight of paper shav<lb></lb>ings, from the appearance of them, they being light—previous to the bag going in, it appeared to have something heavy at the bottom of it—the quantity which the bag contained was put in the scale—Mr. Pim came round his counter, and lifted the bag on the counter—I saw Pim take the covers in his hand, look at them, and appear to examine them—I did not see him take them from the bag—I saw them in his hand, he lifted from the mouth of the bag when the bag was on the counter—at that time I left the door, crossed over to West, and communicated what I saw—I stood a short time, and saw the bag delivered over to Williams empty, and he came oat with it under his arm—I followed till West took Williams, with the bag under his arm—I then returned to Pim's shop, and stationed myself to see if I could see anything of this kind come out—I watched till West came back—I then went into the shop, and West asked Pim if he had bought any paper—he replied that he had not bought any for three weeks—West described what sort of a young man he saw go into the shop, and about the time—Pim replied he had not seen any such person as that there, and when he had bought the paper he bought it of a female—I mentioned that at the Magistrate's office—West said he would search the place, and Pim consented, saying he would take him to where his paper was—he said he had a great quantity, that he was in the habit of buying it by the ton weight at a time—West then went in the rear of the premises, and I went to a bin where I suspected this was, and I found it in the bin—there was nothing over it—I found it as soon as I got to the edge of the bin—Pim's attention was drawn to these books—he said a part of it did not belong to these books at all, that it was part of his own book, and had been there for some time—he told us we had no businsss to take it away—we brought it away, and took it to the station—he afterwards admitted, when he came to the station, that he had bought the rest—he said he might have bought it, to the best of his belief, that evening—I heard him say that as I stood aside of him—Williams said this was the identical quantity of paper he sold to Pim, and Pim told us to look at Williams, and see what a false young man he was.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>was not put to me, nor that Pim said he might have bought it that evening—I cannot say how I came to tell it now—I took no note of this conver<lb></lb>sation—I do not know that I and West have been talking this matter over since—we have not been talking it over at all—I would not swear either way—I might have made a remark to him, but we have not conversed in full upon it—not all that I have told you to-day, but respecting the case coming on to-day—I do not know that I have been talking over with West what I saw and heard on that occasion—I will swear I have not talked about that, or mentioned it to him—I have not repeated what I heard on that occasion—he has not talked to me about it—it occurred at the station—it was more addressed to the sergeant than to me—I was in plain clothes and so was West—West and I were at the shop when this was going on—people came up immediately after, when West called in another Constable in uniform.</p>

I saw Williams go with some<lb></lb>thing into Pim's shop, but what I could not say—he had a bag which seemed heavy—I saw Pim come round the counter, take something from the floor, and put it on the counter—I waited a short time and saw Wil<lb></lb>liams come out of the shop—I followed him some distance—I stopped him, and asked him what he was doing with that bag—he said it was his own bag—I asked what he was going to do with it—he said he brought it from home—I went to Pim's and asked him if he had bought any paper that night—he said he had not—that was about three quarters of an hour after<lb></lb>wards—I told him it was a young man with a hat on, and a brown fustian jacket—he said he had not seen such a person that night—I told him I should go and search his place—he then took me backwards into a large warehouse and showed me some paper there—I said, "Let us go back again"—I went back and found this paper lying on some rags behind the counter—I said, "Here is some paper here"—he said, "That has been in my place three weeks"—the other officer told me he had taken it out of a little bin—I said I should take him and the paper to the station-house—ingoing along to the station I asked him what he came round the counter and took from the floor and put on the counter—he said he had not been round—when we got to the station the paper was placed before Williams, and he was asked if he knew anything of this paper—he said, Yes, it was the paper he took to Pim's—Pim denied it, and said, "Look at him and see if he is not telling a falsehood"—I am sure Pim said he had not seen such a person that night—after he said he had not bought the paper I described the person, and he said he had not seen such a person.</p>

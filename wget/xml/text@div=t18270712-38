               <p>ROBERT PARKINSON. I live at Newmarket. On the 4th of June I slept at the <placeName id="t18270712-38-crimeloc223">White Lion public-house, Charing-cross</placeName>

I found there was no fastening to the door, and I blocked it up with a chair; I got up first next morning, between seven and eight o'clock, and found the door had been opened and left ajar - and immediately after breakfast I missed two sovereigns out of my purse, which was in my breeches pocket - a 5l. country note was still left in the purse; I said nothing about it, but slept in the same room again next night - I blocked the door up as before, and put my breeches between the bed and mattress - there was a 10l. Bank note, a 10l. and a 1l. country notes, two sovereigns, and a watch in my pocket; I was awoke about a quarter-past five o'clock, by the prisoner kneeling at my bed side, with his hands drawing my breeches from under me - he had got part of them to the edge of the bed, but had not taken them completely from under me; he had got hold of them, and was pulling, when I seized him by his shirt - he had not got them completely from under me, for I was drawn with the breeches - I was still resting on some part of them - he had moved me with them.</p>

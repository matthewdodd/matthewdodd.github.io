On Monday morning, 10th March, about half-past three o'clock, I heard footsteps of two men running in River-lane, Islington—they turned into Mr. Cubitt's field, fifty or sixty yards from Mr. Bevill's—it was the two prisoners—they ran across the field and got over a fence—I ran round to meet them—when I came up with them I asked what they were doing there—they said they had gone there to sit down—I took them to the station for being there with some unlawful purpose—I found some blue-tipped matches on each of them, and a knife—about nine I heard something, went to James's-street, Islington, and found footmarks of two persons on the beds in the back garden, ten or twelve yards from the house, near the staircase window—one set were those of hob-nailed boots, with small nails in among them; the left boot had two nails out in the second and third rows; the others were of plain shoes—I took off the prisoner's boots and</p>

I am in the service of Robert Bevill, of 2, St. James-street On the Sunday night before the robbery I went to bed in the kitchen, and shut the door—I do not recollect how the window was—I left my clothes on a chair—I heard a noise in the night, and went and knocked at my master's door—I found my clothes in the garden next morning: and the match-box, containing brown-tipped round matches, on the dresser—I had left it on the table—the matches were not like then produced—we had none but round ones—I found some blue-tipped ones is the hall.</p>

I was called by the last witness, went down, and found the back-door and the lower staircase window open, which is level with the top of the cistern—there is a dust-bin by the wall, by which any child could get to the cistern—I had gone to bed at a little before ten o'clock—the door was fast then, and the window was down, but not fastened—in the garden I found an ink-stand, a bundle of the servant's clothes, some table-covers off the parlour table, and a candlestick, which were my property—the place was strewed with matches, which had been lighted and thrown down, and one or two had not been lighted—they were German matches, very thin and round, brown or red tips, and exceedingly silent—I taw the footmarks of two persons, one with hob-nailed shoes.</p>

               <p>I was brought up to the medical line; Randall, (the unfortunate man that suffered) Beazley, Rabbitts, and I, the day of the robbery we agreed to purchase a pair of pistols each, to go on the road with; Randall and I went into Rider's court to a person of the name of Clark, and went in to purchase a pair of pistols, we asked the price of a couple of pair, they asked us something above a guinea for one pair, and something more than 15s. for another; we purchased one pair for a guinea, and another pair for 15s. after purchasing the pistols, Randall and I went out, the two prisoners at the bar were waiting at the bottom of Rider's court, near to Cranbourn-alley, till we came out; when we had purchased the pistols, we set off immediately to the White Horse Cellar, there was as coach plying for Brentford, which we took; we went into the coach, four of us, and they put us down in Brentford; we walked from thence to a house before we came to the turnpike, in Small-Borough Green; the person who kept it, I was informed, went by the name of Turnpike Jack, I rather think the sign is the Castle; we stopped there and had to the amount of three or four pots of beer, and some bread and cheese; after we had paid for the beer and the bread and cheese, we walked through the turnpike, and came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179312040041"></xptr>to a bye lane on the left hand, which I think, takes us to Isleworth, and charged our pistols in the lane, and walked about round till we came into the same road again; there we waited till the chaise came up; Rabbitt attempted to stop the chaise, I finding him not sufficient, I went up to assist him; after I went up to assist him in stopping the chaise, he went to the horses head; he went on one side of the chaise, and Randall (the unfortunate man that suffered) on the other, and I stopped at the head of the chaise till they had taken what they did in the chaise.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know on which side Rabbitts went? - To the best of my recollection, he went on the right hand side of the chaise, and Randall on the left; but being alarmed at the situation, I did not take particular notice; after they came out, they told me, that they had got two guineas in money and some silver, I met both of them together as they came out of the chaise behind; before they could mention the particulars to me, ten or a dozen people came up out of the public house, which was just by, which alarmed us all; I said to Randall, we had better not attempt against these people, we had better make the best of our way away from them. I made to the hedge first, and got before Randall, and made my escape; I had left my hat and neck silk handkerchief behind me, and got to town; the next morning I sent to Rabbits to know whether he got away or not, and I was informed, that he had, but they thought the rest were taken, and that what money he got, he threw away, for fear it should be found about him; that ended the business of that.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was you apprehended? - I was apprehended some time after, it was on a Sunday, I cannot justly determine what time.</p>
               <p>Q. A week, month or two months? - I know it was no great while after.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't know what you mean by a great while? - It may be a month or two months after, or it may be less, I have not charged my memory to the time I was taken; I can easily determine it, if it is needful.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not yet mentioned, what day it was, that you set out about this business? - I am not certain as to the day, I think it was on a Thursday, and to the best of my recollection the month was in July, near the middle; I saw Rabbitts in the course of three or four days after, I think, but the person I sent, saw him the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see Beazley? - I did not see him for some time after, because he was in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he get out of custody before you was taken, or after? - Before.</p>
               <p>M. Knowlys. You have been brought up in the medical line? - I have been in that profession.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago? - I cannot justly determine, I can mention where I lived, it was at Warsall in Staffordshire, about a year and a half ago; but what I have declared on this robbery, I have declared facts.</p>
               <p>Q. For that year and a half that you have left Stafford, have you pursued any other profession than that of a thief? - From the predicament I laboured under, I was distressed, and was reduced by a number of circumstances.</p>
               <p>Q. I will have a plain answer. - No Sir, I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Could not you as well, and as easily have answered that as any other question? Then it is true? - I cannot say that I have followed my profession.</p>
               <p>Q. You come from some place of confinement now to give your evidence, and have been admitted an evidence in order to save your own life? - I understand it so, and because I would be useful to society.</p>
               <p>Q. To enable you to recollect a number of robberies you have committed, you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179312040042"></xptr>have sat down and composed a book, what is the size of that book, is it not a pretty large volume? - As far as I have recollected, I have; I have endeavoured to recollect every thing that I could to make a minute of.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose the work is not quite finished, I should like to know how many short of a couple of hundred robberies, you have put down on paper? - I have done every thing in my power to justice, to society, and myself</p>
               <p>Q. You know very well the circumstances of every robbery, that you have been present at, but whether you have applied those circumstances to the proper persons, we must take your word alone.</p>
               <p>Court. I wish to know whether you are quite sure, that these people were concerned with you in this robbery? - I am perfectly confident of it; the people where we drank, I dare say, will justify me, that what I mentioned are facts.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember this robbery? - Yes, I heard of it the same night, the prisoner Randall was brought into my house, and the pistol taken out of his pocket.</p>


               <p>Q. Had you seen him in the evening before? - Yes, about three hours before, and three more with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know any of these three? - Yes, all.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after this evening did you see the three people again? - I saw them at Bow-street about seven days ago that I was there; the prisoners are two of them, the man that was up before was the third.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were they in your house? - They were not in my house at all, they sat at the bench before the door; it was about half past five, they had four pots of beer, and two slices of bread and cheese, and Randall had a glass of rum at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing particular in the persons or dress of these, to occasion your particular notice of them? - I had a little boy that knew Randall, he called me out to see him, he says this Randall is a very great rogue, I would have you look at him, and I went out and looked at them all.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the occasion of your taking so much notice as to be able to swear to them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. What house do you keep? - The Castle at Small Borough Green.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a married woman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your husband is whom they call turnpike Jack, is not he? - No, that was the person that kept the house before I took it.</p>
               <p>Q. When did this affair happen? - It was on the 18th of July, that we are told this affair happened.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see these people till about five or six days ago, how long is it from this time that you heard of this robbery? - I dare say it is four months from this time.</p>
               <p>Q. They had their hats on as they were sitting at the door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You only satisfied yourself by looking at them that once? - I looked at them all.</p>
               <p>Q. But Randall was the person pointed out to you? - Yes, he was, but I looked at them all. I was afraid they were coming to rob the house, because he knew every part of it better than I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You know there is a reward of forty pounds for every one that is convicted of an highway robbery? - Yes, I have heard of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Here there are two persons in this case, it would be eighty pounds.</p>

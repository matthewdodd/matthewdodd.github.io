               <p>Q. Did you lose a watch and two watch cases on the 10th of January last. - A. I did; it was near one o'clock, I was coming down <placeName id="t18080113-15-crimeloc88">Fleet-street</placeName>

I see him receive the watch. I called the watchman and the prisoner was secured.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been able to find your watch again. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of your watch. - A. Four or five pounds; it was a metal watch jewelled.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober at this time, had you been drinking with any friend. - A. No, not any thing. I live in Lambeth-street, Goodman's Fields; I had been into St. Martin's-lane, I supped there.</p>
               <p>Jury. Were you near to a lamp at the time. - A. I was not directly under a lamp; I could discern and see about me very well.</p>

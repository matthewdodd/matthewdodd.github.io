I saw the prisoner, with two or three others, following and looking at me, so that I went to a doorway to get from them. I noticed the prisoner particularly; he crept behind the child and touched my shoulder - I turned round, and he was in the act of unclasping the necklace. I said,</p>
               <p>"You villain, are you taking my child's necklace" - he made no answer, but gave it a pull and got it - he snatched a piece of flesh off the child's neck, and gave the necklace to another man. I caught hold of him immediately, and held him; he was taken into a baker's shop, and the mob broke the shop window to get him out; but he was detained, and put into the watch-house.</p>

               <p>"You have got my child's beads." I had my hands in my pocket, and said,</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Mr. Edward Bowring Stephens, theprosecutor—business was commenced at Gun Wharf by Mr. Stephens, as awharfinger, on 25th June last—up to the 11th September, when the pri-soner was given into custody; we had had three cargoes of castor oil from the <hi rend="italic">Queen Victoria</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Vibillia</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Saltwell</hi>—those were the only cargoeswe had—the prisoner was engaged at the opening of the wharf as foremanand superintendent—he had charge of the cargoes that came to the wharf—castor oil comes from the ship in wooden cases containing four tins in eachcase—this is one of the tins (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there are never more than fourin a case—we employ a tinman to solder such as are leaky—all the casesare opened, and every tin carefully examined, and where tins are found tohave leaked they are filled up from other tins—that is part of the businessof a wharfinger—tins so emptied are returned as ullage—each tin containsabout forty pounds weight of castor oil—it was the prisoner's duty to makeentries of the cargoes in his book—the repairs are done by the tinman onwhat we call the quay—we have not a quay close to the river side, it is along road to the river—that is level with the street—it is called the Bank, and what I call the quay; but it is really a cart way—no leaky tins wouldgo into the basement, or tins that were known to be leaky—the tins are allweighed in drafts of four after they have been repaired and filled, and thenpiled away in the vaults off the basement—the castor oil in this case wasplaced in one of those vaults—after they have been weighed in drafts offour, the weights are entered in a book called the landing account—theprisoner enters a return of how many sound tins are turned out of thecargo, and also a return of the ullage, and the landed empties—I find anentry of the <hi rend="italic">Queen Victoria</hi>, at page nine, of 100 cases, and at page ten, 125 cases; that makes 225 cases, which would be 900 tins—he has returned I 380 tins out of the 100 cases as full and fit for the merchant, and 476 out ofthe 125 case parcel, out of 500 tins—that leaves forty-four tins to beaccounted for by landed empties and ullage—he has entered fifteen ullageand five tins landed empty out of the 400 tins, and fourteen ullage and ten</p>

               <p>empties out of the 500—the tins are numbered consecutively in the landingaccount—the first parcel is numbered 1 to 380—for receiving the castor oilfor the purpose of ullage, the tins would be opened where the plate is; where they have been originally filled, and for the purpose of emptying theyare opened at the corner—this one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is properly opened for thatpurpose; it ought to be a little closer to the corner, perhaps; still it is notout of the way—I never knew a tin opened in the way this one is (<hi rend="italic">another tin produced</hi>)—there is also an entry in the prisoner's writing of two parcels, 125 and 150 cases of castor oil from the <hi rend="italic">Vibillia</hi>—the first parcel is atpage thirteen, of 125 cases from the <hi rend="italic">Vibillia</hi>; that would be 500 tins—hereturns 492 as the number made up full for the merchant, and eight tinsullage empty—there are no landed empties in that parcel—the next parcelfrom the <hi rend="italic">Vibillia</hi> is on the same page, 150 cases, 600 tins—he returns 591 full fur the merchant, and nine tins ullage empty—at page fifteen, thereis an entry in the prisoner's writing of 100 cases, that is 400 tins, from the <hi rend="italic">Saltwell</hi>—he returned 382 for the merchant, six tins ullage empty, and twelve landed empty—there were 225 cases by the <hi rend="italic">Queen Victoria</hi>, 275 by the <hi rend="italic">Vibillia</hi>, and 100 by the <hi rend="italic">Saltwell</hi>, making 600 altogether, which would be 2, 400 tins, and I find 2, 321 for the merchant, which leavesseventy-nine to be returned as either ullage or empties—I searched toascertain the number of tins on the premises, when the prisoner was takeninto custody—there ought to have been seventy-nine empty tins, and therewere only seventy-one, and we found ten opened in this improper manner, apparently with a chisel, the same implement as the others, but opened inthe middle to empty it in a mass instead of pouring it—the prisoner wouldnot be justified at any time in emptying castor oil down the well—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), is a sample bottle, and the merchants are supplied with samplesin these bottles—I never knew of castor oil being put in a wine bottle, ora workman's tin can, for the purpose of sampling—I know a workmancalled Bolton—he was engaged by the prisoner—they are paid by the hour, and it is on the foreman's certificate that they get their wages—Boltonmade a communication to me on the 8th August—I had heard the night before that he had been discharged by Venner—in consequence of what Bolton said, I spoke to Venner on the morning of 8th August—I said "Theman Bolton has been to me this morning and made a complaint that youdischarged him, and used blackguard language to him, and that he com<lb></lb>plained, and you told him to take his money and be off"—the prisoner saidhe was cheeky, and kept him twenty minutes for some men that he wanted—I said "I am not going to interfere between you and the men, but thisfellow charges you with having set aside a certain quantity of castor oil, full tins of castor oil, and returned them to the merchant as empties. Isthere any truth in this charge that he makes?"—he said "None whatever"—I told him I did not believe the man for a moment—he threatened us togo to the merchants, and report the fact to them—Venner said "I shalltreat the matter with the contempt it deserves, and order him off thepremises"—I told the man to go about his business—the conversation with Venner took place in his own office, and also in the cellar—we continued itus we went down stairs—I pointed out some tins in the cellar, and said "What are those set aside there?"—I found they were duty-marked tins, that is in consecutive numbers, and that satisfied me at that time—when Icame back to the wharf afterwards, I told him the merchants had been in<lb></lb>formed by Bolton, and that if I could get the complaint in writings we,</p>

               <p>that is Stephens &amp; Co., would prosecute for a malicious libel—that was theway we treated it at that time, with full confidence in Venner—I did nothave any conversation with the prisoner about the well—I knew nothingabout that until he was in charge—the value of the castor oil is about 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been in the habit of seeing tins opened, more orless, for thirty years—I have not seen tins opened in a much roughermanner when they are leaky; you could not 611 an aperture from such ahole as this—there are only ten cases opened in this rough way on thepremises—the number of empties returned by the prisoner was seventy-nine, and there were only seventy-one—that leaves eight to be accountedfor—when tins are empty they are put in various places out of the way—there are a great many people who have business in and out of the wharf—it would be most improper if tins were leaking to put them on the steps ofthe well, because we have got square troughs holding four tins each, thecontents of an entire case, in which leaky tins are put to prevent the loss byullage—if I found any so placed by the well I should find fault with it; it would be a very irregular proceeding—when the <hi rend="italic">Queen Victoria</hi> parcelarrived we had not got those troughs; it arrived unexpectedly, and therewas a great deal of loss and waste in the yard and on the quay from thebad condition of the packages—we had given the order for the troughs, but they did not arrive until the next parcel was worked—I have seen castoroil tins placed on the flooring on the way to the vaults, but not leaky ones—I should find fault if I found any there—when Bolton made the complaintmy impression was that it was entirely false, and that impression remaineduntil the 9th or 10th September—in the meantime Bolton had been to themerchants—I called on them the same morning, and one of them complained—I tried to institute proceedings against Bolton the informant—I still dis<lb></lb>believed him, and endeavoured to convince the merchants that it was false—I should not have counted the tins unless there had been suspicion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> We did not count them until the morning after theprisoner was in custody—we searched the premises to find all theempties that were there—the absence of the eight tins would be amatter of suspicion, but we should not have counted them except undersuspicion—some of the empty tins were in one cellar and some in another—strangers never go down in the cellar alone; some one connected withthe concern takes them—cotton is stowed on the wooden platform in thecellar—it would be very wrong to put leaky tins on the same floor ascotton—the tins are repaired up stairs, on a level with the street—thetroughs are used to put the tins in when they are being repaired—untilwe had the troughs the oil ran into the gutters and into the street, notdown the well.</p>

               <p>the 125 cases were brought from the <hi rend="italic">Vibillia</hi>—I helped to unpack them—six tins were landed empty—the prisoner asked me how many tins therewere landed empty—I told him six, and he said "You go down to the furtherend of the wharf, you will find some empty tins; pick out six of the worstand bring them up on the wharf, and take six full ones down in the place ofthem"—I did so by his orders—the six full ones that I took down had not been weighed or marked—I put them where he told me to put the four, theywere piled along with the four—I can't say the date, but it was about afortnight after the others—he afterwards told me to bring one of the fulltins up to his office, which I did, and then he unlocked his desk and took ascrew-driver and broke a hole in the tin, and he brought out two glassbottles, and got half a sheet of paper and made it like a funnel, and then Ipoured the oil into the bottles and filled them—they were something likepickle bottles—I know how they sample oil; they were not sample bottles; they were bottles that held about a quart of oil each—he ordered me to takethe tin down again, which I did, and placed it along with the others—about two days after that he called me down to him and gave me two canslike bricklayers take their coffee in, and he said "Go down, Bolton, take alamp, and fill these two tin cans and bring them up to me, "which I did—I continued with Mr. Stephens until 7th of August—on that day I badsome dispute with the prisoner, and he told me to go and get my money, and I was discharged—I afterwards complained to Mr. Hadow about what I had seen.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wharfinger, and the owner of Gun Wharf—I went into business there on the 24th or 25th June, last—Venner entered my service at that time as superintendent—on 8th August, I received information from Mr. Hadow about Bolton's statement, and on Saturday morning, the 9th, I went down into the basement to examine the well—I put an iron bar down, and found a great quantity of oil in the well—I should say 4 or 5 inches all over, I could not tell exactly—I afterwards made another examination and found it had all disappeared—the water flows in and out of the well with the rise of the tide—I am not aware that there was any flooding in the cellar at that time—if there had been several inches of water in the cellar I should have seen it—at that time. I did not believe Bolton's statement, and the prisoner went on with his duties as usual.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was no water in the part where the castor oilwas—I have seen water there during the flood tides; about 14 inches or 2 inches—it gradually soaks away; it can't find its way to the well—itlooked as if there were 4 or 5 inches of oil in the well—it would be difficult to tell, because I must have touched the water—I tried to prevent the oil running down the rod—I had a very high opinion of Venner at that time—slight irregularities occur in the business, notwithstanding all precautions; my wish is that they should not, but they do occur.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187311240054"></xptr>
               <p>behind some empty packages on the floor, where two other cargoes werebeing worked, one under the superintendence of Arnold, and the otherunder the superintendence of Taylor—the gunny bag was evidently hiddenaway—another bag was found a few minutes afterwards by Mr. Stephens, further back among the empty packages—the two bags together weighedabout 1 cwt. and 17 lbs.—it was fine orange shellac, worth about 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—these are the two bags (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they were found on the topfloor—two parcels of garnet shellac were being made up at that time; the <hi rend="italic">Ambassador</hi> parcel was the only parcel of that description that we had hadon the wharf—I believe the shellac of the <hi rend="italic">Ambassador</hi> was on the premises, but it had been returned to the chests, and was made up and ready for themerchant—there were forty or fifty empty packages, behind which the bagswere found—shellac ought never to be put in bags of this description—Iknow of no excuse for putting this shellac in such bags as these—the sweep<lb></lb>ings might be put into a sack or bag—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a sample of sweep<lb></lb>ings, but the other is fine clean shellac, and should have been returned inthe chests—Arnold had made a communication to me with respect toshellac being put into gunny bags, and I had also had a communicationfrom Taylor to the same effect—I did not speak to the prisoner about whatthey had told me, but I read over to him later in the evening the state-meat they had made, and charged him—he said it was all a conspiracyand a lie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The shellac was found on the premises, and in the loftwhere it had been bulked—I am not certain whether any delivery of theshellac of the <hi rend="italic">Ambassador</hi> had taken place—shellac was never put into bagsto my knowledge, it would be irregular if it was—if I had found them pre<lb></lb>vious to any suspicion of felony or anything of the kind, I should haveasked Venner what it meant, and told him it looked very much as if hewas going to take them off the premises—it may have occurred before, butit would not be regular, and should not have occurred—they were behindbadly broken chests that were used for firewood, not chests in course ofrepair, had they been I should not have thought it any concealment—theywere broken up and used for dunnage in another part of the warehouse tokeep goods off the floor and for firewood—the bags could only have beenconveyed away by the aid of confederates in the shape of dishonest work<lb></lb>men, who would stow themselves away at night to assist in the robbery—the object of the felony was not accomplished by putting them behind thechests.</p>

I asked the prisoner how hecould account for it—he said there must be some mistake in the Calcuttaweights, the invoice shipping weights—my reply was "Hardly likely, Venner, as they weigh there so particularly to half a pound"—he then said that someof the chests might, in the cramped space in which we were working, havebeen run into other piles by accident—I said "It is a lame excuse, it is pos<lb></lb>sible but not probable"—nothing more passed between us—I was on the wharfby 8 o'clock the next morning; the prisoner was there at work—at that time the <hi rend="italic">Mysore</hi> cargo was being bulked and finished, and the <hi rend="italic">Malta</hi> cargo hadgone—in consequence of what Arnold said I made a search, and found thischest of shellac (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) amongst the empty packages—I saw the word "Malta" in pencil on one side of the chest, and "No. 187," the ship's rota<lb></lb>tion number—the tare was marked on it, 1 qr. 8 lbs.—I fetched a blackbrush and put a large star on the end of the chest and left it, with ordersthat it should not be moved—I gave those orders in the hearing of all themen who were working in that gang—about half-an-hour afterwards it hadbeen removed, and I found it at the end of the adjacent room, with theword shellac written on it, and "B.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-called</hi>). I am acquainted with the working of shellac—I have seen gunny bags used, and have used them myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It is three years ago since I worked any shellac—have seen several cargoes, and have permitted gunny bags to be used—sometimes the cargo is very free, and the freer it is the more difficult it is to get back into the cases, and in filling the oases you don't get half the quantity back, and it is necessary to raise the cases, and after filling at the bulk we remove them on one side, they are shaken down, and we get five or six gunny bags, perhaps, and fill the cases by degrees—they are used while the working is going on, and when the cases are taken a distance I from the bulk—by raising I mean enlarging the cases.</p>

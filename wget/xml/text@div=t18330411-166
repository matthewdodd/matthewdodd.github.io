               <p>JAMES CHAMBERS (Police-constable G 176). On the morning of the 13th of March I was in company with Collins in Tabernacle-walk - we met the prisoner with a stove on his shoulder, which we saw had been fresh pulled out; we followed him, and asked where he got it - he said from a house down the street, that a man gave it him to carry to Old-street, but the man was gone; we took him, and on inquiry we found an empty house with the door open - we went in, and missed a stove from there.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN COLLINS (Police-constable G 217). I was with Chambers - I went to the house in <placeName id="t18330411-166-crimeloc926">City-terrace, Old-street-road</placeName>

               <p>JOSEPH DELL. I live in John-street, Borough, and am employed by Mr. Thomas Letts, to superintend the repairs of his houses - he has a house at No. 11, City-terrace; I have seen this stove fitted there, and it fits exactly - it is the same pattern; Mr. Letts lives in the Wandsworth-road.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. A person in Tabernacle-walk asked me to carry it for him, and said he would give me sixpence.</p>

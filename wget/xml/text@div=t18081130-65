            . I am the officer of East Ham. I took the prisoner in custody and put him in the watch-house; I searched him, and found upon him thirteen penny pieces and one halfpenny, a knife and a key; I locked him up and went down to the stables where he looked after his horses; I unlocked the corn bin with the key I found upon him, and found seventeen penny pieces and seven halfpence in this bit of a lanthorn. I then told him that I had found this copper; he said he had taken them of Mr. Darton's foreman; I told him it had a very bad look of its being hid so; I told him he had better tell what became of the money that he received.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I cannot hear what he said - A. He told me he was robbed in a lane leading from Plaistow to East Ham by three foot pads; he had lost ten pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. to Young. How many penny pieces did you pay him - A. I cannot say the number; they were penny pieces and halfpence mixed together.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I received the money from my master, Mr. Darton, in the taproom of the Cheshire Cheese, in gold, silver, and copper, to the amount of ten pounds; he put the halfpence into a bag and tied them up; he put the gold and silver in a bag; he saw me put it in my pocket; I delivered the halfpence into the landlord's hands while I got my horses out of the stable; then I hung it on the cart. I went to Whitechapel, I found the halfpence out of the cart; I turned back, I was afraid I had not put the halfpence in the cart, although I am sure I had. I have been five years in my place.</p>

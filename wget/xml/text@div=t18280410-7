On the 5th of March, between six and seven, nearer to seven o'clock, I was in my kitchen, after having taken my tea; my servant alarmed me - I went up stairs, found the street door open, which leads to the passage; the shop door is inside of the passage; I am a tailor; in consequence of seeing some persons go from the door, I went into the shop, and discovered a quantity of cloth had been stolen off the shelf in the shop - it was broad cloth, not exceeding thirty-two yards in length and was worth at least 40l.; there had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100010"></xptr>been about forty six yards at first, it cost me 27s. 6d. a yard; I went out in pursuit to several different pawnbroker's; as I went into my shop, I trod on a coat which was on the floor and which coat was mine; it had laid on the cloth in my shop - I afterwards received information from two boys, named Clark and Spencer; I went to Mr. Hartley's, a bellhanger's, in Crown-street, Soho - I first saw his wife and asked if she was proprietor of the house, she referred me to her husband, who was in his working dress; I requested him to endeavour to recover my property, which I told him had been traced into his house; he allowed me to open two rooms in the house, but refused to shew me an upper room because I had not got a search-warrant - I found on the turn of the stairs in his house, two pieces of cloth which formed part of a coat that laid cut out on my board - I claimed it as mine. This was before I asked him to let me search the upper room; I should say he did not refuse to let me go up, but refused to let me go into the front room - the two pieces of cloth I found are in the officer's possession; I sent my apprentice for some officers - some persons came, who represented themselves to be officers, but they refused to proceed; I went to Bow-street, before Mr. Halls and got some officers - we examined Hartley's premises then without a warrant; they came to apprehend Hartley - they found no more of my property there; another piece of cloth was found on the step and brought to me by a lad who is here. Hartley was violent about the matter; I have got back three pieces of cloth - I might call it four as there was a double piece.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's servant. On the 5th of March, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, there was knock at the door; I went to the door and found a man there; I cannot positively swear to him, but believe the prisoner to be the man - I am not sure; he said he came from Mr. Watson's, in Fitzroy-square to take back some patterns: I said "Is it to Mr. Ponder;" he said, Yes - I went down to master leaving him in the passage; master came up - I did not go up with him; the man had dark clothes on, but I am not certain what colour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Whether it was black, blue or brown you cannot tell? A. No; master's passage is rather dark - it was dusk.</p>

On the night in question, I was near Mr. Ponder's house; I live in King-street - I was in George-yard, which comes into Prince's-street and Macclesfield-street, which is at the bottom of Dean-street; Mr. Ponder's apprentice came to me in George-yard, and after that I saw three men taking a roll of cloth away - they were carrying it away: I saw them take it from right opposite the shop door of Mr. Slater in George-yard, where I work. The prisoner put the cloth on his shoulder - I am sure he is the person; he carried it away - he went up King-street, which leads towards Crown-street; I followed and saw him go into Mr. Hartley's house, the bell-hanger's, in Crown-street: I am certain I saw him go in there; the other two men went away - Hartley's door was open; he shut it when he went in - my little brother and James Herrol were with me; I went back and told Mr. Ponder - I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it not rather dusky? A. Yes - but the shops were lighted; I was at play in the yard; Clark and Herrol, two little boys were with me in the yard; they were before the Magistrate, but were too young to be examined; I did not know the prisoner before - I could not see what colour his coat was - I could only see that it was a dark coat with gilt buttons; I am learning the tailor's business.</p>

            . I keep this house; the prisoner came to my house on the 20th of March, 1827, and has lodged there ever since - I do not know what he is, but I always supposed him to be waiter at a gambling house, from his style of dressing; I remember Mr. Ponder coming to the house - I immediately let him into the rooms.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did you not refuse him admission into any rooms, but the two on the first floor? A. He went to the second floor; I did refuse him admission without a search-warrant; it was through an irritation of mind.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, you knew the honesty of all your lodgers, and refuse to let him search without a warrant? A. I did. Two pieces of cloth had then been found; I did not directly refuse admission - not till the irritation was produced by the crowd round the door; I did not see the prisoner come in with any thing that evening; the pieces of cloth were found on the first floor stairs, which lead to the prisoner's room; he was not at home at that time to my knowledge; Mr. Ponder went into his room with me at first, and he was not there.</p>

On the evening of the 5th of March, I cannot recollect whether he was in the house at the time Mr. Ponder came - I was at home, and saw him go out about half-past six o'clock, and saw him go out a second time at half-past seven o'clock; Mr. Ponder had been to the house then; he was not there when the prisoner went out.</p>
               <p>Q. He had gone away for an officer, had he? A. He was gone away, I do not know what for; when the prisoner went out the first time, at half-past six o'clock, he was dressed in white stockings and shoes, light breeches, and a dark green coat; I did not see him come in, but saw him go out again at half-past seven o'clock, with a pipe, smoking, in his mouth; he had not changed his coat - he still went out in the dark green coat; he did not light his pipe at my fire; he might have both fire and candle in his own room for what I knew; I never go into his room.</p>

            . I know this piece of cloth; it was cut by me, and wrapped up about three quarters of a yard into the whole piece of cloth, and it is part of the same piece of cloth as was lost - it is black; I have no doubt whatever of it being mine - it is my own cutting.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you swear to the cutting or the private mark? A. To the cutting - it is a piece which came out of a coat which I had recently cut, and which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100011"></xptr>laid on the board, and the cloth must be in an uneven shape to produce two such pieces as these; it is very much to the disadvantage of the owner to produce two such pieces of cloth.

                  </hi>. I reside at Ruyslip, North wood—on Wednesday night, ✗0th June, my house was fastened up and made secure, between ten and eleven o'clock—my sister and I were the only inmates—my sister is afflicted and generally unwell—about half-past twelve I was going to her bedroom and I heard the breaking of a window—I threw up my window, looked out, and gave an alarm—I did not see any one—shortly after that I heard another crash, upon that, I ran down stairs, and went out at the front door into the garden, and the door closed after me—there were some cottages at the bot<lb></lb>tom of the garden, and I called to the inmates to come and assist me—I waited there some time, and three of them came up with me—one of those was the prisoner's father—the prisoner had lived in my service—one of them got through the window over the porch that had two panes broken and one cracked—on entering the sitting-room, we found it very much disordered—a table turned over and different things on the floor—we then went into the dining-room, but we did not see anything there at that time—we went up stairs, and in my bedroom there were three chairs overturned, the look<lb></lb>ing glass drawn to the edge of the table, and the counterpane and the curtains very much soiled—I had money which I kept in the drawers in my bed-room—that had not been disturbed—we then came down and went up again, and on coming down the second time, we heard some one breathe in the dining-room—a person named Tyler, went in and found the prisoner there—I saw him myself in the corner of the room—the table always stood in the corner, and it had been moved away, and he had got between the table and the corner—there was a large coal-scuttle there—he was between that and the wall—I declined to give him into custody at that time—his father had been protecting me, and finding that this man was his own son, my feelings overcame me at the time, and I refused to give him in charge—on my pointing out to the prisoner the breakage of the windows, he said he was willing to pay the damage—I told him the money was no object to me—I ultimately took the money—I gave no guarantee that I should not prosecute him—I said I should prosecute him afterwards if I thought fit—my sister was in another bed-room, not in the one I have spoken of.</p>

               <p>I had taken the 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I addressed the prisoner as "Joe"—his hat was found on the lawn—there were two or three shillings lying on the table in the parlour I think—that was untouched, but drawn down on the floor with the cloth and glasses—none of the drawers were tampered with—there was a good deal of surprise when we found out who it was who had entered the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I live within 100 yards of Miss Kirby's house—I heard the alarm and went to assist her—I got a ladder and got in at the window which is over twelve feet high—there was a water-butt at the window—a man could get from the water-butt to the window by stepping on to the porch—the window was thrown up, and the panes broken—I undid three doors and let them all in—we afterwards found the prisoner lying down in the corner of the dining-room—he said he was drawn in by a man—his father was there, and Miss Kirby said, through kindness to him, she would not give the prisoner into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I went to give assistance, and got in by one of the doors—I found the prisoner in the corner of the parlour—the table was upset, and he was lying on the legs—I was obliged to remove the table—I said, "It is Joe Field"—he did not answer then—he said in the passage it was not him that did it; he was coming down the lane, and saw a man getting over Miss Kirby's gate; that he caught hold of his legs, and the man dragged him over the gate, and then to the water-butt, and then up the water-butt, into the house; of course, I could not believe that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you mean there was anything concealing him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, partially—I was obliged to move the table before I could get at him—he could be easily seen on entering the room with a light—I have known him about eleven years, and all that time he has borne an exemplary character—I heard of the marriage of the rector's daughter—the people were not enjoying themselves that I am aware of—the prisoner had been drinking.</p>

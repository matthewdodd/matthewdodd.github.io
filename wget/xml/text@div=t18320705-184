            . I am keeper of a lock, at Lime-house. Mr. Dixon's premises are up the cut, and any thing that goes to or from there, must pass my lock to get into the Thames - he keeps an account with me for what passes belonging to him; a man named Foreman was in Mr. Dixon's employ in April, 1831: on the 8th of that month Foreman had a piece of timber in the lock, which he was taking in the direction towards the Thames - there was not water enough to get it out of the lock; it being a wet morning, I

            . I am in the employ of a wharfinger, at Stone-stairs wharf, Ratcliff. On the 8th of April, 1831, the prisoner came to my master's wharf, a little after six o'clock in the morning, and said he wanted a piece of timber landed; a man named Baxter came there afterwards, and joined the prisoner up the wharf: they asked me to get the handle on the crane to land the timber, but I saw no timber and wanted them to come in out of the wet - I opened the shed for them to come in; the prisoner then said he wanted a piece of timber landed very bad, for the sawyers was standing still, and so was the building - in about half an hour I saw a stick of timber brought by Foreman: I did not notice in what direction it came, as I was busy getting the handles on the crane and the dogs - it seemed to me to come up as the tide was coming up; they then asked me to lower the crane for the timber - I said they had better wait till there was a little more water, but they were in a hurry, and they got the dogs out to land it- if they had waited a quarter of an hour, they could have landed it without the crane; when they had got it on the cart, the prisoner asked what the wharfage was - I asked if he was the gentleman who had been with my master the night before; he said Yes, and that he had more timber coming - he then paid me a 1s., and took it away; I noticed the mark 34 rased on the timber.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. I believe the prisoner got the 1s. from Baxter? A. Yes he did - I do not know what the prisoner is; I gave evidence against Boxter and Foreman - one was tried for stealing, and the other for receiving this timber.</p>

            . I am a carman. On the 8th of April, 1831, the prisoner came to my master, about seven o'clock in the morning; he asked me to take a piece of timber to Poplar - I was to take a cart to Stone-stairs wharf, to fetch it; I agreed to do it - he then went away, and came again in about twenty minutes; he blowed me up because I was not ready, and said his men were standing still - I said it was such a wet morning, it was impossible for them to work; he said if I did not be quick, he would get a truck and take it, for down it must go - I went with him, and the timber was loaded; I took it to Baxter's yard, at Poplar.</p>

            . I am a blacksmith. On the 8th of April in last year, I saw the prisoner and Baxter in the East India-road, about half-past six o'clock in the morning, near the turupike - they were in discourse together, and went away in the direction of Limehouse; I returned soon after, and saw the prisoner and Baxter, and a piece of timber near Baxter's premises - I heard the prisoner tell him he had got the timber cheap enough, but it came by this, holding up his finger in a bent direction; Baxter made some observation on the premises, and said he had neither axe nor adze there - he then rubbed his foot on the ground, and rubbed it on the timber, in the prisoner's presence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What was done, was done in the prisoner's presence and in yours? A. Yes - the prisoner knew me; Baxter and he did not whisper together - the dogs are things that lay hold of timber in a grasping way.</p>

            . I live at a coffee-shop in the Commercial-road. On a Thursday in April, 1831, Baxter came in and sat down in the parlour - the prisoner then came and said he wanted to speak to him; I called him to him, and I heard the prisoner say, as he was going out of the passage, "You will meet me at five o'clock tomorrow morning" - next morning they came to our house again, to breakfast, and while they were at breakfast, I gave the prisoner a second cup of coffee; Baxter said he could very well afford to pay for it, as he had given him 5s. more for the timber than he had agreed for; and the prisoner said, had he not been distressed for money, he could not have afforded to sell it to him, or to his own father for that, and he could not have sold it at that rate had he not had it in liea of some laths of a man and his son, who had set up a new timber yard in the Commercial-road - Baxter said, "I am perfectly satisfied, if it is all right;" and the prisoner answered, "You don't suppose Bill that I would deceive you."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is this the first time of your appearance here? A. Yes; I am housekeeper to the person who keeps the coffee-shop - he was game-keeper to a gentleman for many years, named Mason; I am married, but I do not know where my husband is - I have been parted from him for ten years; Baxter was particular in inquiring if the timber was all right, and the prisoner said so help him God it was - Baxter was taken up on the Saturday morning, and his parents thought that it was essential that Mr. Mason should come, but I did not come; I went to Baxter when he was in prison, to know how Mr. Mason was to be paid, but I did not speak to him, because his mother came with me - Mason was not paid; I understand that Baxter was innocent, but I did not come on his behalf - I had not been to see Baxter or Foreman after they were convicted; I only went to Baxter to know how he had arranged for Mr. Mason to be paid - it is my duty to collect his debts; I have seen Mr. Dixon several times, but have not talked this matter over with him.</p>

            . I am a timber-merchant; my premises are in Limehouse-reach. At the time this happened the prisoner and Foreman were in my employ - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050090"></xptr>knew nothing of Baxter till I found the timber in his yard; there was my mark R. D. on it, but it was partly obliterated with road dirt, as if by a shoe, with nails in it - there was the mark of the measure of the timber and the name of the ship; the prisoner was my lath-render, but he did not come to his work after this - I did not see him till the officer took him twelve months afterwards.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How was the prisoner paid? A. Weekly; he was with me mine or ten months - he was subject to ill-health, and did not work the whole week; sometimes he had other masters, and used sometimes to work for them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you find the timber? A. On Saturday morning, the 9th of April; it was on the water at my premises on the 7th, and fastened by a chain and staples.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 4, New Court, Farringdon-street—I am a town-traveller—on the night in question, about 2 o'clock, I was near my home, in Farringdon-street—while I was there the prisoner and another female came up to me; she caught hold of my arm and said, "Where are you going?"—I then took them into a public-house and treated them—we remained there about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—we came out together—when I came out, I met one of my friends; he came up and</p>

               <p>spoke to me, and we walked down Farringdon-street—I and one female walked together, and my friend and the other female walked together—when we got up to Newcastle-street I stopped and talked to her—all at once I felt a tug at my watch-guard—I called out, "I have lost my watch"—then the prisoner ran away—I put my hand in my pocket and found it was gone—I knew it was safe when she was walking with me, just before—when the prisoner ran away, my friend stopped her—I immediately ran and got hold of the prisoner—I saw one of her hands closed, and I said, "Here is my watch"—at that time a policeman came up, and she dropped the watch into my hand—there was no other woman close when she dropped the watch; the other woman had gone away—upon that I gave her into custody, the policeman kept the watch, and it is here now—this is the watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

I live at 5, New-court, Farringdon-street, and am a draughtsman—I met the last witness outside a public-house on that night; he was talking with two females; one of them was the prisoner at the bar—one of the females spoke to me—I did not go into the public-house—I was not drinking with them—soon after, the prisoner and the last witness went down Newcastle-street—I spoke to the prosecutor about going home, and he said he would—I soon after heard him call out, "I have lost my watch," and then saw the prisoner running away—I ran and stopped her—I said nothing about the watch—when I spoke to the prosecutor about coming home, I turned back, thinking he was following me, and I then heard him cry out.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 224). About 2 o'clock on the morn<lb></lb>ing when this occurred, in consequence of hearing a cry, I ran up to New<lb></lb>castle-street—I was passing on duty near there—I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor—I saw the prisoner running, and the prosecutor after her; and he called out, "I have lost my watch"—he caught hold of her hand, and they wrestled—he handed me the watch, and gave her in custody—she said nothing—he charged her with stealing his watch.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was not in the prosecutor's company; I saw him and a female pulling each other about. As I passed him, he took hold of me, and asked me if I would have some gin. I said, "I never take spirits;" he said, "Have some lemonade." I went into the public-house, and remained there about an hour; I then left him; when I got near to the Old Bailey, he ran after me, and said, Young woman, do you know anything about my watch?" he said, "I have lost my key and watch; either you or the other female must know something about it; and if you</p>

               <p>do not return it to me, I shall take you up." I said, "There is a policeman you had better speak to him." He then gave me in charge; when we got to the station-house, the prosecutor took the guard from his neck, and gave it to the policeman. I did not take the watch; I am quite innocent of the charge.</p>

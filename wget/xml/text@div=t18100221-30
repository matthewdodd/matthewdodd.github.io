             is my partner. On Friday evening, I think it was the 2nd of February, between seven and eight, I was in the accompting house, I saw the prisoner standing over a tub of butter, his back was towards me, I saw him take up the tub of butter, put it on his shoulder, and run off with it, I run through the shop as fast as I could; immediately I got to the door I called out stop thief in several directions, he ran down Skinner-street with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you follow him - A. No. I turned back for fear another should go.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the man - A. I did not see the man's face. I have no doubt that he is the man by his back appearance.</p>

            . I am a brush maker by trade. I was standing at Mr. Hems's window, I saw this man hoist up a firkin of butter on his shoulder, he immediately crossed the road and ran up Skinner-street; I pursued him; when he found he was closely pursued he threw down the tub of butter; a man knocked him down and stopped him; I did not see him stopped; he was brought back. I am sure the prisoner is the man that had the tub of butter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You are a new witness, you were not before the Lord Mayor - A. No, I was not. I was coming by last night and Mr. Hems asked me if I saw this man.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Studd, oilman, in Bishopsgate-street. I was coming out of my master's house when Mr. Hems cried out stop thief. I asked Mr. Hems which way the man was gone; Mr. Hems being confused did not tell which way the man was gone, and I being confused, and having a cask stole the night before; I ran up Skinner-street, I saw the man running with something like a trunk on his shoulder, I did not know what it was till I came close to him, then I saw it was a tub, and just as I got to the side of him I heard the tub fall on the road, I turned round and saw the cask rolling from the middle of the road into the kennel; I still kept my eyes on the prisoner and pursued him; he was stopped by two men coming down the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the man who dropped the tub - A. Yes; because there was no other man near.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. It is very odd - you say you were confused, and all of you were so confused you took a cask for a trunk - A. When I came to it I found it was a cask.</p>
               <p>Q. You lost sight of him - A. Only while I turned my head to look at the cask.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Please you, my lord, I had been into Red Lion-street, Spitalfields, and after that I came from Union-street into Bishopsgate-street; my wife was with me; she said she would go to buy some things to bring home for tea, she asked me to get the kettle to boil, I said I would; I crossed the way and went on to Skinner-street, which is my nearest way home; when I got four or five hundred yards down Skinner-street I heard the cry of stop thief; I had not gone far before a man rushed by me and ran down Angel-alley, in a few minutes after I was laid hold of, and knocked down; my eye was swelled up with the blow, I thought I should have lost it; I was never in the gentleman's shop nor on the side the shop was, after I came out of Sun-street.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

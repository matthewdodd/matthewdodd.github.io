            . I am a livery-stable keeper, and live in Keppel-mews, North. On the 30th of September, I saw the prosecutor and prisoner scuffling together - I stopped and said, "Halloo, what is the matter?" - the prosecutor said, "I have lost a handkerchief, and this man has got it," and all at once the handkerchief brushed by me from the prisoner's hand - he threw it down or dropped it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The witness himself was accused of it, an then he swore I had taken it. Witness. The prosecutor thought I was concerned - I saw the prisoner throw it away- when I found the prosecutor thought I was concerned, I went to the watch-house, and gave my card - the prosecutor kept the prisoner till he got him to the watch-house.</p>

About the 27th or 28th of July, I went abroad with my family—I left my family in France—I was absent from home about four days—I was then backwards and forwards, leaving the prisoner, who was my servant, in custody of my house—I left my coat there, and missed it when I came home—this is the coat I left.</p>

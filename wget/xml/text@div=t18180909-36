When I went into the house my mother-in-law was in bed, she got out of bed, called me carroty b-ch, and struck me three times on the head with her fist; my father came to take my part, she caught hold of his shirt, he had done nothing to her, nor said anything to her; he then gave her a slight push to keep her off me, and told her to go to bed; she fell down with her head against the foot of the bedstead.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he did not strike her-A. I am; he only slightly pushed her. I desired her to let me help her up into bed - She said she would lay there. She got up at last without assistance, and went to bed-my father went to bed to her, and I went to bed in the next room. About eight o'clock next morning my father came to me, and said she was very ill; I went to her, she complained of her head. I fetched Mrs. Bennett. She died on Tuesday evening about eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you with her much - A. Almost all the time; she complained of her head very much, but nothing else. I fetched my father from work on Monday, he came, and an officer took him at the gate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. REYNOLDS. My father was quite sober. She struck me very violently, three times, and tore my father's shirt all to pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. To prevent her hurting you he pushed her away - A. Yes, slightly; the surgeon was sent for on Monday morning. She was addicted to drinking.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I was called in to attend the deceased on Monday morning, about ten o'clock. She only complained of her head. I examined, and found a slight mark over her left temple, which did not appear to me of any importance - She appeared scarcely sensible; I saw her again in the evening, her symptoms were aggravated, and continued to increase. On Tuesday morning, about five o'clock, I was called to her, and found her labouring under apoplectic symptoms, which increased until she died that evening at eight o'clock. She died labouring under apoplectic symptoms. I opened the body, and found the right hemisphere of the brain completely covered with coagulated blood; the heart was large and fat, and the liver appeared as if she was addicted to drinking.</p>
               <p>Q. From these appearances, of what do you say she died - A. From the bursting of a blood vessel in the brain.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you any reason to think she died from any external violence - A. Certainly not; there was no external mark on the side where the vessel was ruptured.</p>

On the 8th of April I had a diamond ring safe on a ring-tray, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon—I missed it at eight o'clock in the evening—I acquainted the landlady of it immediately—the only person on whom I could fix suspicion was John Simpson—he used to bring coals from a person I have coals of, and he had brought me some that day—his master was sent for, and then he was sent for—he denied all knowledge of it—I had hand-bills circulated—I at lost got to Mr. Thompson's—I there saw my ring, and knew it—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one.</hi>) <hi rend="smallCaps">FREDERICK COLLINS</hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Thompson, a pawnbroker. On the 14th of April, the prisoner Ann Simpson came to the shop—she wished to redeem some things—she gave in three duplicates, and then she said she wished to pawn a ring—she showed it me, and said she wanted as much as I could let her have for it—I saw it was valuable, and I said would 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. do for it?—she said, "No"—I said, would 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. do? she said, "Yes"—I then told her to wait till I sent to a lady—she said she could not, her children were at home—she left the ring, and I sent to the prosecutrix, who came and identified it—Ann Simpson came again and she was given in charge—she said the ring was given to her by her mistrees six years ago.</p>

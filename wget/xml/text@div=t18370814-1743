                  </hi>. I am clerk to my father, who is a messenger in the Bankruptcy Court. I produce a fiat of bankruptcy against the prisoner, dated 1st December, 1835—it has been enrolled—I attended the various meetings which were held under this fiat—the prisoner attended them, and I never heard him protest against the proceedings—he submitted himself to the Commissioners under the fiat, and obtained from them his protection</p>

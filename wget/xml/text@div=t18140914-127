            No. As I took hold of Catherine Henley, the other ran off as fast as she could. Directly I saw her run, I felt in my pocket, and missed my watch. I charged Henley with having a hand in stealing the watch. I said she knew who the other girl was; she said, no, she had never seen her before that night. I told her if she would tell me where to find Norris, I would let her go; she told me she would not tell, because she did not know. I left her with the watchman, and charged her with stealing my watch. I have seen my watch since.</p>

               <p>GEORGE SQUIB. I was constable of the night. I apprehended Norris about four or five days after the transaction, in Puckeridge-street, St. Giles's; I told her if she would give up the duplicate of the watch, Mr. Wood would forgive her; she said, she had not got the duplicate, a friend pawned it for her, his name was

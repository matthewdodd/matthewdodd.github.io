               <p>31st July, about 11.10 p.m., the prisoner tendered me a bad half-crown for a glass of ale; I told him it was bad, and it was not the first time he had tendered bad money there—he said that it was the first he had been in the house—I recalled the circumstance to him, and he said, "Yes, I was here once before"—I said "You have been hare more than that," and that I had got a bad shilling which he passed 12 or 14 days before—he said that he had not; I gave him in charge with the half-crown.</p>

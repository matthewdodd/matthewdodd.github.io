               <p>Why? - Because they had been long suspected. About 12 o'clock that same night, as I was coming up Holborn, just by the Bull and Gate, I saw Hollis take off his great-coat, and give it M'Coul to go into Masters's shop to pawn it; I had not been there long before a young fellow of the name of Rose came by, in two or three minutes Upton and Davis came; I said to the young fellow, Will you assist me? he said he would; I laid hold of Upton directly, Davis set off running, I ran after him into Red-lion-street, there we over took him; from

               <p>Where was he at ten o'clock? - With me; and we had part of a cold calf's head for supper, the remains of what we had for dinner.</p>

               <p>What time did he go to bed? - After supper, about eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Are you certain of that? - Yes: he dined about two o'clock; he went out after he had dined, and came home about seven in the evening.</p>
               <p>You are positive of that? - Very sure; he staid at home and we supped, and I was very happy to think I had him at home, and said, I hope you will never be in trouble any more; he said, No, he would go to sea as soon as he could get a birth: I told him, I feared he would be hanged if he did not.</p>

When I went to the apartment, I found the door had been unlocked, and the things I heard had been lost, all the things mentioned in the indictment. I have seen one cap since. Yesterday week I met the prisoner in Golden-lane; I laid hold of her, and asked her for my things; she said if I would let her loose, she would let me have them; I let her loose, and she ran away; I caught hold of her again, and she struck me, and told me I should not have them at all. I followed her home, up a court in Whitecross-street; she shut the door against me; I then sent for a constable, he came and took her in custody; he searched her box in my presence, and found a cap in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever found the other things - A. No, she has given them away. I am sure the cap is mine.</p>

No; a man and his wife of the name of Smith took the room; Mrs. Hewitt was in the habit of coming backwards and forwards frequently to this man and his wife that was in the house; I let them the room at three shillings and sixpence a-week; in a fortnight the man absconded, and in another week the woman absconded; after she was gone I employed my brother, who is a carpenter, to break the door open; I suppose it is a month or five weeks ago; the next day I employed her to clean out the room for another lodger; she brought me a band box into the kitchen; the things were shook out, there was a habit shirt, a cap, and handkerchief, very old things; I told her to put them in the club room; the girl behaving something improper to a customer, I parted with her.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after they were put in the club room that you parted with the prisoner - A. A week or ten days; I never looked after the things; I did not suppose that she would touch them; after I had discharged the girl the prosecutrix came the next morning to my house, she said she had left some things; I sent for this band box down, on her examining the band box; she said there were not all the things that she left in the house, and she wished to know where the girl was; when the girl came to me I told her she was liable to be taken up for taking the things away; she brought some things back again, that I had never seen before; she sent them to the person at the next door, and they brought them into my house.</p>
               <p>Q. These things which the prisoner brought back were they claimed by the prosecutrix - A. Yes; she had them all from my house; she claimed them as her own; this was near a month before the prisoner was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Before you saw this girl and caused her to be taken up, had you found any thing at Curnock's of yours that you left there - A. What she left next door I did; they are not the things mentined in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Austin left her lodgings without paying her rent, did not she - A. Yes, she did; I have not seen her since.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 12th of May I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner in Shrewsbury-court, White-cross-street, at her lodgings; Mrs. Hewitt gave her in charge for stealing a number of articles in her band box, left at Mr. Curnocks house; the prisoner said she had nothing belonging to her; the prisoner shewed me her box; I found a cap in it; Mrs. Hewit claimed it; the prisoner said it was not Mrs. Hewitt's cap; I have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>The cap produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I brought these things down in the kitchen, my master said take these things away or kick them away; when I came from the place being a poor girl I took these two or three things, they were not of much consequence.</p>
               <p>Curnock. I desired her to put them in the club room the things that were taken away were never brought down to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that the cap which is produced now in evidence was never in the box - A. I cannot take my oath upon it, I do not think it was; there were two boxes.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Had you any other box than the band box - A. I had a small trunk and band box; the trunk was locked; she did not break it open.</p>

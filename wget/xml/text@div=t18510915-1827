I was entrusted to make up a case of mousseline-de-laines and merinos for Messrs. Candy and Co.—I made the entry in my own writing, and put into the box thirty-four pieces of mousseline-de-laine of various colours, and two pieces of merino—the box was then taken down-stairs, into the lower room, and weighed—I took the weight of the goods from the scale, and put it down in ny book—the box was afterwards taken to the Douane, where the goods were examined by the Customs' officers, and the box was corded and leaded; I made out this invoice (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and gave it to the carrier—the mark on the box was "C. C. &amp; C. 704"—I did not see it put into the cart—I left it there—it was in course of transmission for Havre—the pieces of merino were of a very valuable character, of very fine texture, and only made on order—we received the order to make this from Messrs. Caady and Co.—we do make it for other persons.</p>

C. <hi rend="italic">&amp;</hi> Co.," on it, and some figures, but I cannot recollect what they were—Winter was not present; I believe my wife was—the box contained thirty-four pieces of Paris de laines (the tickets attached to each piece were marked), and two pieces of Paris merino—they were all counted, taken out of the box, and packed on my drawers in the back-room for that evening—Whicher took two pieces out, and said one would do for himself, and one would do for me—they were both put together; one was green, and the other maroon—they were both taken from my house on the Monday evening when the others were taken—Whicber came the next evening, and packed up these two pieces by themselves, and took them to the Mitre—Winter came about 10 on the Sunday, and there were patterns taken of the other pieces, and he said he could take them to a man to see if he could sell them; and he took them away—I met him the same day in Crown-street, and be told me Abrahams and Myers were coming to look at these goods at 2 at my house—he had not mentioned their names to me before—I knew them—I said I would not have them coming there on a Sunday—I had a gentleman and his wife and son and another lady lodgers in my house—they were generally at home—I said I would not have them come on the Sunday, because I did not wish them to come to my house at all—I went the same day to the Mitre with Whicher, and Winter was there first—Abrahams and Myers came in afterwards—Abrahams wanted to know what they wanted for the merinos and de laines, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was asked—I believe I asked that myself—I am not exactly confident that that was in the presence of Whicher—in the course of the after<lb></lb>noon, Whicher said he wondered whether George Senior would buy, and said to me, "You had better go there, and take him some patterns"—Senior keeps the Black Dog, in Sun-street, Bishopsgate—I went there in the even<lb></lb>ing, saw Senior, and left the patterns with him—in consequence of what he said to me, I went the next morning to him—he promised to take me some<lb></lb>where, but did not—I called again on the following day, Tuesday, and again on Wednesday—on the Friday morning I received a message, in consequence of which I went to Senior's house, and found Senior and the prisoner Sayward in the bar-parlourboth looking at the patterns—Say ward asked me what I wanted for them—I said, "1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard"—I had never seen him before—he said he would not give 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; he would write on a bit of paper what he would give me, and he wrote the figure "8"—I said, "You must give me another 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard for it"—he said he did not mind giving me 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard extra for the two pieces of black merino, but not for the others—he asked how many yards there were in each piece, and I said they were marked 58 on the ticket—he said he should like to see a whole piece, and I fetched the two pieces we had taken to the Mitre—I showed them to him—he said they were generally short measure, and they were reckoned at 56 yards to each piece instead of 58—Senior then fetched a little book, I think it was called a ready-reckoner, and said to Sayward, "What do you make it come to?"—Senior said he</p>

Sayward said, "We have not got it, we have sold it all, there were two pieces" I said, "Let us have a look; where do you keep the black?" he went to another part of the counter, and produced some black; Mr. Wilson immediately put his hand on one piece and said, "That is ours;" Sayward said, "I did not know we had got it, I thought it was sold, I sold it for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per yard"—I took him into custody on the Friday; on searching him I found several letters, and a written paper.</p>

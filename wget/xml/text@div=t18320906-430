At the next house to me there were some bricklayers' repairs going on at the back of my premises; on the 9th of August Read came and asked me to allow him to go down stairs and remove a large stone at a place which they were going to break up - I went down into my cellar with him, and helped him to remove the stone; I did not see Neale at that time, but between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I saw Neale, who was the labourer, drunk- I had allowed him to fetch water from the pump in my cellar: I went down in about an hour, found my winecellar door open, and missed between two and three dozen of wine.</p>

            . I am pot-boy to the prosecutor. I went down into his cellar, and found the wine-cellar had been forced open, but I did not know that any wine was gone; the prisoners were working in Mr. Robinson's cellar on the other side of the brick wall - they could get from one cellar to the other; I saw that Neale was tipsy when he came into our kitchen for water - he broke part of the dresser; he said he was not tipsy - I said he was, and I would not go away: their master then came there, and when he was gone I asked them how they got so tipsy - they said they had been drinking some porter; I asked where - they told me, and then I found they had been drinking some finings; I then went to look at our taps, to see if they dripped, and knocked down a bottle of wine which stood there; I asked where they got that from - they said from where the bottled ale stood; I said it was wine, and I gave it to them to smell - they threw it behind them into Mr. Robinson's cellar; I then asked them how much more they had taken - Read said five bottles - he told Neale to give me back what he had, and he gave me back three - one of them was ale, and the cork had been drawn.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You stopped a long time in the cellar? A. Yes; I did not take any myself; they were both tipsy, and hardly knew what they were saying; I saw no bottle of wine but the one that was broken.</p>

             (Police-constable A 86.) I was sent for, and informed the cellar had been broken; I watched to see if any thing was taken away - I saw one of them come up and look, and then I saw Neale come up with a hod on his shoulder - I stopped him, and found in the hod four bottles of wine; I took two of them - he threw the others down and tried to get off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he not tipsy? A. He had been drinking, but he could walk and run very well; he walked to Bow-street afterwards - he was not tipsy.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What could become of the two dozen? A. I do not know; four of the ten I found were broken, and six are here - there had been a cork drawn of the ale, but I believe they had only just tasted that; they might have taken some wine at dinner time.</p>

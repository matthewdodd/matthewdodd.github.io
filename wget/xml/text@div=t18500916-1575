                  </hi>. I am the wife of Victor Fennett, hair-dresser, of 5, Duke-street, Grosvenor-square. On 20th Aug., about eleven o'clock in the morning, I went to Mr. Woodward's office, and saw the prisoner—I paid him 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for rent—three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note—I saw him write this memorandum, which he gave me—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Memorandum, Mrs. Fennett has left 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of rent, a stamped receipt to be sent.—E.

                  </hi>. I live at 27, Bouverie-street, Whitefriars. The prisoner was my clerk—it was his duty to attend to the general business of the office, and to receive money in my absence—on 21st Aug. I was absent until the evening—it was tbe prisoner's duty to insert the names of callers in a book in the office—Mrs. Fennett's name is not there on 21st Aug.—there is only one other name that day—the prisoner has never accounted to me for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. received on that day—on my return he was not at the office—he never came back—he had his salary weekly.</p>

Q.</hi> What sort of a day was 21st Aug.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Extremely wet—I had promised to return that evening, and did so—you would have done wrong not to pay the money into the bankers in consequence of its being wet—you could have left the money in your desk—you had no key to it—you were common-law and general clerk, and had 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I believe I asked you at the station if you had any of the money to return—if I had been at home the entry of Mrs. Fennett's name would not have been the subject of a charge in my bill-book—the name of Mr. Bond would—you entered that yourself—you had to put down the name of everybody who called, whether the subject of a charge or not.</p>

On 22nd Aug., about four o'clock in the morning, I found the prisoner drunk, lying in the middle of the road in Wellington-street—his trowsers were torn—the right pocket was torn out—I saw two men run away from him—I took him to the police-office, and he was discharged next morning—he had five sovereigns, six shillings, a 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-piece, and some halfpence in his pocket—I went with him to the Black Sam, at the corner of Brydges-street, to see if he could find the party who robbed him—he asked the landlord if he knew the parties who were in the house with him the night previous—he said, "No"—the prisoner explained what liquor he paid for, and mentioned changing a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note, and then the landlord knew him—the note was got, and the prisoner said that was the note he had changed, that he knew it by his name on the back—he said he could not walk the streets as his clothes were in such a state, and the inspector told him</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did the prisoner complain of? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was insensible from the blow as well as from drink, I suppose—he told me he was not so drunk before he was struck—he did not complain of being struck—he remained at the station till ten o'clock next morning, when he was taken before a Magistrate for being drunk—I went with him to the Bank to stop the notes, but he did not know the numbers, and could not stop them—he said he should know the men again, by being with them overnight—I was in search of them all that day, and all the next night—I did not see the pri<lb></lb>soner again till the 30th—I was sent up to his house to find him—I saw his wife—she said she did not know where he was—I told her to write to him, to come and see if two men who were taken were the men who had robbed him—I said that to induce him to come back—he came on the 30th, and I took him—he had no bruise on his head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Why did you not pursue the two men? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was not near enough to catch them, they were 200 yards from me—you were very drunk, it was from the drink and the blow—I saw you next at ten o'clock, you were sober then—these trowsers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are just in the same state as when I first saw you—(<hi rend="italic">the side, the fob, and the pocket were gone</hi>)—you told the Magistrate that the money you lost was Mr. Woodward's; you did not give his address, you told me—you did not take me to your house, you took a friend of mine to show him—you said the notes were torn, and had some pieces of canvass underneath—I do not recollect your saying anything about their having any writing on the back—from the Bank we went towards the Strand; we went into a public-house in the City, and had a glass of ale and a bottle of ginger-beer, and we both had some dinner; we then rode in a buss to see the waiter at the house where you changed the note—I went to no other public-house with another policeman—I had no gin in a soda-water bottle; I did not give it to a policeman at the back-door of a public-house—previous to going into the omnibus you went into a hosier's to purchase a collar; you did not buy me a 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. pair of gloves, I never entered the shop with you, upon my oath—I did not go into the shop and select a 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. pair of gloves, and show them to the officer who I sent to your house—I know Jackson's, in Bow-street, there is a bagatelle-board there; I went there with you; it was not to see the ser<lb></lb>geant, because he never goes there—it was merely to have a drop of refresh<lb></lb>ment after I had done with you; we may have staid an hour or two, I often do; after that I went and had some tea with you—an arrangement was then made that you should meet me on my coming on duty at nine, and you came with the young man I had left with you, and who had been in the force—when the inspector gave me leave to go with you a second time, we went in search of the black man at the house where you changed the note; we stopped there ten minutes, perhaps; you spoke to the landlord—we next went to the house of the black man, in Leicester-square, to see if he knew who robbed me—I do not recollect what refreshment the three of us had after leaving that house—we had no beef, fish, or oysters; we did not have a half-crown's worth of oysters and a pennyworth of bread—I do not know what you ate or drank—I was with you all day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in a long defence, admitted the receipt of the money, but stated that it being a very wet day he did not pay it into the bankers', intending to give it to his employer, on his return; that he had made an engagement to go to the Olympic Theatre with a friend who was deaf and dumb, to obtain an engagement</hi>

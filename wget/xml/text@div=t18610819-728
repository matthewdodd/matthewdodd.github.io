                  </hi>. I am seven years old, and live with my parents in Belvedere-road, Lambeth—on Sunday, 28th July, I was in the Belvedere-road by myself, playing—I saw the prisoner Smith—he said, "Follow me;" and I went with him down the York-road—Upham had given me the jug—I was playing in Vine-street, and he said, "Boy, will you go and get me a quartern of the best gin?"—he gave me the jug and a two-shilling piece—he did not tell me where to go, but pointed to the White Hart—I went there with the jug, got the quartern of gin, gave the two-shilling piece, and got sixpenny worth of halfpence, and Is. in change—when I came out I did not see the man who had given me the jug; I saw Smith—it was then that he came up to me, and told me to follow him—I followed him to the York-road to the corner of a street, and he said, "You had better give me the jug and the change"—I did so, he gave me a penny, and walked on—I did not see the jug any more after I had given it to Smith; another boy had it—I did not see the other boy with it; I saw it at the police-court on a Wednesday.</p>

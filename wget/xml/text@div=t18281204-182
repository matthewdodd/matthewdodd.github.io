I had had this gelding five years - it was a roan colour; I put it out on the heath on the 12th of September, and saw it there about twelve o'clock that day - I went there on Saturday morning, the 13th, and it was gone; I found it at one o'clock on the 20th of September, opposite the Swan public-house, at Kennington, standing in a chaise - I saw the ostler there, and spoke about the chaise to him; I proposed to hire it, and in consequence of what I said the ostler went away, and returned in about ten minutes with the prisoner, who asked if I was the gentleman who wanted the chaise - I said I was, and asked what he charged an hour; he said 2s. 6d; I said, "Don't you think that is a great deal" - he said that was a regular fare; I said it was a good deal - he asked how far I was going; I said not much farther, and then told him the poney belonged to me, and I should have him locked up, and the poney too; I asked what he gave for it - he said he gave a fair price for it; I said if he would take me to the man he bought it of I should be satisfied, and would let him go - I told the ostler to take the poney out of the chaise, and lock it up; he unharnessed it, and I took hold of the prisoner - I caught hold of my poney, and let of the prisoner, to put my poney into the stable; the prisoner said he bought it in Smithfield on the 12th of September, at nine o'clock in the evening - I said, "That must be a great story, for you never bought it in Smithfield at all;" he then said, "No, I did not buy it in Smithfield, I bought it coming away from Smithfield-market" - I told him it was mine, and pointed out a large W on the near shoulder; he was very willing for me to have it; I left him in charge of Sturges while I put the poney into the stable, and when I got back he was gone - I got over the top of a water-butt to look for him, but could not see him; I got over several fences, but could not find him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Did you see me go over the wall? A. No; I could see nothing of you when I looked over the wall; I had missed you about a minute - I never lost the horse before; and did not buy it as a stolen one; I know George Wood, who, I believe, deals in horses.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How do you know the horse? A.By a large W which I burnt myself in the near shoulder, and it has three white feet - two behind white, and one white about the fetlock joint; I am sure it is mine - I had had it five years - it was four years old when I bought it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do you really believe that I stole it? A. If you did not, you know something about who did; I never bought a horse of Wood - it was owned from me as a stolen horse; it had been stolen at two years old from Jackman, a drover; I bought it about two years after that- I have seen Wood - he is wanted now, I believe - I have not seen him for six or seven months; I used to see him at Hampstead; he had horses, but whether they were his own I do not know; I was never intimate with him - I never drank with him to my knowledge; I bought the horse of Bolton, who kept the Hour Glass public-houses, at Walworth.</p>

            . I live at St. Ann's-row, Kennington, and am in the provision trade. On the 20th of September, I was near the Swan public-house, at Kennington, and saw Rodwell, and saw a chaise with a poney in it; I saw Fops, the ostler, go from Rodwell - he returned in about ten minutes with the prisoner; Rodwell asked what he charged an hour for the horse and chaise; the prisoner said it was his horse and chaise, and that he charged half a crown -Rodwell said it was a great deal - he said it was the usual price; Rodwell said it was a decent-looking horse - how long might he have had it; how much he had given for it, and where he bought it; the prisoner said he had had it about a fortnight or three weeks, that he bought it in Smithfield, and gave the full value for it - he did not say how much; Rodwell then said "It is my horse, and you are my prisoner;" and directed the ostler to unharness it, signifying his intention to send it to livery; the ostler said it would be safe in his possession, in the stable - I then told the prisoner, that to say the least of it, it was an unfortunate circumstance, and if he could take us to the person he had bought it of, and satisfy the prosecutor, that would be all that was required of him - he expressed his entire concurrence, and said he would go immediately to Smithfield to satisfy the prosecutor; I hinted to him that we were both ready and willing to go - he said he was perfectly ready and willing to go immediately, and if I would allow him to go into the back-yard, he would not detain me a moment - I rather hesitated, but allowed him to go, following a few yards behind him; he then leaped over a high fence, got across some gentlemen's gardens, and escaped; Rodwell and I pursued after him, but he got clear off - this was about one o'clock in the day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. On your oath, did you see me in the garden? A. No; we pursued along the gardens - I did not see you get over the fence; I was not at all intoxicated - <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040080"></xptr>I had drunk nothing that day; the impression on my mind is that you said you had the horse a fortnight or three weeks - I will swear you said so.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You did not see him get over the fence; did you see him go away at all? A. Yes; he went into the back-yard, and did not come back.</p>

            . On the 20th of September, I was at the Swan, at Kennington - I am employed there by the ostler when he goes out with his chaise; I was there on Tuesday, the 16th of September, and saw the prisoner there then - his horse stood there at livery: it was a kind of roancoloured horse: I saw him there on Friday - he said nothing about the horse that day: he came to see it fed, but said nothing to me about it - I saw him waiting there while the ostler fed it; it continued there till Saturday, the 20th; he was there every day; I did not see the horse used till the Saturday, when it stood in the chaise eating a feed of oats, which I had given him; Rodwell spoke to me about it - I went to the cookshop to the prisoner; he came up to Rodwell, who said "Do you own this?" (meaning the horse and chaise) - he said Yes, that he bought it on the Friday, at Smithfield; Rodwell asked if he let it out - he said Yes; Rodwell said "Do you charge so much an hour, or so much by the job?" Yes, said he, half a crown an hour, or so much the job; Rodwell said he was in no hurry, and then said "This is my horse, and it was stolen from me;" the prisoner answered "I am very willing to go with you to the man I bought it off:" the horse was unharnessed -Rodwell asked me to lend him a bridle to take it to livery, I said he might as well leave it there, and it should be taken care of, and it was put into the stable.</p>
               <p>Q.Did the prisoner give you any directions about the horse, between the Tuesday and Saturday? A. He used to dress him over, and wash his bad eye; I put it into the stable, and left Rodwell and Sturges talking together, and when I returned, the prisoner was not there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Did I not work the horse on Wednesday and Thursday? A. I was not there all day; it was in the afternoon, if you did - he did work it in the afternoon, in the ostler's chaise - I was not there on Thursday or Friday.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I went near the Duke's Head public-house, Kennington-lane, on Monday, the 3d of November, and met the prisoner with a bridle on his back - he was a little intoxicated; I told him I wanted him, would he step a little way with me? he said"Let us go in here;" I said No, I wanted him on a charge of felony; he said "Then I shall not go further, unless I know what it is for;" I said "It is respecting that horse you stole from Hampstead Heath;" he then made a little resistance - I told him it was of no use, though he had escaped once, he should not escape from me, but if he would walk civilly with me, I would not behave rough to him; he said he would; he said the horse was his own - that he gave 4l. 10s. for it, at the Ram public-house, Smithfield; I took him towards Queen-square: he said "Why, I know how it will be - I know how it will go - you may as well round it at once - twenty sovereigns is no object to me to make it up" - I had not either threatened or promised him any thing; I told him I did not do my business in that way - as he had escaped once, I would take care he did not again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Why did you not apprehend me when you saw me at Croydon fair? A. I had not then got an exact description of you; I swear you offered me twenty sovereigns to make it up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 12th of September, I went to Smithfield, and bought the horse, between six and seven o'clock, at the Ram-inn door, as I came out - I bid the man 6l. for it; it had a large lump on his off-haunch; he would not take the money, but said he would take it home, and cut his head off first; I at last gave him seven sovereigns - he gave me 5s. out of it - one Sanderson and Goodman were present when I offered for it - I bought it to let out, at Kennington, and was offered money for it several times, but would not sell it; I had seen the person I bought it of several times in the market, but never spoke to him before; he was a stout man - I had seen him dealing in horses, and considered I gave a fair price for it - I had no reason to believe it was stolen; I put the man's name down on a piece of paper - he gave me the name of

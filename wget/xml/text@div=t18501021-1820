                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Harding, a pawnbroker, of York-street, Westminster. On 9th Oct., about five minutes past two o'clock, a girl came into the shop, and in consequence of what she told me I ran through Horseshoe-alley, and saw the prisoner in Palmer's-passage, about one-eighth of a mile from the shop, with a coat under his arm; I called, "Stop thief!" and he dropped the coat, and I picked it up—it is Mr. Hard-ing's property, as I had seen it safe on the right-hand corner 'of the shop outside the house, a quarter of an hour before—I gave information to the police, and afterwards saw the prisoner at the station—I believe he is the same man, but I cannot swear to him.</p>

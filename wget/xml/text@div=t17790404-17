               <p>Were the lock and key gone too? - It was lost; my man found it in the field, as he was hedging, about a month ago. The horse was an iron grey, six years old, marked R. C. on the near nostril; a brown mane and tail. I had her about three years. I found her at a place called Gilded Moreton, in Cambridgeshire, in the possession of

               <p>When did you find her? - On Sunday se'nnight, the 13th, after I lost her.</p>
               <p>Tell us how it happened. - A man came from Hatfield, in Hertfordshire, and gave me intelligence of her. I set out after her, and pursued the prisoner to Gilded Moreton; it was about eleven o'clock at night when we got to the place where he was.</p>
               <p>What inn was it? - I do not know the sign. Mr. Pack saw him go out of Hatfield with the mare just before I came there.</p>
               <p>Did you know any thing of the prisoner before? - Yes; three or four years before. I tapped him on the shoulder. As soon as he got out of the reach of my arm he said, you be d - ned; he jumped over the stile, and got out of my reach. I went into the house, and said, I believed they had a mare of mine<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177904040028"></xptr> there. I desired them to get a light; they brought a candle; when they came into the yard they blowed the candle out; they went and lighted it again, and then when they were in the yard they blowed it out again; they did so a third time; then the man that was with me took the candle out of the person's hand, and went and lighted it himself. I saw the mare, and knew it was mine. Mr. Pack pursued him, and took him th e next day.</p>

               <p>I live at Ashwell, in Hertfordshire. I am a smith; the prisoner brought me an iron-grey mare to shoe on the Sunday.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner is the man? - Yes. I did not shoe her by reason it was Sunday. He went out towards Cambridgeshire. There I found him.</p>
               <p>How did you know he went to Cambridgeshire? - Because he used to go that way.</p>
               <p>You saw the mare at Gilded Moreton? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it the same mare? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I live at Mill-hill. Last September a man, by the name of Shaw, came from Ashwell, and said Fox had got a grey mare. I asked him how long he had had it; he said he saw him with it a week before. I went and told Mr. Clewin. I pursued him with Mr. Clewin, and found him and the mare at Gilded Moreton.</p>
               <p>Pack. I went after him the next day, and found him at half past five in the evening at St. Neot's in Huntingdonshire.</p>

               <p>I live in Sander's-lane, about a mile and a quarter from Hendon. I saw him go by my house, about four o'clock in the afternoon. I saw him go by again about eight o'clock at night with a mare.</p>

               <p>I harvested at Ashwell. I went down into the fens. I was there a week. I came back along with the same man he mentions now. I came up to Barnet fair. I saw a gentleman there who had a mare sold to him by somebody; he said I was the man that sold the mare to him. I said I was not the man. He threatened to take me into custody. I was frightened, got from him, and went down into Hertfordshire. I saw a man with two horses, a bridle and saddle. This mare was one of the two horses. A young man asked me to ride. I said I was going to Ashwell. He said he did not know Ashwell, but he knew Great Moreton, and took me to the sign of the Swan, and said, if I staid there he would come to me; they call it Gilded Moreton.</p>
               <p>Jury to Mrs. Hinton. What colour was the mare you saw him upon? - A grey mare.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was at Ashwell at the time the mare was lost; Mr. Pack knows it.</p>
               <p>Pack. He worked at the harvest at Ashwell; he did not mind his business; his master turned him away before the 4th of September.</p>

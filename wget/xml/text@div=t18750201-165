Eight o'clock is about our busiest time—I was alone in the shop on the 14th—if there is silver in the till we give change from that; if not, we send out for change—I don't know what silver there was in the till on the 14th—Mrs. Chemellie came down about a quarter of an hour after the prisoner had left, and about the same time as the 16th—on both occasions she went to the till directly.</p>

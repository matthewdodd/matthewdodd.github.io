                  </hi>. I am a private of the 100th Royal Marines, stationed at Woolwich—on Monday afternoon, 7th September, I came up to London Bridge, as I had two months' leave—I wanted a cab, but they were all on strike—I wanted to go to the Waterloo Road, but was bewildered because St. Thomas's Hospital was not there—the prisoner came up, and I said, "I cannot get a cab"—he said, "I will show you the nearest way"—I said, "All right, old <hi rend="italic">chap</hi>," and I relied on him—we went across the river, and went to house after house, and at last I got tired of it, and said, "Look here, I am not going further with you, I have had enough of that sort; before I send you away we will have a glass of something else to drink"—we had a pint, or a half-pint, of sherry—I was going to have another; I pulled out my purse, and he snatched it away—there was five 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes in it, and four sovereigns—I was obliged to go book to Woolwich—I met the sergeant, who paid my fare back.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How many public-houses had you been into? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> One, before the Mitre—I did not stay there long; I did not leave Woolwich till 2 o'clock, and the robbery took place before 4 o'clock—I was not the worse for liquor—I did not have the chance to have any of the sherry, the prisoner <hi rend="italic">mopped</hi> it all up—I had had nothing else all the time I was in his company, and was as sober as I am now—I went after the prisoner, and so did the publican—the door was shut, but on the hinge—the prisoner got away—I think there were two more people in the bar—I had paid for the first half-pint of sherry, but had not a chance to drink any of it—I was going to pay for another half pint—to the best of my know<lb></lb>ledge, I had nothing to drink during the whole time I was in the prisoner's company, but I had a half-pint of beer at the canteen at Woolwich—I only went into one public-house with the prisoner; I am certain of that—I had something to drink in the prisoner's company at the Mitre—the sherry was are talking about—I did not say that I did not drink any of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Mitre, 38, Fish Street Hill—on 7th Sep<lb></lb>tember, the prisoner came in with the soldier—they called for a half-pint of sherry, which the soldier paid for, and he got a sip of it—another was called for, and the soldier felt in his pocket for odd money, but did not seem to have any—he took his purse out, opened it, and the prison</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was the door open? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, on the strap—I suppose he and the soldier, and the men with him, drank the sherry—there were six of them, all drinking together—they all came in together—I followed the prisoner; the soldier did not attempt to catch hold of him; he was not very sober.</p>

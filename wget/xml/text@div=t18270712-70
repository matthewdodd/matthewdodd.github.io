I took the prisoner before a Magistrate at Union-hall, about five weeks ago, but he was not committed, because the parcel was stolen in Middlesex; Mr. Chambers advised me to go and get a bill; he absconded for some time - it was his duty to sell goods and to collect money; he was to receive 5 per cent. for what he sold; he refused to have any salary beside that - he had parcels to show to customers, but I sent this parcel to Fulham.</p>

            . I am a draper, and live at Fulham. I received a parcel from Mr. Howell in the middle of April, by coach, it contained six pairs of stays - I did not know there was such a person as Mr. Howell, and had had no dealings with him; the prisoner came to my house in about a quarter of an hour, and said, "You have received a parcel which does not belong to you;" I said, "I know it don't" - he took it from my house.</p>

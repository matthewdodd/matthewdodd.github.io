            . I am a patrol of Bow-street office. On the first of June, I saw the prisoner in <placeName id="t18120701-91-crimeloc546">Palace-yard</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18120701-91-crimeloc546" type="placeName" value="Palace-yard"></interp>

It was at the time that the procession of the knights were going on, I observed the prisoner; and I saw him attack a gentleman at his pocket. I made up to the prisoner; I saw this handkerchief a little way out of the gentleman's pocket. I saw the prisoner draw this handkerchief out of the gentleman's pocket, in an easy way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the gentleman appear at all to notice him - A. No, not in the least. I saw him take it completely out. He held the handkerchief in his hand. I seized his right hand, that had the handkerchief, I took it out of his hand. I told the gentleman, that this man had picked his pocket of this handkerchief. The gentleman made answer, that is my handkerchief. The prisoner could not avoid hearing that. The prisoner said, for God's sake, let me go. I will never do the like again. I said, no; I shall not let you go, by any means whatever. I told the gentleman, that I was an officer of Bow-street; and desired the gentleman to attend at Bow-street. I brought the prisoner out of the crowd, and the gentleman followed me, and four or five men followed the gentleman, out of the crowd, persuading the gentleman to let him go, and not to prosecute. Two or three of the faces of them men I knew. We came as far as Whitehall. The gentleman seemed to make a stop. I then took the prisoner back to the gentleman. I told the gentleman to take care of them fellows, for they were thieves, and to take care of his pockets, or else they would rob him of more than he had been robbed of, and to keep as close to me as he could. We came as far as Bedford-street, in the Strand. I having hold of the prisoner, I spoke to the gentleman, and said, this way, if you please. This gentleman followed, and the other men, all the way up. I crossed up Bedford-street; one of the men ran up to me, and said, d - mn you, let the prisoner go, the gentleman does not want to prosecute. I then said, the first man that comes near me, to rescue him, I will lower him immediately. The prisoner said, what have you to do with me, now the gentleman will<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181207010063"></xptr> not come forward. I told the prisoner, if he offered to resist, I would give him the contents, as well as them. The prisoner then said, if you will put up your staff I will go quietly with you. I searched the prisoner, and found this silk handkerchief in his hat. He had a silk handkerchief round his neck; and this little knife, I believe, is his own property. I know nothing further.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I did not take the handkerchief out of the gentleman's pocket. The star-pattern handkerchief belongs to me.</p>
               <p>Westcoatt. The star-pattern handkerchief I took out of his hat.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

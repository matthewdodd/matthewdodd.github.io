            , on the 10th of June last, and several times before, we lost money, and I suspected the prisoner, who lived with us, and I ordered some money to be marked in the petty cash, which was done so, and on the 9th of June one shilling was wanting, and on the 9th and 10th of June I ordered more money to be marked, not thinking one shilling a sufficient proof, and in the morning there were two shillings wanting; I sent for a constable, and the prisoner was searched, and the two shillings found upon him.</p>

               <p>Will you swear they were the two that were taken from the prisoner? - Yes, I can, I told the constable that searched him that he would find number 8 and 14, and so they proved, besides I took the particulars of them whether the mark was on the head or the tail side, and the dates, and I am sure they are the same, I marked them myself.</p>

On the 26th of January I was in my back shop about ten o'clock, I was alarmed and followed the prisoner along Thames-street, and overtook him about twenty yards off, with my coat on his back - I brought him back and took it from him. I asked him if he had anything else, he said, no. I found a waistcoat in his pocket. I asked him what induced him to go up to my two pair of stairs room, he said that he had an execution in his house, and his wife and family were starving.</p>

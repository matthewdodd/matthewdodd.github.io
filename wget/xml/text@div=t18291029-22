The prisoner was quite a stranger, but I called him on the 14th of September to buy two coats of me - he bought one for 6s. 6d.; the other, which was a beadle's coat, he said was too dear - I asked him 2l. for that; 1l. 13s. had been offered me for it before - it had gold lace on it; when he laid down the 6s. 6d. for the other coat I was looking at the money, and he took the beadle's coat and left the one which he had bought of me - I did not miss it for an hour, till my husband came home; the prisoner had a brown coat, sewn in the sleeve with light thread - he lifted up his arm, shewed it to me, and said he was a very poor man; I met him on the Wednesday, and accused him of it - he said he knew nothing of me, and never bought any thing of me; I am positive he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner before? A. No - these old-clothes men are very much alike; I did say when I saw him that he was not the man, but I had not then had a good look at his face - I looked at him in the face, and then said he was the man; the beadle's coat was provided by the parish, but it is allowed to my husband - the prisoner gave his address correctly.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How came you to say he was not the man? A.Because I was not sure, and he had not the same coat on - I do not swear to his coat, but to his features.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you with your wife when she met the prisoner? A. Yes - I asked if she knew that man; she said, "I think that is the man, but I will not be sure" - I said, "Look at him, and be sure;" then she looked at him, and said, "He is the man, I could swear to him if I were on my death bed" - she was about four yards from him at first.</p>

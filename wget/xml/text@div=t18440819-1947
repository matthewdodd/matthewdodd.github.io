In Jan. last, a loan of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; was applied for—it was to be lent to a person of the name of Elliott—John Scott, of Pollard-street, Pollard's-row, was proposed to be surety—I went there to make inquiry about the solvency of Scott—I there found the prisoner—I asked him if he was John Scott—he said he was—I asked him how long he had lived there—he said, "For the last ten years"—I asked him if he was the housekeeper—he said, "Yes"—I asked him whether he was a satin-dresser, according to the description on the form—he said he was—I asked him where he was employed—he said, at Stanbridge's, in Pitfield-street—I had the form with me in which the descrip<lb></lb>tion of the person proposed as security was—I held it in my hand—it is not usual for the parties to look at the form—I asked him whether he knew Elliott—he said he did, very well—I asked him whether he knew what he was going to do with the money, in case it was lent to him—he said yes, he wanted money to buy tools with, as he was only casually employed, and if he had this money he could purchase tools and employ himself in the evening—I asked him to show me his receipts for rent—he produced them, which showed me that the rent was paid up to the Christmas quarter—I then pulled out a blank note on a stamp, which I generally carried with me, filled it up, and</p>

On Monday, 23rd Dec., between seven and eight o'clock, I saw the prisoners in High-street, Putney, coming in a direction from Hammersmith—Beasley was carrying a large bundle under his arm, wrapped in a blue handkerchief, under another one—as soon as he got beyond the shops he ran away—I missed him, turned back, and met Fleming—the conversation, I detailed in the last case passed between us—I let him go, and then met Beasley again—he then had no bundle—I said, "Where is that bundle you were carrying?"—he said, "I was carrying no bundle"—I said, "Yes you were, a large bundle"—he said, "I was only carrying a few rags"—I said, "where is the handkerchief?"—he said, "This is it round my neck"—I said that was not the one (that was the same he has now)—I took him to the station, and afterwards found the bundle from twenty to thirty yards from where I stopped him, put in between a thorny hedge—these two handkerchiefs formed the bundle (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and it contained 14 lbs. of fresh pork, and 4 1/2 lbs. of beef suet.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Randell, of 6, Albion-row, Hammersmith, and keep a meat-shop. On 23rd Dec., rather before five o'clock, Beasley came to the shop and asked if I sold sausages—I watched him out of the shop and went to the door—I then had a. loin of pork hanging on a beam in the shop, and my husband afterwards came in with the suet, which was wrapped in this blue handkerchief—he laid it on a board in the shop—we had our tea in the back parlour, and about eight missed the pork and suet—the shop door leading to the street was shut while we were at tea—Hodder brought me the pork and suet on the 24th—that was the same sort I had missed, and the same in quantity, I did not weigh them—I swear to this handkerchief.</p>

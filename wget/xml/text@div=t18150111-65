               <p>Q. Did you at any time lose any thing from your shop - A. Yes. On the 9th of November, I left the shop at four o'clock in the afternoon; I left the property safe. I did not come back till the next morning; and when I returned the man requested that I would look over the goods, he had lost two knives, there were three deficient valuable knives, one of them with twelve blades; a pocket knife, mounted with silver, and pearl handle; the two knives would cost me fifty shillings to manufacture them in my own house,</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Smith, the prisoner came into my master's shop on the 9th of November, between six and seven in the evening; he first of all asked to look at some oyster knives, which we had none; there was nobody in the shop but me, I was the only person that had the care of the shop at that time. As we had no oyster knives, he wanted to look at some pocket knives, I opened the glass case upon the counter, and shewed him what knives there were. There he examined them, he had another person with him, he and the other person was companions together. They examined the whole glass case there were a great many knives in the glass case. After they had looked over the glass case, they wanted to see some other knives, which I shewed them; sporting knives they were with horse pickers, and different kind of instruments, he overlooked the sporting knives, and none of them suited, after that the prisoner said he must have a common knife to cut his nails with. I pulled out a drawer, and took out a paper of common knives; when I opened it to shew him, one of which he purchased. I asked him for the paper which he had taken out of the drawer; he returned it to me, the paper which he took up contained common knives; he returned that to me. He bought a knife at eight teen pence, and then they left the shop. From their behaviour, they caused me to suspect that something else might be gone, I did not see them take any thing. After they were gone, I looked over the glass case, two valuable knives were in that case; the two knives were missing from that case, the two knives were worth two pounds ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after these persons had left the shop was it that you missed these knives - A. In less than five minutes. I am sure these two valuable knives were in the glass case at the time the prisoner was there, no other person was in the shop before they came in, and I was in the care of the shop all that day.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner again - A. When the officer took him in custody. I think the 24th of November.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen your knives since - A. No, when the officer met him and charged him with this, he said he was at Oxford at the time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not deny being at your shop.</p>
               <p>Robinson. You did, you said you were at Oxford at the time, it was on Lord Mayor's day, when you came.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. to Robinson. When you saw him in custody of the officer, were you certain of his person<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181501110040"></xptr>then - A. Yes, I was.</p>

            . I am a constable; I took the prisoner in charge on the 20th of December. I took him on another charge.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. to Robinson. I understand you to say you saw him in custody on the 24th of November - A. That was a mistake; it was on the 20th of December.</p>
               <p>Matthews. Robinson said he was the man that robbed the shop on Lord Mayor's day, he was one of them he said there were two together; he and another. The prisoner said he was in the country at the time, I do not recollect at what part of the country he said. I searched him, and found no knife of any sort upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know this cutlers shop - A. Yes, there is a good light in this shop, to know a mans person again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I solemnly declare I know nothing of the knife I am charged with stealing. I acknowledge I was in the prosecutors shop; I did not take any thing from the prosecutors shop but the knife that I bought and paid for. I am quite innocent.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. to Robinson. Before the prisoner came to the shop - A. Before the prisoner came in the shop I looked at these two knives they were in the case and almost immediately after they left the shop they were missing. I am positive they were in the glass case all the day; they were in the glass case when Mr. Smith went out at four o'clock in the afternoon; and after he was gone the glass case was not opened until the prisoner came in.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. What made you recollect these two knives in the glass case - A. Because there were only two of the sort; one of the knives had a pair of the scissors at the end of it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Roberts. Do you swear to seeing these two knives being there - A. I do; we had no more knives of that description; the glass case was not opened from the time that my master went out, untill the prisoner came in.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. to Prosecutor. How long had Roberts been in your house - A. Twenty five years, I served my apprentership after he was there.</p>

On the night of the 26th, I went to bed, leaving my master up - I put my watch on the drawers in my room; I awoke about half-past six o'clock in the morning, and found my watch gone. It was dark then, but I heard that it did not tick. I found my room window a little way up, the watch could not be got at without coming into the room, as I had put it on the other side of the room, they must have come in through the window. I found a piece of tile broken off the wash-house, which was near my window - a person could reach the window from there. The prisoner never stopped out later than ten o'clock, we shut the door at eleven. I know he was at home at half-past five o'clock in the evening, but did not see him after. I never saw him again until he was taken - I locked and bolted the room door, and found it so in the morning.</p>

            . I am a corporal in the first battalion of Grenadier guards - the prisoner was a private in the regiment. On the 27th of November, about six o'clock in the morning, I met him in Coventry-street with a woman on his arm; the sergeant stopped him, and gave him in my charge for being absent from his quarters all night, he wished to go away with the woman - I refused to let him; he said the woman had his watch, I said if she got it by improper means, I would give her in charge, he said, No he gave it her as he had met her, and been with her all night, and she spent some money and he gave it her as security, he asked if I would lend him a shilling, to give her for the watch, I gave him a shilling, and she gave it me - I afterwards produced it to the prosecutrix, who claimed it. I gave it to Jeffery.</p>

I examined the prosecutor's room, there was a wall ten feet high outside, and an iron railing round it - some person must have got on the iron railing, and then over the wall, they could then get on the wash-house, and through the window - the prosecutrix told me the name of the maker of the watch.</p>

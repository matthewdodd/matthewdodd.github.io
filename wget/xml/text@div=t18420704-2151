                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Baldwin Howard—he keeps the Blue Anchor, Mile End Road. On the 9th of June I went up to my own bed-room, on the first-floor, about four o'clock in the afternoon—on the same landing, and opposite to my bed-room, is a room to which company resort—I remained in my bed-room till a few minutes after nine—I had two children with me—I put them to bed at half-past eight—I made the bed at that time, and there was no pipe upon it—I had the articles stated in a drawer in that room—I left them safe, and the drawer shut—I shut the room-door after me—I went down, and when I had been down about ten minutes I saw the prisoner in front of the bar—I looked at the clock when I went down, and it was five minutes past nine—when I saw the prisoner he was going towards the staircase, and he had a pipe in hit hand, twisting it about—I told him there was no one up stairs—that was the fact, as they had all come down when I did—the prisoner stood with his right hand on the staircase—I did not see him again for about three-quarters of an hour, when he came from the back-door to the parlour-door, which was in a direction from the stairs—he said, "Good night; I shall not stop now;. I am going home to go to bed"—he went out at the front-door—in about ten minutes I went up stairs to get change—I found the door was shut, but the drawer was wide open—I missed from it the work-box which had contained the articles, and a China-crape shawl—I went afterwards, in consequence of something that was said to me, to the stable, and in one of the stalls I found the partition of the work-box, and the tray of it was all broken—I went to the privy, and saw the work-box down the well—it was brought up afterwards—I had seen it safe in my room in the afternoon, and I did not leave the room at all till I went down stairs at past nine—the value of all the articles lost was 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I found my husband in the par<lb></lb>lour when I went down at past nine, and he remained there till I went up—I gave information to the police the same night—we have only been in the house nine weeks—I first saw the prisoner about a fortnight after we got there, and he has been in the habit of coming two or three times a-week, or it might be oftener—the next morning my little boy brought me a tobacco-pipe—next morning the prisoner came to the bar, and said he had heard that I had accused him of robbery—I said we had—he said he should wish it cleared up—I said that was my intention—I went to the door, and saw a policeman, and gave him in charge—I asked why he had said the night before that he was going home—he said he had met a female, and went down Whitechapel-road with her, as far as the Red Lion; that he neither knew who she was, nor where she lived.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you think it very extra<lb></lb>ordinary that he should walk with a female? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—it was about five</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184207040110"></xptr>
               <p>minutes past nine when I came down stairs, and in about ten minutes I saw the prisoner—I had been in the club-room up stairs before I came down—there were five persons in the club-room then, and my sister had been with them—I had been in the bed-room, and I am sure, when I was there, the drawer was shut—I could not make the bed unless it was shut—I had not made the bed till half-past eight o'clock—I am sure the door was closed when I left the room—the prisoner was in the habit of frequenting the house—he had been there the night before, and had been in the parlour—he did not remain till five o'clock; it was not four when he left—he was in the room the whole time—he was drinking—I cannot say whether he was smoking.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does the place through which you saw the prisoner pass, on the night of the robbery, lead anywhere else besides up stairs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, to the the parlour and the yard—a person coming down stairs might get into the yard without passing the place where I was—it was George Carpenter, our man, who gave me the first information which led me to suspect the pri<lb></lb>soner—about ten o'clock that night, which was about ten minutes after I last saw the prisoner, Carpenter told me he had seen the prisoner in the stable and in the water-closet—I cannot tell from what direction Carpenter came when he told me this—he came to the bar and told my husband—I had gone up stairs before that—I went up about ten—I came down and told my husband that the box was gone, and then Carpenter told me this—Carpenter has been in our service a month—my husband took him from the recommendation of a person he had known for years—I do not know whether it was a written recommendation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has Carpenter committed any act of dishonesty since this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He has been charged with drunkenness—there were some spirits found in the kitchen—I suppose they were ours—I have not the least doubt that they were—I did not swear that they were—I believe they were—he had no right to take them that I know of—the spirits had no right to be in the kitchen—he was entrusted in the cellar—I do not know-that he stole these spirits out of the cellar—I cannot say that he stole them—they were found in the kitchen—I do not authorise my servants to take them out of the cellar into the kitchen, and they have no right to do it—if a person takes them, and brings them into the kitchen, it is stealing, if you like to call it so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not called it so? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said the spirits were found in the kitchen—I might have said that they were stolen—I might have said that I would have charged and prosecuted Carpenter, if it would not haw prevented his coming as a witness here—he is not in our service now—my husband turned him away—I do not know whether it was for getting drunk or stealing the spirits.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the witness's husband. On the night of the robbery my wife came down between nine and ten o'clock—I was sitting in the parlour—I afterwards sent her up stairs for change for a seaman's note—I remained in the parlour—I saw the prisoner at the door between six and seven that evening, and I served him with some porter and a pipe—there were four or five other persons with me in the parlour—</p>

               <p>

                  </hi>. On the 9th of Jane I was potman to Mr. Howard. I came in that night about a quarter after nine o'clock—I had occasion soon after that to go to the stable in the yard—it was dark—I heard something of a hustling in the stable—I hallooed out, "Who is here?" and the prisoner answered—(I knew it was him by his voice)—he begged my pardon, he said he did not know where the water-closet was, and he was doing his occasion there—I said it was granted—I then commenced shutting up outside—I removed a table, and two horse-troughs, and a tub, round to the back part of the house, and placed them against the stable door—no one could get out that way after I had put those things there—I then came round to the front of the house, and went in—I did not see the prisoner there—I then went to the stable, and went in, and called out, "Are you coming out?"—I got no answer—I then went to the bar, and got a light, and looked round the stable—I could not find him—I then went to the water-closet door, and that was fast—I went in before the bar again, and sat about ten minutes—I then went out again, and knocked at the water-closet door—I said, "Halloo, are you gone to sleep?"—the pri<lb></lb>soner answered, yes, he had, and he came out, and said he was going home—he went through the house, and said, "Good night"—in about ten minutes after he was gone, I heard of the loss, and I then told Mrs. Howard what I had observed—I went with her into the stable and the privy, and found a box down the privy—no one went from the house to the yard be<lb></lb>tween the time when the prisoner went away and my finding the box down the privy, and no one could have got out of the door while the troughs were against it—I had known the prisoner about a week before.</p>

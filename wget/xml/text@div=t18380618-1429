                  </hi>. I am a sergeant of police. On the 9th of March I was tioned at Uxbridge—the new police had been established there not more four or five weeks at that time—I knew the prisoner before that—he was the owner of a stable in the town of Uxbridge—I found him in that stable at a late hour, a few nights before, in a very indecent situ<lb></lb>tion, and I aroused him—on the 9th of March I saw the prisoner stand<lb></lb>ing close to the Bird-in-hand beer shop—I observed several persons round the door of that house, making a noise, and Latham, who has been con<lb></lb>victed was knocking at the door for admittance—I was coming up the middle of the road—there were about twenty persons at the Bird-in-hand—I did not say or do any thing to them—I did not interfere with them at—as I passed, the prisoner Pearce came out from among the men, and said to me, "What business had you in my stable the other morning?" holding his fist up to me; he could have reached me if he had liked—I said to him,"Now, my good fellow, I don't want to have any thing to say to you, you know under what circumstances I was in your stable"—he bad been drinking and was unsteady—we were followed by the prisoner and Latham up to the station-house gate—as they went along they called out, "You——y police b——rs, we will do for you—we will drive you out of the town—we will make this town too hot for you"—when I got to the station-house gate, I attempted to open it—Pearce came in front of me, and put himself in a fighting attitude—I immediately caught hold of him to take him into the station-house—Latham threw himself round Pearce, as I sup<lb></lb>pose to prevent me taking him—we got them into the yard, and from there into the little room called the charge-room—Fortnum helped me—they, being drunk at the time, both fell down on the floor—I and my wife kept them down on the floor, while Fortnum went to unlock the strong room, which joins the charge-room—during his absence, Latham rose up on one knee, drew a knife from his pocket, and made several stabs at my person—I received one wound inside the left thigh, and another nearly through the calf of the same leg—I called "Oh God! the villain has stabbed me"—</p>
               <p>Pearce immediately called out, "That is right, give it to the b r, go it"—</p>
               <p>Latham got up on his legs and made another plunge at me—I drew my staff, and struck him at the side of the head; had I not done so, I believe he would have killed me—I stepped back into the yard, followed by Latham—he still kept thrusting at me with the knife—I received seven cuts in my clothes; but only two in my flesh—the station-house gate at this time was burst open by a mob, and the two prisoners rescued from my custody—I then went to my apartments, and could go no further through loss cf blood—a woman named Ann Clements took a very active part at this time—I bled very much indeed—I at length succeeded in getting the mob out of the station-house, and fastened the gate—from that time, till lately, I have not been able to apprehend Pearce.</p>

               <p>persons round the Bird-in-hand, making a great noise and disturbance—I heard Latham calling "B—y police," and "Down with the police"—I and Cooper walked towards the station-house, followed by Pearce and a mob—I cannot say whether Latham was with him at that moment—I heard Pearce calling us b——rs, and half starved, and that they would do away with us, and so on—I saw Cooper take hold of Pearce—I did not see what Pearce did to Cooper before he took hold of him—I was getting the gate open—when Cooper caught hold of Pearce, Latham hung on Pearce to try to rescue him—I assisted in getting them both into the station-house as far as the charge-room, and both Pearce and Latham fell down together—Cooper was rather pulled down with them—I went to get the key of the strong room to put them in, and while they were on the ground, Latham rose him<lb></lb>self on one knee, and made two thrusts with something which shone, and said "Take that, you b——r"—Cooper said he was wounded—I do not recollect that Pearce said any thing at that time—I went to fetch more po<lb></lb>licemen—I knocked them up out of their beds, and on returning to the station-house, found Cooper bleeding very much in the passage—there was a great number of persons outside, and stones were thrown, and the windows were broken—the gate had been burst open previously, and there was a great mob outside—both Pearce and Latham were rescued—Latham was taken again the same night, and Pearce got away.</p>

About ten o'clock on the evening of the 9th of March I was called upon to attend Serjeant Cooper at the station-house—I found him bleeding a great deal from a wound in the leg—there was a smaller wound in the leg—one wound was an exceedingly dangerous one—it was a deep punctured wound, and must have been inflicted by a sharp instrument—he was in bed—I passed my finger into the wound—it penetrated to the centre of the calf of the leg—it was about two inches deep—it appeared to have been made in two direc<lb></lb>tions—rather triangular, as if the instrument had gone in in one direction, and come out at another—it was a wound very likely to have been inflicted by a knife such as the one produced.</p>

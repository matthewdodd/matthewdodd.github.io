                  </hi> I am in the employ of John Huskisson, baker, High-street, Whitechapel; he does not live at the shop; the prisoner was in his employ, under me, for three months. On the 25th of June Mr. Huskisson gave me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in pence and halfpence—I put them into the till—I went to the till at four o'clock in the morning, and missed 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—these are the monies master gave me to put into the till—(<hi rend="italic">examining them.</hi>)</p>

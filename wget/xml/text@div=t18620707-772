                  </hi>. I am the landlord of the White Hart, Hickman's folly, Dockhead—on Friday evening, 20th June, about a quarter to 8, the prisoner came and called for a pint of beer, bringing a white jug—the beer was three half-pence—she gave a counterfeit half-crown—I was very busy, and I took it up and laid it by the side of the till, till I served her—she went away, and as soon at I had served the others, which was not a minute, I detected it was bad—I had given her change—I never keep half-crowns in the till—I went to put it behind and discovered it was bad—I went after her, but could not see her—I marked it and put it by itself—on Tuesday, 24th June, she came again, about the same time in the evening, and asked for a pint of beer, but knowing her I did not serve her till I had served every one else—she brought a different jug—she offered a half-crown—I told her it was bad, sent a boy fox a policeman, and gave her in charge, with the two half-crowns—she told me she lived at the bottom of London-street, but after she got to she station she said at Bow somewhere—I heard her mention both those places—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the two half-crowns she gave me—this is the first one.</p>

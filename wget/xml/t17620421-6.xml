I had some reason to suspect he was not honest by being out one evening, and laying out about 12 l. in cloaths, and he had not received any wages of me. I went to a house in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, and desired Mr. Adams to send his boy to my shop for half a pound of ten shilling tea. I took the marks of the money, and the years they were coined, of half a crown, and 2 s. and 6 d. and they were delivered to the boy.</p>
               <p>Q. How were they marked?</p>

             the Second's sixpence, date 1697: the other shilling was a a plain one, which I marked with a cut on the edge. The boy went and bought half a pound of tea, and paid that money for it, as he told me. I went home and looked in the till; there was only half a crown and a sixpence of the marked money, and three or four shillings more. I then said nothing to the prisoner, but kept a stricter eye upon him, with an intent to discharge him: there was nobody in the house but my sister and the prisoner, and I gave her a strict charge to be out of the way when the boy came. When I charged the prisoner with it, he trembled and could not move, if I would have given him 50 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you owe him any wages?</p>
               <p>Nailer. I owed him 5 l. 14 s. A woman at the Spotted Dog, in Blackamoor-street, owned she received sugar of him at different times.</p>

               <p>I never wronged my master in my life: I put the money in the till that I had for the tea. She told me she had no money. I said, I had as lief put the money out of my pocket, as to pay her.</p>

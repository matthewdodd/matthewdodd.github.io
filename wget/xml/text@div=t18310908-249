The prisoners, Richard Roper and Atkins, were in my employ in July last, and had been so between two and three months; I missed property which they had access to - Robertson, the Policeman, has produced a great deal of it to me since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q.Had Alkins lived in your employ before that time? A. No - the business became mine on the 14th of February; I engaged Atkins on the 9th of May - I knew that he bore a good character.</p>
               <p>JOHN ROBERTSON. I am a constable, and live in Shoreditch. The prisoner in July last lived at No. 45, in the Curtain-road - I apprehended him, and he took me to his lodging himself; I found a key on him - there was a box under the bed in the room he took me to; I unlocked it with the key - I had asked him previously what was in it; he told me to open it, and I should see - I did so, and found a quantity of pickles, blacking, and a variety of articles; Mr. Marchant, who was with me, identified part of the property, which was in two boxes - before that the prisoner said he had bought it out of his wages on Saturday nights, but when it was identified he said whatever he had to say he should say at a future place; here are two boxes of property, which I brought from there - I said to Richard Roper, "I believe you are going into business with Atkins, at Chelsea:" he said, "I don't know about Chelsea, but we had an intention of going into business;" I afterwards mentioned it to Atkins, and he said they had an idea of going into business.</p>

            . My husband is a boot-maker.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you known Atkins? A.Since Christmas, by seeing him at the prosecutor's shop; my husband worked for Atkins - he did not send any box to my house since Mr. Marchant has had the concern: he sent a large one there before he went into the country - he asked my husband to let him leave something; he said he was going into business for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080113"></xptr>himself, and had no place to put them in - he said they were his own; the box was in my possession two or three days - it is here; I have not a doubt about its being the same.</p>

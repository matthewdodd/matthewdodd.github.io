He said he had been moving goods for his mother; he said that all was settled concerning his mother's lodging; and that he would be a lodger with me that night, as I had vacant beds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you consent to that? - Yes. He asked my shopman, whether he would drink share of a pint of beer? he agreed to that, and the prisoner went and setched a pint of porter. I went into the parlour, and I saw the prisoner stand near to the fire place.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did you stay in the parlour? - Not above two minutes, I believe; I saw the prisoner stand at the fire place, with his back towards the shop. I have two rails of boots hanging across the fire place; the fire place is not made use for a fire, there are boots hang up there for sale, over the two rails before the fire place, over the fire place are two shelves of boys shoes; a mantle shelf originally. I see the prisoner standing there, and there came in a person for some boys shoes, to have a pair, and another for a pair of boots. I cast my eyes towards the fire place, were the prisoner stood, and I see him put a something in his bosom, what it was I could not tell, I then went on his left hand side, and got as it were to see if I could see what it might be that he had, but as I came towards his left, he turned with his back towards me, and he pretended to be pulling boots down, of a different quality to what the customer wanted, at last he buttoned his coat up. I told my wife, Wilkes had got something, and when he had buttoned up, as he thought convenient, he went out at the back door, I followed him to about two yards of the back door, my back door goes into Leicester-street; and at the door I seized him by the collar, in Leicester-street, I then told him, Wilkes, you have got something in your bosom, but what it is I don't know. I then took him by the collar, and never quitted him till I delivered him up to one of the officers of Marlborough-street who searched him, and I stood present at the time, there was a pair of boots found on him, nothing found on him but that, at that present time; as they were going to lock him up, after I was bound over to appear against him for these pair of boots; I was sent for by the magistrate directly after, and when I went back at half after five, the magistrate produced forty duplicates.</p>
               <p>Court. We cannot hear any thing about the production of those duplicates, because that is going to another fact, unless you then heard him say any thing relative to these boots? - He said, he hoped they would make it death, that he might die for the crime he had done, he was sensible of his guilt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. We don't want your sense of his expressions, we want the prisoner's sense.</p>
               <p>Q. So you see the prisoner putting something in his coat? - No, in his bosom.</p>
               <p>Q. He was helping a person on with some boots? - No, he was not, he was standing up at the fire place.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there was a person came in for a pair of boots? - There was.</p>
               <p>Q. You keep an old boot and shoe shop? - And new too.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether officially or not, the prisoner did pull down some boots to shew to this person? - He did.</p>
               <p>Court. Was that before or after he had got the boots concealed? - Not till after.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. There was some person came in before the prisoner put a young in his bosom? - No, he had got the boots secured first.</p>

               <p>On the 24th of November last, the prosecutor, Mr. Ford, brought the prisoner at the bar by his collar to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from the prosecutor's house? - Very near a 
quarter of a mile, he desired me to take care of the man, to take him into custody, and to search him, and he rather resented it, he would not let me search him; I insisted on searching him, and I found these pair of boots between his shirt and flesh, buttoned up; the prosecutor was there, he said, that is my property, they have been in my possession ever since, and they are 
marked with my name.</p>


               <p>Prosecutor. They are mine, marked G 6, they cost me seven shillings and sixpence, and a shilling doing them up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my counsel.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>

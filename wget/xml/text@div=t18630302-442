                  </hi>. I keep a market-garden at New Cross, and have a stall in Covent Garden-market—on Saturday, 1st February, I was attending to my stall; about 7 o'clock a man came and purchased two dozen greens, and gave me a half-crown, which I put in my pocket—the prisoner came about a quarter of an hour afterwards, with a porter, to take them away—the prisoner bargained for one dozen bunches of rhubarb, which came to half-a-crown—I did not notice anything particular about it, but he looked confused—I gave it to Redding, my servant, to try it—the prisoner went from one side of the van to the other—the beadle passed, and as my servant had bent the half-crown nearly in two, I had the prisoner taken in custody—as soon as I had done market, I looked over the money in my pocket, and found this other bad half-crown (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which was marked in my presence.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 6, Stock well-street, and am in the employ of Mrs. Hargood—the prisoner came to her stall on Saturday morning, 21st February—he was standing among a good many more, but I did not see any one in his companionship—another party bought two dozen greens—I do not know whether the prisoner was with him or no—the prisoner paid my mistress a half-crown—I saw him again a quarter of an hour after<lb></lb>wards, when he bought a dozen of rhubarb, and paid with a half-crown, which my mistress handed to me—I found it was bad, bent it, and kept it in my hand—I went round, caught the prisoner by the collar, and asked him how many he had—he said that he had no more, and told me to search him—I gave it to the beadle.</p>

On the 1st of October, about twelve o'clock at night, I was passing by Spring Gardens; the prisoner took hold of me; I told her I would have nothing to do with her. She would walk with me, she walked as far as Carlton house, and then she was going to turn back; I missed my money from my trowsers pocket; my pocket was open. I had not stopped any where with her. I asked her for the money; she said, she had not got it, I told her if she did not give it to me; I would give charge of her. I lost one pound four shillings and sixpence. She was searched, and one pound one shilling and sixpence was found upon her.</p>

            . I am a watchman. The prosecutor gave me charge of the prisoner; I took her to the watch house, in crossing over by the Mews gate, on the pavement, I heard some money fall; it was moon-light; I looked on the pavement; I saw sixpence; I picked it up. I heard somebody say, she had taken it out of her mouth. I searched her mouth, and found a one-pound note, with a shilling in it. I went to the watchhouse, and gave it to the constable of the night. I found no more of the money. A crowd came about, and I wished to get to the watchhouse.</p>

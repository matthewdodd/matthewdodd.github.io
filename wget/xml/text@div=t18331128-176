               <p>SAMUEL SINGER. I live in Cambridge-terrace, Lower-road, Islington. I am married, and have five children, and am fifty-six years of age; I <rs id="t18331128-176-viclabel975" type="occupation">sell coals on commission</rs>

I pawned it for, all at once.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the oath you have taken, had you said or lone anything to him on that day, or on the former day of an indecent tendency or nature? A. No, sir; nor suffered him to do anything to me; I spoke to him in the first instance out of charity, because I thought he looked very wretched and miserable, which was my only reason; I gave him into custody by the advice of a friend, yesterday fortnight, in River-lane, Islington; I had not seen him before, after I gave him the 7s. - he came to my house that day - I do not know how he knew where I lived - I had not told him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. How long have you carried on business in your present residence? A. Five years; I have been at Bristol many times, thirty years ago - I had no particular reason for leaving it, that I swear - it was about eleven o'clock on the 12th of November, that I first saw the prisoner - I spoke to him out of humanity - he was dressed as he is now as near as I can recollect, but he was very dirty and shivering from cold - I think he was rather ragged, but I did not take much notice of his dress - I think his trowsers were rather ragged down the side - I cannot say whether it was both sides - I cannot swear to one side - I think I saw the appearance of rags somewhere, but I did not particularize it - I think there was a little rags - I first asked if he had been to sea; he said, he had, but he should not wish to go to sea again, if he could procure a situation; I said, I thought I knew of one for him, where he would have a good bed to sleep on and plenty to eat; I then proposed to give him a pint of beer, and he said, he should have no objection; I did not ask him to follow me, but I told him I was going down Gutter-lane and he followed me at some distance; I did not tell him not to walk by my side to my knowledge - I will not swear I did not - I walked on the left hand side of the way, and he walked some distance behind me, on the same side - I did not keep looking behind me - I did not tell him to walk on the other side to my knowledge - I think I can venture to swear I did not - I had no reason for walking so far before him - I suppose it is a mile from where I first saw him to the public-house - I told him I was going to a public-house where I called now and then, and had a glass of beer, and he said, "I am going that way;" Type-street is not much out of the way; I could go in two minutes and a half from the bottom of Bunhill-row; the house is the sign of the Red Lion; we went direct into the parlour and called for a pint of porter; we did not have glasses; I drank a little of it; we both drank out of the same pot - we had no conversation; I sat and read the paper, and he drank the beer - I sat on a seat near the window, and he at a little distance from me; I did not ask him about any ship, or any women being allowed on board; I will positively swear I did not say anything about women; I did not say anything to him, nor he to me - on the next day I met him at the same place; I told him I was going to the same public-house; I walked on, and he followed me; I called for a pint of beer; I drank a little drop; he then put his hand into my trousers, in front, as far as he could; he was sitting at some little distance from me; he did not change his place; I stood up and went out - I said nothing to him - I left the room and came out, and he followed me - I walked quietly away; I was very much terrified - I did not say anything to the landlord, or any one in the house, as I did not know his motive for doing it - I suspected it was to see if I had any money - when I got half-way up Bunhill-row, the prisoner came again and said, "I come to have some money of you - if you do not give me some, I will give you into custody, for what you have been saying."</p>

               <p>Q Then he did not say, I come to demand money of you? A. No, sir, not in the first instance, but he did afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What else did he say? A. He said, he would follow me as close as my skin was to my body, but he would have some; he would not let me move away from him, and we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280126"></xptr>walked on together; I did not stop at all - I did not give him in charge as I never gave a person in charge in my life, and did not wish to do it - we walked together from Bunhill-row to Islington; and he went with me into Mr. Smith's the pawnbroker, just at the top of River-lane - I suppose that is a mile from Bunhill-row - I did not mention at Mr. Smith's that he had attempted to rob me as I thought I should never see him again.</p>

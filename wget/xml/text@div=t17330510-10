I went on, and they turn'd back and follow'd me. The Prisoner took hold of the Blanket, and said, What have you got here? 'Tis nothing but a Blanket, says I; and with that he gave me a Blow with his Fist, and knock'd me down. I held the Blanket still, and begg'd him not to abuse me, because I was big with Child. Then let go the Blanket, says he. I was loth to lose it, and struggled to keep it as long as I could; upon which he kick'd me, and at last pull'd it from me, and then he ran one Way, and the others who stood by, ran another Way. I cry'd out, Stop Thief, and follow'd the Prisoner, and he was taken within about 30 Yards, by a Man who was coming towards me. I heard him ask the Man why he stopp'd him? and the Man said, because the Woman cry'd out.</p>

            . As I was walking over Moorfields, between 8 and 9 at Night, I heard the Cry of Murder! Thieves! It was a little darkish, and running towards the Noise, I met the Prisoner coming full Speed from the Woman. She was then about 30 Yards off. I stopp'd him. He cry'd, What do you want? What do you want? I told him, I beliv'd he was the Person concern'd. She soon came up, and said, he had dragg'd her along the Ground by a Blanket, and taken it from her. He had nothing when I took him, but Somebody presently brought in the Blanket, and she said it was hers. The Prisoner deny'd that he knew any thing of the Matter, and said that he was not the first Man that had been wrongfully accus'd. We carry'd him to the Flying Horse by the Watch-house, and sent for a Constable, and next Day he was carry'd before Justice Chamberlain in Spittle-Yard.</p>

She's big with Child, says he, and I fancy she may have Child-bed Linnen. So we follow'd her, and he went foremost, gave her a Knock with his Fist, and tripp'd her up, and said, Damn you, deliver the Blanket. She struggled to keep it, and held one End while he dragg'd her along by the other, and at last he got it from her, and ran away. He had no Stick. We stood by to watch. He was taken at one End of the Field, and I at the other, and we were both carry'd to the same House, the Flying Horse; and going next Day before Justice Chamberlain, I confess'd, and made my Information.</p>

               <p>Bagley. Why, last Easter-Monday we got drunk together, and that was the first of our Acquaintance.</p>

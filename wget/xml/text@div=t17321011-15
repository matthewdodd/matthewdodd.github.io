The 2 Women followed me, and took away my Wallet of Stockings under pretence that they were afraid I should be robbed. Says I, robb'd or robb'd not I will go to London this blessed Night.

So we carry'd them to the Cage, and about 4 a-Clock the same Morning we met Richardson. He begun to rifle at me, and swore damn him, he would not go with us to the Cage; but however we made him, and as soon as Abigal saw him, she cry'd, and said, this is all along of you, if you had not jump'd out of Window, we had never been brought hither.</p>

               <p>Abigal Freeman. The Prosecutor came about Dusk. I was undressing my self in order to go to Bed. He sent for one Pot, and I sent for another. We sat drinking about an Hour and a Half, it was then near 10 a Clock; we went to the Chandler's-Shop for a Dram ; he was very much suddled, and my Husband not being at home, I desir'd him to stay all Night and lie in my Bed, and I would lie with my Sister. So I got him Upstairs. Coxon and Richardson lodg'd at my House, Richardson and the Prosecutor join'd together for a full Pot of Two-penny; I left 'em drinking, and went to see a Neighbour who was not well. I return'd about 11 and went to Bed, and knew no more of the matter till about 3 in the Morning, when I was waked by the Prosecutor.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Rochester—I am master of a barge belonging to Mr. Horsnaill. On 22nd Jan. I was delivering mangold-wurtzel and Swede turnips at White Hart Dock—the prisoner came to me there and said he should like to have some—I told him they were sold, but we were going down to load again, and I would bring him up a fresh load—he gave me his direction to give to my master, and I said, if my owner consented, he should have some—I saw him write it—this is it—I gave it to my master—I afterwards got a cargo of Swede turnips and mangold-wurtzel—I brought them to Horse-Ferry Dock on Saturday, 1st Feb.—when I got there I saw my owner and the prisoner talking together on the wharf—Mr. Horsnaill beckoned me to come on shore, and he said this man was going to sell the cargo, and I was to receive the money—when any carts came down to receive the cargo from the barge's side I was to receive the money before the carts left—the prisoner agreed to that—he said if it was a large cow-keeper came, it would not do to ask him to pay, but if it was one or two persons came he might do so—Mr. Horsnaill said if the whole money was paid afterwards it might go, and I was to go with him to receive the money—on the following Monday morning the prisoner was there again—I asked him whether he had sold the mangold-wurtzel and turnips—be said he had sold the half of them, which was about twenty, or twenty-four, or twenty-five tons, to Mr. Bowran, for 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the ton, and 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the Swedes—there came a wagon and two carts with Mr. Bowran's name on them, and in the afternoon some of Mr. Biggs' carts or wagons came—the prisoner told me he had sold them all, and Mr. Biggs was going to have part of them; that was the reason Mr. Biggs' carts came—the cargo altogether was forty-eight tons; and in the coarse of Monday and Tuesday the whole was delivered out, but seven tons to the carts of Bowran and Biggs—on the Tuesday evening the prisoner came again and said they should not be long in clearing the rest out, and he would clean himself and go with me to get the money—he went away, and I did not see him again—the seven tons were fetched away in the morning by Mr. Bowran's cart, but the prisoner was not there—I after<lb></lb>wards went with Mr. Horsnaill to Mr. Bowran's, and we afterwards met the prisoner—Mr. Horsnaill asked him when he was going to settle—he said, "I will settle with you directly"—he went a little way with us, and then he wanted to turn back to go to his wife—we went with him—he asked us to go into a public-house—we went inside a public-house door, and he went out and went over to his own door, which was right opposite—we waited outside—he did not come out, and I did not see him any more till he was in custody.</p>

About the end of Jan., I was spoken to by Hill—he gave me this address, and in consequence I called on the party, but did not see him—I then wrote this letter, which contained an offer to send him a cargo—I received another letter, stating that he accepted my offer to sell wurtzel, and get me 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per ton—in consequence of that, a freight</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Goswell-street—I know the prisoner. On the 20th of April he produced a promissory-note for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., at two months after date, dated 8th of April—he wanted me to discount it—I said I would rather not do it, having had one or two transactions with him before, and had a good deal of <hi rend="italic">bother</hi> with him—he said if I would do it he could get his father's name to it, and I returned it to him—when I first saw it it had only one name to it, which was his own endorsement—he represented his father as a respectable man—I made inquiry, and wrote this letter to his father—on the 28th he came again with the promissory-note, with his father's name, "Thomas Collingwood" upon it—I discounted it for him—he showed me a letter which he said he had received from his father—I did not get any answer from his father.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">Letter read</hi>)—"Mr. Collingwood—I am taking a bill or promissory-note of your son, Mr. Collingwood, and I wish to know if it is perfectly right, as I am taking it entirely on your name; if you will be kind enough to write by return of post, if it is quite correct, and will be paid, as I take it entirely I on your responsibility."</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Harcourt Arms Inn, Newnham Court, Oxfordshire—the prisoner is my son. This indorsement on his bill is not mine—I received this letter—I was very ill at the time, and gave it to my son a considerable time afterwards—I never gave him authority to put my name on that note.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was it not some considerable time after you received the letter before you saw the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—this matter had happened when I made a communication to him—I had allowed him to use my name, to try to get a situation, and so forth, and that I would become security for him, but not to use my name to a bill—I will not say he might not draw that inference—I certainly believe he had no intent to defraud.</p>

                  </hi>. I am gamekeeper to Richard Jepps, of East Wolds, Oldham—about midnight on 30th September I heard the noise of two dogs—I went out and crossed meadow and along a field—I saw three men in the hedgerow and two dogs; one of the men had a guano bag, which appeared to have something heavy in it; one had the stick produced—I ran after them and one struck me over the head and on the arm—they all ran away—Males' hat came off—I had-no rest for two nights from the effects of the blow which knocked me down—I shot one dog to save myself from being torn—it was a clear night—I knew the prisoners very well—I examined the place next morning; it had been all netted for about 60 yards up the hedge, as I saw the peg holes—I did not see any ferret; one was picked up last Tuesday by a man who goes hedging.</p>

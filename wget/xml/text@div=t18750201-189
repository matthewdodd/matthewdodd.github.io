                  </hi>. I live at South Lambeth—on the night of 26th January I went to bed about 11 o'clock and left everything safe—I was called up about 7.14 in the morning by the Inspector—I found the back kitchen window open which I had fastened over night, and missed articles worth about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—these produced are them.</p>

On the morning of 27th January I was in the Lambeth Road, and saw the prisoners coming from Stockwell towards town in a direction from Mr. Peddle's—I stopped them and asked where they came from, they said "Straight along the road"—I asked them where they were going—they said "To Vauxhall to try to get a job at the gas works"—I saw something bulky in front of Oliver, I touched him and said "What have you got there?"—he said "Nothing"—I said "Let's look"—I had a struggle with him, and shouted out to another constable, who came and secured McDonald—they were taken to the station and searched—on Oliver I found these two tankards and the teapot, and on McDonald nine forks and seven spoons in his pocket, and 2 lbs. of bacon and a box of matches—they said they had found the things just before they met me near a fence.</p>

When the prisoners were brought to the station I asked McDonald where he had got the property that was found upon him—he said he would not tell me anything—Oliver said he found them against the fence close to where the policeman stopped them—I went to the backs of the houses in Abbot Square, and at the back of 31 I saw the back kitchen window open—I went and knocked up the prosecutor—I found that the window had been opened by something being passed between the sashes to push the hasp back—I found this toast rack on the window ledge, a candle, and the remains of some matches.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Oliver's Defence.</hi> I was coming along to work and saw the articles placed in a corner with a lump of black rag over them—I saw the constable pass right by where they were, he must have seen them—I met this man, picked up the articles, and gave him the forks and spoons and took the other things myself—we went along the road and the constable came running after us and took us for breaking into the house and stealing the articles, of which I am innocent.</p>

I returned to the room about a quarter before one o'clock, found the window open and the things gone - there is a small garden before the house; the gate and the street-door were both shut - there were footmarks on a bed under the window, where they had stood.

            . I am an officer; the prosecutor's house is in the parish of St. Dunstan's, Stepney. On the 26th of January, the prosecutrix came to our office, said she was robbed, and took me to Christie's, they said the prisoner had just passed - I went out, and took her; they said she was the person. I then took her to her lodgings in George-yard - she pulled out a key, and unlocked the door. I saw a large box, and asked her for the key - she gave it to me, I there found the duplicate of the clothes. She said she met a woman in the street whom she drank with, and she asked her to pledge them. I found the rest of the things stated in the indictment behind her box - it was about three o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

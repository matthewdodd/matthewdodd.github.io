               <p>PETER CHAPMAN sworn. - On Saturday evening, the 3d of November, about eight o'clock, I was standing at my own door, which is next door to the prosecutor's; I saw the prisoner come out with the tables; I went in and asked her, if she had lost any tables; she looked, and said, she believed there was one or two gone; I went some distance, and found two tables standing under a baker's shop, in Dean-street, the corner of Carlisle-street, about 800 yards or better from Mr. Atkinson's house; there was a man in the habit of a sailor in possession of them, not the prisoner, that man I endeavoured to secure, but he made his escape; I then put a person in possession of the tables, and went back to the prosecutor's house, to see if he could swear to the tables; the wife came with me; when I came back, I saw the prisoner, within 100 yards of the tables, looking at them, I knew him to be the man that I had seen come out with the tables, and I secured him and took him to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>MARY ATKINSON sworn. - On Saturday evening, the 3d of November, Mr. Chapman came to me to know if I had lost any thing; I then missed them; I went with him to see them, and one of them was a new pembroke table, my husband had oiled it, we had not bought it above ten minutes before; and the other table had got three mahogany legs and one beech one; I had seen them a few minutes before.

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Alexander Brown, who is a seafaring man. I let lodgings—I have known the prisoner nearly five years—in October last he came to my house, and said he had come from the <hi rend="italic">Phantom</hi> brig on the coast of Africa, that he had got 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; prize money to receive, and put these papers into my hand—he said I must go with him next morning to Somerset-house, to get some of the prize-money—I went with him—he did not get any the first time—he went two or three times—he did not re<lb></lb>ceive any money in my presence—on the 14th Nov. he paid me about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; which he owed me, and left 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in my hands—he drew that in two or three days—he then asked me to advance him more money till the middle of December upon these two papers, which he said were prize papers—I let him have sometimes 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and sometimes 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., at different times, and with <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> hire, and all together it came to 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—I went with him once in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to Norfolk-street, Strand, for the purpose, as he said, of getting some money—I cannot recollect the day of the month—I went several times—he took me to a public-house near where he said the agents were—I went with him again to Norfolk-street—I began to feel dissatisfied, not having his money at the time he told me—he left me more than two hours, and when be came back he said, "I am all right"—I said I was very glad of it—I said, "Have you got your money?"—he said, "No, I have not got my money, but I have got a paper which the agent has signed for me to get my money on the 2nd January"—he gave me this third paper—I made all these advances before I received this—I remarked that it was but for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said, "Oh, yes, it is"—I said, "This is not all you have got to take?"—he said, "It is a mistake, it is 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;"—next day, I think, he took me up to the Admiralty—he said he could not pay me that day, he could not get the money, it was not all paid into the office—the last time he took me out he gave me the slip and went away, before that he asked me if I had any money, I said all I had was 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I gave him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I after<lb></lb>wards heard of his being at the King and Queen public-house in Mary-street, and found him there in a fresh suit of clothes—he got away from me then—I found him again in the Commercial-road, told him I had lost all my money by him, and desired him to settle with me—I had borrowed some of the money to assist him—I have been selling my things also to raise the money, believing he would pay me at last—I should not have trusted him with this large sum of money if I had not believed they were genuine papers entitling him to money—he brought me a newspaper to satisfy me it was payable at that time—there is no mention of money in the two first papers, but he re<lb></lb>presented that he was entitled to receive money, and these papers would enable him to get it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a navy-agent, and live in Upper-terrace, Islington. On the 14th of Nov. the prisoner came to me with other seamen belonging to the <hi rend="italic">Phantom</hi>, and applied for an advance on his prize-money—he was en<lb></lb>titled to several prizes taken by Her Majesty's ship Phantom—we cannot tell the amount, we can only judge what it may amount to before it is pay<lb></lb>able—I advanced him 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he went to Somerset-house, before the ex<lb></lb>aminers of prizes, and signed a prize-order in my favour to that amount, including the order and stamp—seamen generally calculate that they are en<lb></lb>titled to a great deal more than they really are—he wanted about the amount I gave him—he did not ask for more—he considered he would have about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; more—I was to have the commission of 2 1/2 per cent.—about the middle of Dec. he came and asked for a further advance of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;, which I de<lb></lb>clined giving him—on the 8th of Jan. a payment took place, and I received 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., leaving my order not yet satisfied by 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Halford and Co., navy-agents, in Norfolk-street—they are agents to Commander Haines, late of Her Majesty's ship <hi rend="italic">Phantom</hi>—she was engaged in the suppression of the slave-trade on the Afri<lb></lb>can coast, and made prizes—this paper (No. 3) is not genuine—I know Captain Haines's writing perfectly well—it is not his signature, nor is any part of it his writing—these other papers (1 and 2) are genuine—they merely describe the time of his service, and so on—I know nothing of the prisoner—we have no prize-money due at present—on a rough calculation, I should say about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be due to the prisoner—not more than 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in ad<lb></lb>dition to what has been drawn, under Captain Haines's command—the Phan<lb></lb>tom was under the command of Captain Butterfield, prior to Captain Haines—it is not in my power to say what the gross amount due to the prisoner would be—we are not agents to Captain Butterfield—I do not know how much he may be entitled to under other commanders, but under Captain Haines, the most would be 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; additional—certainly no such sum as 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—it would depend on the number of prizes and slaves taken—I have not heard of any prizes made by the <hi rend="italic">phantom</hi>, which could at all account for an expec<lb></lb>tation of 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—that is a very large sum indeed for a common sailor to re<lb></lb>ceive.</p>

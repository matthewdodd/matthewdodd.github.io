On the 19th of April, about eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to me by Kingsland turnpike - she said to me, "Little boy, I want to speak to you: will you go on an errand for me? and I will give you a penny" - I said "Yes" - she was quite a stranger to me - she took me to the end of Rook-place, and sent me to Mr. Hitch's, at No.3, to ask for a cloak for Mrs. Gardner - I went and saw Mrs. Hitch- I got the cloak from her, and gave it to the prisoner - she told me to wait, and she would give me the penny; but she did not come back - she was taken about nine o'clock - I am sure she is the person.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you seen her before? A. No - it was not quite dark - the lamps were lighted - I know she is the person by her curls, her bonnet, and shawl - I said at the police-office I knew her by her curls - I did not mention her bonnet and shawl.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the magistrate ask you how you knew the woman? A. Yes; and I said I knew her by her curls, bonnet and shawl - I am thirteen years old - the prisoner went to the corner of Rook-place with me - I then gave her the cloak, and went on my mother's errand - I waited about ten minutes to get my penny.</p>

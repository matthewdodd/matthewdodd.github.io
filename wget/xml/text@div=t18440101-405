About half-past ten o'clock on Tuesday night, the 10th of Dec., I was in a lane in Lower Clapton—I saw both the prisoners walking together—Murphy had a bundle on his back—I asked what they had got jn the bundle—Murphy said a goose, and it was their own; he got it from Waltham-abbey—they went very quietly to the station—Murphy carried the bundle—he untied it—I found a goose in it—it was quite warm, and appeared to have been a very short time dead—I asked if they wished to say anything—Barr said it was his own, and he brought it from Edmonton; and Murphy said he saw the other at Clapton-gate, and was going to take the goose from Clapton-gate to town for him.</p>

He has a field with two ponds about 100 yards from his house—he had four geese in the field—they were safe on Sunday morning when I went to feed them—they were safe there at three o'clock in the day—on Monday morning I missed an old goose which I knew well—I went to the station, and saw it there—it was my master's.</p>

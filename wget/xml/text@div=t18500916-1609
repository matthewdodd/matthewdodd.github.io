                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, D</hi> 30). On 22nd August, about two o'clock in the morning, I was in Bell-street, New-road—I received infor<lb></lb>mation from Knight, and in consequence went with him and Pierce to the pri<lb></lb>soner, Martin St. Ledger's house, 75, Devonshire-street, Lisson-grove—it is a beer-shop—while we were outside, I heard as if persons were playing at bagatelle inside—I heard numbers counted, 3, 6, 9, 21, 23, 46, balls rattle, and persons in conversation, and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. clink upon the table—I knocked at the door, and a person who I recognised by his voice to be Martin St. Ledger, said, "Who is there?" I said, "Police!" and he said, "Go round to the front-door"—the door I went to first, is a side-door in a court—I went round to the front-door, which is in Devonshire-street, waited five or six minutes, and while doing so I heard several persons going up-stairs, and the rattle of glass—Martin opened the door in five or six minutes, and I then got to the front of the bar; I found no one there—there was a middle door, which goes into the bar, secured by a wedge, and I said, "Where are the people who were here?"—he opened the door, and said, "If there are people there you had better find them"—I looked, and did not see any one—I said, "I am certain you had people playing at bagatelle"—he said, "There is no bagatelle-board here"—I said, no doubt it was a portable one—I did not go up-stairs—sergeant Pierce looked behind a door which shuts against the staircase, and directly he pulled that back, a man and a woman came down-stairs; Knight said, "What are these people here?"—we had been in the house before that night, and Martin said, "You have been here before, and I will serve you out for this"—I said, "Why you are drunk"—he said, "Well if I am, I am in my own house"—the man who came down, was John St. Ledger, and he directly struck Knight on the side of the head, which knocked his hat off—I was at the sill of the door at the time, and I turned farther round to expostulate with him, he made some observation which I</p>

About two o'clock on the morning of 22nd, I went with Steer and Knight to this beer-shop in Devonshire-street, kept by Martin St. Ledger—while outside I heard sounds which appeared to be bagatelle balls, and heard numbers counted, 3, 9, 21, and glasses rattle "we knocked at the door—I said we were police—we were told to go round to the other door, and we should be let in—about five minutes after that, Martin let us in—while waiting we heard sounds of several people going up-stairs—when the door was opened I said to Martin, "Where are the people who were playing at bagatelle or skittles?"—he said there were no people—I said, "It is wrong for you to have people playing at this time and drinking, and you drunk"—he said, "If I am drunk, I an in my own house"—I said,</p>

               <p>"Very well, that will do; let me out", and I went out; Steer was follow<lb></lb>ing me, and Knight after him—as we were going out, John came down-stairs with a woman, and said, "Hallo, what is the matter?" and struck Knight, and knocked his hat off, and he staggered out at the door—the door was closed, and Steer's leg came between the door and the door-post, and the door was closed upon him—Steer cried out, "My leg, my leg! open the door"—I should say the door was kept closed five minutes, during which time I cried out to the persons inside, "Open the floor; you will break the man's leg!"—I did not get any answer—I sprang my rattle—some other constables came up—we then pushed the door open, and got Steer away—when we got him into the street be fainted—when the door was pushed open, I saw Martin and John St. Ledger—I did not see M'Donald.</p>

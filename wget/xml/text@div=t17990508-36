               <p>Q. So that if a coachman was to call to this man crossing the road, he would not hear it? - A. He has been run over several times.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you seen him fall down? - A. No, I had not; the first I saw he was lying under the horse's belly; I held up my hand in this direction to the coachman to stop; the prisoner at the bar was a <rs id="t17990508-36-deflabel216" type="occupation">coachman</rs>

               <p>Q. Did he stop? - A. He did not stop then, and the fore wheel of the carriage went over Mr. Gray.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the cause of his immediate death?</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. A. No, my Lord, he lived three weeks after that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the coachman hear you call to him to stop? - A. I do not exactly know that he did; I kept still calling to him to stop, but he did not stop; he went round the corner into Duke-street, and there I lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he driving Furiously? - A. He was going by no means fast, I think the jog trot of a hackney-coach; I attended to the man, got him out of the road, and he was sent to the Middlesex Hospital; I examined him, and found that his thigh was broke, and one of his arms.</p>
               <p>Q. On what day was this? - A. On Monday, the 15th of April, last Monday was three weeks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. This was a gentleman's carriage? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he was driving no more than the pace of an ordinary hackney-coach? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether he heard you call to him, you cannot tell? - A. No, he might not.</p>

             sworn. - I am house surgeon of the Middlesex Hospital, I reside there; I was in the hospital when the deceased was brought in; I examined him, and found his right arm broke, it was a compound fracture, and his right thigh broke; had he been a young man, he might have recovered this injury; but, being an old man, there was no chance of his recovering, his arm being a compound fracture: he continued in the hospital from the 15th of April to the 4th of May.</p>

               <p>Q. The verdict of the Coroner's Jury was accidental death, I believe? - A. I believe it was.</p>

             sworn. - On the 15th of April I had a warrant to apprehend the prisoner; going to the office, I said to him, coachman, why do not you take more care, and stop your horses; says he, I called out to the man, he would not get out of the way; says I, why did not you draw your horses on one side; he said, it was his own fault; I told him he did not know what trouble he was bringing upon himself, but his troubles were nothing to the poor old gentleman's, with his broken arm; says he, it serves him right if his neck was broke.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. How long was this after the accident? - A. About an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. By that time had he not rendered himself insensible by intoxication? - A. Yes, he was in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. It was as much as he could do to walk, was it not? - A. No, he could walk very well.</p>

               <p>Q. Mrs. Chisholme, I believe was? - A. Yes; his character was quiet, orderly, inoffensive, and sober; he was on board wages the first six weeks,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080061"></xptr>and, in the course of that time, I had an opportunity of observing whether he was a fit person to be taken into my house; I found he was, and it is my duty to say, that I believe he would not wilfully have injured any man.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five other witnesses, who deposed that he was a humane, tender-hearted, good man, and that they believed he would not hurt a worm. <rs id="t17990508-36-verdict217" type="verdictDescription">

             sworn. I am a victualler, I live at the Cape of Good Hope, Devonshire-street, Portland-place. On the 16th of March, the prisoner came into my house, about nine o'clock in the evening; after sitting some time, he offered the watch for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180604160060"></xptr>sale, he said he had been very ill, and was very much reduced, would be glad if somebody would buy it of him, he at first asked three guineas and a half, he came down at last to twenty-five shillings; the man came and asked me my opinion whether he should buy it, I advised him not to buy it; as he was coming by the bar, he wished me to lend him half a crown upon it; I took the watch away from him, and gave him in charge of the watchman. On seeing him bring the watch in his hand I thought he had stole it, I do not think he had any pocket to put it in. I wrote to the man who cleaned the watch at Edgware, and on Tuesday morning the prosecutor came to me, (The watch produced, and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>

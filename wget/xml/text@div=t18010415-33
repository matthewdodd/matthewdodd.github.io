             sworn. - I am a journeyman carpenter, I work with Mr. Nash, of Wapping-wall: On Saturday night, the 28th of March, about ten minutes past nine o'clock, I went up New Gravel-lane, and saw the prisoner driving two pigs; I had some suspicion of him; I asked him where he was going with these pigs, at that time of night; he said, he was going home with them; I asked him where he bought them, he said, he had bought them on board-a-ship, he seemed very much fluttered; I said, my friend, they are not your property, you have stolen these pigs; says he, then you had better stop me; I said, I have a great mind to stop you; I followed him, driving the pigs up Ratcliff-highway; I took a great deal of notice of him, and the pigs too, it was a moonlight night; he then drove them up King David's-lane, Mile-end; I stopped there, and pursued him no farther; I was in company with him about twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before? - A. I have seen him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Under all these circumstances, have you any doubt that the prisoner is the man? - A. None; I remarked one pig in particular, that was the barrow-pig, it was swelled under the belly; I saw that one of the tails was cut short, I did not observe the other tail; the next morning, I was at the barber's shop, and heard that Mr. Blackling had lost the pigs; I went with him to Special's, where I saw the same two pigs; I am sure they were the same.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180104150023"></xptr>Blackling. One of them was a barrow-pig, and there was a large swelling under the belly, which is very usual.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. As I was coming home on the Saturday night, I saw these pigs in the street, and I was going to drive them to the Green-yard, but it being rather late, I asked Mr. Special to let me leave them there till the next morning.</p>

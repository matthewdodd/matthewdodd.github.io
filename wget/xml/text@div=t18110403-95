At the same time the prisoners Healy and Smith ran by me; I observed that an attempt had been made at my pocket, and determined to walk slow that we might observe them. When we reached Mr. Cato's the two prisoners were looking and appearing to make some observation on the birds in the window, which caught my particular attention; I expected a probability of being attacked again, and therefore it put me on my guard. I am confident they were the same men. When we had proceeded as far as the Swan gateway on Holborn bridge I felt again a second attempt, much more severe than the first, and a man's hand at the mouth of my pocket; I do not say it was his, it may have been his. I applied<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181104030051"></xptr>my hand to my pocket, held my handkerchief tight, the same moment the two prisoners ran by me a second time, I had only a few paces to go after them. I left my wife and went after them, I was determined I would take them; they went into George-court, when I came to the end of the court I surprised them, and they ran; I ran after them, and in consequence of a cart loading or unloading at the top of the yard they escaped by getting under the horses bellies, and ran down Chick-lane; I pursued them to a narrow passage that leads to the entrance of Chick-lane, but from prudent motives I thought it best to retire.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen them before - A. I knew their faces perfectly well, we lost some goods a few days before. Their persons were very familiar to me, I have no doubt of their persons.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Sepulchre's parish. On the 11th of February, about half past six in the evening, Mr. Lutwych came to my house, I went with him in search of the two prisoners. In Holborn, opposite of Field-lane, I saw two men standing close together, as if they were waiting for something; Mr. Lutwych said, here they are; I laid hold of one, and he the other. As we were conveying them to the Poultry Compter I kept looking behind me, in the middle of Cheapside I missed Mr. Lutwych, I conveyed my prisoner in, I went to see for Mr. Lutwych, he said he would deliver his prisoner up to me, he had endeavoured to make a rescue, and when he found he could not he accused him of being one of the Vere-street gang. I then conveyed Healy to the counter, and there Mr. Lutwych said, that is the man that accused me of being one of the Vere-street gang; he replied, I do not doubt but you are one; he put his hand to his backside, made use of a bad expression, and said he might kiss his backside. I searched Healy, I found two knives about him; this is a French knife, he said his father gave him that knife, he used it to cut cows tails.</p>
               <p>MR. LUTWYCH. In consequence of our having lost the goods some days before I followed them into George-yard, and there I thought fit to retire, but thinking it was my duty to take them if I could I went to Warrell, it was getting darkish; we went down Saffron Hill, to the extremity of Field-lane, by Mr. Cato's; I saw the prisoners, I immediately seized them both; Smith I gave to Warrall, and the other I took myself; in Skinner-street he was very troublesome, he wanted me to strike him; I told him I would not. When we came as far as Newgate market he taxed me with indecent liberties, I told him if he said any more about it I would knock him down, but I did not strike him; in Cheapside he would not go on any further he said; I made him go on; bye and bye he said I belonged to the Vere-street gang. I asked one gentleman to assist me in taking this man, when the charge was given by Healy that I was one of the Vere-street gang they all shrunk; if he had had any of his accomplices about him I do not know the consequence. I said, let me be what I will, go you shall, and in the presence of Warrall, when he came, he then accused me of being one of the Vere-street gang.</p>

               <p>Mr. Allen. I was call'd up between 1 and 2 o'Clock in the Night, the 12th of July last, by a Neighbour's Servant, who is a Baker, and lives over - against my House. I look'd out of my Chamber Window, and he told me, somebody had been breaking into my Cellar. I desir'd him to watch, 'till I could come down; and when I came to examine the Cellar Door, I found one of the Bolts broke, and the Staples that belong'd to the other, were broke likewise. I had order'd my Servant to fasten them about Eight o'Clock; which he did; for after I had been out, to take a Pint of Beer, I return'd Home, and about Nine, I saw them both fast. When I found the Door broke open, I order'd my Servant to search the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173809060003"></xptr> Cellar; he found the Prisoner hid behind a Hogshead of Oyl, and lugg'd him towards the Cellar Window; then I help'd to pull him out, and he was carry'd to the Watch House.</p>

            . I am Servant to Mr. Spurling, a Baker, over-against Mr. Allen's. On the 12th of July, at Night, I was at Work there; and hearing a Noise, I look'd through a Hole in the Window, and saw a Man piddling about the Cellar Window; I ask'd him, what he was doing there? upon which he rose up, and went away without speaking; but I did not speak very loud, for fear some of his Companions might be about the Window, and do me a Mischief. Then I call'd my Master up; and when he and the Servants came down, I went out, and finding Mr. Allen's Cellar Door wrenched open, I knock'd at his Door, and acquainted him with it. He came down with his Apprentice, and as soon as they got a Candle, the young Man went into the Cellar, and I was going to my Work; but before I had got to my own Door, he cry'd out, - he had found the Man. Mr. Allen immediately shut the Cellar Door to keep them both in, 'till I came back; then we open'd the Door, and I help'd to pull the Prisoner out.</p>

            . I am Mr. Allen's Servant. I fasten'd the Cellar Window a little after Eight, and push'd both the Bolts home. About Ten, I went to Bed, and a little after One, the Baker knock'd at the Door, and said the Cellar Window was open. Upon this, my Master and I came down, and he order'd me to go into the Cellar, where I found the Prisoner conceal'd behind a Hogshead of Oyl. I call'd for Assistance, and snatching up a Shovel, I stroke him a Blow, which made him reel; then I seiz'd him, and lugg'd him to the Cellar Window, and my Master and the Baker took him out. I don't remember that he spoke one Word, while he was in the Cellar; nor had he any thing about him, but a Steel and a Tinder-box, which the Constable found in his Pocket. My Master is a <rs id="t17380906-5-viclabel24" type="occupation">Currier</rs>

If the Prisoner had got into the House through the Cellar, he must have broke open more Doors.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. As to the Steel and Tinderbox, - I was going to my Wife at Colchester, and they were only to light my Pipe, as I went along. And as to my being found in the Cellar, - I had been drinking, and in passing along, I chanc'd to fall down into it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Allen. He could not fall into the Cellar, unless he fell into it on purpose, after he had open'd the Door; and I am sure he was quite sober. <rs id="t17380906-5-verdict25" type="verdictDescription">

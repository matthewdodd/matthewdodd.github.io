                  </hi>. I am a wire-weaver, living in Mark-lane; Berry was my servant. In consequence of information I went into to parlour on the 5th of June, and called her up—I said I had had a very awkward charge brought against her by the policeman; that he had suspi<lb></lb>cion of her having given to Allen two bottles of wine, and some sugar—she said she knew nothing of it—I asked her if she knew Allen—she denied ever having seen him in her life—I asked how she came to admit the man into the yard—she said he rang the bell, and forced his way in, offering some wine to sell to her—I put samples of the sugar in my pocket, and went with two friends and the policeman, to see whether it corresponded with that found on Allen's person, and it did—the wine I believe to be some of a very old wine I had in my cellar.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Mark-lane, near the prosecutor's, About four o'clock in the afternoon, on the 5th of June, I was sitting at our drawing-room window—I saw Allen sitting on the corner of the corn-market stairs—half-an-hour after, all of a sudden, I observed him run to the gateway—I ran down, looked under the gate, and saw the prisoners together—there was no knocking or ringing.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable, No.</hi> 534.) I saw Allen sitting on the steps for upwards of an hour—after that I saw him enter the prosecu<lb></lb>tor's wicket-gate—I never heard either a ring or a knock—the door closed after him—I ran over, and looked through the key-hole of the wicket-gate—I saw both the prisoners in conversation—I could not understand what</p>

               <p>they said—I returned, and as I passed the gate again it was opened by some person, and I saw both the prisoners talking—I crossed on the right side, and Allen then name out—I saw he had something about his coat different to when he sat on the corn-market steps—I overtook him, and in his left coat pocket I saw the neck of a bottle—I took the bottle out of his pocket—I said, "Where did you get this from? you come back to the house where you came from, and give an account of it and yourself"—I went back with him to the house—I pulled the bell, and Berry came to the door—I said to her, "Do you know this man?"—she said "No"—I said, "Do you know this wine?"—she said, "No, only he came and offered it for sale"—I said to Allen, "You have got something else on the other side"—I took this bag of sugar out of his pocket—the name of "Carter, bread and biscuit baker, 28, Great Tower-street, London," is on it—I asked Berry if she knew anything of that—she said "No"—I asked if her master and mistress were at home—she said "No"—I took Allen to the station, and found another bottle of wine in his right-hand pocket—I asked if he knew Berry—he said, only from her lodging in a house that he did, in the Borough—the wine has been very much shaken—these are the same corks that were in the bottles—I sealed them up at the station.</p>

Q.</hi> Was it a close wicket-gate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—there was no crowd round me—I looked through the keyhole for about a minute—the prisoners were talking just inside the gate—they might be two or three yards from the gate—I am sure they were not before the keyhole—I could tee Berry's face.</p>

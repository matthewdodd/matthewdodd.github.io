               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing happening at your house - A. On last Monday, I went out on my business, selling things. There had been a grand review. The prisoner broke into my house; he took the tiles off, and broke through the ceiling. I went out between nine and ten o'clock; every thing was safe in the house then, I returned between four and five o'clock; my things were all tossed about, and the plaster and mortar was all on the floor; it appeared that somebody had come into the house at the top, by taking the tiles off, and breaking through the lath and plaster, they got into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any of your property - A. Yes, there is some part of it here. I missed a red cloak, an apron, a shawl, and an handkerchief of mine; of my husband's a small tea-spoon, two waistcoats, a pair of leather breeches, and a shirt.</p>

               <p>Q. What was your cloak worth - A. Fifteen shillings, an apron one shilling, the shawl five shillings, the handkerchief one shilling, the tea-spoon nine pence, two waistcoats five shillings, the breeches five shillings, a pair of stockings, value one shilling, and the shirt five shillings. I could not replace them for that money. I saw the property the next day, at a woman's at Brentford, where he had sold it; not all the property, only what I have got in my basket. The prisoner was present at the time I saw it in the woman's custody; her name is Crockett. The prisoner owned that he took the property before my face. They said it would be better for him, if he confessed.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you must not tell any thing he said after he confessed; was your husband at home - A. No, he was along with me helping to sell the things.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. You do not know what terms your husband has the house upon - A. I took the house, and pay the rent for it. It is in the parish of Easton.</p>

            . I took the prisoner in custody at his own house, at Hounslow. I had a search warrant to search the house. I found nothing in his house. He confessed. I went with him to Mrs. Crockett's.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told him it would be better for him to confess - A.No, I did not; he said voluntary to me, as we were going along the road, that he took the things, and sold them to Mrs. Crockett. These are the things that I took from Mrs. Crockett. I have had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160015"></xptr> them ever since, and he said he got into the house at the back part. He took off the tiling, and broke through the cieling, and he entered the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these things shown to the prisoner at Mrs Crockett's - A. They were. He said these were the things that he took from the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of the other person say any thing to him - A. I cannot say; they might make a promise.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Gunnell. Look at these things, and say which of them are your's, and your husband's - A. This red cloak is mine, and the shawl, and this apron. The two waistcoats are my husband's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I confessed to Mr. Cook, the high constable. I was taken up for something else, and then I confessed.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

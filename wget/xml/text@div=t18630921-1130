I deal in fruit, and live at 4, White Horse-yard, Westminster-road—I bought a horse of the prisoner five or six weeks ago—I don't know the date—I was charged with stealing and receiving it, and discharged—the man came and owned it, and a policeman took it away—the prisoner said it was his own—a man named Bartram was with him at the time he sold it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a greengrocer, at Bromley—on the first Friday in July, I bought the horse in question, for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I afterwards employed the prisoner to take it to Smithfield—I told him to take it up to the Bird-in-Hand, and wait there till I came; when I got there he was gone—I found him at the market—I refused the money offered for the horse, and told him to bring it home and I would pay him—he lives at Stepney—I never knew Bartram till afterwards.</p>

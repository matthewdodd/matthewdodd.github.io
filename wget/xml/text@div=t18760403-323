                  </hi>. I reside at 469, New Cross Road—I was in business as a licensed victualler twenty-five years—I have left it about eighteen months—on 25th May, 1875, the prisoner was introduced to me by a person named Rywall, an auctioneer at New Cross—he said he wanted a little money—I asked what security he could give; he said I might go home to his house in Cooper's Row, Kent Road, and see his furniture; he would give me that as security—I asked him whether, it was encumbered or whether he had any lodgers; he said no, it was all his own—I went with Rywall to the house 30, Cooper's Row, and we took an inventory of two rooms—the prisoner said that all the furniture there belonged to him—his daughter was not there at that time—this bill of sale was written out by</p>

               <p>Rywall on that same day, and the prisoner signed it—this is his signature, "W. Chas. Smith" (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—I advanced him 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the security of that bill of sale—in August he came again, and said he wanted to increase the loan to about 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to purchase a horse and cart—he said he was an, egg merchant, and was supplying the Crystal Palace with eggs and butter—I Bad some stone bottles, to contain from two to seven gallons, and he said he could work them in his business very nicely if I could sell them cheap—they cost me about 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I sold them to him for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were branded with other names, which made them rather unsolvable—I gave him 46<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked him what security he was going to give for it; he said he would give the horse and cart that he was about buying with, the money I was going to lend him—that was added to the bill of sale—no part of the money miss repaid—he put me off several times; at last, hearing that he was in very great difficulties, I went to his house—I then saw him and his daughter—I said I had come for my money—he wanted to put me off a little longer, and said he would pay me every. halfpenny—to make a long story short, I left a man in possession—the daughter said to me, "Is that your authority? this is mine," producing some papers rolled up in her hand—she did not show me what they contained—she said she had got a bill of sale, on the furniture; that her father would be the ruin of them;. it was all her own furniture, and he knew it—she said that in his presence—I afterwards instructed the man to take the goods (away—I afterwards received a notice not to part with them—I kept them for a month in case the prisoner should, redeem them, and then they were sold—an action was brought against me by the daughter in the Common Pleas, and she recovered a verdict for 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and costs 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I never had any of my money—the prisoner offered me 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before I took the goods away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My son-in-law, Freeborn, went with me to the prisoner's house—Rywall is not here that I am aware of; he is now somewhere in Fleet Street—the first bill of sale was for a month; I was to have 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the lean of the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the month—I have not many customers like that; I do not charge more than 60 per cent—I do not know a man named Diprose; I never heard of him—I was asked that question at the police-court—I don't know that Rywall was connected with Diprose; I have only seen him once for the last six months—I believe I said before the Magis<lb></lb>trate "I have persons now indebted to me at the same rate of inte<lb></lb>rest, 60 per cent., on monthly bills of acceptance"—I don't know that the prisoner was charged 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. by Rywall for preparing the bill of sale; I gave him half a sovereign—I don't know what the prisoner paid him—both bills of sale were signed at Smith's house; no one was present but Smith, Rywall, and myself—Rywall has drawn half a dozen bills of sale for me—I do not keep any books—I did not tell Smith I would not let him have the money unless he took the bottles; I old the daughter if she would give me 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down and a bill of sale for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I would withdraw—I did not like to break the home up—Smith offered to give me 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that was all the money he could scrape together then—would not take it—that was when I left the man in possession—I think here were two or three beds sold at the auction—Smith brought the horse and cart and harness to my place; I sold them—I don't know who bought hem; they fetched about 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner was sober when he signed the ill of sale—we went into a public-house after it was settled—Rywall was a the Common Pleas when the action was tried; he was not called as a</p>

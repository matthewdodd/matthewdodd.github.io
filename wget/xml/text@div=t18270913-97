In consequence of an anonymous letter I watched him, and about a quarter past nine o'clock, on the 15th of August, I saw the prisoner Jones come in, and when he went out, I followed him, and asked what he had been to the warehouse for; he said he had got a little hair; I asked how much; he seemed confused, and said about a pound or half a pound: I took him into the counting-house, and asked him what he paid for it; he seemed confused, and said Ryan could tell what he paid for it; I called Ryan, who said 18d.: I had the hair weighed, and it was 2lbs. 10ozs., the value of which is 7s. 6d. I told Ryan he must be a very bad man to deliver so much hair at such a price: he said it was a mistake altogether; I said I could not look it over, and got an officer - I had seen nothing take place between the prisoners in the shop; Ryan entreated forgiveness, and said it was his first offence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Then Jones went into the house? A. Yes; Riley said it was his first offence, and that he had done wrong - I do not recollect his saying it was a mistake - he had lived seventeen years with us, and bore a very good character.</p>

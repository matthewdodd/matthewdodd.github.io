            . I keep the house. The prisoner and the prosecutor came there about nine o'clock at night - he was very much intoxicated; they went up stairs, and were there a little while - she then came down, went over to the White Hart, and fetched a young woman to see if he had lost his watch - she then brought this watch down and told me if he asked for it, I was to give it him, and if he asked who came in with him, to say nothing, as she would not stop with him, because he had no money to pay her - he put a handkerchief round her neck when he first came in; the door was left open - two or three women lodge in the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He was in liquor - I took him into the landlady's room; he tied the handkerchief round my neck - we then went up stairs; he had no money, and as there was no lock to the door, I took his watch to give to Mrs. Cummins.</p>

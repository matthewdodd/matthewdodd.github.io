I am a seaman—the prisoner is my brother—he lived with me in Frederick Street, Greenwich—on 17th May I went home and found him lying on the sofa; I said "What are you breaking the things for; I won't have any more of this ere; you will have to get out of this 'ere"—I took hold of his shoulder, and he resisted—a struggle took place between us—he was very drunk and I was. sober—I got him; out, and then found a wound in my side—I had not felt anything; I was too much excited—blood running down first attracted my attention—I became uncon<lb></lb>scious—I have been attended by a medical men—the wound hat healed now.</p>

I am the wife of Robert Stephenson—I heard screams in the street on 17th May, and saw the two Mr. Diblins and Mrs. Diblins struggling on the ground—I ran out to pick up Mrs. Diblin—another neighbour and I, succeeded in getting the prisoner away—his face was very much disfigured, and blood was running from it—I was washing his face, and the door opened and Mrs. Diblin said he had been stabbed—I saw him draw something from his pocket and try to open a knife; he partially succeeded, and I snatched it from his hand and called him a coward—that was not after the stab—I had not heard about the stabbing</p>

               <p>then—I gave it to a neighbour—I did not observe whether there was way blood on it; I was too agitated—the prisoner was very drunk indeed—he was not given in custody then; Mrs. Diblin said "For God's sake come in; my husband is bleeding to death from loss of blood," and I went in.</p>

I am a surgeon, of Greenwich—I was called, and found the prosecutor on a couch with a small incised wound about half an inch long and a quarter of an inch deep in the region of the stomach—I do not know how deep it was beneath—a knife like this would produce it—he did not lose much blood; it has healed up very nicely.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. Q. What was the prisoner? - A. I took the prisoner as my <rs id="t18050109-45-deflabel236" type="occupation">servant</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18050109-45-defend464 t18050109-45-deflabel236"></join> about a year ago, and trusted him with the whole management of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss these articles? - A. In the month of November last, from information that I then had, I applied to Bow-street for a search-warrant; I saw the things taken out of the box by the Officer; it was a box of mine, but I had no particular use for it; I desired him to send up all the keys of what I had in the house; having some suspicion, he sent every key whatever, except the key of this trunk; he appropriated this trunk intirely to himself, it contained every thing of his own property; when I saw the contents of this trunk, the thing that struck me most was the handkerchiefs, and from what I understood, he had accused the other servants of taking them; what we found in that trunk he owned; the four handkerchiefs and the two card-racks were found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180501090039"></xptr>in that trunk at my house, No. 3, York-street, Baker-street, Westminster, on the 24th of December.</p>
               <p>Q. Those things were found in your box; do you know them to be your property? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You missed them in November? - A. I was informed of it in November.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever mentioned any thing to the prisoner of the loss of cambric handkerchiefs? - A. No, I did not, because he mentioned it to me on my arrival in the house of the four handkerchiefs being lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you keep these handkerchiefs in York-street? - A. They should have been there.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the handkerchiefs lost before the watch was missing? - A. I believe the watch was missing many months before the handkerchiefs; I was informed of them both on the same day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. The prisoner at the bar had accompanied you to Ireland? - A. Yes, I arrived in Ireland on the first of August, and remained there till the 21st of November.</p>
               <p>Q. During all this time the prisoner was attending you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any recollection whether this watch was in Ireland? - A. I do not recollect it, if it had, I should have taken notice of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not seen the watch at the hotel? - A. I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. The intelligence you received of the loss of your four handkerchiefs was immediately upon your return from Ireland? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing the prisoner to have appropriated them to his own use, can you say it was done in your house in York-street, or that it was not done in Ireland? - A. I cannot say whether it was done in Ireland; they were found in his possession after my return to York-street; I received information from the prisoner himself, saying, that there were four handkerchiefs lost, and after he had had some conversation about some other servants, he charged them with taking them; with respect to the watch, I had delivered it to the housekeeper, for the use of the servants, when I took the house in York-street, there being no clock in the house, about two years ago.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Therefore, if it had been taken down, it was not by your own knowledge? - A. Certainly not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you enquire of the prisoner about it, in consequence of any thing being said? - A. Yes, I asked him for the watch after I came there; he said it was in Burton-street, at Mr. Dillon's watch-maker; I went and enquired, it was not there; I told the prisoner it was not at the watchmaker's; he said it must be there; I went the second and third time to the watch-maker's, but I could not find it there; I came back, and told him each time; he told me it was not worth my while to bother my head about it, it was not worth keeping in repair; he then said the late housekeeper had told him she had left it there, and he knew no more about it; I had not seen it in York-street, I had seen it in lodgings at Piccadilly, when Mr. Dillon lodged there, and on the day I went to Mr. Dillon's, Mr. Dillon went to Oxford-races; the prisoner had four or five Jews every day in his room.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you ever see these cambric handkerchiefs and flannel shirt, or the silk stockings in York-street? - A. Not till the box was broke open.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Dillon.) Had you ever seen them in York-street? - A. I certainly had seen them in York-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Since the prisoner came into your house do you reccollect ever having seen them? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see it in his own room; - A. Yes; he was at his chest of drawers, and I turned round and saw the watch in his hand, I said nothing about it at that time.</p>

               <p>Q. What did the box contain? - A. Wearing-apparel belonging to the prisoner; there was no property in the trunk belonging to Mr. Dillon, but what is mentioned in the indictment; and on the 26th I went to Dixley and took the prisoner into custody, at his Lordship's house; I told him I had a warrant for him from his master, charging him with stealing a number of things belonging to his master, and that, among other articles, he was charged with stealing a silver watch or time-piece; he said the time-piece he had in his trunk; I took the key from him immediately, and took him into custody; I unlocked it, and he put his hand down and pulled the watch out; the flannel shirt was in the trunk at Dixley; the stockings were in a sort of drawers in his room; they were locked up with some of his own things; he said he put them there to send them to wash, but being only three pair, he had not sent them; he always kept them to a greater quantity to send to the washerwoman's. - (The property produced and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Q.(To the prosecutor.) What is the value of the watch? - A. Twenty shillings; the flannel shirt, 2 s. 6 d. the cambric handkerchiefs, 1 s. each; I know they are mine, and I am certain I did not give them to him; and the card-racks, 6 d.

On the 7th of February, about a quarter before six o'clock in the evening, I was coming out of the parlour, and met the prisoner in the passage; he was coming from the yard with something under his arm. I went into the kitchen, and missed my great coat off the dresser. I then followed, and caught him fifty yards off, and said,</p>
               <p>"That is my coat" - he said, it was not, and offered me 1 s., I refused it; saying, I would have the coat - he then gave it to me, and struck me across the head with his stick (which broke into three pieces) and ran off. I called to a young man who secured him.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A boy came into the yard to me, and said I should have the coat for 3 s. When the prosecutor came up, and said it was his, I said</p>
               <p>"Take it then, here is 1 s. for you;" but he pulled at me, and I gave him a rap with my stick.</p>

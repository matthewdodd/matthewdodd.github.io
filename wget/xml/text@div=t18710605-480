I live at 40, Colonade, Russell Square, and am a coach<lb></lb>man—on Sunday morning, 7th May, a little, after 2 o'clock, when I left the yard, I met the prisoner at the corner of Kendall Street—he and his companions followed me to the comer of the Colonade—they surrounded me—he wanted to fight me—one or two of them punched me in the face—I ran away to my own street door—he ran after me, and challenged me again to fight—I consented—he held up his hand, saying "I have some<lb></lb>thing here for you"—I could not see what it was—he rushed at me, and stabbed me in the arm—I fell on my back—my brother came out, and I went to the hospital—I was bleeding very fast—I lost two or three quarts of blood at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brother of the last witnesses—I live at 40, Colonade—on this night, about 12.15, I heard someone about the street door—I went out and saw my brother John standing in the mews, and the prisoner, with about half-a-dozen companions—he was challenging my brother to fight, throwing up his arms, and trying to get away from his companions—he had both arms up—they were, I believe, holding him back—I heard him say "I have something for you!"—on a sudden he rushed from his companions, sprung upon John, and struck and fell right on him—when John got up he was bleeding.</p>

I am a surgeon, living at 26, Burton Crescent—I have known prosecutor some years—I saw him on the afternoon of 7th May—his arm was bandaged up—next morning I removed the bandage, and found a clean-cut wound of the fore-arm, 4 in. in length—it must have been done with a sharp instrument—the wound formed a kind of flap, as if a person were holding up his arm, defending his body from a stab—the knife produced would be likely to have caused the wound—I did not probe it—he was weak from loss of blood—there was no contusion about the wound, as if it had been caused any other way.</p>

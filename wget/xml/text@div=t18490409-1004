I went with Baker to Williams's house on that evening—when he tapped at the window I heard a noise inside as of some persons moving about—Williams opened the window and said, "Who it there?"—Baker said, "Is that you, Williams: is the horse come home?" Williams said, "No"—Baker said, "Come down, I want to speak to you"—he came down and opened the front door—he had either trowsers or drawers on—he appeared flurried—Baker said he was taken into custody for a robbery in the City-road—he said, "Robbery, I know of no robbery"—Baker said, "For a robbery in Regent-street, City-road; your horse and cart is at the station"—he said, "I lent my horse and cart to a short dark man, dressed in a cap and light jacket"—Baker said, "Do you know who he is?"—he said, No; I should be very glad to identify him if you take him"—he said after the man was gone he had his misgivings, and sent the boy after him—I saw this flannel jacket found—this cap was given to me the next morning by Williams's wife.</p>

               <p>Q. How could they get at the pigeons - A. They got over the wall; the holes by which the pigeons entered are close to the ground almost; it was entered; they opened the lath-door, and forced open the wooden-door to get into the place; I lost nine pigeons; I got seven again, they are here; I can swear to them any where. I went to two shops, where they deal in these sort of things. I found four at

            . I am a bird and a pigeon dealer, in Old-street. On the 28th of April in the morning Mr. Parr came and gave information. The prisoner came to me about a quarter before five in the evening; he brought three almond pigeons, he asked nine shillings for them; I was considering which way I should detain him; I told him I thought that was too much. I endeavoured to stop him; I asked him if they were his own; he said yes, victuals was so dear he could not keep them; he wished to sell them. I locked the door, and locked him in; he made his escape from me; I laid hold of his jacket, and the pocket came off. I delivered the pocket to Mr. Parr; here it is. I was sent for in the evening when he was taken in custody; and the piece that same off his jacket made his jacket complete. Mr. Parr claimed the three pigeons that were left with me.</p>

At the watchhouse; I asked how he got these pigeons that he sold to Mr. Ball; he denied having any pigeons in his possession. I asked him how his jacket came torn; he said by the wheel of a cart. I then sent to Mr. Parr to come to the watchhouse for this piece; I matched it to his jacket, and it formed a jacket.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. What is the value of these pigeons - A. I would not take ten pounds for them.</p>

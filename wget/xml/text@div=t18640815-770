I live at 28, Thomas-street, Bethnal-green—on 11th July, about half-past 5, I was in Brick-lane, and saw the prisoner <hi rend="italic">whacking</hi> his horse with the handle of an old whip—when I got to the Two Brewers public-house, I saw the horse knock the child down and run over it—Mrs. Myers picked it up—I should think he was going at the rate of eight or nine miles an hour—he was sitting on the copes of the cart, not inside it—it was loaded—the copes project over the shafts, over the horse's back—he was sitting on one side—I saw the child before it was ran over; it just stepped off the pavement into the road—the big one left it and ran back, and the other ran on and was knocked down—I heard Mrs. Myers scream out before it was run over, and so did I—I don't think the prisoner had strength to pull up—both the children appeared frightened—the prisoner pulled up about thirty or forty yards from the place.</p>

               <p>quick as possible—the rate the horse was going was about three or four miles an hour. The child ran all of a sudden underneath the cart. I heard the people scream, and I jumped off the cart and ran to the woman that had the child in her arms, and said I was very sorry for doing it. I have been driving a good many years, and it is the first accident I ever had. I hope you will forgive me this time, and I will be very careful for the future. My master can give me a character.</p>

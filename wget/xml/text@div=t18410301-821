                  </hi>. I live at Lambeth-hill, Doctors Commons, and am a commercial traveller. On the night of the 25th of February, about half-past eleven o'clock, I was at the corner of Cheapside—I went down on the left of St. Paul's Church-yard, running—as I got under the piazzas of St. Paul's School the prisoner rushed out, and caught hold of me round the waist—as I was running fast she turned me round two or three times be<lb></lb>fore I could rescue myself from her—I put my hand to the side of my pocket, and found my bag and money gone—I accused her of the robbery, she denied it—after speaking to her two or three minutes the police<lb></lb>man came up—I said, "Give me the money, and I will let you go"—I turned round, and saw my bag turned inside out, about two feet from her—when the policeman came up, I would not give her in charge, thinking I might find my money on her—I searched her for very nearly a quarter of an hour, but could not find where she had put the money—I had seen my money safe in the bag within ten minutes before she laid hold of me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I have the bag—the prose<lb></lb>cutor picked it up—I was by at the time—I came up while he was charg<lb></lb>ing the prisoner with taking the money—he had her cloak off, and was searching her about her breast, and when I was going to take her into custody, he said he wished to search her a little more, and offered her 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to give it up—I let him do so, but should have taken her in charge for all that—she denied having the money—she said he had been in company with some other girls—the bag was picked up about four or five feet from where they were—I searched on the ground with my lamp before I took her to the station, and after I came back again, where the bag lay, and could not find any money—she was searched at the station, and nothing was found on her.</p>

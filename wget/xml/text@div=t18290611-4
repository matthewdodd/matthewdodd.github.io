The prisoner, about seven or eight weeks ago, came to buy a cap; she said she was a washerwoman, and should be obliged to me to have her when I wanted one, and I could have a number of respectable references - one place which she mentioned she had been at eleven years; I went to this place, Reily's pork shop, Whitecross-street, and asked if Hankin washed for them - they said they did not know her, she had not referred me there, but mentioned that place which was the only one I remember; I afterwards went to her house and left word for her to come to my house - she came that afternoon; I believe it was the 20th of May - I agreed for her to wash for me; she was to come to me on Thursday morning, which she did, and washed in the kitchen which Mrs. Powell and I have between us - she staid till half-past ten o'clock at night, and on the Friday afternoon about three, I missed some lace, and on looking at the book, I found it was forty-five yards; I had put it into the lace box myself when I was clearing the shop-window at night - it was in my part of the shop: I had seen it during the Thursday, and recollect wrapping one piece of it up on the Thursday night about ten o'clock; it was then in the box - I took it out of the window, wrapped it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110007"></xptr>up, and put it into the lace-box; I missed only two pieces at first, but when I came to recollect, about an hour after, I missed another, which I had also seen on the Thursday evening, but do not recollect wrapping it up - it was about the middle of the window; on the Sunday I missed from a drawer in my bed-room, three stockings which I had seen on Friday on a line at the top part of the house - I went up stairs and missed seven black silk stockings which I saw myself in a box on Thursday, about three o'clock in the afternoon, when the prisoner was up stairs with me; I am not certain they were all there - I missed thirteen pairs of my sister's stockings; the prisoner had every thing to wash that was dirty; she said to me on the Thursday morning, "You are so badly off for drying here, if you will allow me, I will take your flannels home to-dry, as they will dry better;" I said "Very well," and she did take them house - I did not give her leave to take any thing else; she went home about half-past ten o'clock on Thursday night, and about ten or five minutes after she took the things she had washed into the shop, and put them behind the counter - she asked my leave to put them there, saying, she thought it would be the best place for them; I was then in the shop and the servant also - I saw nobody else there; I believe we all came out of the shop together - at that time the things were put into a tub behind the counter, and I wished the prisoner to put some cold water over them - I was not in the shop when she did it; I heard the water poured over them - that was after we all three came out of the shop; I was in Mrs. Powell's room - there was nobody else to do it but her; I had told her while she was washing to take the things to any part of the house she liked to dry them; I told her to take some on the leads - she went into different parts of the house; my bed-room was not locked - she came on Friday night to bring home the flannels she had dried; I found them quite correct, and told her we had lost some lace; she said "Ma'am, I hope you don't think it is me;" I said "Oh no, I am sure I don't," nor did I- she went away; McCray, an officer, came to the house on the Friday night, and searched my sister's bed-room and Mrs. Powell's room; the prisoner came next day to iron - I saw her about ten o'clock; she persuaded me to have every body I had in my house searched, which had been done on the Friday night; there were lodgers in the house at that time. On Sunday I went to Worship-street - McCray and Lock went with me to the prisoner's house; I got there nearly at dusk - she keeps two rooms; she said they were hers, and in the first box we came to, in the back room, I found three or four pairs of stockings and two or three night caps, and in another, an old pair of white stockings, near the bed foot, on the floor, and in or near a box, an old black silk handkerchief, in the drawers in the front room, with a man's night cap, the lace is worth about 5l. at the wholesale price; it belongs to my husband - I found a card in my bed-room cut to pieces.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. What is the value of the property found? A. Not much; the stockings cost me 2s. 6d. a pair - she offered to be searched herself when the lace was missed, and said I was too easy by half, she never saw such an easy woman - she said the stockings were not mine; the shop was shut when I put the lace away - she was going home at all hours on Saturday, but was there till twelve o'clock at night; she said she wondered at our coming on Sunday to search, and taking her by surprise - and when the stockings were found, she said she meant to bring them home on Monday when she came for a blanket, but I never intended to give her one to wash - I should not have prosecuted her for the stockings, but my girls were afraid they should be suspected, and I was persuaded.</p>

            . I am a constable. On Sunday evening, the 24th of May, I went with McCray and Mrs. Allen to search the prisoner's lodging - she was at home; I told her Mrs. Allen suspected she had robber her, and I came to search her place - she said, "You may search my place, and welcome, I have got nothing belonging to Mrs. Allen;" we went into the back room, and the first thing found was a pair of stockings between two bedsteads - I showed them to Mrs. Allen, who said they were hers, and in one of the boxes I found two pairs of almost new stockings and a woman's night cap; the prisoner was present - I then went into the front room, and searched the drawers; I took out a cap, and Mrs. Allen said it was hers - the prisoner directly said it was given to her by the servant of the house, and if I looked further I should find a man's night-cap; she then said, "I brought the things home to wash, and meant to bring them back again" - I asked Mrs. Allen if she gave her leave to take those stockings and things home - she said No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you a judge of the value? A. I would not give 1d. for the night-cap - the things altogether are not worth more than 2s.; I cannot find the lace or the silk stockings.</p>

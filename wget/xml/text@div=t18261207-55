            . I live at No. 16, China-row, Lambeth, and am a dustman and sweep. I saw the prisoner in Smithfield riding this horse up and down for sale on the 4th of August; it was lame in front naturally, and had a shoe off behind; he asked me 3l. 10s. for it; I offered 50s.; and after a few minutes he agreed to let me have it; I am certain of his person; there was a boy and a young woman with him; I cannot be mistaken in him; I bought it between half-past three and five o'clock; a friend gave me a cart-horse for it, and he sold it to Mathey, a hackney-coachman - I saw the gelding when Huggett claimed it - it was the same as I bought of the prisoner - I saw it come out of the stable at Hampstead.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Will you swear I sold you the horse; for I have not been to Smithfield for fifteen years? A. I swear to him; he took the money for it, and I had it booked.</p>

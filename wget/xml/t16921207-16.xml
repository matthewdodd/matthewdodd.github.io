The Chyrurgion, who dissectect her, gave his Opinion, and said, That the Liver was discoloured, and the Stomach expoliated, and very black in four or five places; which discolouration must be effected by some Corrosive Matter thrown into the Stomach, and must proceed from Poyson. Other Witnesses declared, That the Prisoner was reported to have had more affection for another Woman, than he had for the Deceased Katharine, but that was not made appear. The Prisoner said his Wife was a very ill woman, and had an Evil Tongue, and sought his Ruine, and would not live with him, therefore she had out of spight brought this upon him; to prove which, he called some Witnesses, who confirmed what he said, and that she was a very debauched woman, given much to drinking, and had been troubled with the Foul Disease, and was oftentimes sickly; there was no one that see the Poyson put into the Ale; so upon the whole the Gentlemen of the Jury <rs id="t16921207-16-verdict77" type="verdictDescription">

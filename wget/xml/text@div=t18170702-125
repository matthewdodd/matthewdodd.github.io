On the 4th of June the prisoner, Trassam, came to my shop, and ordered a pelisse, which was to come to about 5l., she ordered it to be sent to 51, Old Nichols-street, Bethnalgreen, where, she said, she kept a chandler's shop. I asked her for a deposit - She said she had no money with her. The next day she left 10s. 6d. as a deposit. She came and tried it on, and desired it might be sent home any time on Saturday evening, and some lace with it for children's caps, as she wanted to consult her husband about them. On Saturday night, about six o'clock, I sent Mary Walker, and my boy, home with it, and the lace. She came back, saying, we were to take it again in an hour or less. The prisoner, Fitzgerald, came and said, we were to send them home directly, as her mistress was now disengaged. I sent

             crying in the shop. I went into the house, and saw there was a side-door in a passage-they must have made their escape through it - I saw no more of them. On the Tuesday following, I went round to the pawnbroker's and found the pelisse at Mr. Harris's, in the Minories; about a quarter after nine o'clock the same evening, I met the prisoner, Trassam, in the Minories, in company with a man named Burke, I secured her and he rescued her. The next morning, Mr. Harris sent for me, I went and found the prisoner, Fitzgerald, who had come to redeem the pelisse. I received the lace from the prisoner's mother.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. I did not go up stairs; the prisoners might have been in the house. Fitzgerald said she was Trassam's servant, and then her cousin.</p>

            . I am shopwoman to Mr. Garford. I took the pelisse home, both the prisoners were standing in the shop - They shut the door and said they would try the pelisse on. Trassam said her stays were dirty, and she would change her dress and try it on up stairs. I said, if she would allow me, I would try it on as I should see if it wanted any alteration; she said she could try it on up stairs and come down in it, and would not detain me a minute. I had six cards of lace with me, she said she would take them up and shew them to her husband. I took them out of her hand and said, I would shew them there, as we never suffered our laces to go out of our sight. She picked out four pieces, saying she would take them to her husband, as he was engaged up stairs with a gentleman. I said I could not allow that - She immediately went up with them; Fitzgerald said she would not keep me many minutes; I said that I was in a hurry. She opened the door, and went out into the street, saying she was going to fetch her child. I saw no more of them, but am certain they are the women.</p>

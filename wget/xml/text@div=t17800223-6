               <p>What time was the alarm given? - About seven o'clock, between seven and eight.</p>
               <p>Had you seen the trunk? - I had not seen it then. I ran down Wood-street to London-wall, and crossing over to Little Basinghall-street, I saw the prisoner with a trunk; I took him by the collar and asked him where he was going with that trunk? He said he was going to carry it for a gentleman. I said he had carried it far enough, and bid him put it down; he put it down and wanted to get away. There was a man on the opposite side of the street, whom he called Jones, who crossed the way with a stick in his hand; I called for assistance, and that man ran away when he saw some people coming up. I brought the prisoner and the trunk back to the Castle-Inn.</p>

             Esq. sworn.</p>
               <p>There is only the watch in court.</p>
               <p>Worrell. I never saw the watch before.</p>
               <p>Did you see the trunk opened? - No; the constable did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Taylor. On Tuesday evening the 1st of February I came to the Castle-Inn; a few minutes after I got out of the coach, the trunk was missed. A book-keeper and some of the attendants at the inn went after it; the prisoner was brought back to the inn, with the trunk. I can only speak to the property.</p>
               <p>How long was it after the trunk was missing that Worrell brought back the prisoner with it? - I suppose about five minutes.</p>
               <p>Did you open the trunk? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is there nothing in court but the watch? - No, I have on the breeches and stocking; they were in the trunk.</p>
               <p>Was the watch in the trunk? - It was.</p>
               <p>Did you put up the trunk and put the watch in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that is the watch? - Yes; I have the inventory of the things which were in the trunk; the trunk had not been opened when it was brought back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Do you know the number of the watch?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I think, to the best of my remembrance, it is 623. made by Easton, of London. There are two seals to it, one seal has a cypher. I am sure the watch and seal are mine.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner before the trunk was missing? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you see any body of the name of Jones? - No.</p>

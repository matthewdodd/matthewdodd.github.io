             thus depos'd. Between five and six in the Morning, as I was standing at Mr. Scarlet's Door in Picadilly, about 40 Yards from the Prisoner's House; The Deceas'd (who was a <rs id="t17261012-17-viclabel75" type="occupation">Gardener's Boy</rs>

As he was passing the Prisoner's Door, a Dog came out from thence and ran at him. He whipt him, upon which the Prisoner came with a Candlestick in his Hand with a Candle in it about as long as my Finger. He collared the Boy, and struck him under the left Ear, with the Nosle end of the Candlestick. The Boy presently reel'd and fell down backwards on his Head. The Prisoner took him up and went for a Surgeon.</p>

             thus depos'd. The Boy went along smacking his Whip, and whistling and singing like a Nightingale, the Dog ran at him, and he whipt him. The Prisoner came out, and said, Sirrah, what do ye whip the Dog for, and with that he struck the Boy (I think, but I am not positive) with the Foot of the Candlestick on the Right side of the Head. The Boy Stagger'd, fell down, and gasped. I bid him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172610120005"></xptr> fetch a Surgeon, and he went from me, and left the Boy to the care of a Chairman, I was within 4 or 5 yards when the Blow was given.</p>

Mr. Jewit called for a point of Purl, and sat down on the Beach. - When I brought it up, the Prisoner said to me, Did ye ever see such a sad Accident? How came it? says 1. Why, says he, I struck him only with my Hand. Then he had me look on the Deceas'd's Head, and see if any hurt was done to him, but I could see no Mark at all.</p>

On Sunday, the 5th of June, exactly at a quarter to two o'clock, we went out; I locked the two bed-room doors - the back door was bolted; I double locked the outside door myself, and put the key into my pocket; I returned about nine o'clock, alone - I found a crowd about the door, and the house broken open; I went in at the door, and found a private watchman inside - I found a great deal of property taken away from different rooms, and the drawers all pulled about; I lost about 30l. worth of goods, and have got none of them back - I never saw the prisoner till the day of the robbery; I saw him standing about my door about half an hour before I went out, talking to another man - I am certain he is one of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q.How long was the prisoner standing there? A. I saw him there about half an hour before I went out - I said two men were standing there, and I did not like the looks of them; they stood there talking and picking their finger nails - I was in this Court some years ago, but cannot tell when, for I am no scholar; I cannot tell how many years ago it is; I was tried and sent to the hulks at Sheerness for six years - I was discharged on the 4th of April in some year.</p>

I live oppo<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300036"></xptr>site the prosecutor's house - I saw him and his wife leave the house; I cannot say whether he locked the door - it was shut, and about four o'clock I saw one man come out of the house with a large bundle, and a moment after the prisoner came out with a large blue bag - he could hardly get it under his arm, it was so very heavy; they pulled the door too, and went off together - I had nobody at home; I went over to the house, found every thing in confusion, and the contents of the drawers strewed about; I got somebody to mind my shop, and went in pursuit of them - they were not out of my sight at that time; I swear positively to the prisoner - they saw me looking at them, and the prisoner looked me full in the face; I pursued him as quick as I could, and we caught him just down by Eastroad - they turned a corner short, and we lost them for about three minutes; then the prisoner came up the street again without any thing - I said, "That is the man that had the blue bag, I would swear to him among a hundred;" we had all got to the end of the street at the same time, and he was taken - we all said he was the same man; he had said, "What do you want with me?" he was all in a perspiration - the street is no thoroughfare, which made him come back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you ever seen him before? A. No; he went across by the brick-field - I might be one hundred yards from him when he had the bag under his arm; the prosecutor's door is about eighty yards from my shop - I saw his face plainly; I am fifty-six years old - it was day-light; he returned up the very street which the man with the blue bag had gone down, the very direction that the people were in pursuit; I do not suppose I was nearer to him than eighty yards -I swear positively to him; he looked at me.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Rogers, a jeweller. I was walking with my brother by this house about four o'clock in the afternoon, and saw the prisoner, in company with another man, running up the Shepherdesswalk - the prisoner was carrying a blue bag, and the other had a bundle in a handkerchief; I walked between them some steps - it was raining; the prisoner said, "I can't put up the umbrella, I can't go so fast;" they were just upon the run - the other said to him, "Never mind, run on, we have not far to go;" I turned round, and saw Taylor the officer running - I ran also, and saw the prisoner taken into custody, but he had no property then; I am quite certain of his person.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.There was no pursuit after him when you first saw him? A. Yes; I, my brother, and the officer followed him, but it was on account of suspicion from what I heard them say - there was no hue and cry after them then; he just turned down the street, he returned in about three minutes without any thing, and was taken - he was walking back, and the persons who had pursued him were waiting at the top of the street, to see if they could learn what house he had gone into with the property.</p>

            . I am a headborough. On the Sunday in question I saw the prisoner about noon, alone - I saw him again about half-past four o'clock, in Edward-street, in company with a respectably dressed man; the prisoner had a blue bag on his back - the other man had a bundle under his arm: I thought it was not altogether right - he got to the corner, turned round, looked back, and then ran; I followed, and lost sight of him, saw him again, and lost sight of him again - I ran to the end of New Hoxton, and saw them between Allerton-street and Union-street, and when I got there I saw nobody; I turned round in five minutes, and saw the prisoner in Hoxton New-town - I went up; Richards said, "That is the man who robbed the house - I will swear to him;" he was wiping his face, and was in a perspiration.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was there no means of his getting out of that street without coming back? A. He must go through houses if he did - there are gardens at the end of the street, but they are always locked; people belonging to them have private keys.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. At the first examination he said he saw me two hundred yards from him, and at the next examination he said it was four hundred. Witness. I always said it was two hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. About a quarter-past five o'clock on the Sunday in question, I left home for the purpose of getting my wife some medicine, she being extremely ill, and near her confinement - I was passing the corner of the street, and observed a number of people collected, and on getting towards them I heard Richards say, "Come back, for they have not gone this way;" on my getting near to Richards, Taylor turned round, and said, "I think you are the person who committed the robbery, and I must take you;" I went to the station without hesitation. I respectfully submit to you, is it likely if I had been the person that I should have gone down the street, get out of sight, and then come back into the arms of the persons in active pursuit of me, which I must have known? and now, my Lord, if there is any discrepancy in the evidence, I trust you will give me the benefit of it.</p>
               <p>One witness gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

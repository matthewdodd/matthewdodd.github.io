             thus depos'd. On the 12th of September last between 8 and 9 in the Evening, I went cross the Way and asked my Neighbour if it was not Time to shut up Shop? I left the Prisoner (who was my <rs id="t17261207-37-deflabel138" type="occupation">Servant</rs>

The Prisoner went away directly. I had no Suspicion of the Prisoner's taking the Money till I saw the Key in the Draw where the Money was, and then I looked into the Draw and found that the Money laid in the Indictment was gone, I made Search after the Prisoner all that Night, but could not find her; then I advertiz'd her in the Publick News, and took her at Thatford in Suffolk, I had her before the Mayor, and she confessed the Fact.</p>

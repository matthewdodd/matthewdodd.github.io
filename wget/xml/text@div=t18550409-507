                  </hi>. I live at No. 24, Rose-street, Long Acre, and am a hawker of baskets. On Tuesday, 27th March, I was out selling my goods—I had something to drink in a public house in the Wandsworth-road, and about 4 or 5 o'clock that afternoon I came to the Jolly Gardeners, in Lam<lb></lb>beth-walk—I was the worse for liquor, but not so bad as not to know what I was doing—I did not see Blundell there when I first went in—I called for half a quartern of rum, and whilst having it, Blundell came and wanted to talk to me—he wanted to <hi rend="italic">toss</hi> me for a quartern of gin—I said I would sooner treat him—I called for a pot of 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. ale, and had a part of it myself—I do not know whether Blundell had any of it; he might have had some—I did not ask him—I wanted to get out of his company—I might have had 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. about me at the time, and some coppers—I took the money to pay for the ale out of a waistcoat that I had on, with double pockets—it was in the top pocket on the right hand side—I pulled my money out to pay for the ale, coppers and all together—Blundell might have seen that—when I had paid for the ale I put the money back again into the top pocket—after that Blundell wanted to spar with me—I did not—I told him I was an old man—he hustled me about, and knocked me down—he struck me, and knocked me down—I had not observed Collins there; there were more persons about—I was insensible from the blow; and when I</p>

               <p>came to my senses I found myself in the station house, and I only had one farthing, and no hat—next day I found myself very much hurt at the side; I got worse and worse, and went home and went to bed; and on the Friday following I went to King's College Hospital—they told me there that one of my ribs was fractured—I have been attended ever since, and I am still suffering—I am bound up now, and am afraid to talk loud—I did not strike Blundell, or make his mouth bleed before he struck me—I did not spar at him to show what I could do when I was a young man—I did not reel against him and fall down—the account I have given is a true one.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoe maker, and live at No. 76, Princes-road, Lambeth. On Tuesday, 27th March, I was at the Jolly Gardeners—I saw the prosecutor go in there with his old lady, and he left his goods at our shop, which is about forty yards from the Jolly Gardeners—I afterwards went in, and found him there, and Blundell—Blundell wanted to toss him for a quartern of gin—he said he did not want to toss him, or to have anything to do with him—Smith had had a drop to drink, but knew what he was about—he told Blundell that sooner than toss for a quartern of gin he would pay for a pot of ale—he ordered a pot, and took out his money to pay for it—he took it from his right hand waistcoat pocket—I saw him pay 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. at the bar, and place what was left back again in his waistcoat pocket—Blundell saw that—I then saw Blundell hit the old woman a smack in the face, and after that he said to Smith, "We will have a tustle"—he <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the old man (Smith) down on his back, and at the same time slipped his left hand into the old man's right hand waistcoat pocket, and took out some money—he handed it over Smith's face with his left hand, to Collins; at the same time he picked up Smith's hat, and gave it to Collins—Collins put the cap he had on his head into the hat, and put the hat on—he remained in the house about three minutes afterwards, and then walked away—I walked behind him—the way in which Blundell knocked Smith down was by laying hold of him and <hi rend="italic">chucking</hi> him down, and he fell a top of him, and while he was down I saw him kick him no less than twice or three times in the ribs—that knocked Smith <hi rend="italic">like silly</hi>, he did not know what he was doing—I followed Collins up two streets, and part of another, to find a policeman, but I could not see one—I then returned back to the Jolly Gardeners, and met two policemen—Blundell was then gone—the policemen went after him, and afterwards brought him back to the Jolly Gardeners—he was quite sober—Collins was tipsy, but knew what he was about, in my opinion—I should have known what I was about if I had been like him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 1, Hunt-street, Vauxhall.

                  </hi>. I am barman at the Jolly Gardener's. On 27th March, the prisoners were at our house together for two or three hours—between 5 and 6 o'clock in the afternoon, I was cleaning the windows out<lb></lb>side; the windows are all round the house—it is a square house, and there</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185504090135"></xptr>
               <p>are windows all the way round—there is no tap room or parlour—it is all front to the bar—it is a gin palace; all bar—whilst I was cleaning the windows, I heard a disturbance, which caused me to get down the steps; it was a hustling, and a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>, and a woman was hallooing out, "Shall we fetch a policeman?"—I had not observed Smith there at that time—on hearing the noise, I looked through the window, and saw Smith on the floor, and Blundell on the top of him—I got down the ladder, and went into the house—Blundell had then got up—Smith was lying on the ground, seem<lb></lb>ingly insensible—I lifted him up; I was obliged to carry him—I took him to the other end of the shop, and sat him down, and then went back to get the mob out of the shop—I could not exactly tell whether his eye was cut at that time—I saw Collins by the side of Blundell when I came down off the ladder into the shop, and I heard Collins say to Blundell, "Let him have his hat"—Blundell immediately said, "I will see the b—d—first"—I then saw Collins put his cap in the hat, and walk out of the house—I did not exactly see how he got the hat—Blundell remained in the house for a short time, until he heard there was a policeman sent for—I went out to look for one, but could not see one—I endeavoured to keep in the house, to get the mob out—I heard the woman say that Blundell had robbed Smith, and she would fetch a policeman, and she went out once, twice, or thrice to get one—I have not seen that woman since—Blundell threatened to give her a crack, and he followed her out into the street to give her one, calling her all the b—b—he could lay his tongue to—a policeman afterwards came; Blundell was then gone—I did not see Blundell strike the Woman; he was quite sober—I believe Collins was quite sober enough to know what he was about.</p>

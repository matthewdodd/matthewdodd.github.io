                  </hi>. I am a porter, and live at 198, Gray's Inn Road—on Sunday morning, 7th December, about 12.30, I was in Holborn, going home—I wanted a pie for my supper, and was standing by a pie-shop, near Weston's Music Hall—I had a watch in my pocket at that time—I saw Blore standing by the door of the pie-shop—I did not go in—Gibson came up and asked me if I had got a light—I said I had not—he put his fist in</p>

               <p>my face—I put my head back to save the blow, and some one caught me by the throat and put an arm round my neck—Gagan and a man who is not here came up—my watch and chain were stolen from me by Gibson—he put his hand down to his right side, between the man and Gagan—directly the watch was taken Gagan closed her arms round Gibson and said "Come away, George, come away," and turning to me, she said "You shan't fight with my husband"—I seized hold of Gibson and he threw me down—I called "Police!" when Blore turned round and struck me at the side of the face—the constable ran up—I had hold of Gibson—I had got up from the ground then—I still held him—I gave him into custody—he began black<lb></lb>guarding me, saying that I was swearing falsely, and he had not taken the watch, and I was told to go down to the station by the constable—I went—I had been there about a minute when Gibson was brought into the yard, Blore followed, and began blackguarding me in the passage—two policemen came out and I gave him into custody—he said that I was swearing false against Gibson—I had seen Gagan once before, and I have no doubt that she was there—I saw her ten days afterwards at the top of Drury Lane—I walked up alongside of her to be sure she was the woman—I looked her full in the face, and went away again—I followed her into Holborn, and the first policeman I came to I gave her into custody—he asked me what I charged her with, I said for being concerned in highway robbery in Holborn, with Thomas Gibson and Blore—she said "Oh, you have only got spite against me," and she turned round to somebody alongside of me, and she said "You know I was along with you up to 12 o'clock on last Saturday night"—I don't know her sister at all.</p>

It was a silver watch—T am not at work at the present time—I was at work at 16, Russell Court for ten or twelve months—I had never seen Gibson and Blore before—I mean to swear that—I was not at work that day—I had been up to my mother's place, and I had been to Weston's Music Hall in the evening—I was there from about 8.30 until 12 o'clock—I did not have a disturbance there or anywhere else—I have never been in trouble, only for being tipsy once—I have never been convicted, I have always had the penalty of a fine put upon me, which I have paid—I did not know that was a conviction—I had been at Weston's three and a half hours, and had been taking moderate drink—I had about four glasses of ale, no spirits—this affair took place in front of a pie-shop—there were not a great many came out of Weston's at the time, they were all gone—I had been talking to some friends for half an hour after 12 o'clock, outside Weston's—there had not been a quarrel between me and any<lb></lb>one as the crowd was coming out—the pie-shop is two or three minutes' walk from Weston's—there is a narrow passage there—I did not strike Gibson—when he asked me for a light I told him I had not got one, I did not say anything else—my coat was buttoned when I came out of Weston's—I had undone it as I walked up to the pie-shop window—anybody could see that I had a chain—I last saw my watch about 12.20, when I looked at the time last—I swore at the Police Court that I saw Gibson take it—I mean to swear now that he tore it from me—he was the only man there who could take it; the chain was in his hand, and the watch was attached to it, and I took the chain out of his hand—the chain was in his hand, and the watch must have been there—I did not see who he gave it to, it was passed between the man and the woman—I said at the Police Court that he gave it either to the man or the woman—the chain was torn from me, and I</p>

               <p>got it back from Gibson—there were a dozen or two dozen people there, per haps—there was not a very terrible struggle going on—Blore struck me after the robbery—he turned round and said "Leave go"—he said nothing about his friend—Gibson was given into custody outside the pie-shop—I did not see the woman then—I did not see Blore on the way to the station—I did not see him until I got inside the police-station.</p>

I said before the Magistrate that Gagan used the word "husband"—she threw her shawl on Gibson and said "Don't fight, come away," and turning to me "You shan't fight with my husband"—I don't think she was there when the police came up—she must have gone away, because I did not see her—I did not see her go—there were not a great many people passing and re-passing; there were a few—I had no ill-feeling at all against Gagan—I had left my friends about ten minutes before the <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—I was coming along Holborn, and thought I would turn into the pie-shop.</p>

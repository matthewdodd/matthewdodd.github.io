                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>). I keep the house, No. 8, Arundel Court, Haymarket. I knew the deceased, Heloise Taubin; she lodged in that house for four months before her death—I think she got her living by walking the streets and bringing gentlemen home; she was a gay woman—I believe she was thirty-two years of age—she occupied the third floor front room—on the night of 23d Feb., I was in Charles Street, Haymarket, about 10 o'clock—the deceased was also out in the street at that time, walking about—about 10 o'clock I saw the prisoner in Charles Street; he spoke to me—we were in conversation for some minutes together—I had a watch and some jewellery on that night; a chain and several rings—he came up to me and asked me if I was a French woman—I said, "No"—I then spoke to him in German; he did not answer—I afterwards showed him where I lived—Ishowed him the house with my finger; he walked up and down the Haymarket with me; that was at the same time—about half past 10 o'clock I was in Arundel Court; I had just returned home, and he was standing there talking to two women at the door of my house—they were the deceased and Madame Virginie Sylvestre—I did not see whether he left the court at that time, as I went into my room—about 11 o'clock the prisoner came to the house—I was then in the parlour with an old lady—the prisoner came and rang the bell—the servant opened the door, and he asked for Madame—heopened the door of my room, and said he had come to sleep with me—I told him that I would not allow him to sleep with me, because it was too little money, and I expected a friend—he had said in the Haymarket that he would give me 10 francs—I told him it was too early, and he said he would come later—I told him in the house that I would not go to bed at so early an hour for so little money; I said, "You think perhaps I am foolish or stupid to go to bed so early for so little money"—when he saw that I would not let him sleep with me, he was very sorry and very cross about it—I then went into my back parlour and put on my bonnet, and the prisoner remained at the door of the parlour; the two rooms are adjoining—the prisoner spoke to my servant, Ann Brown, in French—she does not understand French well, and she called me—he told her to go and fetch the little woman of the two with whom he had spoken at the door; she went—the prisoner remained in the house while she was gone—in four or five minutes she brought the deceased back to the house, and I saw her go up stairs with the prisoner; that was just 11 o'clock—I never saw her again alive—I went out after 11 o'clock—I saw the deceased in the streets that night, with a watch, a chain, and a ring on her—I did not see her body after she was dead.</p>

               <p>where they buy their dresses; they were their own—they are lodgers—a Monsieur Mouton lodged in the house, no other man; he sells jewellery; he is a merchant—he came to see Virginie, but I think he had a room somewhere else; I am not certain about that—I believe he slept in the house sometimes—I do not know that he slept there always, as I did not trouble myself with my lodgers at all, or their business—the ladies paid me for their lodging by the week—they were not in debt to me at this time, not any of them—I do not know whether Mouton was in the house at 11 o'clock, when I was there—I do not know whether Mrs. Disher was in the house—she is married, and Mr. Disher lives in the house, and works out of the house, as a tailor—I did not know of any disturbance between Mr. and Mrs. Disher that night—Juliette had been ill three weeks; she had a pain in her side; she was attended by a surgeon, after the death of the deceased, not before—she had not been altogether confined to her bed for the three weeks; she came down sometimes to see her friend, Virginie Sylvestre, and the deceased was also her friend—Juliette lived in the back garret; the deceased in the front garret; Sylvestre in the second floor front; and Disher in the second floor back—the two rooms on the first floor were occu<lb></lb>pied by a Belgian woman, I do not know her name; I think it was Anna, but I am not certain; she did not occupy that room a long time—I am the land<lb></lb>lady of the house, but my servant generally let the rooms—the Belgian woman was a gay woman, she had no man living with her—she had a lover, but he came to the house only—I think he was a Frenchman; he came from Lyons, or somewhere thereabout—I had seen him there the same night that I saw the prisoner—I did not see him on that night, it was the next night, when she was dead—I recollect now that it was on the night following, because I was very sad about this accident, and he spoke to me to console me about it—I did not see him on both nights—I do not know whether Anna, the Belgian woman was in the house that night—I did not mention her name when you asked me about the gay women who were living in the house, because I did not recollect it at the time, as she only lived a very short time there—I did not see the Frenchman in the day at all, I saw him the night after the misfortune; he came then into my parlour, and spoke to me to console me—I had never seen that Frenchman talk to Heloise; I never saw him speak to her—I saw the Belgian woman about 4 or 5 o'clock in the afternoon, when she came into my parlour—that was the day after this—I occupied all the ground floor—my bed room is at the back—no one slept with me that night; no one came in at any part of the night—I told the prisoner I ex<lb></lb>pected a friend; I did expect him, but he did not come—I had no other rooms than those below, only the kitchen—I had Ann Brown as a servant, and another one, a little woman who has since left; I think her name also was Ann, but she had another name besides—she was in my service at the time the prisoner came to the house; she slept in the kitchen, and Brown slept out of the house—Brown left sometimes at 1 o'clock, and sometimes at 2 o'clock in the morning—she usually came at 10 or 11 o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing—theother girl was about twenty years of age—she went to bed about 1 o'clock that morning—she got up about 7 or 8 o'clock in the morning to to wash the stairs and the passage; that was generally the case, but that morning I was asleep when she got up, and I cannot say the precise time—shewashed the passage every day—it was her business, as servant, to do it every morning—on the evening when I saw the prisoner, I had not rings on both my hands, only on one hand—I wore four on that night; they were the same as I have on now—they are all diamond rings—theywere on two fingers of the same hand—the ring that Heloise had on was a ring with a red stone, a stone such as gentlemen wear in their pins, a garnet—I had the same watch and chain on that I have now—I did not wear the watch suspended at my waist, but in my pocket—when I showed the prisoner my house with my finger, I was about as far from it as across this court—when I say he was very cross about my not consenting to sleep with him, he did not say anything, but he looked downwards, with his eyes down.</p>

In Feb. last I lived No. 8, Arundel Court, Haymarket; I occupied the second floor back room—my husband lived with me—I remember the Wednesday, when the death of this young woman was discovered—on the night before that, I had a quarrel with my husband; in consequence of that I went and sat on the stairs—I went out of my room about 1 o'clock—I went down into the kitchen then—I came up again about half past 2 o'clock, and sat against the door of my own room—Icontinued to sit there till 7 o'clock the next morning—about that time, or a little before 7 o'clock, I heard three groans proceeding from the top of the house—that was about 7 o'clock, it might be a few minutes before—about half an hour afterwards a gentleman came down the stairs—the prisoner is the person—he said nothing to me, he never spoke to me; he came behind me all the way down, and passed me at the foot of the stairs; he followed me all the way down, and passed me on the landing to get out at the house door—I saw him quit the house—there was nobody there to open or close the door, he opened it himself and closed it himself; nobody else came down at that time—he did not carry anything in his hand—I noticed that he was very stout across the shoulders, and thought he was a stout gentleman as he passed me—he presented a stouter appearance across the breast than he does now; he had on a brownish coat, it was a loose coat with loose sleeves—it was not at all like the one he has on now, it had no hood to it—it was a coat; it had a collar, no hood; it was a big loose coat, rather longish, and loose sleeves; it was a great coat, it hung loose about him—I had an oppor<lb></lb>tunity of seeing his coat when he went outside the door—it was quite light—Inext saw him at Marlborough Street—I saw his face, for he turned round and looked at me when he got outside the door.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of No. 8, Charles Street, St. James's Square. I was called in to the house in Arundel Court on the Wed<lb></lb>nesday evening, between 9 o'clock and half past—I went up to the front room on the third floor, and there found the dead body of a female, lying on the face the face supported by pillows on either side—I removed the coverings so as to see the whole body—it was on a bed—the face was downwards on two pillows, and the rest of the body was corresponding with it, quite flat down<lb></lb>wards, flat on the belly—I should think ten or twelve hours had elapsed since the death—there was slight warmth in the chest and belly—the fact of the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185804050092"></xptr>
               <p>body being covered with clothes would keep the warmth longer than if the body had been entirely exposed—I had the body turned over on the bed—beforethat was done I noticed the position of the arms, they were turned outwards, and the hands everted, that is, the fingers from the body, so that she would have the arms in this way behind her—I did not particularly notice any discolouration of the arms before the body was turned over, but afterwards I did; in front of the arms they were livid—the general appear<lb></lb>ance of the body was livid, and with red patches; the eyes prominent, and the blood extravasated underneath the membrane of the eye; the pupils dilated; the right eyelid had drooped and covered the eye; the feature swere swollen and much distorted; blood and mucus was running from the nose; the tongue swollen and protruding from the mouth, so much swollen that I could not have made any mistake about it at all—at the lower and front part of the windpipe there was a dark red livid spot, about the size of a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece; the skin around that spot was excoriated externally—it was such a mark as would have been caused by either the finger or thumb of a person—therewas no mark of a ligature round the throat—the finger nails were livid, dark coloured—on Saturday, the 27th, I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examina<lb></lb>tion of the body, assisted by another surgeon, a Mr. Power—the vital organs were quite healthy, we found no trace of disease in any part of the body—shewas apparently from thirty to thirty-three or thirty-four years of age, as Dear as I could judge—we examined externally the part of the windpipe where the livid spot appeared; there was the appearance of recent injury there—on removing the skin over the spot that I have described, it appeared much bruised; the muscles underneath were turgid, or filled with blood, charged with blood, and appeared bruised—I attribute her death to strangulation—a pressure on the spot of the windpipe which I have described, of the finger or thumb of a person, would cause death by strangulation—whether death would be speedy would depend upon the amount of force used—from our exami<lb></lb>nation of the windpipe we came to the conclusion that considerable force had been used—that is my opinion—it is difficult to say, but supposing a consi<lb></lb>derable amount of force had been used, I should say that death would have happened within half an hour, or perhaps more, or less, it would depend upon the amount of force used.</p>

               <p>the brain have some of them been gorged with blood—that does not always follow in strangulation, but I should certainly look for it—in this case death was not caused by what is popularly called apoplexy; it is not because the vessels of the brain are loaded, that it should be called apoplexy—the vessels being gorged is one of the symptoms of apoplexy—I examined carefully the vessels of the brain in this instance—the heart was healthy, but was not in its natural state with regard to the supply of blood; the right side was full of dark black blood; that is one of the symptoms of death by strangulation—shewas not a woman of full habit; there was nothing remarkable either one way or the other—she was muscular, and comparatively in good health—she appeared to have the ordinary power that women of her size generally have—sheappeared in perfect health; I saw nothing to make me think the contrary—she did not appear over strong, not beyond the usual strength of women of her build and size—she was a woman of ordinary strength—there were some livid spots on the arms which I call extravasation or ecchymosis—Iam not aware of any difference or distinction between cadaverous lividity and ecchymosis—I am not aware that in the books there are any such dis<lb></lb>tinctions drawn—I do not know of marks like those I have spoken of, livid spots, coming on after death, not the same as I have described; not when parties have died a natural death; there is a general lividity on most bodies after death, but not of the same description; it is not in patches, as it was in this case—there is frequently a general lividity in persons who have died from unnatural or other causes, but I am not aware that it comes in patches, in the manner that I have described—I will not say that the lividity of a dead body would not come on in patches in some instances, but it has not come under my observation—the blue spot on the windpipe was deeper and darker than the patches on the arms—the skin was excoriated outside that spot, not to any great extent, perhaps it might be the size of a shilling or larger, I did not take particular notice—it fitted the thumb very well, for I tried it—it looked as if the pressure had been directly on the windpipe, as if the pressure had been this way with the thumb point—I gave the appearances my most careful attention, and came to the conclusion that death was caused by strangulation, by pressure on the windpipe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the excoriation that you noticed such as might have been caused by the thumb only, supposing a person's thumb to have been used for the pressure? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very probably, I should think—that excoria<lb></lb>tion, as far as my observation went, was chiefly on one side; more on one side than the other—this was a mode of death not probable, and scarcely possible, to have been caused by the subject herself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What makes you say that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A person using pressure upon herself in that position would lose the power, and then relief would come; the hand would drop, and the air would come—it is the want of air in these cases that causes the death—the injury on the throut would not have caused death in any short time except from the want of air—if the air had not been excluded from the lungs, no doubt the party would not have died; I mean, from the amount of injury received upon the part; she would not have died from that—when I spoke of ten and fifteen minutes, I meant a continued pressure for those times—I do not think the mere blow would have done it; the amount of injury done would not cause death—if a blow of that kind had caused death, it would have been instantaneous; if it was a Mow of suffi<lb></lb>cient power to cause death, there is no doubt it would be instantaneous—therewas nothing that I could see in the deceased's body at all to cause death but the pressure on the windpipe.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the house surgeon to Charing Cross Hospital. On Saturday, 27th Feb., I assisted Mr. Tothill in making a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> exa<lb></lb>mination of the body of the deceased—I had seen the body before that day, in the dead house at the hospital; the general appearance of it, when I came to examine it, was livid and ecchymosed—the lividity was general; the patches of the ecchymosis were on the upper part of the trunk and arms; principally on the shoulders and arms—the face was congested with blood—there was a spot or mark which particularly attracted my attention, on the centre of the throat, just over the windpipe—I call it an ecchymosed mark—in size it cor<lb></lb>responded very nearly with the top of my thumb—there was no mark of a ligature round the throat—on opening the body, we found the organs gene<lb></lb>rally healthy—there was no trace of disease—when I saw the body first the tongue was protruding and very much swollen—that was on the Thursday I believe—there was blood extravasated underneath the conjunctiva of both eyes, that is the external membrane of both eyes, I mean, of the eyeball—the pupils of the eyes were dilated—the nails of the hands were livid; one was slightly broken, that was the top of the nail—I cannot say for certain which band that was, or which finger, I did not attribute so very much importance to it—on removing the skull, we found the brain considerably congested, sufficient to deserve the name of congested, it was decidedly congested—lexa<lb></lb>mined the muscles under the spot where I observed the external mark in the throat, and found them much bruised—the lungs were considerably congested—therewas no foreign body in the throat—the heart was healthy, the right side contained black blood—judging from these appearances, I attribute the death of the deceased to strangulation, produced by pressure on the windpipe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The right side of the heart contained black blood; what caused that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The right side of the heart not being able to propel the blood to the lungs, on account of the lungs being gorged with blood—that would depend upon the deficiency of air being there, the lungs being so gorged by the deficiency of the air that the heart was not able to propel any more blood to the lungs—it is the duty of the right side of the heart to send blood to the lunge.</p>

The prisoner showed us his berth; I saw this black bag there; it was looked, I unlocked it with a key which the prisoner gave me—he was there when I unlocked it—Imotioned to him that I wanted to see the contents of the bag, and he gave me the key—when I unlocked it, I saw the wooden box at the top of it; the brooch produced was inside the box, at the top, and also this earring (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prisoner was taken on shore by me and Huggett—I after<lb></lb>wards went back to the ship, and received from the captain's wife, who was on board, these two silver cord bracelets and this little purse—these articles of dress were given to me by the captain; a <hi rend="italic">moire antique</hi> jacket, and a black silk mantle—these were given to me on the Saturday, about twenty minutes past 11 o'clock in the morning—I had at that time left the prisoner on shore, in Huggett's care, at an inn by the road side—I did not show any of these things to the prisoner before I came up to London; he saw me find the box at the top of the carpet bag, and said, "<hi rend="italic">Me</hi> bought it"—there was a portmanteau in the berth the prisoner was taken in, it was locked; I opened it with a key which the prisoner gave me, and found a quantity of male wearing apparel, among which was this shirt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), with some marks on it which are quite visible now—they are the marks of blood and mucus, as far as I can say; the marks, apparently of blood, are on the left breast and arm—I showed it to Mr. Tothill, the surgeon.</p>

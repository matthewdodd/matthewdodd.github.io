               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bevil. Q. Do you mean to swear that that is what he dropped? - A. I caught him in the act of righting himself.</p>
               <p>GEORGE GREGG sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a sailor on board the Alert; I was standing across the quarter-deck and saw the prisoner come up and throw down this tortoiseshell under the pig-styes in a bag, I ran forward to North and asked him what it was; he said he could not tell; he opened it, and it contained tortoiseshell.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am the mate of the Alert; I was on board on the 6th of August; the Captain's name is James Macdonald; I saw the prisoner in custody, I asked him several times whether he had been at work on board the ship that day, and he for several times hesitated; I knew he had been at work as a lumper, but I was determined to get an answer from him; he at last said he had.</p>

               <p>ALEXANDER BROOKFIELD sworn. - I was on board the Alert; I know the prisoner to be perfectly innocent.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Take care what you are saying? - A. What I am saying is the truth; he had not an opportunity of going down; he was never off the capstern of the vessel.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Are you the gentleman that North saw with him in the boat? - A. No; I was upon deck, I was the foreman of this man.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to say when he was taken this is an innocent man? - A. I did not know what it was till he was in the boat.</p>
               <p>Q. You went before the Magistrate I take it?- A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure he could not take the tortoiseshell? - A. I think not.</p>
               <p>Q.(To North). Do you know that man? - A. This man I believe is the other man who was in the boat.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure he is the man? - A. I am certain of it; they were both standing in the boat ready to shove off.</p>

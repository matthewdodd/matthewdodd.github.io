I sell hosiery and wearing apparel, and rent the shop and parlour - the landlord does not live in the house. I sleep there, but my husband does not live with me; we have been separated four years; he is alive. On the 31st of December, between seven and eight o'clock, the prisoner came in and asked for a pair of stockings - I shewed him a pair, which came to 8 d.; he told me not to double them up, for he would go and tell his mother, and return in a few minutes - he came back<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182401140006"></xptr>and asked if I had a pair of men's stockings; I said, No: he went out, returned in about five minutes, and asked if I had a pair of shoes; I said, No. He went out, and kept walking backwards and forwards. I saw his face through the glass, and said,</p>
               <p>"What are you doing there?" he said,</p>
               <p>"Nothing, you will know me the next time you see me, shan't you, for you look at me very hard." I went into the parlour to supper, and in a few minutes heard jugs rattling - there were two in the window. I went and found a square of glass taken out, which was safe before, and nine pairs of stockings gone, and a pair of gloves. I went out, and met him in a quarter of an hour, in Old Tothill-street, coming from the baker's with a pie in his hand - I said,</p>
               <p>"Oh! you are the lad I am looking for."</p>
               <p>"Me," said he,</p>
               <p>"I have not got your stockings." I had not mentioned anything about stockings to him. He ran into a house in the Almonry with the pie. I followed, and fetched his mother, who searched him, but found nothing.</p>

            . I am thirteen years old, and live with my father, who keeps a coal shed opposite to Wales's. On the 30th of December, I was at the shed, about a quarter to seven o'clock, and saw the prisoner standing about Wales's window - there was a light in the window, and a gas-light in the street. I saw him do something to the window, and go away three or four times, and then saw him put something into his pocket; he went away, and stood by a dead wall for two or three minutes, then went to the window again, and as he came back, I saw him putting something more into his pocket; he put something into his jacket and trowsers' pockets, and could hardly get it in - he returned a third time, and put his arm half into the window - Wales came out, and he ran away. I told Wales what I had seen. I was about six yards off, and am certain of him.</p>

               <p>"You are the boy I want;" I asked what for? she said,</p>

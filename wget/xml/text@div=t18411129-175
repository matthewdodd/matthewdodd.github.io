                  </hi>. I am fifteen years old, and live with my father, in Eagle-street, Red Lion square—I am shopman to Mr. Mel<lb></lb>luish, a boot and shoe-maker, No. 28, Bell-yard, Temple-bar. On the 27th of November, I was coming out of my master's back-room into the shop, at a quarter to twelve o'clock, and saw the prisoner take a pair of boots up singly, and run away with them—they were just inside the shop—I called to my father and ran out after the prisoner—he ran up towards Carey-street—I called, "Stop thief "—as soon as I called "Stop thief," the second time, the prisoner dropped the boots, and ran towards Lin<lb></lb>coln's-inn—I did not see him taken—I am sure I kept sight of him till he dropped them—I have no doubt the prisoner is the person.</p>

I am 18 years old, and am apprenticed to Mr. Bar<lb></lb>ham, of the firm of Barham and Marriage, Grocers, of 14, Aldgate, and 70, High Street, Kensington—I was employed at the Aldgate shop, and on Saturday, 21st August, I was sent to Kensington to get the money from that shop—I got there about 9.30, and saw a parcel made up by the manager—it contained a cheque for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, another for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, and 97<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in cash—the silver was put in a bag, and the gold and notes were put into a bag again, wrapped up into one parcel, tied up, and given to me to take to 14, Aldgate—I put it in my left-hand trousers pocket, and went to High Street, Kensington, station—I had got a third-class return ticket—the</p>

               <p>prisoner was at the booking-office door, and tried to catch hold of my arm—as I was in a hurry I passed him, and said "I should think you are cracked," and ran down to catch the train—I looked back, and saw the prisoner having his ticket clipped—he came down to me on the platform, and said "Don't you know me?"—I said "No"—he said "I am Perry, of Aldgate; I thought you were too proud to speak to me"—I said "No, I did not know you"—I then recognised him, having seen him at my em<lb></lb>ployer's behind the counter—he asked me what ticket I had, and said "I am going first, will you go with me? I will pay the fare," and we both got into a first-class carriage—when the train started he looked over into the other compartment, laughed, and said that there were some girls there—we travelled on alone, and after we had passed one or two stations he asked me if I had ever heard about zoedone—I said that I thought I had seen the advertisement—he said "This is a sample, taste it; don't take more than half"—the bottle was full—it was like this (<hi rend="italic">a one-ounce bottle</hi>)—there was no label on it—I put it to my lips, and took about one-eighth of it, and it effervesced to my nose and nearly choked me; it also made me feel sleepy—he then put some on a handkerchief, put it to my nose, and asked me to smell it—I did so—he saw me making wry faces, and asked me if I would have some port wine to take the taste out of my mouth, but he did not produce any—I said "I would rather not"—after that the train stopped, and a lady came in—that was, I think, the station before King's Cross—the lady got out at King's Cross, and we two were alone again—after the train left King's Cross the prisoner looked out at the window for some time, and said there were some green and blue lights, and asked me to look at them—I said that I did not want to—that was in a tunnel—I fancied I saw him turn round, and I turned round too, and saw something go up in the air, and felt a hard blow on the top of my head—I rolled on the floor of the carriage, and was senseless for a moment—he continued to hit me on my head—I tried to get up; he knocked me down again with the stick—he had knocked my hat off with the first blow—I tried to trip him up and to kick him, but he got farther from me, and continued to hit me with the stick, and as the train was stopping he knelt on my chest and gagged me with his hand—I pushed his hand away and called "Murder—thieves," twice—he throttled me by putting his hand across my throat, so that I could hardly breathe—I was on the floor of the carriage when the train arrived at Farringdon Street—I kicked, but could not attract people's attention—when the train started he hit me with the Stick again, and then he put it down and said "Where is the money?"—I said "I shan't tell you"—he searched my coat-tail pockets, and at last found the parcel in my left-hand trousers pocket, and I said "Take it, take it," thinking he would leave me alone—he took it out and put it on the seat, and commenced hit<lb></lb>ting me over the head again—I put my hands up to protect my head, and then saw him open the carriage door nearest the platform—he caught hold of my legs and cried "Come on, come on," but I caught hold of the leg of the seat and said "Don't pull me out, you will kill me"—he said "Come on, come on," and pulled my legs towards the door, but did not succeed in pulling me out, as I put my arm round the leg of the seat—he gave it up as a bad attempt, and began hitting me about the head again, but I put my head under the seat, and he hit me about the shoulders—the rail between Farringdon Street and Aldersgate Station is, I believe, underground—I was</p>

               <p>see anything—I had the parcel in my hand at Kensington Station, and he wanted to know what was in it—I had told him that I came for the cash instead of Emmott—I am sure he did not say "Come on, give me the money" when he opened the door—he had the money before that, and he tried to pull me out of the carriage—he did not say "Come on" at the time he took the money—he said "Where is the money?"—it was in the tunnel that the door was opened, not just as you run into the station when the platform enlarges—it was some time before we got into the station that he opened the door—I am sure it was right in the middle of the tunnel.</p>

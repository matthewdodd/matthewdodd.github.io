            . I live in John-street, Oxford-street. The prisoner came into my service on Thursday, the 2d of January, I did not suspect her being pregnant. On the <rs id="t18230219-38-cd221" type="crimeDate">4th of February</rs>

When he came down he stated his apprehensions, and having seen some blood on the stairs leading to the yard, he asked for a candle - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182302190021"></xptr>went with him to the privy, and found an infant laying on its back, with the head and part of the neck in the soil; I sent for a person who came in half an hour, and took it up - it was put into a box unwashed. I could see no marks of violence on it in the state it was then in. The constable nailed the box down, and put it in the front vault of my house, and nailed up the door. This was late on Saturday evening - it remained there till Monday morning, when Howell took it away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. Watson took the child from the privy - A. Yes. Mr. Kerr was present - the soil only covered it as far as the chest.</p>

            . I am an apothecary. On the 4th of January, Mr. Ellis sent for me about eight o'clock in the evening. I first went to the privy, and on throwing down a piece of lighted paper, I saw the child laying on its back, and the head depressed on the soil. The chest and face were visible, but sunk a little in the soil; Mr. Ellis sent for Watson to take it up; I did not observe any thing about its neck - I went up stairs to the prisoner with Mrs. Ellis, who introduced me as a medical man, and left me with her; I asked if she wished for my assistance, she said No, that she had been poorly, but was better - this was all that passed.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had no reason to suppose from what passed, that she had been recently brought to bed - A. Not the least; the child appeared not to have come to maturity by a month or two - I am induced to think it was born alive by its general healthy appearance, but cannot say it was so. A feeling similar to an inclination to stool, is very common in pregnancy. I opened the body and found the lungs inflated, and from that I think it had breathed, but that is not conclusive - it might have imbibed sufficient air, even in parturition so as to have inflated the lungs.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot say it was born alive - A. Certainly not.</p>

            . I am a night-man. I went to the privy with a light, and saw the child laying on the surface of the soil on its back, with its head in the soil; one of my men got it up and put it into a box, it was quite naked; I observed nothing about its body.</p>

            . I summoned the Coroner's Inquest, and was sent for the body of the child on the 7th, to take it before the Inquest - I went to Mr. Ellis's vault; the servant unnailed the door in my presence, and gave me the box, I took it to St. Marylebone workhouse, and unnailed it, and left it for two hours with the nurses to be washed - I then called for it, and found it laying on a clean table, and a piece of a silk handkerchief laying by its side, which the nurse tied round the neck - I myself had not seen it on the neck before.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 19, Frederick Place, Orchard Street—on Thursday night, April 29th, about 11.15, I heard a cry of "Stop thief!"—just as they got to my door there was a very short, and rather stout man, and the police halloaed out, "Stop him, whatever you do!"—the policeman could have stopped him in another step, but he was overpowered by running—I followed them to the corner, and then the policeman lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's mother—on Thursday evening, 29th April, I was at home—my son was in the house, and William Gordon and my husband, and my two other children—it might have been 11, or a few minutes before, when Gordon left—I had to re-light a candle, and had to leave the room to do so—that is the reason I noticed the time so particu<lb></lb>larly—after he left I heard a noise in the street; my son loft the house and</p>

               <p>I followed, and when I got into Ball's Pond Road, which is not more than 100 yards, I run into the road and got on the high pavement, and a policeman was holding a young man with a bandage on his head, who was on his knees, and the policeman had his hands upon his shoulder—he said, "Loose me, loose me," but the policeman held him, and he left his coat and ran away, and struck me on the left breast, and I was taken home insensible—I did nothing to rescue him—before that I and my son had not left the house, we were taking supper together—I have lived in the house eleven years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What do you mean by being taken home insensible? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was taken home insensible by a strange female, in consequence of the blow I received, and my husband came and assisted—I did not take a coat home with me—I recollect nothing—I could hardly walk across the road—Gorden has known my family eleven years; he has been intimate with my son from childhood, and is a painter and glazier—he has been very much with my son of late, and has been coming in and out of our house as if it was his home—he had been employed, but my son was not, and they spent their evenings together—he may have come there five days a week for the last thirteen months—I cannot tell you Gordon's employer's name, but I know he has had work from him for the last three months and more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would there be truth in the statement, if it was made, that your son and Gordon have gone out four days a week to look for work together? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and oftener than that, but not since Gordon has been employed—they have been out together three or four mornings a week, but I have not calculated the time—it is about five weeks since the occurrence.</p>

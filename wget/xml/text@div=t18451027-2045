                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable N</hi> 211.) On the 23rd of Sept. I saw Sutton, Dunn, and Probert, in Frog-lane, Islington—there was another person with them, who is not in custody—they were each carrying some<lb></lb>thing heavy on their heads—I know Long—he keeps a marine-store dealer's shop in Frog-lane—I saw Dunn, Probert, and the one who is not in custody, go into Long's shop—I stopped Sutton in Greenman's-lane—he had these two pieces of iron on his head—I took him into Long's shop—I saw Dunn, Probert, and the other, in the shop—I asked Long what he had bought of those boys—he took from under his counter a broken piece of iron, and said, "I bought this of them"—I said, "There must have been more than that"—he said, "Yes"—the boys then made their escape out of the back door or the side door—I said to Long, "You had better go and try to get these boys back, it will look better for you"—he went out, and brought in Dunn—I then told Long he must go to the station-house, and assist me in taking the iron there—he did so—I asked if that was all—he said, "Yes;" but'at the station-house I told him I thought there was a great deal more—he said yes, there was more, he had bought a lot of them before—we went back again, and got six more pieces.</p>

                  </hi>. I work occasionally for Mr. William Catling and David Catling.

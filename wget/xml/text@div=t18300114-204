            . I am an officer. The prosecutor came to the office and got a search-warrant; I went to the prisoner's house on Saffron-hill - he is a marine-store dealer; he was sitting smoking his pipe in his back-parlour - while I was searching I turned and found he had decamped; we went out, and I traced by the snow that he had gone to the next yard - Duke staid there while I went into the next house, and found him in a cupboard; he made great resistance - I was surrounded by about six people, and had great difficulty in making a capture of him; I lost my hat and handkerchief for some time - here is the watch; I found it under the window in his back room under some old iron.</p>
               <p>ROBERT DUKE. I was with Waddington, and was holding the candle to him; I turned, and the prisoner was gone - what has been stated is correct; he denied knowing any thing about it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She said she would be a mother to my young man, and she would be glad to have such an one; she and I sat drinking gin and water at the fire that day as we had done at every meeting, and Foley came home unexpectedly.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, representing that he was in the habit of visiting the prosecutrix in her husband's absence: that on the day in question he was intoxicated, and she proposed to go and live with him, intimating that he could have the plate and watch; that she frequently put the watch into his hand, and on getting home, and becoming sober next morning, he found he had brought it away.</p>

               <p>THOMAS COPE. I am an officer. I have an examined certificate of the former conviction of the prisoner; I attended and know he is the man.</p>

When I came near a Lamp I made a Stand, and look'd him full in the Face; he had a Bar of a Window under his Arm, by which I took him to be some Carpenter's Prentice . I saw another Man behind him at a Distance. The Watchman was then beating the Hour at the Corner of the Square, so that I was out of Fear; but turning about, I had hardly gone 3 Steps when the Prisoner knock'd me down, and struck me 4 or 5 Blows afterwards. Then he put his Hand in my left Pocket, and took out fifteen pence half-penny, which I had there. With scuffling and struggling, I had the good Luck to save my Watch in my Fob. The Watch came to my Assistance (when the Prisoner was gone) and carry'd me to Mr. Sandford, a Surgeon, who dress'd my Head. In 3 or 4 Days I called upon Mr. Sandford again to pay him for his Trouble. He told me that he had heard the Watchman say that he saw one of the Fellows run from me, and knew who he was. I sent for the Watchman, and describ'd the Prisoner to him. The Watchman told me that that Man was the Captain of the Gang, that he had run away from his Master, and now went a thieving. I was sent for to Justice Philips's, when the Prisoner and another were brought before him; I directly said the Prisoner was the Man, but he would not confess any thing then.</p>

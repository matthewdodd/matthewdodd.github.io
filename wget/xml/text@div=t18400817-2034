                  </hi>. I am gate-keeper at St. Katherine's Docks. On the afternoon of the 4th of August I was at the back of the warehouse letter F, and saw the prisoner coming towards his cart, which was waiting there—I noticed that he appeared rather bulky under his left arm, inside his jacket—I went and asked what he had get—he said he had got nothing—I searched him and found this pound of indigo there—it is a sample pound—I asked him where he got it—he said one of the labourers had given it to him on the staircase—I took him back to the warehouse to point out the man—he said he could not.</p>

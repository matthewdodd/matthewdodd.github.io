                  </hi>. I am a brass-founder, and live in St. James's-walk, Clerkenwell. I have known the prisoner from three to four years—I have had transactions with him in business, and have been in the habit of selling him refuse metal out of my shop, and generally took copper from him in exchange—if my metal came to more than the copper, he gave me the difference in cash, and if his copper came to more than my metal, I gave him the difference in cash, at the scale, at the time the metal was sold—I never trusted him—I do not believe he ever asked me to do so, be<lb></lb>cause he knew I should not have done it—on the 29th of December, I had some ingot metal to dispose of, and I sent my man Day with a message the prisoner—I wanted copper at that time—the prisoner called on new said he would give me a certain price for it—6 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per lb. was the price agreed on, which was the ready money market price at that moment—he was to pay as he always paid—he did not say anything about paying for it—be had sent word by my servant—he afterwards came again, and brought his horse and cart, and man—the metal was then weighed and delivered to him—my servant and his I believe put it into the cart—I did not it</p>

               <p>driven away—I then went into my counting-house, and he followed me, as I thought, for the purpose of paying me—he said he wanted a bill of parcels of what it came to, as agreed—he made out the account, and gave it to me to receipt it—I have not got it with me—I have not looked for it, lately—he began to examine his pockets for the money, and then declared he had left his money at home, and if I would give him leave he would go home and fetch it, if I would let my servant go with him—I told him my servant should go, but on no condition to give the money to my servant, bat to bring it to roe positively—he said he would bring it, and I said I would give him the bill of parcels and receipt—he then went away with my servant—he came back again and said, "Oh, Lord, I have lost my pocket-book"—I was so confused at the moment, that I do not know when-there I said anything to him—I do not think I did—he went away—I saw him again next day—I sent my servant to him, and he came—he said he wished I would take 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that evening, and on the Tuesday following, on his honour, he would pay me the rest—I told him I would have no more to do with him—I insisted on having my metal back—he declared he could not let me have it back, for he had actually sold it to pay a bill of 49<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he produced a bill to me—he did not say to whom he had sold it—he said he had sold it before he had bought it—he then went away—I saw nothing more of him until I applied to have him taken in custody—I never in<lb></lb>tended to give him any credit for the metal.</p>

            . I am Riley's servant. I got up about six o'clock in the morning, and missed the bell - the door, leading from the shed to the yard, was wide open; the glass was taken out of a window near the shed door -I had fastened the door inside with an iron bolt, which was undone; the window is about five feet from the ground- a person could not get in at the window unless somebody helped him up; the glass was taken out sufficient to let a small person through - it was not broken, but taken out in one piece; I fastened the shed the night before - nobody went there after me; the door was bolted, and the window safe - it does not open; the bell was on the shed door, which is the street door, and which comes into the coal-shed - mistress saw me hang it there at eleven o'clock at night.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. About half-past seven o'clock in the morning in question, I examined Riley's premises, and found an opening where they said there had been a window; I afterwards saw the glass in the yard, partly broken - there had been six squares in lead; it appeared to have been taken out altogether - it had been nailed in with small brads; it fitted the hole - it would require very little force to get it out; it was about five feet five inches from the ground - I could not get in there without standing on something; neither of the prisoners could get in from the ground - this is a corner house, and all the houses there have yards to them; I apprehended the prisoners in about an hour, at their father's house; the back of his house is but a few yards from the back of the prosecutrix's premises; they could get over the fence of their father's yard, and I traced steps from there into three different yards - the fences are board, six feet high; there were footmarks on the dirt in each yard, of feet without shoes or stockings; I could see the marks of the toes and heels - I could not tell whether there had been one or more persons; the father let me in; he was not dressed - I spoke to him, then went into the next house, which was empty, and there found a bell; the back door was open, the front one shut, but not fast; I went up stairs in the father's house, and saw both the prisoners dressed, except their stockings and shoes; neither of them had slippers on at that time - the eldest put on slippers afterwards, and they found a pair for the other before he left.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say before the Magistrate that they had no stockings on, but the eldest had slippers on, (looking at his deponition.) A. They have taken me down to say so - neither of them had slippers on when I went up.</p>

            . I am an inspector of a Police division. The prisoners were brought to the station on Friday, the 3rd of December, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning; nothing was said to induce them to confess any thing -Joseph cried very much, and said to the other, "You know you knocked me up this morning at four o'clock, to go and steal these things." or words to that effect - the other said, "It was you got in at the window;" I asked John what could have induced him to commit the robbery; he said he did not know, and seemed quite careless about it -I asked if they had had any food that morning, they appeared in so wretched a state, I thought they were starving - John said he had had a little bit of bread; I asked how many brothers and sisters he had - he said, "There sisters and one other brother;" they were charged with stealing six aprons and a gown.</p>
               <p>MRS. RILEY. This is my bell - I know it by a mark on it; there is a piece broken off the iron spring, which was done to make it fit - I saw it last about eleven o'clock at night; I found the casement of the window in the yard, about one o'clock - I had seen the premises fastened that night.</p>

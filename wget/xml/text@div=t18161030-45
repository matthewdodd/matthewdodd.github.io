            . I am a pawnbroker. On the 19th<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181610300029"></xptr>of October, I received information about eight o'clock in the morning, that a gold watch had been stolen; and about two hours afterwards, the prisoner Henrickson offered a gold watch to me to pawn for three pounds. I asked her whose it was? and she said, her sister's. I secured her immediately, and took her towards the Thames Police office. Going down Old Gravel-lane, she turned up a court, expressing a wish to change her shoes before she went to the office. I kept the watch by me all the time. She went into a house, and I followed her. She went into a room on the ground floor, and I staid outside the door. Through the crevice between the door and the door post, I saw her take something from her pocket, and hide it under the bed clothes. She then came out, and said as she could not find the shoes, she must go as she was. When I got to the office, I informed the officers of what I had seen, and I accompanied them back, and shewed them the house.</p>

While they were searching the place below, I went up into the attick, and there I found the prisoner Ashton, concealed in a closet. I took him into custody, and round his neck I found this silk handkerchief, which is claimed by the prosecutor. I immediately asked him if he had sent the watch to pledge by a women? and he said, he had. I then took him to the office. Henrickson was there before us, and I asked Ashton whether that was the woman he had sent to pledge the watch? and he said, it was. I asked him where he got it? and he said, he found it on the Dock-hill, wrapt up in some paper. I afterwards apprehended the prisoner Dickson in the same room that I had apprehended Ashton in.</p>

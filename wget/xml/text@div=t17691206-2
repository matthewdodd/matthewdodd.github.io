He said he had made a guinea, he believed, and he had made a gown and frock. It was then dark. He said people saw him, and he had put them into a cart, and if I would go with him to pawn the gown, he would pay me for it. He took me round the fields near Islington-Road, into a barn where was a cart, into which he had put them. I took and pawned the gown to Mrs. Geary. We told

They said they broke open a house, and had got some, and if I would go, I should have some as far as it went. I was going with them, when one of them picked a gentleman's pocket, and he laid hold of me; upon which I confessed to him this fact.</p>

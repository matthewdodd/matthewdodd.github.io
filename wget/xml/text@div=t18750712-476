                  </hi>. I live with my husband at 42, Northampton row—the prisoner and his wife lodged in the same house—on 4th July, I went out at 1.30 leaving my baby of thirteen months old at home, and I returned about 3 o'clock—I took the baby from the bed and fed him—I then went into the prisoners' room carrying the baby in my arms at the breast—my husband followed me in, some words of quarrel took place between the prisoner and his wife about the dinner not being ready, his wife took up a glass of beer and threw it it in his face, using very aggra<lb></lb>vating language—he went to hit her with his fist—my husband said "Don't hit her," and he sat down on the bedside—when she threw the beer in his face he got up and took the poker; I did not see him take hold of it, but he got up and I saw it when it was in my baby's forehead; I saw him</p>

               <p>throw, but I did not see what he had got in his hand—I could not pull it out of the baby's forehead; I asked my husband to—I fainted and did not see the child till the Tuesday after.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoners wife was very aggravating to him, she commenced the quarrel—I told her to be quiet, but she would not—it is a small room; the bed is near the fireplace—I went into the room about 3.5 and this occurred about 3.30—I was there about five minutes before my husband and the prisoner came in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a writing case maker—on 4th July, I was with my wife in the prisoner's room, his wife was aggravating him very much, he went to strike her because she threw a glass of beer in his face—I said to him "<hi rend="italic">Fred</hi>, sit down"—he said "I will Harry," she again aggravated him very much, and he took up the poker and threw at her; I know it was not intended for my boy—when I turned round to see where the poker had gone it was in my boy's head—I pulled it out and went with the child to the hospital; it died within five minutes after it was there—I can certainly say that it was through the wife's aggravation that he threw the poker.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> She was more to blame than him, she was very aggravating indeed—he said he did not want any row—he was sitting on the bed very close to the fireplace—I did not actually see him throw the poker, I saw him stoop, and as soon as he stooped the poker was picked up and gone in a minute—they were quite sober—he has lived there about six weeks; he is a very quiet peaceable well disposed man—he has expressed the deepest sorrow for this unfortunate affair.</p>

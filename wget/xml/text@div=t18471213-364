                  </hi> I keep an eating-house, in Lisson-street, Mary<lb></lb>lebone. On Tuesday evening, 7th Dec., between five and seven o'clock, I was in the bar parlour of the Broad Arrow public-house, Milton-street—the prisoners were in and out all the evening—I do not know whether they were both in the room together—I had two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, in my purse; which I pulled out about six o'clock from my right trowsers pocket, and put them into my left hand—I was going to give them to Mr. Cooper, who was going to take possession of the house that evening—the broker pressed me to put the notes into my pocket again—I put them into the purse, but the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note clung to my fingers, and I sup<lb></lb>pose I must have dropped it—I put the purse into my pocket, buttoned it up, and did not look at it again that evening—at eight o'clock next morning, I missed the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, No. 76058, dated Oct. 11th—the purse and the other notes were all safe—I staid in and about the public-house about two hours after I took the notes out—I was in the neighbourhood till eleven o'clock—I</p>

               <p>stopped the note at the Bank—on Wednesday afternoon, about three o'clock, I gave information at the Broad Arrow that I had lost the note—the prisoners were them in front of the bar—I did not know either of them before—I said I had stopped it, and offered a sovereign reward to anybody who would produce it, or hear of a clue to it—Williamson asked me if it would not be advisable to print a few handbills, or advertise—I said I would con<lb></lb>sider of it—he said if he knew anything of the party he would let me know—Mandell said he had not seen it—on the 9th, about four o'clock, William<lb></lb>son came to my house, and told me he had a clue to the party who had picked up the note, but they would not give it up for anything less than half—I said I should not think of that, as the note was stopped, and asked to have an interview—we went to a house in Chiswell-street, and had a pint of ale—I questioned him several times about the note, and offered two sovereigns reward, and ten shillings to him—he said he would go and make the offer, but did not think the party would take it—he came back in ten minutes, and said they would not take less than half—I said I should very much like to have an interview with the party, and that I would make the reward 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for himself—he went out again, and I set the potman to watch—Williamson came back, and said the parties would not take it, for it was worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to them, if it was not to me—I gave him in charge there about seven o'clock—he told Sergeant Brannan that the party who could give him a clue to the note was the potman at the Broad Arrow—I pro<lb></lb>ceeded with him and the policeman to the Broad Arrow, and saw Mandell—I asked in Williamson's presence what he knew about the note, and cautioned him to speak the truth, as it would be taken against him—he said, "The truth of it is, I picked the note up in front of the bar on Wednesday morni<lb></lb>ng, and gave it to Williamson"—that was the morning after I lost it (it was not there when I went on Wednesday, for I searched)—Williamson said, "This young man picked up the note and gave it to me; I put it into my waistcoat-pocket; by some means it worked out, and I do not know where it is"—both prisoners were taken to the station—the Broad Arrow was closed to the public on Wednesday—this is my note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the number is the same—I had taken it of a neighbour, and saw him sign this name on the back.</p>

Between eight and nine o'clock on Thursday night, the 9th, I was fetched by the pot-boy of the Pied Horse, Chiswell-street, and found Rudland and Williamson in the parlour—I left them there, and went with Vousden to the Broad Arrow and saw Mandell—I spoke to him about a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note being lost there on Tuesday—he said he had not heard of any note being lost there—I said, "If such had been the case you must have heard of it"—he said "Yes"—I sent a policeman back to the Pied Horse, and then went there with Brannan—Williamson was out<lb></lb>side the Pied Horse, nobody was with him—I spoke to Rudland in the parlour—Williamson came in—Rudland said, "I believe you can give me some information respecting this note"—he said "Yes"—Rudland said, "Have you any objection to show me the party"—he said, "No"—we all went to the Board Arrow, Williamson showed us Mandell and said, "That is the young man that can give you the information"—Mandell said, "I picked up the note and gave it to Williamson"—Williamson said, "That is right, the young man gave me the note, but I have lost it"—they were both given in</p>

The prisoner came into my house to see a child of mine that lay dying: she would treat me with a dram, she said, if I would go for it; I went for a quartern of gin; (this was the fourth of September) when I returned I miss'd three knots of silk: I went to her and told her, if she would return it, there should be no farther trouble; she called me names, and wondered I could say such a thing: after that she owned that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176409120037"></xptr> she took the silk and gave it to another woman.</p>

               <p>R. Weller. This was the same night that she took it. I carried and sold it for her for half a crown and three-pence. I had no money for it that night.</p>

               <p>R. Weller. I sold it to Mr. Merryman. It was known the next day, and the officer went with me to his house, and he gave me the half crown and three-pence, and I delivered the money into the officer's hands.</p>

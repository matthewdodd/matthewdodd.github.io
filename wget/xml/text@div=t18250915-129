In going up stairs, I put my money, consisting of 16 s. in silver, into my right-hand trousers' pocket, and my handkerchief upon it. I had one or two half-crowns - I do not know which. We went on the bed together, and in four or five minutes, she got up and ran down stairs. I had before that, paid her 1 s. for the room. I got up and went down stairs. I crossed the road, and waited there some minutes; a woman came and asked me if I had lost any thing - I said "My money;" she asked if I had lost anything else. I then found my pocket-book was gone - she said "Come over, and perhaps I may find it." I then crossed over to the house where I had been, and saw a woman going up stairs with the book under her apron; she got to the top, and threw the book down. I took that, but I could not get the money - the prisoner was taken in about a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you no business to do? A. Yes; I had, but I had done it. I was then going to meet a person of the name of Nelson, in Whitechapel - I was perfectly sober. I had never heard the character that place bears; we had been in a public-house together at the corner of George-street - there was no dispute between us.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner in Shoreditch, on the 7th of September. I told her she was wanted for robbing a countryman in Whitechapel; she said she knew nothing about it; the prosecutor attended next day; we turned the prisoner out in the yard with two other women, and he swore to her - there was nothing found upon her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. She had not been out of the way, had she? A. Yes; from the place where she generally was.</p>

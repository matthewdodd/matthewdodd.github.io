I am the wife of the prisoner, and live at 46, Cable-street, St. George's—he left me about ten months since to go to sea—he came back a fortnight yesterday—he said that he had no money—I said nothing to him on Thursday-night, the 6th, he held a knife over my head, and said he would take my life, and wash his hands in my blood—on the Saturday-night I came home at 12 o'clock, and found him sitting on the stair—the wall between my room and the passage was smashed in—I asked him why he had done that, as he would not pay my rent for me—he said, "I will pay the rent for you"—I ran from the house into the next house, and he after me—he came towards me with knife in his hand—I cannot say where he took it from—he struck me with it on the left side of the face, and cut me from the temple to the chin.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Vincent, of 45, Cable-street, St. George's—on Saturday-night, the 8th of this mouth, I was standing at my door about half-past 10 or 12 o'clock, and saw the prisoner go by—he went into the prosecutrix's house—he had been in the house about five minutes when I heard a great row—I went and saw the prisoner on the stairs, and a young lady on the stairs with a candle in her hand, in her night dress—about a quarter of an hour afterwards the prosecutrix came up the street, and the prisoner ran into my passage after her—she asked me would I come round to her door with her—I said I did not like to do so—she took the key and opened the door, and said to the prisoner, "Get out of my place, you won't pay any rent for me, and won't keep me, I will go to my landlord"—I told her her landlord's place was closed—the prisoner ran out with the knife in his hand, and I saw him stab the prosecutrix with it—before doing so, he said, "I will give you your rent in blood."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Who is the landlord of the house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. White, who keeps the oil-shop—this was about ten minutes to 12—I had seen the prosecutrix come home without her bonnet or shawl—I did not see her go out—it was about a quarter of an hour before she came home that I saw the prisoner go into the house—I saw no young man there that evening—I an not able to say whether there was one or not—I had never spoken to the prosecutrix before—it was a knife like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) that the prisoner had in his hand, and he had another one also in a handkerchief—at the time he stabbed her I was holding her round the waist, and my head was nearly cut with the knife—after he had cut her he ran after me—I ran down the kitchen stairs, opened the back door, and got over the wall—I did not see a large iron spoon there at all.</p>

I am a surgeon of 71, High-street, Whiteclapel—on Satur<lb></lb>day-night, the 8th of this month, I examined the prosecutrix's face—I found an incised wound extending from the temporal bone down the cheek to the under part of the lower jaw—the wound was deeper in the centre of the cheek, but did not penetrate through—it was a dangerous wound—it will disfigure her for life—this is just such a knife as would inflict such a wound.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were the edges of the wound clean cut? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, in two portions—the centre part of the wound on the muscle of the cheek was not, but the upper and lower portions were.</p>

On the 16th of January the prisoner and another woman came into my shop, they asked to look at some muslin; I shewed them some muslin and then they asked for some gingham; they bought a small quantity of that, and while I was serving that the prisoner had a child in her arms, she went towards the door and went out; the person that was with her paid for what she had bought, and went out. I missed a piece of Irish linen. I told

            . I am shopman to Mr. Parry. My master told me to go after the two women; I stopped the prisoner at the bottom of Holborn Hill; she said she could not come back, she was going to the doctor's; I told her go where she would I must follow her. In Hatton Garden she said if I would let her go and forgive her she would confess what she had got; I asked her what it was; she held it on her arm; I took it from her and looked at it, and saw it was my master's property. I brought her back; I said, here is the woman and the cloth. This is it, I am sure it is my master's property.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in her defence; called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

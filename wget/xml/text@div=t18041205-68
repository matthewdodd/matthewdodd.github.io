               <p>Q. Do you live in the same house with Irvin? - A. Yes; I knew she was no lodger in the house, and the room having been robbed before I followed her and brought her back; she had the young man's property upon her. (The things produced.)</p>
               <p>Irvin. These are my property; there is no mark upon them, but I know them to be mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had a walk out of the country, forty miles, with three children; I was so tired I sat down to rest at a street door; there was a hat, and I took it up, but as to the inside of the door, as I have three fatherless children, I never was within the door.</p>

I inquired for it, and he said it was down below, under the cabin; he went down, searched for it some time, and then said he had taken it ashore one rainy night, and forgot to bring it back - he said he took it to the lodging-house. I desired the other apprentice to go to the lodging-house for it; the prisoner said he would go, but I said he should not. He then said it was not there, it was at Briggs's; I missed other things, suspected him, and gave him in charge. I went with him to Briggs's, and found the coat hanging up there with another old one of mine; he said he took them ashore on Sunday last to look decent. Briggs told him that he said they were given to him by a passenger in the ship.</p>

            . I live at No. 44, North-street; the prisoner brought me a great coat first, and a blue one three or four days after; he said a passenger on board gave them to him - he asked permission to leave them with me, and said he would take them on board. The prosecutor afterwards saw and claimed them.</p>

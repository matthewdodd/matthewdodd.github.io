            . I am watch-house-keeper of St. Pancras. I saw the prisoner on Sunday morning, the 28th of August, a little before me, with a bag on his shoulder, and two umbrellas under his coat. I followed him to Buckingham-street, and then stopped him; he went with me as far as Fitzroy-street; he then said he was very sick, and begged me to let him lean against a post, which I did; he then snatched the staff from my hand, and broke the strap from my wrist; he struck me on the head, and on several other parts; I called to a man named Jones to come, but the prisoner kicked him, and he went away; I then saw one of the patrol, and called to him; he refused to come, but at last he came, and the prisoner was secured; these brushes fell out of the prisoner's pocket in the scuffle; the other property was found in the bag.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been down to Battle-bridge, and as I was returning a man said to me, "Young man, do you want a job?" I said, on Monday morning I should. He said, "If you come to the Adam and Eve public-house, at five o'clock to-morrow morning, I will take you to my master's." I went about six o'clock, and did not find him. I was returning home, and in Tottenham-court-road a man met me with a kind of shooting-jacket on, and he said, "Have you a mind to earn 1 s. 6 d.; take this bag to the Buffalo's Head, in the New-road, I shall be there by the time you get there." Soon afterwards I was stopped by the officer, and made no resistance.</p>
               <p>One witness gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

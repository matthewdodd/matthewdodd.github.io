                  </hi>. I live at Peckham Rye, in the parish of St. Giles, Camberwell. On the 15th of September, I was sitting in my drawing-room in the afternoon, and in consequence of what was said to me, I went into the surgery, and then into the adjoining room, and missed my watch, chain, ring, and brooch, worth at least 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the watch was well worth 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had been in the room ten minutes before, and the articles were safe—I went to the police, and told them, and went with an officer to Bath-street, Melsom-ground, about a quarter of a mile from my house—I found the prisoner, two other men, and two women there in the room, and some baskets—I put my hand on the prisoner's shoulder from the description I had received, and gave him into custody, but he ran away—I saw him in custody in about a month afterwards—I have found none of mu property.</p>

                  </hi>. I live exactly opposite the prosecutor's house. I was at tea on the afternoon in question, and saw the prisoner—I had seen him frequently before that—on the 15th of September, about a quar<lb></lb>ter to five o'clock, I saw him knock at the prosecutor's door, and wait four or five minutes, then open the door himself, and go in—he opened it with the handle or latch; nobody let him in—it was the surgery door—the street door is always open—the surgery door is on the left of the street door—I watched, and saw the door open leading from the surgery into ano<lb></lb>ther room, but could not see that he opened that himself—he came out in seven or eight minutes; and when he got outside the gate, he put his hand to his trowsers pocket, and pulled it up again, as if he was looking at something in his hand—he put it in again, and walked a short distance, and called at a shop to know if they wanted any baskets, which he had, selling—he then walked briskly away, and then ran—I sent a message over to Mr. Gill by my sister—I must have seen if any other person went into the surgery while he was there—I could see into it from my window—the door between the surgery and the other room was closed before he went in; and I saw it open while he was in.</p>

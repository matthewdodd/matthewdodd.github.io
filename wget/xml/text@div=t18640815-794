                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife—he is a clerk—we live at 2, Hyde<lb></lb>place, Westminster—we have been married eighteen years—a fortnight ago last Saturday (30th July), he came home between 2 and 3 in the afternoon—I can't say whether he had been drinking, but he was excited—he went to bed a little after 8—about 9 o'clock I and Mrs. Woolley were in the parlour together, and my husband came from his bed into the parlour—he did not say anything—my little boy said, "Where is the pistol?" and with that, my husband left his bedroom and took the pistol out of his box, and aimed it towards me; but I don't think he meant to injure me—he pointed it towards me—I heard the report, hut it touched one of the paintings, and I escaped it—I had given him no provocation—I was going out of the room at the time—I can't recollect whether my face or my back was turned towards him—I did not see the smoke from the pistol, I only heard the report—we had had no quarrel previous to this—I think it was mental excitement caused him to drink—ho had fired in the garden about 7 in the evening, and I remonstrated with him, and he said he did it for a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi>—he never made any threat towards me, that I heard; I am very deaf—I stepped over to Mrs. Woolley to ask her to come over—that was to assist him into bed with one of the daughters, which they did—I was about as far as I am from my lord when my husband fired the pistol—he aimed it at the painting</p>

               <p>more than towards me—I remember the policeman coming—I did not hear what my husband said then, I was not in the room; I kept in the doorway—I did not hear him make any complaint about my pawning things, not then; I had a few days before.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 1, Paradise-place, Vincent-square—on Saturday, 30th July, about 7 o'clock, Mrs. Leach came to me and some of the children with her; they remained at my house, and I went back with her—I saw the prisoner standing at his garden-gate, smoking his pipe—I asked him to come indoors and speak to me; he did so—after a few minutes' conversation, I asked him to remove the powder and shot; it was then on the table—he put it away—he was in an excited state—I then went home—I was fetched again by the daughter a little after 9—when I went in, I found the prisoner fast asleep in the front room, sitting in a leaning posture with his head on the table—the daughter and I put him to bed in the next room, three steps up—one of the little boys, from seven to ten years of age, ran in and asked for the pistol—Mrs. Leach was not there at that moment—the prisoner directly jumped out of bed and took the pistol—I could not positively say that he took it out of the box, but he stooped—I tried to take it from him—he lifted the pistol and fired it as his wife entered the room—she saw him lift his hand—he lifted his hand and shot at his wife—the muzzle was pointed towards the door, where she stood—she came to the door as he fired—we had two candles burning—after the prisoner had fired the pistol, he went to bed again—he took the pistol into the bedroom with him—he said in the afternoon that he had been provoked, and I desired him to be quiet and at peace—he seemed very low-spirited; he said the home was not to his mind, not as he could wish—after the pistol was fired, I heard him say, as he came out, that he had been</p>

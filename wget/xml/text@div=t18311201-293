            . I live in Cheapside, and am an umbrella-maker. On the evening of the 11th of November the prisoner came into my shop, and asked for a sixpenny stick - he threw down a counterfeit 5s. piece to my wife; I was standing behind a desk, where he could not see me: I went forward, took up the crown-piece, and said, "I don't like this, my friend, have you a sixpence;" he said No: I took it to a vice in the shop, and tried it - I found it was bad; he said, "You must not deface it, I will take it back" - I said, "You shall not take that back, nor yourself;" he then dropped the stick and ran off - I pursued him; as he found I was gaiming ground, he stopped at the corner of Friday-street, and said "There he goes" but I took him; I am certain he is the person - I had not lost sight of him. Mr. Powell, the solicitor of the Mint, said they would attend to it, but I heard no more of them, and I was forced to go before the Grand Jury - I there saw Mr. Powell and Mr. Field, who said the Mint did not think it worth their while to prosecute unless there was a second uttering.</p>

            . I took the prisoner, and produce the crown-piece which I received from the prosecutor.</p>

               <p>The prisoner read a long Defence, stating that he had been employed as a Law-writer , and had received the crown-piece with some other money, of a Mr. Jones , at Williams' coffee-house - he went to buy the stick, and took the crown-piece out by accident to pay for it; that when the prosecutor refused it he had run out to find the gentleman he took it from and the prosecutor pursued and took him .</p>
               <p>The crown-piece being broken was evidently counterfeit .</p>

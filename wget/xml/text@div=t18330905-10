               <p>JOSIAH GILL re-examined. He has been in Shoreditch work-house twice, they could do nothing with him - he appears like a lunatic; he has almost knocked himself to pieces; he has got into the wash-house, and nearly covered it with blood; this was when he was apprenticed to my father - one evening my father asked him to see my cousin home, and instead of that he ran to her house, and waited till my cousin came home.</p>

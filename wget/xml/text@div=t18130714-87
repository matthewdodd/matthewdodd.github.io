             in Lee-bridge-road, near Clapton, with a bottle of cream in his hand, a bag at his back, and a pair of boots hanging to it in the front. I asked him what he had got; he said a pair of boots and some grub. He said he had a brother lived at Woodford; he gave it to him. He put the bag down; I found there was no grub in it; there was a pair of boots and about a pound of butter fresh from the churn, not made up, three cabbages, some beef, mutton, and bacon, some cheese and some dripping. The constable went down to Woodford, and found where it came from.</p>
               <p>MR. GARVER. I am a constable of Hackney. Between twelve and one o'clock on Sunday morning, the 20th, the patrol brought the prisoner to the watch-house, and the things that he has described. The prisoner first said his brother gave them him, and afterwards he said it was his wife; she lived with Mr. Inglish, in Snakes-lane. I went down in the evening and saw his wife; she said she gave him all the things the bag contained, and that they were given to her.</p>


               <p>Prosecutor. I have every reason to believe the prisoner's wife gave them to him.</p>

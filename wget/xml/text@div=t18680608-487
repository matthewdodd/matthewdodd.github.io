                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman, in Friday Street, City—the prisoner Eliza Chadwick, was in my employment—previous to July, 1867, I carried on the business of a shawl mauufacturer, and a dealer in Winseys, I was afterwards desirous of superadding the mantle business; for that purpose I engaged the female prisoner, at a salary of 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I had known her for four or five years previously—she left in the middle of January—she had requested an increase of wages; I refused—the matter came before Mr. Commissioner Kerr, on 30th March, and was adjourned until some future day—when I went back to my premises on 30th March, I received certain information from my workpeople, in consequence I communicated with the police at Bow Street, and Cheshire the constable was sent to me—I went with him to the prisoner's house in Fore Street—I saw her there, and a Mr. Townsend, and a number of workpeople, as well as the male prisoner and Mrs. Hall—I found a considerable quantity of property there, this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is all my property, I have examined it all—its value is</p>

Parker, Lee and Hammond, of St. Paul's Church Yard, my present solicitors, to defend me at the Sheriff's Court—the prisoner came to me the day after she left, and said if I did not pay her she would sue me—the summons was not taken out for a month, it was heard on the 30th, I went to her house that day—I found twelve or fifteen work girls there, they were doing the identical work that I was, for she stole my patterns; I found them there—I gave her into custody—she showed me all the materials she had there—these (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) are all my patterns—she did not design any of them, these patterns are cut from large pieces, we sell the cuttings at threepence a pound—the</p>

               <p>prisoner has not designed all these patterns, she designed tome and I have designed a good many myself, and so has Mr. Crystal and others; I believe nearly all the young ladies would occasionally suggest a pattern—I do not manufacture the whole of these things nor are they made expressly for me, I buy at Leeds, Manchester, and London, in the open market, other per<lb></lb>sons may buy similar articles—before the prisoner entered my service I occasionally gave her out things to make; and others did the same, she could not have made a living out of what I gave her, Mr. Crystal occa<lb></lb>sionally gave things out, and sometimes if I have been in Scotland, my brothers may have done it; I was in partnership with my brothers, but we dissolved in September last.</p>

On the afternoon of 30th March, I accompanied Mr. Gow to Chadwick's—I said to Mrs. Chadwick that Mr. Gow had told me he had reason to believe she had some of his property in the house, and I more particularly wished to see a velvet jacket which she had worn that day at the County Court—she said, "Oh yes, you can see it;" and she went to a cupboard and brought out a velvet jacket—Miss Reed, who accompanied us, said, "That is the jacket I told you about, it was cut off your materials stolen from your place"—Mr. Gow then gave Mrs. Chadwick into custody—she claimed all the property we found as her own—I then told her I should search the house—I did so with Fawke, who was with me, and took away a portion of the property now produced—I afterwards took away the remainder—the male prisoner came into the room before we searched the house—I told him we were police officers, that Mrs. Chadwick was in custody, and that I should search the house—he became very abusive, and said, "You are a police officer, are you?"—I said, "Yes"—he opened the door and said he would throw me down from the top to the bottom and break my neck—I had to take up a poker to him to prevent his doing it.</p>

               <p>The Prosecutor depos'd, The Prisoner was a Neighbour's Niece, and used to visit her Daughter, that she had Reason to suspect that she had Robbed her twice, that the Tea Pot was lost the 24th of September, and the Ring lost January the 18th, that while she was gone out of Town, the Prisoner, as she was inform'd, came to her House, and having sent out the Maid of an Errand, there being only two Children in the House, and her self, she broke open a Wallnut-Tree Scriptore, and took the Rings mentioned in the Indictment; that when she came Home on the Tuesday following, she found the Scriptore was broken, and the Rings gone, and that the Prisoner owned the breaking of the Glass, and sent Money to pay for it. There were other Evidences to confirm this, and that the Rings were found by the Prisoner's Direction, where they had been pawn'd by her.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner did not deny her having pawned the Rings; but pleaded, that the Glass of the Scriptore was broken by Accident, by the Fall of a Curtain Rod; that the Board of the Scriptore behind the Glass was not broken, and that the Prosecutor's Daughter,

            , gave her the Key of the Scriptore, and bid her take the Rings, and make use of them on Account of Money she ow'd to the Prisoner, she having no other way to pay her. It did appear by other Evidences, that there had been a very great Intimacy between the Prosecutor's Daughter and the Prisoner; but the Prosecutor's Daughter charged the Balance of Accounts upon the Prisoner. The Prisoner desir'd the Prosecutor might be ask'd. If she was not married to her Son? But the Prosecutor said, her Son deny'd it; she reply'd, that she could produce her Certificate, and that when she was before a Justice, and her Mittinens was made in the Name of

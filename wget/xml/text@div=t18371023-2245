                  <hi rend="largeCaps">FRANCIS CHOAM KELLY</hi>. I live in Robert-street, Hampstead-road, and am clerk to Walker and Co., of New Inn. On the 29th of July last I was at the Acton Arms public-house, Kingsland-road—I had missed my road, and went there to ask my nearest way to Islington—I was not tipsy, but I had dined with four gentlemen at East Ham, in Essex, that day, and was a little the worse for liquor—I had certainly taken a glass of wine—I mean several—we had two bottles of wine between four of us—I did not sit down in the public-house—I did not sec the prisoner there—I believe she is one of the three women who followed me in—I had not seen them before I went into the public-house—they followed me in almost immediately after—one of them called for a quartern of gin—I called for a glass of beer my self before they came in, and put my hand into my pocket, supposing I had silver to pay for it, but I had none, and took out my purse to change a sovereign to pay for it—as the landlord was giving me change, he asked the female who called for the gin who was to pay for it—(that woman has been posecuted already)—she immediately said I was to pay for it—that was not the prisoner—the price of the gin was taken for out of my change—I objected to it at first, but finding it likely to make a disturbance, I told the landlord he had better take it rather than have a disturbance there—I put the change into my purse, which I placed in my right-hand trowsers' pocket—I then immediately left the house—the women followed me out directly, all three of them—the moment I got out I was seized by one of them by both arms—that was the one who has been already prosecuted—the second came to my left side, and placed her hand on my left side, and the third came on the right side; and the moment I moved to get away, she unbuttoned my pocket, and drew the purse from it—I believe that was the woman not in custody—there were six sovereigns and one half-sovereign in my purse—I am sure they were safe in my purse; and I believe the silver in it was three half-crowns, one shilling, and a sixpence—I had changed sovereign, and received half a sovereign among the change; and the half pence were in my waistcoat-pocket—I cannot swear whether the prisoner was one of them or not, but I believe her to be one—two of the women immediately made off, down Kingsland-road—the third remained for a second, and then walked in a contrary direction—she was immediately apprehended by a policeman, and has been tried—I never saw my money again, nor my purse—there was nothing found on the woman who was taken up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a die-sinker. I was in the Acton Arms on the 29th of July—I was servant there then—the prosecutor came in about half-past ten o'clock and called for a glass of porter, for which he gave a sovereign—while he was drinking the porter, the prisoner came in after him there was a girl called <hi rend="italic">Newington Nance</hi> with her, and another—I knew the prisoner before by sight by living there, and have heard her go by the name of Harden—master gave the prosecutor the change—he put it into a leather purse, and put it into his right hand pocket—he was taken sick at the bar—ho was not very tipsy—he had been drinking wine, and the porter took an effect upon him—he appeared to know what he was about-master called me to see the gentleman out, and I went to do so, but girls said they would see him out, and they would not let me see him out—I tried to do so, and they came in between us—I am sure the prisoner is one of the three—I can swear to her—the three girls took him to the corner—I saw him outside the house—the one not in custody put her hand into the gentleman's pocket and took out the purse—the prisoner had got him round the waist—when they got the money they made off—I</p>

I was in the Acton Arms—I had not seen the persons inside—I had not been there more than ten minutes—I saw two or three women at the bar, but not to notice them exactly, nor had I noticed the prosecutor—as soon as I came out of the house I saw the prisoner with two other females holding the prosecutor very tight, and in about half a moment the prisoner and another ran away—the third was walking away and the policeman took her—I gave inform ation to the police and the prisoner was afterwards taken—I have known her by sight for four or five years—I am sure she is the person who held the prosecutor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Samuel Mumford, of New<lb></lb>castle-street, Strand—the prisoner was in our service—it was his duty to receive money and pay it the same evening to Mr. Goodman, our principal young man, to Mr. Coleman, or to me—he was to pay one of us three, and no one else—if he received 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 7th of Feb., or 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 24th of March, or 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the 11th of April, he has not paid them to me—when I gave him into custody I charged him with it, and he said he had paid all the three sums, but I do not think he said to whom.</p>

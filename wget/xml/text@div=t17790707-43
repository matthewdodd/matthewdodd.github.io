On the first of June, I had been to spend the evening with my sister in St. John's Square. It has pleased God to afflict me with fits. As I was coming home about half after ten o'clock at night, I found myself poorly in Smithfield; and coming down Snow-hill I fell down in a fit, and lost my things; I cannot say who was about me.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman; I was going my rounds at ten o'clock on Snow-hill, coming down Cock-Court, I saw a man and a woman; the woman was sitting on her backside; he was behind her holding her by the arms; he desired me to go and get a coach, he said his wife was in fits. I went to Smithfield to get a coach; when I returned the man was gone. The woman was lying on her back still in a fit. I stayed some time till she came to herself; she lost her cloak and shoes; I asked her if she had any money; she said she had fifteen shillings; she felt in her pocket, and her money was gone; I did not know what to do with her; the constable came, and we took her to the watch-house; there she lay till two in the morning; one of the watchmen learned where her husband lived, and sent to him, and he came at two o'clock and took her home.</p>
               <p>Was the man you saw supporting her the prisoner? - Yes, I saw the prisoner afterwards before the Justice; I described him before I saw him; I was in the room; he was sent into the room; I knew him directly.</p>

               <p>On the first of June, going down Snow-hill, I met that woman; she appeared to be very much in liquor; she took hold of my arm, and desired me to see her home. We had not gone far before she went up a passage, and said she would go no farther. I called to the watchman to go and get a coach. I then went down to the Fleet-market to buy something for supper, and when I returned the woman and watchman were both gone; and I picked up a cloak and a pair of shoes and buckles. As I was going home, the watchman laid hold of me. I intended to have had the things advertised the next day.</p>

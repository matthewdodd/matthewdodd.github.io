                  </hi>. I live at 168, Kent-street. I am a widow—I lived with the prisoner as his wife for two years—on Tuesday, the 11th of June, some words passed between us between two and three o'clock in the after<lb></lb>noon—the prisoner went out after that—I went to bed during his absence—about half-past ten o'clock—I was awoke from my sleep in the course of the night, I cannot tell about what time it was I was awoke by something cutting me across the throat—I got up, and ran down stairs and opened the door—I cannot tell who did it—I saw no one—I cannot tell whether there was any body near the bed, man, or woman—it was dark—as I was coming down stairs I received a wound in the arm—I cannot tell whether it was done with a knife, I was too frightened—it appeared to be the cut of a knife—I opened the door, and called "Murder" once—I could call no more—I fell down—a surgeon afterwards attended me—I went to the hospital on Tuesday morning, and remained till Thursday, when I was brought here—the prisoner gets his living by selling whips.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. About ten minutes before twelve o'clock I was called—I saw the prosecutrix outside her door, lying on her back, bleeding profusely from the throat—I inquired who did it—the prisoner came running down stairs, and said "I did it, and meant to do it, and to do for myself afterwards"—I took him to the station-house.</p>

               <p>----, I am a policeman. I saw the prosecutrix lying in the manner described by Green—she was lying on her back wounded—I said, "For God's sake, who cut that woman's throat in this way?" the prisoner came down stairs without his shoes, and said, "I <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it, and I meant to do it"—I told him he must go along with me to the station-house—I said, "What did you do it with?" he said, "A knife, and I threw the knife upon the floor"—I went part of the way to assist my brother constable—I gave him to another constable, and ran back to assist the woman to the hospital—I went up stairs, and found the knife underneath the bed—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—that is the knife—there are marks of blood upon it—the prisoner was the worse for liquor—he was very drunk—he was able to answer me, and avow what he had done.</p>

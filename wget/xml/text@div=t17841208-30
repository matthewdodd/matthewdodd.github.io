               <p>Mr. Peatt, Prisoner's Council. You say you had not seen these cows since Thursday morning? - No.</p>
               <p>How long have you had them? - I cannot say, we change our beast about from year to year, I have a great many, my father is a cowman; they do not feed together, we know them all be the colour what they will, I found the prisoner at the King's Head in Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Was you ever mistaken in a cow? - I should know it if it was a thousand miles off, in the midst of a thousand beast.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you perfectly sure these were your cows? - Yes, I have not the smallest doubt about them, I know them all by their colour, nothing more, and one of these cows is a particular grey one.</p>

               <p>I know the prisoner, I have seen him before; on the 29th of October last on the Friday morning, as I was going to Smithfield about half past six, the prisoner came, and said he had brought two cows for me to sell, he said he brought them from Mr. Hamilton, of Holloway or Highgate, I am not sure which, I looked at them, and booked them in that name, the name of Hamilton.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there a Mr. Hamilton at Holloway that you knew? - No, I do not know any such name.</p>
               <p>Court. You did not buy the cows? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Did you sell either of them? - I sold one of them.</p>
               <p>Did you receive the money for it? - No, I sold it to a Mr. Wright, of St. James's-market,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080095"></xptr> a person I am very intimate with, and he had not paid me.</p>
               <p>Did you pay the prisoner for that? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you acquaint him that you had sold it? - I never saw him from the time he delivered me the cow, when he spoke to me, till he was taken, which was about twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Before that, Mr. Rhodes came to you? - Yes, Mr. Rhodes came about twelve, and said that is my cow stands there, how came you by it; I told him a young man had brought them to me in the morning, and said he brought them from Mr. Hamilton, of Holloway, that he left the cows with me, and was gone away somewhere, I did not know where; when the prisoner was taken up I was present.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He said little or nothing to Mr. Rhodes, till he came before the Justice, then he said he bought them.</p>
               <p>Did he give any account of the person of whom he had bought them? - No, I do not remember.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was paid for driving these cows to market, by one Hamilton of Highgate, he told me he was going into town, and desired me to sell them, accordingly I gave them to Mr. Chapman, and desired him to sell them, and I went into the King's-head, and had a pint of beer, and they came and took me up, I have several times carried cows to Mr. Chapman.</p>
               <p>Court to Chapman. Had you ever any dealings with the prisoner before? - None, to my knowledge; I find since, he lived with a Mr. Herring, and he sent three or four to me to sell, and I have mentioned him to Mr. Herring, and he gave him a very good character; Mr. Herring lives just by Hampstead.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Did you send to Mr. Herring? - Yes, Sir, he was here four days past, he was here till eleven o'clock last night, my witnesses were all here this morning, they are all over at the public house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chapman. I did not see him drive them into the market.</p>
               <p>You did not know how they came into the market? - No.</p>

               <p>Do cows coming from Hampstead-road come through that turnpike? - It is the road from Kentish-town.</p>

               <p>Last Sunday was se'nnight I was called up about five o'clock on an information of a robbery having been committed. I heard the woman was in the watch house. I went to her and charged her with the robbery. She said she took the watch out of a man's pocket she was in bed with, and that she had had it a week, and had sent it to pawn by Randall. I sent for Randall; he immediately acknowledged he had pawned the watch.</p>

               <p>I met the man in Oxford-road; he asked me to take him to my lodging; I said I had never a lodging of my own to take him to, but I could get him a lodging for sixpence, in Banbury-street, St. Giles's, and asked him to give me something to drink; he said no, he would see the lodging first. When we came there, we went into a back room. I then asked for something to drink; he said he had no money, he would treat me in the morning; in the morning he said he had no money, and he gave me the watch to pay for the lodging, and some liquor we had bad; I kept the watch a week, and he never called. That is the truth, my Lord, as God is my judge.</p>
               <p>To the prosecutor. You was very much in liquor? - No; not so much but I know what I did. I did not give her the watch.</p>

                  </hi>. I am waiter at the Crown Tavern, Bow-lane. On the evening of the 21st of May the prisoner came to the coffee-room—I got him some brandy and water—he gave me a card to go to Mr. Sawyer for him, which I did—I had collected my plate, and put it into a basket on the table—I suspected I had lost some, and missed three spoons—I went to my employer, and they were found in the prisoner's pocket—he did not say any thing—he was not sober—these are the spoons.</p>

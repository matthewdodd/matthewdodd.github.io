                  </hi>. I am a plumber—I live now at 43, Queen's Road, Bayswater—in October, 1868, I lived at 31, Pared-Street, Padding-ton—I have known Mr. Denyer some years—I remember his calling upon me in October, and asking me if I would go and do him a service—he produced an envelope, and took out a copy of a writ, and asked me to go to Dr. Beale's and present it to him—he said he had tried several times, and could not get in—I went to Dr. Beale's, in Porteus Road, No. 19, I believe it is; Mr. Denyer went with me—I knew Dr. Beale by sight; I have known him for years perfectly well—I knocked at an inner door, and a young man let me in—I asked for Dr. Beale, and he showed me into the waiting-room, and said, "Go into that room and take your turn with the rest of the patients"—I went in alone; Mr. Denyer remained outside, on the opposite side of the road—I sat down in the room and took my turn; the young man told me when it was my turn to go in—I waited, I suppose, half an hour, or something like that; I can't say exactly—there were other persons there; they went out one by one—I went into the surgery, and saw Dr. Beale—he asked what he could do for me—I said I was not a patient of his, I had brought a note from Mr. Denyer—I gave it him—he took the note and opened it; it contained the copy of the writ—I had seen it, and had it in my hands, and read it—I am positive the note I gave the defendant contained the copy of the writ; I had seen it put in by Mr. Denyer when he came to me—Dr. Beale opened the note, took it out, and held it up to the candle—this was somewhere about 9 o'clock in the even-ing; I can't tell to ten minutes; there were candles on the table—he said</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. TAYLOR</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When was this conversation; do you mean that it was two or three days after the 5th October? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perhaps so—I don't recollect the date—I had soon Mr. Denyer several times before that; that was not the first conversation we had about it—I saw him on the morning of the 5th October, and I promised to see him again in the evening, to go and serve Dr. Beale with the writ, but I saw the Doctor go out, and I had not the writ in my possession then; I went round to look for Mr. Denyer, and he went to look for me, and when I saw Dr. Beale go out I went home—a day or two after I met Mr. Denyer and told him I had seen Dr. Beale go out, and I did not trouble myself about it any longer, and he said he had got Mr. Maxted to do it—it was on some subsequent occasion that he asked me to make an affidavit—I am quite sure this was on the 5th October—my attention was called to that day, because that very morning there had been some conversation with Mr. Denyer—I am quite sure it was the defendant that I saw go out of the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer's porter, and live at 89, Seymour Place—I have known the defendant for some long time—I recollect the 5th October, I was in charge of his house that day; I was there from about 8 in the morning until the following morning, and did not leave the house at all—during that time the boy was in the house and the defendant's sister-in-law a young lady—her Christian name is Clara—the defendant was out the whole of that day—whether he might have come in and gone out again while I was in the back yard I cannot say—I saw him about 8 a.m., he had his hat in his hand and was going out to a lady—I saw him go out—I did not see him again till about 4 o'clock the following morning, when I let him in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I understood you to bay he might have come in without your seeing him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—I remained in the house till the following morning—I went out about 4 o'clock and went home, and then came back again—I was examined at the Police Court—I did not say there that I took care of the defendant's house on the morning of 5th October till 8 in the evening; that is wrong—I said he might have come in without my seeing him—there was a great many patients coming in and going away; because he was not there—I told them he was not in, would they take a seat, I expected he might be in shortly—I did not see him come in, if he had I must have seen him.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you swear he could not have come in without your seeing him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—the patients wait in the front parlour; sometimes I was in that room, sometimes down in the kitchen, and sometimes up in the drawing room—I was in that room about 9 o'clock, I patted by it several</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186908160044"></xptr>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you answer the door on every occasion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, mostly—I don't answer the door to everyone—I answered a great many—I can't say that I answered all—the doctor was not in the habit of coming in with key—he had not a key to let himself in.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 17, Albion Mews, Albion Street, Hyde Park—that is quite a mile from Dr. Beale's—on the morning of 5th October last I had occasion to go to Dr. Beale's—I had previously engaged him to attend my daughter in her confinement—she lives at 7, Phoenix Place, Addison Road, Notting Hill—that is two or three miles from the doctor's—they charged a half-crown fare for the cab—I was at the doctor's before 7 o'clock on the morning of the 5th—I waited some time, a gentleman saw me and said he would see me as soon as possible—some time elapsed after the doctor came down, and then it was some time before we could get a cab—it was nearly 8 o'clock when we left—he went with me in the cab to my daughter's house—I remained there the whole of the day—the doctor did not leave during the day—he attended to my daughter—she was confined about 5.15—he was there then—I could not say how long he stayed after that—some time elapsed, and he had tea before he left—I should say he remained half an hour or more afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am under articles to Mr. Ablett, the solicitor who is defending Dr. Beale—on 5th October I saw the defendant, about 8.40 in the evening, at my house, 65, Cambridge Terrace, Hyde Park—he remained at my house till 4 o'clock the following morning—I had been thrown from my chaise the previous evening—the doctor attended me then, and he promised to call round early the next morning, but he did not do so, he called in the evening—I know Mr. Wortley—I sent my coachman for him to come as a witness for the defence—he resides at 10, Netley-Street, Harrow Road—I believe he is in the employ of the Great Western Railway Company—he has not come yet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You say it was 8.40 o'clock that the defendant came? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I got very fidgetty in consequence of his not keeping his promise to be with me at 9 in the morning—he had attended me previously—I had met with what might have been a serious accident—I lost my teeth I was in pain for several days, and Dr. Beale was afraid of erysipelas setting in—I was suffering pain on 5th October, but I knew what I was doing—I felt annoyed at Dr. Beale not coming as he had promised—I sent round for him in the evening—I know it was 8.40 when he came in, because I had told my wife if he was not there by 9 o'clock to send for Dr. Kirby—it was then exactly 8.30—I had my watch under my pillow, and I looked at it when he arrived.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How far is your house from Dr. Beale's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It depends upon which way you go—the quickest way would be, I should say, half a mile, and the other three-quarters—I heard a cab or some vehicle pull up at the time he came, and that probably was the vehicle he came in.</p>

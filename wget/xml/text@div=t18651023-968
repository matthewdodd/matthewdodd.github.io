                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, of 30, Bouverie-street, City—on 12th September, about two o'clock in the morning, I was coming from Charles-street, Grosvenor-square—the two female prisoners struck me and knocked me down—I struggled with one on my left and held her fast—the other ran away—I caught the left hand one's hand in my pocket, the other then returned and a struggle ensued—Sullivan was standing by the whole I time—the females ran away, leaving me on the ground I attempted to run after them, and Sullivan caught hold of me—I called, "Police" as loud as I could—I had a half franc piece in my pocket and some other money—my right hand was very much injured in the fall, it swelled very much.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Sullivan.</hi> You told the Magistrate that you never saw me till you were running after the females; you ran against me <hi rend="italic">in</hi> crossing the road, as I ran to save myself from being run over. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> That was not so—I was not exactly sober.</p>

I was on duty in Piccadilly, and heard cries of "Police"—I ran, and when I got within 100 yards I saw the two female prisoners knock the prosecutor down—he got up and struggled with them again—they appeared to see me and ran away; he ran after them and Sullivan closed with him in the middle of the road—the females ran down Stratton-street—I took Sullivan and then ran after the women and took them both—I gave Davis to 106 C.</p>

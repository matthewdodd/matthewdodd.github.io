About 12.30, on 24th June, I met the two prisoners in the Walworth Road—I had known them by sight for some time—they were going towards the Elephant and Castle—I stopped them, and said, "Where are you off to this time of night?"—they said, "Going home"—I said "Home! what do you mean? where do you live?" Bristow said, "2, Hanover Street"—I said, "Where are you going? to Maguire—he said, "I am going home, I live there, too"—I said, "Where have you come from now?"—Bristow said, "I have just come from my father's house, in Trafalgar Street; I have just been married to-day, and I am going home to my wife"—Bristow had a very heavy chain on—I said "Well, you won't go home yet, for I shall take you to the station, and see what you have got about you"—I called another constable and took them both to the station—I searched Bristow and found this chain and locket—I also took a stud put of his shirt—I took a watch from his pocket, and said "How do you account for this watch and chain"—he said, "I have been</p>

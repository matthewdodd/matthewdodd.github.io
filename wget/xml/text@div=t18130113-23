            . I am a butcher in Leadenhall-market. On the 12th of December, between six and seven o'clock, I met the prisoner with a sheep on his shoulder. I saw him coming from Mr. King's. I turned round, and saw the sheep had a head on it. It is not usual to sell a sheep with the head on. I thought he had stolen it. I ran after him, and a little way down Lime-street I caught him. I asked him, where he had got it. He said, he had found it on the ground. I brought him towards Mr. King; supposing it was stolen from him, and Mr. King's man owned it.</p>

            . I am a journeyman butcher to Mr. King. Between six and seven o'clock, Mr. Lee brought the prisoner and the sheep. This is the sheep; it was hanging at the door, on our premises. I know the sheep; it has our private mark. It is Mr. King's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I hope your honour will have mercy on me. I was sold by the French to Tippoo Sulton, for refusing to fight against the English. On that day, at Blackwall, he told me to meet him at Leadenhall-market, and when I came to him, this sheep laid on the ground. I said, what have you got here. He said, a sheep; will you have it. I said, I did not care. They came and caught hold of me.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 28, Storey-street, and am in the employ of Mrs. Stratford—on Saturday, 12th August, I and a lad named Cahill were in a cart belonging to my mistress, in Skinner-street, Snow-hill, with three baskets of linen in it—we stopped in Skinner-street to deliver one of the baskets—I got out of the cart, leaving Cahill in it—in consequence of what a woman said to me I looked in the cart, and saw that one of the baskets was gone—I went into Giltspur-street and saw the prisoner with it on his shoulders—I went and caught hold of him—he dropped the basket and tried to get away—I clung to him, and he dragged me across the road, and punched me on the head two or three times—I called "Stop thief," and clung to him till the officer came up and took him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi>, 247.) On 12th August I was on duty in West Smithfield—I heard a cry of "Stop thief," and ran into Giltspur-street, and saw Kirk holding—the prisoner by the scarf and crying, and his clothes were all dirty, as if he had been dragged in the mud—he gave the prisoner in charge for stealing the basket of linen—the prisoner said he was employed to carry it to No. 7, Newgate-street—that was quite in an opposite direction to where he was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was on Snow-hill, and saw a man with the basket under his arm, and a parcel in his hand; he asked me to carry the basket to 7, Newgate-street, and told me to wait in Giltspur-street while he went to No. 11, Hosier-lane. The boy came and caught hold of me, and when I looked round for the man, he was not to be found.</p>

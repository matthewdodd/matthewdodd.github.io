The prisoner lodged in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181207010061"></xptr> our house, about five or six weeks; he had the articles on the bed, and no one lay in the room but him.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he to pay a week - A. Eighteen pence a week. He took the counterpane off the next bed. He took a counterpane, and the blankets off his own bed. The woman in the court saw him go out with them, between five and six in the morning. She tapped at my window and asked me, whether Jones had paid his way. I said, no. She said, he is gone away. I ran up stairs, and missed the things.</p>
               <p>JANE JONES. I live in Holywell-lane. I saw the prisoner go out of his lodging, in the morning, with a bundle on his arm. I rapped at Mrs. Sheeby's window. I said, has Jones paid his way. She said, no. I said, he is off, with his bundle. She said, he has no bundle. She ran out of her bed, and said, he had robbed her.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM ALLEY. I apprehended the prisoner. I took him to Worship-street office. He confessed before Mr. Mosez, that he had taken the things. He would not give up the duplicates.</p>

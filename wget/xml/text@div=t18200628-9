I cannot say when I put them there - I had not seen them for a fortnight - the drawer was always locked - I found it still locked. The notes were in a canvas bag - four were still left; they were all marked with a B in the corner, and a cross in the middle of the front. The prisoner lived in my house at the time. I let her a bed at 1 s. a week.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. How old are you - A. Seventy-four; the prisoner lived three times at my house; she is a distant relation of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not often visit her at her brother's house, at Hackney - A. No; I went after my money; I never went there to have any kind of intimacy with her.</p>
               <p>Q. How well you understand me; did you not go to see her, and request her to come back to your house - A. No; I never took liberties with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not tell you she was going to leave you, and you gathered some gooseberries for her to take with her - A. Yes. When she was taken before the Magistrate the first time he discharged her; I did not tell him there was but 18 l. in the bag. I will not say I did or did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say to her,</p>
               <p>"There is only you and me in the house, you may as well make one bed as two" - A. Yes, I did say that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Mrs. Jeffries speak to you about taking liberties with the girl in her presence - A. She did not. She was first taken up on Saturday, and again on Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the Magistrate on Saturday that you had found one of the notes at Mrs. Mardon's, which was one of those the prisoner stole - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not afterwards tell the Magistrate that it was not one of the notes - A. It was dark then, and they would not let me take it to the light; it was daylight, but not light enough in the room.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you not swear before the Magistrate, that you believed it was not one of the notes - A. I might have said so.</p>

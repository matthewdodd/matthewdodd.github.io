             sworn. I am foreman to Mr. Rolfe. On the 7th of April last I went to lodge at Mr. Pullinger's house, he lives in Baldwyn's Gardens; he was not in the employ of Mr. Rolfe at that time; some time after that he went to work for Mr. Rolfe, I had property in his cellar, which he gave me leave to put there; I only rented the one pair of stairs room; a little after that he went to work for Rolfe. By going down the cellar I perceived wood there, such as bottoms and thick deals; in consequence of what I heard from the painters at Snow Hill, I perceived them deals belonged to Mr. Rolfe; I had seen them in the cellar before, I looked at them in the building, I found they matched; and seeing them in the building, and from what the painters informed me, I thought it my duty to mention it to Mr. Rolfe, Mr. Rolfe had a search warrant, and then he found them himself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed.</p>
               <p>Q. You being a lodger in this house had the consent of the prisoner to put some articles in the cellar yourself. - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. How many other lodgers in this house. - A. I cannot say, there was a shoemaker in it, I never had any thing to say to them.</p>
               <p>Q. You frequently went down into the cellar. - A. I went down into the cellar when my business called me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner bring these boards into the cellar. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the day of the month when you saw the boards come there. - A. No, I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. You had some little dispute with the prisoner at the same time. - A. None in my life, any more than seeing him not behave himself as he ought, he spoiled some work in the building, and that he ought not to have done, I never had any great dispute<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170077"></xptr>with him in my life.</p>
               <p>THOMAS DURBY sworn. Q. Are you a painter - A. Yes, I work on Snow Hill, on Mr. Rolfe's buildings. On the 3d of September there were some boards lent to the Swan public house, by permission. of Mr. Rolfe, at the fair time; these boards were not carried over from the building to the public house till they had just left their work, the men that had them, they appeared to be running with them instead of walking; in consequence of which I thought they were taking them by stealth; I told the foreman, as he was a stranger to the buildings, I told him to keep a good look out, he had some sharp ones to deal with; I saw the prisoner take some boards from No. 49, Skinner-street, the prisoner was at that time working in Fleet Market. I saw the boards in the cellar, but they did not correspond with what he took at that time.</p>

             sworn. I am an officer. I obtained a search warrant, I went to the prisoner's house, Baldwyn's Gardens, there I found seven boards, two boards appear to have been used; we carried the boards down to the hoard in Fleet Market, there we found some boards had been taken away; we compared them with the hoards that were standing, there were some paper on them all, we compared them with the nail holes and the length, they had been in the ground; it tallied exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there more than one board of that kind. - A. There were two, they both tallied, exactly the depth in the ground and nail holes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rolfe. I was with them when they compared the boards; I have no doubt but they are my father's property.</p>

            ) You are the foreman, look at these boards. - A. They are the fellow boards as come from the fence, there be fifty of the same sort, and Pullinger was at the moving of them for the building of the houses; I do believe upon my oath that they are the boards; the boards were all put in the earth, through the brace as they go along; the nail holes tallied, they all answered exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether all the boards of that hoard belonged to Mr. Rolfe. - A. Yes, they do.</p>

             sworn. I am a carpenter, I know them to be Mr. Rolfe's property by matching them with those that are standing; I was two years foreman to Mr. Rolfe, I was perfectly conversant with Mr. Rolfe's goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the board that they were taken from. - A. Yes, they tallied exactly, not only in the length of the boards, but in the nail holes, and the depth of the ground they were put in, by the colour of the board, and the splash of mud above the ground as well as the mud on the board that was in the earth; I sincerely think that they are part of the hoard, and Mr. Rolfe's property.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of them. - A. Two shillings a piece.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought the boards of a man one evening as I was standing at the door, he had the boards on his shoulder, he said he bought them for scaffolding, he was a plaisterer, he said he wanted some money for his club, or else he should be struck out of the book, he asked me two shillings and six pence a piece, I told him they were not worth that money, I gave him three shillings and six pence for them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and keep a draper's shop at Upper Tulse Hill. On Friday afternoon, 16th May, about 5 o'clock, the female prisoner came and asked for some ribbons—I put a box before her, they were not of the right colour, and I went to get another box—in doing so I upset the former box—I picked up three pieces and the prisoner one piece, and as I was in the act of rising, I saw the prisoner put a piece under her arm, under her shawl—it was peach and white coloured, and was in paper; it had not been opened—my sister, who was on the other side of a glass door, came out and said to the prisoner, "You have a piece of ribbon</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185606160149"></xptr>
               <p>under your shawl"—she caught hold of her shawl—it came off in her hand and was left partly on the counter and partly on a chair—I caught one of her arms, my sister the other, and the ribbon fell from under her arm wrapped up in paper as she had taken it—she knelt down on the floor and implored me to forgive her for the sake of her dear children—I said that I bad been severely robbed since I had been in business, and would not—she knelt on the floor five times and begged forgiveness—I sent for a police<lb></lb>man—I saw a tall man standing in front of a crowd at the shop door—there were children from school there—I should not know him again, being agitated—he stayed there about five minutes—the female prisoner also took up a second piece of ribbon and put it towards her shawl, in the paper, just as my sister laid hold of her, and she then laid it down again in the box—there were two yards of that, and eighteen yards of the first piece, which was worth 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I am the sister of the last witness. I was in the parlour, looking through a glass-door, and saw the female prisoner in the shop—I saw the prisoner pick up a piece of ribbon and lay it down again, and pick up another piece and put it under her arm, in the paper, without opening it, and she was in the act of picking up a second piece—she got it half way to her shawl when my sister looked up, and she put it down again—I came out, caught hold of her arm and said, "You have a piece of ribbon under your arm"—in catching hold of her, I dragged her shawl, and she ran to the door without it; my sister caught her there, as in trying to open the door she shut it—I went to my sister's assistance, and while we held her the ribbon dropped from under her arm; she said, "You have not found it on me"—my sister said, "No, but it has dropped from you"—she then knelt down and asked my sister to forgive her for the sake of her children, for she should lose her character—she knelt down several times—I had hold of her when the ribbon dropped—she had not opened the paper at all.</p>

               <p>she said, "What do I want two policemen with me for? I suppose he is a policeman in plain clothes"—the male prisoner was within two yards of her—I was looking at her in Camberwell-lane, and in a minute I received dreadful blow on the right side of my head, which penetrated to the bone, and I saw the male prisoner run away when the female prisoner found that I did not fall, she stopped and said, "Oh, what a villain he must be is serve you like that! what a brute! I know nothing of him"—I found on her one shilling and a halfpenny.</p>

The prisoner was coming a sharp pace; at the side of the horses he said, stop immediately, d - n your eyes, or I will blow your brains out! I did not see any thing in his hand. I did stop as he desired. I might run perhaps twenty yards. As soon as the carriage stopped I watched his motions; I saw him at the chariot, and saw my fellowservant lay hold of him.</p>

               <p>I am footman to the Marquis of Granby. I was behind the chariot when my lord was coming from the Duke of Rutland's, between nine and ten o'clock. The prisoner came behind the carriage first, then he passed it, and rode up to the coachman. I immediately leaned my head over the carriage, and heard him say three or four times - stop, or I will blow your brains out! When the chariot stopped he went to the window, and said to the Marquis of Granby - deliver your money immediately, or I will blow your brains out. I jumped over the wheels, laid hold of him, and unhorsed him. He said he would blow my brains out. My lord came out of the chariot, and we secured him, put him into a hackney coach, and carried him before a magistrate.</p>

I know not what I might say. I belong to one of his majesty's ships. I did not expect my trial to come on till the afternoon. I was in liquor. I asked his lordship if I had robbed him, or demanded his money. He said no I had not. It was never my intention to do any thing of the kind. The horse I had was my own.</p>

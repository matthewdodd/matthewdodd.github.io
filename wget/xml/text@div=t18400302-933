I lodge in the lower rooms—the landlord does not live in the house—it is in the parish of Christ Church, Middlesex—the prisoner came to the house two or three years ago to work, and worked there a year or two, but he has not worked there the last two years, and had nothing to do with the house—on the 19th of February I was in the wash-house, which is under ground—I had left my room at twenty minutes past seven o'clock in the evening by the time-piece, which is now in Court—every thing in the room was then safe—I returned to my room about half-past eight o'clock—it was then full of smoke, and the carpet was on fire—it was smouldering through to the boards—I cannot tell whether that was done in getting a light to take these things or not—when I left my room I had locked the door, but I cannot swear that I took the key out—I am in the habit of</p>

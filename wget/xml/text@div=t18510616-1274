                  </hi> I am a wine-merchant, of 21, Pudding-lane. In March last the prisoner called on me, and wished to have a sample of champagne—he said he came from Read and Co., of Bath—I believe some samples of champagne were shown him—he requested to have a sample sent to a party in Oxford-street—two or three days afterwards he called again, and purchased three cases, the same as the sample—it came to 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he re<lb></lb>quested me to draw on Read and Co., of Bath, and to send the bill to the place where I sent the sample—he said he was staying in London for a short time—I drew a bill on him, and sent it to the address he gave me; this is it <hi rend="italic">—(this was dated 28th March; drawn by Samuel Hulme Day, and Co., on Read and Co., Bath, for</hi> 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">payable at six months; accepted, Thomas Read, jun.</hi>—I received it back again, accepted as it is now, in this letter, which was part of the envelope—the prisoner afterwards brought this delivery order for the purpose of having the name altered from Reid to Read—I altered it, and we delivered it to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Wilkinson and Stennet, of Botolph-wharf. That is a bonding-wharf—the prisoner came there on a Saturday in March, the 29th, I think, and handed me this delivery-order—I handed it to the head-clerk—on the face of it, it was deliverable to <hi rend="italic">Reid</hi> and Co., but it was indorsed <hi rend="italic">Read</hi> and Co., and the head-clerk told him so—he said he would get it altered—he took it, and left; he returned with it in about 10 minutes, corrected, with the initials "S. H. D." to it—upon that I handed him the warrants, and he gave me this receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw him write it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wine-merchant, of Bath, and am the twin-brother of the prisoner. I am here by subpoena—he was in partnership with me—he left five years ago—since then he has lived with me, and assisted in the counting-house some time—he left to go abroad about a year and a half ago—I do not think he went; I never gave him leave since he left, directly or indirectly, to sign acceptances—I should say this "Read and Co." to this acceptance is my brother's writing, and this note also; but I should say this "Read and Co." on the back of the delivery order is different.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you mean that it looks like your brother's writing, or do you mean to pledge your oath it is his? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From the knowledge I have of his writing, I should say it is his—our partnership was dissolved in 1846 by a deed; he came down again in 1849, and stayed about a year and a half—he came to assist in the business—he did not keep the books altoge<lb></lb>ther, I kept them principally—he was not allowed to give orders; he used to take orders—he did not give orders in my name except I gave him leave—I may have given him leave to give orders, but not to any extent—he was not in the habit of drawing bills, I swear that; not to my knowledge—I would not pledge my oath to it unless I was certain—my business is wholesale and retail—while my brother was with me, he received nothing specific for his services, not as a salary—I appeared as a witness to handwriting against him on two former trials—I came on subpoena then—after those prosecutions had failed, this bill was preferred—I have a partner; his name is Danger: he was sub<lb></lb>poenaed, but is not here—I was asked on the last occasion whether I had a partner.</p>

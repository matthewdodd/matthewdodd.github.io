                  </hi>. I am a partner in the house of William Masterman, and four others, bankers, in Nicholas-lane. The prisoner was in our employ as cashier—his duty, with respect to the specie received, was to debit him<lb></lb>self with it in his money-book, which was the account between us—It was the account of the money-drawer, with which he was entrusted—the cash was to be put into the drawer or till—there are three regular cashiers in the house, who attend the counter—two or three drawers are open at the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183509210155"></xptr>
               <p>same time—there must be some of the cashiers present during the whole of the banking hours—there is always more than one present—the pri<lb></lb>soner made entries also in another book—this is it, (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) it is called a telling-up-book—It is a private book belonging to the prisoner—the prisoner's duty was to count up the money in the till, to see that it agreed with the balance in his money-book—this was done every afternoon after five o'clock—the book was made up to four o'clock on the receipt side, and to five o'clock on the payment side, or I would rather say half-past four o'clock—the money received between four and five o'clock is put down, as for the next day—after he has told up his cash, he should endeavour to agree it with himself, and then hand up the book, which shows whether the amount corresponds, in order to facilitates the general balance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does he communicate to one of the partners every night the result of his balance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not necessarily—It is put on the balance paper from his book—the book is produced sometimes to one, and sometimes to ano<lb></lb>ther, who puts the figures together, to ascertain the balance—according to the prisoner's figures, the balance of cash in his till, on Friday night, the 28th of August, was 1762<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that is the cash he was accountable for, either in the till or that he had in store—It so happened that I looked into the figures with him on the 28th, shout half-past five o'clock, but not into the cash—the telling-up-book and the cash-book were both produced—this entry in the telling-up-book is in the prisoner's writing—he debits himself on the morning of the 28th with cash to the same amount, 1762<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and appears to have received, in the course of the 29th, 624<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he has debited himself with that—the whole amount received that day is 2638<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., being the balance of the 28th and the receipts of the 29th—the payments amount to 1329<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he has taken credit for that—the amount of cash which should have been in his till, or elsewhere under his charge, on the evening the 29th, is 1309<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that is the result of the figures furnished by himself—after five o'clock on the 29th, I sent for him into the private counting-house, and told him I had a very unpleasant duty to perform, but it must be done; that it had been ob<lb></lb>served that his money was large, and it had not been below a certain amount for a considerable time, which gave rise to apprehensions respecting its correctness; that he had neglected to avail himself of some opportuni<lb></lb>ties of going out of town which increased the suspicion, and I must re<lb></lb>quire him to produce his money, and should be exceedingly glad to find it was correct—I did not distinctly hear what he said, but I understood him to say it was short, and I asked the question, "Then it is short?"—he said it was—I asked how much—he said about, or near 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—after a few seconds, I asked him what had become of it—he was going to tell me a story about somebody which I did not wish to hear—he then immediately threw him<lb></lb>self on our mercy—I said I could say nothing to it—I examined his till, and found in the till and drawer under his charge 345<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 0 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. effective money—there was some bad money in one corner—the deficiency was 964<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been cashier at Messrs. Mastermans nearly eleven years. The prisoner's station at the counter was next to me, be<lb></lb>tween me and another—It is the custom to hand bank-notes or cheques to a clerk behind—It was his duty to put cash into his till, and make an entry in his money-book at the time he puts it into the till, but that is omitted sometimes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From your knowledge of business, would it in your judgment be an easy thing for a cashier, instead of putting the money into the till, to put it into his pocket? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Such a thing might be done certainly; even with a cashier on each side of him—they are busily engaged during the day, and might not see an action of that kind—on the 29th of August, I was in attendance nearly the whole day—I presume on that day, that the pri<lb></lb>soner put what cash he received into the till—he was transacting his busi<lb></lb>ness, both receiving and paying—I did not notice any thing particular<lb></lb>it was possible for another person to have access to his till, certainly—I did not observe any thing of the sort take place—he was absent I believe, from about one till half-past two o'clock, but I cannot say exactly—I was there part, or all the time he was absent—I presume his till was locked during that time.</p>

The prisoner was our shopman for about fifteen months, and resided in the house—it was his duty to sell articles, and if he received any money to give it to the clerk at the desk—he was to enter it in his own book, and the clerk signed it for the same amount on the opposite side—I have two bills and receipts in his name—they are both</p>

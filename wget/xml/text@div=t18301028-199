On the 26th of October Mrs. Robinson was at the house in John-street, and from what she said I went up to the drawing-room and examined a bundle of dirty linen of his in the sideboard drawer, and among them was a pair of dirty stockings, a night-cap, towel, and two or three neckerchiefs of mine - I called in a Policeman, and gave the prisoner in charge: he acknowledged the things were mine, and said he had taken some of them five or six months back - he gave the Policeman this key, and in his box at Norfolk-street, were found two collars and a pair of stockings.</p>

               <p>MR. ROBINSON. These are mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you owed him any wages? A. I usually pay my servants every half-year - he drew part of his wages before they were due.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, at any time, owe him wages which was not convenient to pay? A. Certainly; we have given him things, but these are nearly new - he had the care of my plate and things of value; the value of the property in his box was 1s., or 6d. if you please.</p>

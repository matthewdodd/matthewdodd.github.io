               <p>Q. How old was the deceased?</p>
               <p>Robinson. He was about my size, about fourteen years old. This was in a field near <placeName id="t17681207-42-crimeloc235">Paddington</placeName>

The deceased catched seven birds out of nine, that came over a hedge; he catched them with twigs. Williams sent a boy to spoil his twigs; that boy was named Sharp, he was helping the prisoner. Cunningham attempted to push Sharp down the bank: his twigs were upon the bank. Sharp spoiled some of his twigs.</p>
               <p>Q. How big was Sharp?</p>
               <p>Robinson. He was a great deal bigger than me. He began to beat Cunningham with a stick. Cunningham then went and sat down upon Williams's nets, because he should not get any more birds. Williams came and talked with him. The boy would not get off. He talked with him near ten minutes: then he hit him three or four times with a stick, and kicked him.</p>
               <p>Q. How big was the stick?</p>
               <p>Robinson. It was as thick as my thumb.</p>
               <p>Q. On what part did he kick him?</p>
               <p>Robinson. He kicked him on the private parts: he kicked him but once. Then Cunningham came away to us: then he and I came home. He complained very much of his back. I saw no more of him till after he was dead, which was about a week after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any bruises upon him after he was dead?</p>
               <p>Robinson. I saw none, but on his groin; he was very black, and swelled very large.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of Williams, when you went away.</p>
               <p>Robinson. We left him in the field.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain Williams kicked the deceased?</p>
               <p>Robinson. I am very certain he did.</p>

            . I am an apothecary. On the 10th of November, I was sent for by Cunningham's mother. I found the lad in desperate convulsions: I gave him no medicine then. I went again at night and brought him out of the fits. He was the next day in very great pain. All he said was, O my belly! O my belly! not a word how it was done, nor who did it. Upon searching him, I found a rupture: one testicle was swelled, and very black. He died on the 12th of November. I really believe he died of that rupture.</p>

            . I heard the deceased say, the prisoner gave him a stroke or two; but did not hurt him. He said it was Sharp that did it. I heard him complain of his belly. I saw him the next day after he came home, and three or four days after I saw the swelling on his groin, it was exceeding black and very large, and he was in a vast deal of pain: he was then in bed. Sharp's father came to see him, and brought his son. Cunningham knew him, and said it was

            . I am father to the deceased: he told me Williams set Sharp to beat him, and he did beat him; and after that Williams came and beat him with a stick. I asked my boy why he did not tell me sooner? He said Williams kicked him in the groin, and he lay about a quarter of an hour in the grass before he could recover himself. He said Sharp hit him once or twice with a stick.</p>

             hit him with a stick once or twice. I asked him if any body else did? Yes, said he, old Williams hurt me in my groin; and I was afraid to tell my father, lest he should be angry. Sharp came to my son said, God bless you! God bless you! And a little after that, he cryed out, Old Williams! old Williams! Sharp kneeled down and asked my son's pardon.</p>
               <p>Q. to Robinson. Are you sure he did not kick the deceased?</p>
               <p>Robinson. I am certain sure he did not; nor did he offer to lift his foot up to him.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was you to Williams at the time?</p>
               <p>Robinson. I was about an hundred yards from him when he kicked the deceased. I am sure I saw him kick him in the groin. Cunningham came immediately to me, and we went home together. He lay on the grass, and cried murder several times for about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after Sharp beat him was it that he went to William's nets?</p>
               <p>Robinson. About a quarter of an hour after.</p>

               <p>Just before the deceased's death Robinson was sent for: he then, upon oath, said I was not the person that kicked the lad, but it was the other lad with them.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable S</hi> 103.) On the morning of the 16th of August I was in Edgeware-road about seven o'clock—I saw Bull go to the stable of No. 1, Canterbury-villas, with an empty bag under his arm—I saw Sayers come out of the stable, and look round—he saw me, and went round a corner directly—I continued on the watch, and saw Bull come out with something in a bag on his shoulder—I am sure it was empty when he took it in—I asked him what he had got—he said, "Oh, you can look, I have been to feed the nags"—it was two pecks of oats—I said, "I saw you go to No. 1, Canterbury-villas, and you came out with this"—he then said, "Yes, I have been to borrow it of the coachman"—I took him to the station-house, and went to the stable, where I saw Sayers—I told him he was in my custody for taking oats, which Bull had carried away—he said he had taken none away that morning—he afterwards said a man had been to leave half a bushel of corn, which Bull had called for—I have brought a sample of the oats from the bin in the stable, and they correspond with what Bull was carrying.</p>

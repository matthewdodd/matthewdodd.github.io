About seven o'clock in the evening of the 25th of April I saw the prisoner near the shop; he looked in, and I suspected him. I went to the back of the shop, and saw him take this umbrella from another, to which it was attached by a bit of string, and hung in the window; I saw him put it down, look round, and then take it away; I ran out, and the constable, who had been watching him, had just stopped him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ADOLPHUS, JUN. Q. These were in the window, for people to look at, and to handle? A. Yes, but he took it off the hook; I saw him in custody in two or three minutes - he appeared to be in liquor. The place is much frequented - he might have been seen by twenty or thirty other persons. It has Mr. Moore's name inside - he did it quite openly, as a man takes his own umbrella.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is it an usual course of dealing for people to ask the price, or to walk off without asking? A. They generally ask the price.</p>

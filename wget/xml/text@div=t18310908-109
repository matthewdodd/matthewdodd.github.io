On the 11th of July, about twelve o'clock, I saw my watch hanging in the cupboard by the fire-side; I then went out about the door, with my son's baby, leaving the room door open - I returned in about half an hour, but did not miss the watch till about four o'clock, not having occasion to look for it; it was worth about 5l. altogether - I believe the two seals were gold, and the chain; I am not a judge of the value -I saw the prisoner in charge with it at the Mansion-house on the 19th: the key was then gone.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Spinks, a pawnbroker, of Gracechurch-street. On the 12th of July, about ten o'clock in the morning, the prisoner pawned this silver watch, with two seals and a chain, for 4l. - I received information three days afterwards that it was stolen; I went to Bow-street, and was told to stop the party if any application was made for it - I met the prisoner in Cornhill as I went home, and gave him in charge; I understood him to say he had had it from a captain, merely out of a frolic, and he knew nothing about stealing it, that the person's name was Germain, and he had gone into the country; he told the Lord Mayor he was gone to Ipswich, and he was remanded to bring the person forward, but he never came.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Did the prisoner frequent your shop? A. I never saw him before; I know him by his being lame in his right hand and foot - I saw him among a number of persons, at a fire in Cornhill.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

Bugg gave the prisoner into my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080059"></xptr>charge, in Cornhill; I told him the gentleman charged him with felony - he immediately said, "I suppose it is for a watch?" I said I believed it was - he said, "I have made that all right, it is only a joke; I have sent to Mr. Germain to set it right;" I went to his lodging, and found a letter addressed to Germain, who lodged, at the public-house where the prisoner did; I have been there several times, but he has never appeared.</p>

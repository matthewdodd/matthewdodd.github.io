                  </hi>. I live at Finchley and am a clerk in the Bank of England—on Sunday morning, 1st November, between 12 and 1 o'clock, I was in St. Paul's Road, Highbury, going to a friend's house in Dalston—I met the three prisoners there—at that time I had a parcel in my hand—the prisoners stopped me as I was running along by pushing up against me—I am sure Rust was one of them and I think Booth was the next man to him—when they pushed against me I turned and wanted to know what they meant by it—they commenced insulting me and asked if I wanted to fight—I told them I should be very happy to knock them down if they wished it, and after a few more words I crossed over to the' cabman and asked him if he would hold my parcel for me—the cabman refused and I went back to where the prisoners were on the pavement—Rust was taking off his coat and Booth and Coomb pushed me-about and then I received a blow in the chest, I believe from Booth as he was nearest to me—it sent me into the road—I went back on to the pavement again and they asked me jeeringly to go home—I turned to go home and they all! ran up St. Paul's Road towards Islington—I felt in my pocket to see if' my watch was there and found it was gone—I ran after the prisoners—I believe I called out "Stop you villains" or something of that sort—I over-took Booth—he had not gone more than 20 or 30 yards—I threw him down and I saw the cabman driving after the others—they were brought back shortly after by the cabman and a policeman to where I was with Booth—Booth said if I would let him get up and not strangle him he could tell me all about it—that was before the others were brought back—when they came back Booth said that the watch was in the garden, he had thrown it away in the garden—after that I went to the station and charged them there—I saw my watch on the following Monday at the Police Court in the hands of the police—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it.</p>

This was between Saturday night and Sunday morning, a few minutes past 12 o'clock—I was going to my friend's house to sleep—I said I should be happy to knock them down—I am not given to that kind of thing—I dare say if you came and pushed against me 1 should knock you down—Rust commenced to take off his coat—I believe that was what prompted me to say I should be very happy to knock them down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cabman—early on the morning of Sunday, 1st November, I was walking home—I saw Mr. Came and the three prisoners—they were all on the pavement close together having words and were talking about fighting, and Booth struck Mr. Carne and drove him into the road—Mr. Carne came to me and asked me to hold his parcel—at that time Rust was taking his, coat off—I declined to hold the parcel and Mr. Carne went back to them—they were telling him to go home after that—he turned to go home and then the three prisoners ran in the opposite direction—he turned immediately and said "Stop you scoundrels," and ran after them—I jumped on to a cab and went after them—another cabman drove and I rode by the side of him—I saw Mr. Came take Booth and drove after the other two—I took Rust first—Rust and Coomb were together and the policeman took Coomb—we took them back to where Mr. Came and Booth were—I heard Rust, say to Booth "You know all about the watch, why don't you say where it is, we don't want to get into trouble, if you tell the gentleman we could go back and find the watch?—Booth said "I know where the watch is," and after that he said be believed he could find it again.</p>

            . What have you to, say about this Firkin?</p>
               <p>Hudson. This Firkin I found in Smith-field, my Master served them with Small beer .</p>
               <p>Q. What is the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Hudson. He sells Small beer, his Wife sells it out again, and he had a Cask of my Master's that holds eighteen Gallons, and he lent me this in the Place of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I will not believe him, I lent him none.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the Firkin at the Bull-head ?</p>
               <p>Hudson . Yes, my Lord, it is there now with Prosser's Drayman.</p>

               <p>Hudson. He lent it me for my Master's Use.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask that Man whether I lent him the Cask.</p>
               <p>Hudson. My Lord, I cannot tell whether it was his Wife or him, for they were both at Home, I might not mind it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Yes, my Lord, he must mind it, for he was in the Room.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prisoner. What have you to say for yourself?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please you, my Lord, if you will please to hear me, Gentlemen, I will tell you the Truth, and nothing but the Truth; we were coming Home from Temple Bar, and we picked up this Cask coming along at Charing-Cross ; we were laying down six Buts of Beer, and between Charing-Cross and Temple-Bar I picked this Firkin up, I throwed it upon the Dray and carried it Home for a whole Week, and could not make any thing of it, and this Man went into the House; I was not in the House when he took the Cask away. I told my Wife not to let the Cask go, for I would find it out.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any Witnesses?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I have got a Woman here somewhere .</p>

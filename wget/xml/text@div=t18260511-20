On Monday, the 25th of April, about eight o'clock at night, or rather later, I was writing at the further end of the shop - it was dark - I had not closed the shop; my young man alarmed me; I put my hat on, walked across the street, and observed the two prisoners walking close together - they stopped exactly opposite my window, on my side of the way; Tipper immediately put his hand into the window, which was cracked, and a piece of glass had been knocked out a few minutes before, when I crossed the road - he put his hand through the broken pane and took out part of three silk handkerchiefs - they were all three in one piece - he got them partly out - part of each might be out; I immediately crossed over and laid hold of him; Langley was standing close by his side, as if covering him; I immediately turned round, and took them both into the shop; Tipper was pulling the handkerchiefs out when I laid of hold him; the whole piece had been quite removed some inches from where it lay, but he had not got it all through the hole; I seized him with them in his hand, and sent for an officer - they are worth 20s. - my shop is part of the dwelling-house.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Aberdein. On the 25th of April, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was behind the counter, close by the window, and heard the glass fall from the window - the pane had been cracked before but was not broken - there was no hole at all - I immediately looked at the window, saw the glass had been pushed in, but saw nobody near it - it had been mended with putty before; I informed Mr. Aberdein - I saw the handkerchiefs there half an hour before, a few inches from the window - they could not be reached without a hand being put through the pane; I think be must have put his whole hand through to get them.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for about a quarter past eight - it was quite dark; I found the prisoners in the shop, and took them with the property - Tipper said the other had nothing to do with it.</p>
               <p>MR. ABERDEIN. I had placed the handkerchiefs in the window myself, about two inches from the pane - it was impossible to get at them without a hand coming through the glass.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>LANGLEY's Defence. I had just left my aunt's, and was going to my cousin's - I left my aunt at the corner of a turning, stopped to look at these handkerchiefs; in two or three minutes the gentleman came over, and laid hold of this youngster - I looked at him, he laid hold of me, and asked if I was one.</p>

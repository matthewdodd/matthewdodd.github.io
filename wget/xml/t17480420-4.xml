               <p>Q. I suppose you was willing to go along with them?</p>
               <p>Davies. I suppose I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go then?</p>
               <p>Davies. I went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. What into a bedchamber.</p>
               <p>Davies. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay?</p>
               <p>Davies. About half an hour, or less.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you stay with both?</p>
               <p>Davies. No, one was sent for immediately, and Atkins would have me come to know where she lived, that I might come to see her another time; she said she was in hast, and we went into Rosemary-Lane; then I went to another house with her.</p>
               <p>Q. So you went into another house with her?</p>
               <p>Davies. I don't know whether I was in the house or in the alley, but they carried me up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you walk up stairs, or did they carry you?</p>
               <p>Q. No: I went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you had a mind to go?</p>
               <p>Davies. I believe I had; this woman Scott, brought up the liquor, and another old woman came into the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she stay?</p>
               <p>Davies. No, she hardly came into the room, and I was to be concerned with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose any thing?</p>
               <p>Davies. I had a guinea in gold, and five shillings in silver, and they were for getting into my breeches-pocket as fast as they could.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them?</p>
               <p>Davies. I can't tell which; the candle went out, and I went down stairs, and I could not find my way out, and the old woman lighted me out.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you lose?</p>
               <p>Davies. I lost two handkerchiefs, a guinea, and a crown.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of the Prisoners took them?</p>
               <p>Davies. Either of the two, I can't tell which.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that all you had?</p>
               <p>Davies. I had twenty nine shillings and four pence halfpeny.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they both in the room when you lost your money?</p>
               <p>Davies. I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lie down in any house?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lie down in the first house?</p>
               <p>Davies. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put your hand in your pocket when you came out of the first house?</p>
               <p>Davies. I don't know?</p>
               <p>Prisoner Scott. I have nothing to say. I am a hard working woman.</p>
               <p>Pris. Atkins. I was going to my mother's, and the young woman was going home; Mr. Davies asked me where I was going, and I said, I was going towards Tower-Hill, and he was very much in liquor, and asked me to go into a house on Tower-Hill; I told him, I did not know any house of that kind, for I am not used to any such thing, and he pulled and hauled me into the house, and forced me to go up stairs, and threw me down upon the bed by main force.</p>

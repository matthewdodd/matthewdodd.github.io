                  </hi>. I am a sawyer, and live in Turner's-place, near the City saw-mills. On the evening of the 23rd of March I went out with a friend to buy a hat, we then met with some loose characters and they got into conversation—I think there were three ladies—I treated them to some gin and cloves—we went to three public-houses—I do not know the sign of the last, but it was near the turnpike—I came out and accompanied the prisoner whom I had become acquainted with at the second public-house, and he had gone with us to the last public-house—I went with him to the end of Henrietta-street, where he asked me to lend him half-a-crown—I would not—he then asked me to lend him half-a-crown on his watch—I was hesitating about it and he snatched the half-crown from my hand as I was about to return it to my pocket—he then knocked me down—the officer came and found me bleeding.</p>

PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You remember all this very accurately? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I was not quite sober—the first public-house I was at that night was in Old-street, I went in there with a friend, a female, whom I had seen at the play one evening before, and I met her again that night, by chance, about nine o'clock; we went and had a quarter of gin between us—I accompanied her home to Henrietta-street, we had nothing to drink there—she went back with me to the public-house and I parted with her outside—it was then about half-past eleven o'clock—about twelve o'clock I was going home and met with another female—I went with her to the Britannia public-house, we had a quartern of gin there—two other girls were there who knew the girl I was with, and we all went over to the other side of the way to another public-house—I <hi rend="italic">stood</hi> another quartern of gin there—I then went outside and the prisoner came up, he was a stranger to me, but he appeared to know the girls—they spoke to<lb></lb>gether—we then all went to the Three Crowns public-house, at the corner of East-road—we there had half-a-pint of gin and cloves, nothing more, and then the females left—I had not pulled them about—they did not call me a monster and say they would have nothing to do with me—I did not give the prisoner a thump—I did not touch him—I did not say to him, "Halloo, old fellow, have you not got any further?"—he did not advise me to go home to bed—he did not say if I would lend him half-a-crown till to-morrow he would be obliged to me—he mentioned that he was a shopmate</p>

               <p>or I should not have kept company with him—he did lay if I would lend him half-a-crown he would pawn hit watch in the morning and pay me—I saw the watch in his hand, which induced me to pull out my half-crown—I did not snatch at his watch.</p>

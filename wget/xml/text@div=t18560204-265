                  </hi>. I am a widow, living at No. 17, Thrawl-street, Spital<lb></lb>fields, the prisoner lodges in the same house. On 2nd Jan. I was in the kitchen with him, and other persons, I think he had been drinking a little, he appeared to know what he was'about—he was making use of most vile expressions—I begged him not to do so, and he called me violent names—I said that if I was a man I would push him out, or kick him out of doors for using such language—he continued to call me names, and went towards the door with a plate in his hand, and a piece of bread and cheese in the other hand, calling me names—I put my hand on him, and pushed him to the door, and he struck me with the plate, but it did not cut me—he then said that he would cut my b——throat, put his hand into his pocket, took out a knife, and cut me across the arm—I screamed, and he put his left hand on my shoulder struggling to cut my throat—I put my arm up to save my throat and my arm was cut, my head then dropped and I cut my nose on the knife—some people came to my help, and I said to a young man, "Look what this old brute has done"—he ran for a policeman, and the prisoner went up the street—I followed him, and he threw the knife away—he said that he had thrown the b——knife away, and the b——s could not find it, but he would cut my b——throat—a policeman came and took him into custody, and I was taken to the London Hospital <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> If she would only state the truth, her hands and arms were</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cripple, and get my living by singing in the street—I lodge in this house, and was in the kitchen when the prisoner came in—he had a plate of sprats in one hand, and half a quartern loaf in the other—he said, "Where is the b——fryingpan?" nobody made him any answer—the prosecutrix was sitting smoking a pipe by the fire, and he said, "Come out of the way, you old w——"—a party said that he ought to have his nose pulled for making use of such an expression to an old woman—he used very bad language, and the old lady got up and gave him a <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> towards the door—he hit her on the head with the plate, saying, "You old <hi rend="italic">cow</hi>, I will do you a kindness," and pulled out a knife, and cut her on the left arm—he found that that did not make her let go of him—she put up her left arm to save her face, and he cut her nose—she fell back, and he went away quickly up the street—I crossed the street and heard something drop, about the middle of the street—I did not lose sight of the prisoner, but gave him in charge, and went back with a policeman to where I heard something drop, and found a knife—the prosecutrix had not scratched him before he used the knife, she merely laid hold of him by the collar—when he struck her on the head with the plate it broke all to pieces.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the dressers at the London Hospital—the prosecutrix was brought there with an incised wound on her left arm, three inches long, and an inch deep, not quite down to the bone—on the right wrist there was a wound about an inch long, and quarter of an inch deep, and there was a slight cut across the nose—the wound had been inflicted with some violence with a knife.</p>

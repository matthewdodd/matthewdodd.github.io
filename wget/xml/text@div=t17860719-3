               <p>I am a fruiterer opposite the Mansion-house; on Friday last the two prisoners came into my shop and asked me if I would buy any melons, I said, yes; they asked me eighteen pence for one; the value of this melon if ripe, and fit for sale is fifteen shillings, that occasioned me to have some suspicions; I had not a doubt whose melons they were, for I knew the growth of the prosecutor's melons, and he spoke to me in the morning; I told them to fetch the rest; when they came back, I asked them where t hey got them; they said, from one Mr. Smith of Islington, that a hog had routed them out, and they were to sell them for two shillings a-piece; I knew Mr. Smith, and that he was not a melon grower, he is a florist; I took them into custody, and before the Magistrate they said, Mr. Smith lived at Kingsland, and the third day they said, they met Mr. Smith in town.</p>
               <p>What may be the value of the three? - About twelve shillings I should imagine, but it is impossible to ascertain a value, in the state they are, because they are utterly unfit to sell; no man that grew them would cut them, nor any fruiterer buy them.</p>
               <p>Prisoners. We have no witnesses; Mr. Smith gave us these melons to sell; he asked us first to buy them; he told us he lived at Islington, nobody would go after him.</p>

                  </hi>. On Wednesday, the 21st of Dec., at a quarter after one o'clock in the morning, I was coming over Westminster-bridge, and felt unwell, and sat down on the middle recess—I heard three or four men on the opposite side—one said to the other, "Go over and see what that man is"—the prisoner was one of them I am certain—I do not know who spoke—the prisoner immediately came over, and was going to put his foot over on the footpath—I said, "You need not come, old fellow, I am not asleep"—he immediately came up, caught me by the collar of my coat, and thrust me against the wall—he was alone—he knocked me down against the wall, and took my handkerchief from my hand—he ripped the button off my coat, which was buttoned, in an attempt to pick my pocket—he thrust my coat open, and put his hand towards my breeches pocket, which was buttoned—he tried to unbutton it, I am quite sure, but he did not—I had 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it—directly he tried to do that, I got up, and in the scuffle I managed to get the handkerchief out of his hand—I saw a policeman's shiney hat down below</p>

               <p>—I thought if I hallooed out the prisoner would escape—I did not call out, but went quietly from the place to the policeman—the prisoner walked over the way, and joined the other men—I did not follow, but went quietly down to the policeman at the bottom of the bridge—I told him what had occurred—he came up with me directly, and asked me to show him the man—I showed him all the men sitting down together—I pointed out the prisoner to him, and he took him up—when he struck me he struck me against the wall violently with his fist, and had me by the coat—it was a blow.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. About a quarter after one o'clock, in consequence of what Rodway said I went back with him to the recess, where the prisoner was still sitting, with three or four in his company—I had not seen him there before—the prosecutor gave him in charge, and gave me a cotton handkerchief—this is it—it is worth 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.

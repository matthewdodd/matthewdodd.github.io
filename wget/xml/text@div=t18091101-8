               <p>Q. When - A. I do not exactly recollect the day of the month.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the 15th or somewhere thereabouts - A. I believe it was. I saw this man with his head and shoulders out of the flap of a cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a cellar that is closed with a flap - A. Yes; he had his head and shoulders out of the cellar, and with three bottles of wine down on the flap. There was a large flap that lies down and a small one that lifts up to let light in; this small one he was coming out of; the large flap is to let the beer down, and the small one is to let the light in, it is against the house.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the head and shoulders of a man out of this flap - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Whose house was it - A. Mr. Mahony's, the Cock, in Tottenham-court-road.</p>
               <p>Q. That is his dwelling house is it - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This cellar is a part of the dwelling house - A. Yes. I immediately laid hold of the man, he made a spring and got out of my hands. He was in the cellar when I laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the three bottles of wine - A. I picked up two and carried them with me, I left the third there; I pursued; I was never more than five yards behind him, I never lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards secure him - A. Yes, by the assistance of the watchmen in Percy-street, their names are Smith and Sykes. Upon that we returned to Mr. Mahony's with the prisoner and found the other bottle that I had left on the flap; he had opened that small flap; it is about eighteen inches wide.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned you found one bottle standing as it was when you had left it - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You delivered that wine I suppose to Mr. Baker - A. Yes, he is here, he is a watchman.</p>
               <p>COURT. If a man got in did you observe enough to know if the flap would close after him - A. Yes, it would.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing he had opened the flap and had got in whether it is necessary to do any thing to raise the flap in order to come out - A. He must raise it again, for when he was in it naturally would fall down.</p>
               <p>Q. He must have fastened it after he went in, and then open it to come out again - A. He must so; I saw no more than his head and shoulders.</p>
               <p>Q.When he came out that flap was kept up by his head and shoulders - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a flap was it - when it fell down did it lock itself into any thing - A. No; there is a bolt inside to bolt it; it falls on the large flap where the foot passengers pass, there is no grove at all to receive it.</p>

I got up as soon as I could and saw him taken.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not see whether the cellar was secured that night by bolts - A. No. There is a large flap that lets the beer down; the little flap falls down upon the large flap and is fastened by two bolts the same flap is used for the purpose of letting air into the cellar; I cannot say whether it was fastened that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the wine that was produced to you your wine - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that wine in your bin on the over night - A. Yes; I generally look over the wine bin every night; I had looked over the wine bin that night.</p>
               <p>Q. It must have been removed from the place where it originally was left to be upon this flap where Irrons found it - A. I suppose so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss that quantity of bottles from the bin - A. Yes. As soon as I was alarmed I came down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity had been removed from your bin - A. I missed eight bottles, I found three.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the others - A. That I cannot tell. This wine had been four years in the cellar, I never took any out of that bin.</p>
               <p>Q. There were three found - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the other five you did not find about the cellar - A. No; they must have been conveyed off.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there sufficient circumstances about these bottles for you to know them to be yours - A. Yes; there is a passage over this cellar where there was a rat hole, the wet came down; I stopped that rat hole; the dirt was dry on the bottles, I believe the bottles came out of that bin. The cellar door that parts the wine cellar from the beer cellar was broken open, it was locked before; I locked that door myself that night; he must have been concealed in the porter cellar to have broken into the wine cellar; he must have broken the door to get in there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Reynolds. What time did you go to bed - A. At half past twelve. I was the last person up in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. You went into all your cellars that night, did not you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was dark and you had a candle with you - A. Of course it is dark at twelve o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. When you awaked in the morning you found this inner cellar door open - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A person that entered into your wine cellar must have broken the door open on that side - A. He must be in the beer cellar, and have broken the door open to get into the wine cellar.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Saturday night I had received my wages, I stopped a little at my pay-table; it was about half past twelve o'clock at night when I had done settling for my labour in the house; I was very much in liquor, I did not know rightly which was my best way to go home; I was walking about, I did not know where I went to.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a drover, and live at Dalston. I have been in the habit of driving cattle for Mr. Pickett for seven or eight years—on Friday, 19th March, I took ten cows to Smithfield for him—he went there with me himself—there were nine milch cows and one brown cow—Mr. Pickett remained till near 3 o'clock; he then left roe—the price that was fixed on for the brown cow, or heifer, was 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the others were to average about 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—I saw the prisoner in the course of the day—he made a bidding for three of the cows, but the red cow was not one of them—</p>

               <p>I refused his bidding; I did not sell him any cow that day—I did not receive any money from him—I did not enter into any bargain for the tale of a cow with him—about 4 o'clock, I sold one of the cows, and went into the Bull, public-house in St. John-street, to receive the money for it—I had driven the cattle out of the market, and the cows were all safe when I went into the Bull, which is, perhaps, 100 or 120 yards from Smithfield—I left Cun<lb></lb>ningham, the drover, in charge of the cows—when I came out of the Boil, the cows were standing in front of the door, and we drove up St. John-street—the officer would not let them stand any longer—they were driven up Sutton-street, to be milked there; and after that, they were driven to Ayles<lb></lb>bury-street—after they got to the bottom of Aylesbury-street, I counted them, and the red cow was missing—the drover was then pone—I went back to Mr. Curry's, at whose place the cows had been milked, and made a com<lb></lb>munication to him—I saw the red row again on the Monday following at Mr. Amos's shed, at Stepney; it was the same I bad missed.</p>

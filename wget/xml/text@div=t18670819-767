                  </hi> I am a letter-carrier of the West Central Dis<lb></lb>trict—on 6th July last I was on duty in Russell Square between half-past two and three o'clock—I was passing from the railings of one house and preparing to deliver the next letter—I saw three men—I heard one say, "Here comes a postman"—all three then ran and pushed me against the railings—I expostulated, and Petty struck me a violent blow in the mouth, causing it to bleed—Press pushed up against me before I was struck—the inspector came and took my letters and I followed Petty—all three ran into a public-house and joined another man whom I had not seen before—I said I was determined to have Petty and Press for pushing me about—they threatened to rip my b----guts open, and ran through Queen Square into another street, where I met a policeman, who took Petty into custody—I was followed by Mr. Weaver.</p>

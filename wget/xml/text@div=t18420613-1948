                  </hi>. I am a pot-boy, and live in George-street. St. Giles. On the 2nd of June, about half-past five o'clock in the afternoon, I called at Bainbridge-street to see a friend—I saw the prisoner there—I asked her if George was at home, meaning the person she lived with—she said no—we had something to drink—I then went out by myself, for two boon and a half or three hours—I then returned there, as I wished to see George—I saw the prisoner again—she asked if my watch was safe—I said it was—she said it would be better for me to give it up to her, to give to the land<lb></lb>lady to take care of—I said I was quite capable of taking care of it myself—she would insist on taking it, and took it out of my pocket, took the guard off my neck, and the silk handkerchief out of my cap, and went out—I had had a little to drink, but I knew what I was about, and was capable of taking care of myself—she returned to the room in two or three minutes, and I asked if she had left my watch with the landlady—she said, "Yes," and I was satisfied—she then went out—I asked if she was going for George—she said, "Yes," but, instead of that, she fastened me in the room, and left word not to let me out—I afterwards gave her into custody—my watch and handkerchief have not been found.</p>

                  </hi>. I was staying with a person in the next room at this house—the prisoner showed me a handkerchief the same evening—I heard her tell the prosecutor that she would take the watch round to Mrs. Sparrow, the landlady—the prisoner was drunk, and I called out, "Don't take the watch to Mrs. Sparrow"—she and the prosecutor had been together, and drinking—they passed as brother and sister—I told her she had better leave the watch with Ann—that was the person I was staying with.</p>

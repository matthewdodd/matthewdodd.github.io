On Tuesday, the 13th of January, I had been at Westminster Hall, attending a cause, and dined with the witnesses - we had four bottles of wine among six of us. I was sober enough to go to the office and make some entries. I left about seven o'clock, and had a 20 l., and a 10 l. Bank note, and a cheque for 5 l. in my pocket-book - I had received the 20 l. note from Mr. Tomlinson, on the Friday previous.

I got home about one. The only recollection I have after being knocked down, was telling the watchman that I was robbed, for I felt my pocketbook gone some time after; it had been in my inside coat pocket - it could not have fallen out when I fell. On the Thursday it was brought to me by Hawkins, with the cheque and memorandums in it, but the notes were gone.</p>

On the 13th of January, I remember a man and woman coming to the house, and about half-past twelve o'clock that night, I found a red pocket-book on the bed, and gave it to my mistress without opening it. The prisoner was in the house on that night with a gentleman, but I do not think that it was the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>ANN HAWKINS. I keep this house. I did not see the persons who came. Harrold brought me a pocket-book; I opened it, and found a cheque for 5 l., and some memorandums in it, but no Bank notes.

            . I am Leonard's brother. On the 14th of January, the prisoner came and asked me to go with her to the Minories to get change for a 20 l. note, and said if I would go with her she would buy me some things, and if they asked any questions, I was to say I was her son, and that I had received the note as my own money. One Phillips was to go with us to pass as her sister, and my aunt. I had known the prisoner for years, and thought she had received the money from her husband, who is a seaman. I went with them to a sale shop in the Minories - she asked for some clothes, which were fitted to me. She took the note from her bosom, and told me to get change for it; I handed it to the shopman. She bought a pelisse for herself - the shopman went out, and returned in half an hour with the change, and handed the prisoner 15 l. 8 s. 6 d.; she put it into her bosom. I heard her say the day after that she took the money from a gentleman's shop in George-street.</p>

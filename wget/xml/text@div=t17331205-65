Accordingly last Tuesday, by her Directions, I took Mr. Burly and Mr. Froud with me, and went to an Alehouse in Little St. Martin's-Street, by Leicester-Fields; we sent the Girl at the Alehouse to the Prisoner's Lodgings, under pretence of enquiring for a Pot, to see if they were at home. The Girl brought us Word they were. I sent Burly and Froud up Stairs, placed another to watch at the Door, and went my self into the Yard, to see if any Moulds should be thrown out at Window. But believing they were taken by the Noise I heard above, I ran up. We ty'd them, and then begun to search; the first thing I took Notice of, was a bad Six-pence, some Chalk, and Brush lying in the Window, for we found no bad Money upon their Persons; Looking towards the Fire-side, I saw a little Trunk. I ask'd the Prisoner, Knight, What was in it? He said, he could not tell. I drew the Nails and open'd it, and found these pair of Chalk-Molds, which have the Impression of a Six-pence, the Head on one side, and the Reverse on the other: This Paper, in which were these Six-pences nfinish'd, not so much as the Tops being cut off : This little Box with these 18 bad Shilings in: it This Bag, with about 40 bad Shillings, and Six-pences, 3 bad half Crowns, and some Pieces of Metal; all these, and this Crucible, which is to melt Metal in, were found in this Trunk - Upon searching Knight farther, there was found in his Pocket this Key, which upon Trial open'd this Trunk.</p>
               <p>Knight. That is the Key of the Trunk where my Linen is.</p>

            . I have known the Prisoners eight Years, but never was concern'd with them till July last was 12 Month, when one Sunday, Elizabeth came to my Lodging, and ask'd me to go out with her next Day, but said nothing upon what Account. I agreed, she came on Monday, between 2 and 3 in the Afternoon. We went out together. Crossing Lincoln's- inn -fields, she gave me 6 d. (I thought it was a good one) to buy some Gingerbread; the Man said it was not. I told her of it; she curs'd me for a Fool ; gave me another to fetch a Pennyworth of Silk; I pass'd it, and brought her the Change. You Fool you, says she, you may do this as well as my Daughter Molly, if you'll give your Mind to it, and you shall have half what you get. After this I put off several in the same Manner, and we always shar'd whatever Goods I bought, and the Change out of the bad Money. They then lodg'd at Mrs. Mason's, a Chandler, against the Chequer Alehouse in <placeName id="t17331205-65-crimeloc292">King's-street</placeName>

Her Daughter, Mary, at the same Time cut off the Tails with a Pair of Scissars, scrap'd the Edges round with a Knife, and then fil'd them. After this, the Mother went to Ireland, and left me and her Daughter Mary, and

             (her Daughter by another Husband;) I was taken up for passing a bad Six-pence in Lombard-street, and this Day 12 Month I was brought to have a Detainer till next Sessions, Mr. North being ill, I was sent from hence to the Compter, and at next Sessions was try'd and acquitted; but I was ruin'd by being 7 Weeks in Confinement: I was big with Child, and forc'd to sell my Bed, and they all kept from me under this Misfortune, and would not so much as send me any Thing for my Relief. I said to my self, If ever I find 'em in the Kingdom, I'll give the King an Account; and 3 or 4 Months ago I was inform'd they were come to London. The Mother sent for me, in the Name of a Gentleman, to come to Mr. Garvey's, at the Bull-head in Prince's-street; when I came to her, she said she was sorry to hear of my Trouble. About 5 Weeks ago I inform'd Mr. Ashton of this, and about a Month ago I told Mr. North, and Mr. North assur'd me there was no Reward to be given in such Cases. I made it my Business to enquire out their Lodging, and having found it, I sent Word to Mr. North last Tuesday, and he came and took them.</p>
               <p>Mr. North. On Alice Dearing's Information I took the Prisoners; and besides the Things I mentioned in the last Trial, I found this Pair of Scissors and these two Files in their Room.</p>

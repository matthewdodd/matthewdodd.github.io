James Carter &amp; Co., seed merchants, of High Holborn—we have a nursery ground at Perry Hill, Sydenham, and stables at Whetstone Park, Lincoln's Inn, for the horses—we have one or two horses at Perry Hill—it is the practice to load up at stated periods the dung in London and take it down to Perry Hill—it is generally loaded up the night before and the cart starts early in the morning—Pitches was a carman—Hatcher had been porter and had been discharged about fourteen days before the 3rd February—we missed large quantities of corn and in consequence of that communicated with the police at Lewisham, and also previously to that we had made a purchase from our corn merchants of a peculiar mixture, made up specially under my directions—we purchased 9 1/2 quarters of Russian oats and had it mixed with 4 bushels of Swedish barley; it was very unusual; I did not see the mixture made; it was the corn in use at Whetstone Park previously to the 3rd February—it was the habit to take down two sacks of corn at stated periods only for the horses at Perry Hill—it was simply the duty of the men to take down the corn to Perry Hill and leave it with the foreman of the nursery—they had no authority whatever to dispose of it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer P</hi>). I was directed to make enquires with reference to the prosecutors' corn—on Thursday night the 3rd Feb<lb></lb>ruary, I came to London and went to Whetstone Park, behind Linclon's Inn Fields upon the prosecutors' premises—I saw a van with four wheels, laden with three sacks of oats in the front part and with dung in the remainder—I marked the centre sack with a cross—I examined the contents of all three—the first one outside I opened and put in some pieces of a railway time card, which I cut up—the middle one I opened and found this piece of I; stick in it I took that out and put a pencil mark on it and put it back again, f and then put some pieces of brown leaether in it—the outer one I also put some pieces of time card in it—I went back to Lewisham, and communicated with sergeant Eldred—next morning I watched for the appearence of the van and caughtsight of it at about 10.20. a.m.,—it came from Lewisham pitches-station—Pitches and Hatcher were walking on the kerb talking together—Eldred came in just as they passed the door and I went out and followed them and the van—I saw them turn round and draw up to the George stables—from Lewisham Station to the George is about 300 or 400 yards, from the George to the Catford Bridge Railway Station is about the same distance, and the distance to the nursery is a mile and a quarter—when I saw them turn to the George stables I at once turned back to Ladywell, where I saw sergeant Eldred; then to Catford Bridge to avoid going down the main road—I stood on the bridge and saw the wagon come round to the Board of Works office where it stopped—I then got out of the way as the van passed me towards the nusery—Pitches and Hatcher were riding in it then I waited until they had been in the nursery a little time and then went in and spoke to Pitches and asked him how many sacks of oats he had brought, he said <hi rend="italic">two</hi>—I said I should charge him with stealing a sack of oats, and he turned pale and said nothing—the other man was sweeping out the van at the time I examined the bin at the place and saw some corn the same as the sample—I saw two of the three sacks I marked, not a third one—I found the pieces of card in the fodder, and several days afterwards I found my time card in the bin of fodder—I came away from Perry Hill to the George stables and got there about 2 o'clock in the afternoon—I saw Harris and Drake talking together by the horse trough as sergeant and I were walk<lb></lb>ing up from Russia Green—I kept on the same side of the road as the George while the sergeant went on the other—I told Drake I should take him into custody for receiving a sack of oats—he said he had not received any, I said have you bought any, he said no, and I took him in charge—I re<lb></lb>mained there until Eldred came—I found in the corner of the stable the middle sack I had found in Whetstone Park the night before—and the pieces of brown leather—the sack was marked as I had marked it—there was about a bushel in the stable of the mixture—at the station I told Drake I had found the sack of oats, and he made no reply—I have known him about two years and a half—three years and Harris five or six years</p>

               <p>they were at one time at Southend together—they both came to the George about two years and a half ago—the stable is a seperate occupation to the public-house—while standing at the stable door waiting for sergeant to come back I asked Harris for the keys of two coach-houses, and we had to take them out of his pocket by force—in the coach-house was found a lot of slating for houses and I found 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in an eld hamper among some rubbish, the amount was composed of sovereigns and half-sovereigns.</p>

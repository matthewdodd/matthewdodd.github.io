                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 376). On 24th Sept., about twenty minutes past 7 o'clock in the morning, I was watching the shop of Mr. Nor<lb></lb>rington, a baker, No. 7 Ave Maria-lane—I saw the prisoner come out with two loaves of bread under his arm—I followed him to a ham and beef shop in London-house-yard, kept by a person named Sadler—I saw the prisoner place the loaves on the end of a form there—he came out again in a mo<lb></lb>ment, leaving the loaves in the shop—I asked him who ordered him to leave the loaves there—he said, "Nobody"—I asked him who the bread belonged to—he said it was his own—I then told him I was a police officer (I was in plain clothes), and that I should take him back to his master, Mr. Norring<lb></lb>ton—on the way there he said, "If you will allow me to take the loaves back, there will be nothing said about it;" and he then said, "There will be nothing known of it"—he repeated that more than once—I told him I could not do that, I should take him to his master—I did so—Mr. Norring<lb></lb>ton was not up—I waited till he got up—this was half past 7 o'clock—Mr. Norrington gave him into custody—I took him to the station, and then went and fetched the bread—I searched him, and found on him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my aunt, Jane Sadler, who keeps a ham and beef shop at No. 16, London-house-yard, St. Paul's. I knew the pri<lb></lb>soner in Mr. Norrington's service; he used to bring the rolls of a morning—on 24th Sept., about 20 minutes past 7 o'clock in the morning, I saw him at my aunt's house—he had two quartern loaves—he put them down on the stool, and left them; he did not say anything, he left directly he had put them down—we dealt with Mr. Norrington—I had not ordered any loaves to be brought that morning, I always order the bread—I afterwards gave the same loaves to Green, the officer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe some loaves were left before at your shop! <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the foreman took those away; that had been going on for several weeks—I generally paid the foreman for our bread.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LILLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> About how many times did this happen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At first we took no notice of it, until it got so frequent; at first only half a quar<lb></lb>tern was left, then it got to two or three quarterns a day, and then we thought it was not right—it was done constantly, about a week after he came.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How often had these loaves been left in this way, and after<lb></lb>wards carried away by the foreman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Several within a day—they were put in quite an open place in the shop, anybody could see it—the prisoner never said anything when he left them; he always brought them at the time of delivering the rolls—this had been done before the prisoner came into Mr. Norrington's service; the former young man used to leave loaves in the same way.</p>

               <p>took at bread—he was not authorised by me to take any loaves to Mrs. Sadler on Wednesday, 24th Sept.—I had a foreman at that time; it was his duty to do the baking, and take out bread—he had no authority to send out bread—the prisoner ought to have acted under my directions—they were not allowed to take out bread when I was in bed—our earliest deli<lb></lb>very of bread was about 8 o'clock—I remember Green bringing the prisoner in custody—I charged him with stealing the two loaves—he did not say anything at that time—Walker, the foreman, was then on the premises—he continued in my employment for two or three days afterwards—I had given no direction to send the two loaves to Mrs. Sadler's on the 21st.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

On Thursday evening, the 27th of December, about seven o'clock, I went out, having locked the door and fastened the shutters - the back door was also fastened - I left nobody in the house - I went with my wife to No. 12, in the same street, and in about a quarter of an hour my wife went to the house, expecting her father home - I heard the cry of Thieves! I ran out towards the door, and saw the prisoner come out of our door, and run away - I pursued him immediately, and never lost sight of him - I am positive he is the man; he ran down the street, towards where I was coming up; I saw him taken, and am positive he is the man who ran out of the house; his hat fell off as he ran by the door which I came out of - a neighbour picked it up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far were you from the house when he ran out? A. Four doors off - it was not very dark - it was about seven o'clock; there was an oil-lamp near the house; he turned no corner; the property taken was mine, and not my father-in-law's; I am sure it is Bethnal-green parish.</p>

            . On Thursday, the 27th of December, I and my husband went to a neighbour's house; and about a quarter past seven o'clock I returned to look at the fire; as I was putting the key to the door, it flew open, and three men rushed out - the prisoner was the first- I caught hold of him, and am sure he is the man; I had hold of him; he struck me three times on the side of my head, and got away; my husband heard me cry Murder! Thieves! and came towards the house; the prisoner ran towards the bottom of the street; the other men ran another way; I am certain of the prisoner's person; there was a light in the house, from a candle which they had lighted; when I went in I missed a picture, a pair of salts, three images, and the tops of two vinegar-cruets; I had seen them safe before I went out; the tea-caddy was broken open, and a few papers, which had been in it, were strewed about the table; I had locked the caddy; I have not found the property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Your impression was, that three men ran out? A. Yes - the prisoner was the first; there is an oil-lamp about five doors from the house; my husband was in a neighbour's house, four doors off.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where he came from you could not say? A. Not the exact place - I did not see him come out of the door; he had no hat on when I stopped him.</p>

I cautioned you about this, that you should never want it from her name again; that you would never have dominion over it"—he seemed to be very surprised; he hesitated for some time—I was in a hurry at the time, and just as I was about going away, he stopped me, and said, "Well, but could not someone else do it for Mrs. Chandler"—I said, "Yes, certainly, if you will get her to sign a power of attorney"—that ended the interview—I had business, and I was obliged to run over to the bank—I saw him again on 17th October, 1867, when this slip (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was prepared—the body of it is in my writing—I prepared it at Chamberlain's dictation or request—by</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">City Detective Sergeant</hi>). On Monday, 19th April, I went with Mr. Pittard to St. Andrew Street, Hertford, and took Chamberlain into custody—he was in his shop—I told him that I was an officer from London, and that I held a warrant for his apprehension for forging a transfer of stock to the amount of 2194<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., standing in the books of the Bank of England in the name of Mary Ann Chandler—he said at first, "I know nothing about it"—he then said, "Well, there was a transfer, but it was no forgery; it was my own money, and I have a right to transfer the stock. Miss Chandler is a woman that I have been living with for twenty-two years, and she told me that I might go and do it"—I asked him who the women were that went with him, and said, "One was Mrs. Judd, was it not?"—he said, "Yes, my sister"—I said, "Who was the other woman?"—he said, "I don't know as I shall tell you; I don't know her, I never saw her before; I don't know where she lives, she is a woman I picked up in the streets of London"—I said, "That wont do for me; where is the receipt of the stock?"—he then unlocked a drawer, produced this receipt, and gave it me—he said his sister had received the dividends, and that Miss Chandler had told her to do so—the prisoner Judd then came into the room, and Chamberlain said to her, "Here is an officer from London to ap<lb></lb>prehend us"—Judd said "What for?"—he said, "For forging the transfer"—I then said to Judd, "Who was that woman that went to the Bank with you?"—she said, "I don't know anything about her; I don't know her; I am not going to get anyone into trouble"—Chamberlain then said, "Well, we have got into trouble, and I shall tell you all about it"—Judd said, "Don't be a fool; don't get the woman into trouble"—Chamberlain said, "We have got into trouble; the woman's name that went with us it Hutchinson, and she makes pill-boxes for me, and has for the last fifteen years; she lives at 103, Bethnal Green. What do you want? will you have the dividends?"—I said, "Yes, give me the dividends"—he then opened a drawer, and took out 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver, three 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and four Egyptian bonds for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—he said, "Well, now, you take those; you won't take me"—I said, "I shall take both"—he said, "I shan't go unless you send round to Miss Chandler; I will tell you what I will do, if you like: I win transfer all the stock back again standing in the Bank of England, and then you won't take me"—he said, "I have sent round to Miss Chandler a letter offering her marriage"—at that time a woman came into the room with a letter in her hand—Chamberlain took it from her hand, and gave it to me, and said that was the letter he had sent round to Miss Chandler (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Dear Mary. I am very unhappy, and I can't under<lb></lb>stand why you left me in this way, unless it was on account of taking in another; but it is no such a thing, for I see the evil—that is all done with, I will take my oath; and if you will come back again I feel sure we shall end our days in happiness, and am willing to be married to you any minute, and sister is willing too. Do send me an answer as soon as possible by Mrs. Stevens, as it lies between us and God, and am willing to agree to anything you want." <hi rend="italic">The letter bore no signature or date</hi>)—I then took him into custody, and brought him to London.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">City Detective Sergeant</hi>) On 20th April I went with Mr. Pittard to 103, Hare Street, Bethnal Green, where I found Hutchinson—I told her the nature of the charge—she said she had done it to oblige Mr. Chamberlain, she had known him a number of years, she did not think there was anything wrong about it, if there was, she wished he had got somebody else to have done their dirty work—she produced this letter, and said that Mrs. Judd's son had brought it.

I am sixty-three years of age—I have lived with the prisoner Chamberlain for twenty-three years—I lived at St. Andrew Street, Hertford, with him for a long period—I came to London with him in October 1866, and went to Mr. Hewkley's and had the stock transferred to me—I did not receive any of the dividends upon it after that—I never authorized anyone to receive them on my behalf—I know Judd; she is Chamberlain's sister—I don't know that Hutchinson is any relation of theirs—I know they were acquainted—no application was made to me by Judd or Chamberlain to attend to transfer this stock back to any other name; the matter was never mentioned to me at all—I am certain of that—it was never mentioned to me that I should go and transfer it—I never authorized anyone to go and make the transfer in my name—no one ever asked me for my authority to do so—I did not go to the Bank of England in April last, or direct anyone to go—I never was at the Bank of England to do any business—I believe on that day in April I was very ill in bed—I know Mr. Prance—I did not accompany him there, only after the forgery was com<lb></lb>mitted; I went with him about the stock very lately.</p>

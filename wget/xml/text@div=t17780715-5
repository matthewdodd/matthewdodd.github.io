Possession was delivered on the 1st of April of all the goods in the house; and thus described, Mr. Pope becomes intitled to the property of the house during that term; he likewise becomes intitled to every thing in the bill of sale. Sir Alexander agreed to quit; and as I understand, did quit the house; perhaps, one or two of the servants were permitted by Mr. Pope to remain in the house, which will make no difference, for b oth the property and possession of the goods were in the person of Mr. Pope.

It is observable, that Mr. Watts, an upholsterer, should make this bargain for two months. Mr. Pope accordingly delivered over the house and the possession of the goods to Mr. Watts, the consequence of which was, which probably was the view in it, Watts lets Sir

               <p>How came you to keep Carter in possession after the 1st of April; if Watts had a right to all, why did you keep Carter in possession all the time? - Carter was Watts's servant, but put in possession by me.</p>

               <p>Carter was in possession for Watts then? - No, for me I understood.</p>

You was to quit possession to Watts; but Carter, Watts's servant, was to be put in possession for you, to make the world believe you was in possession? - With my consent and Carter's, Sir Alexander was suffered to stay.

               <p>Court. There never was a more scandalous prosecution carried on in a court of justice. If this gentleman had been convicted, he would have been liable to be hanged; now you hear from the prosecutor himself, that he never thought of this prosecution till after the bill in Chancery was brought against him, and an action for usury. It was agreed upon, that Sir Alexander should have any part of the goods at an equitable price; and it appears, that a regular inventory was taken; and now the prosecutor confesses, that it occured to him, that if he convicted this gentleman, there would be an end to the action in Chancery.</p>

My lord, after having so<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177807150018"></xptr> candidly stopped in the prosecution, upon my word, I think it is too much for them to ask a copy of the indictment. Mr. Pope applied to a justice of peace upon the circumstances of the case, and the justice was of opinion it was a felony. The property, most undoubtedly, is Mr. Pope's.

               <p>Mr. Justice Nares. If the opinion of a justice of peace was to be a bar to any remedy, there might be the most villainous prosecutions carried on with impunity. I presume in this, as in every other instance, the justice of peace acted fairly, according to the facts before him. What was in the private knowledge of the prosecutor, and what he concealed from the justice is not before the court. I never saw a case in my life where there was so little colour, or pretence, to make it a criminal prosecution. I think there never was an instance where a court ought more to interfere, and grant a copy of the indictment.</p>

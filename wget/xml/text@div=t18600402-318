I keep the Star and Garter at Westminster—on 23d March the prisoner came to my house about 11 o'clock in the morning—she had something, for which she gave me in payment a Victoria half-crown—I noticed that it bore a whitish appearance, but it was not sufficient to make me have any suspicion—I put it in the till—there was other silver there and other half-crowns, but I was able distinctly to distinguish that from those other half-crowns—I gave the prisoner change</p>

               <p>and she left—she came again about 12 o'clock for a pint of porter—the price was 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she gave in payment a half-crown of George the Third—I suspected it and spoke to the barman—I gave the prisoner change, and while I was speaking to the barman, she was off instantly when she had got the change—I ran after her but I did not see her—I made inquiries and called at several places—I did not find her abode till about 6 o'clock at night—I did not find her there—she came to my house about 9 o'clock the same night—she was then intoxicated; and in a bullying tone she asked if I wanted her—I said, "Yes;" and before I had time to tax her with passing bad money she took out the contents of her pocket and threw it on the counter, and asked if I could find any bad money—there were three or four sixpences and some other money—I said I had not charged her with passing bad money—I gave her in custody, and I gave the constable the last half-crown—I did not tell her at that time that she had passed bad money, but I did afterwards—I had given the constable the firsfc half-crown in the morning—when she came for the beer she brought a jug to put it in.</p>

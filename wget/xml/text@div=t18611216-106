I am a millwright, residing at Henry Cottage, Philip-street, Bath—I became acquainted with the prisoner prior to March last-some time before March I spoke to him about an action against somebody—he advised me as to an attorney—he mentioned the name of Mr. Tood or Todd, I am not sure which—in consequence of that advice I came up to London with him and saw Mr. Todd—it was somewhere in Newgate-street—I generally live at Bath—I know very little about London—I never was here</p>

               <p>the prisoner say anything to you about going to London, shortly after you had paid the money into the bank? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he came on the Sunday morning, and said that Mr. Tood or Mr. Todd had written to him to be in London on Monday morning to help make up the briefs for the Assizes, in my action—that was the day after I had paid the money in to the bank—a few days after that I saw the prisoner back again in Bath—he said it was all right, Mr. Tood had received the money—he said he had been up to London.</p>

Todd—these are all in the prosecutor's handwriting—I am of course speaking of the letters themselves—that which is on the back are copies of the answers which I sent, in short hand—they are all about this money, the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., except the first one—the first says nothing about the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is asking me whether I think it would be the best plan to go to Cardiff, and, as I had never received any money, I thought it was a very unreason<lb></lb>able thing to expect me to go, and I never answered the letter—I think it was in the second letter that I communicated to him that I had not received the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I received a letter from him, dated the 15th, on the 16th, and then I wrote a letter to him, of which I have a copy—it was on 16th August that I first communicated to him that I had not received the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is the</p>

               <p>only known the prisoner since March, 1860—he has not brought me a great deal of business; he has brought me two matters, this and another, in which an appearance was entered—I knew nothing of the prosecutor till the prisoner introduced me to him—he has not brought other persons to my office—he was not acting as my agent down there—there are plenty of attorneys at Bath—it appears that he was acquainted with a man of the name of Holly, who laid claim to some property, and had been a client for twenty-five years, or more, of Mr. Hawkes, of Frome, to whom I was agent Mr. Hawkes died some months ago, and I having been so long agent to him, Holly came to me, he being also acquainted with the prisoner; that was the origin of it—I have not been acting as attorney for the prisoner in this matter—I went to the Mansion House and I cross-examined the witnesses there, because he had no means to procure any assistance—I learnt from him that the receipt was given in the presence of his son—I have not taken steps to subpoena his son—I have is here—I took steps to produce him at the police-court, at the prisoner's request—he was not there—it appears he did not get my letter in time—I do not know whether Mr. Hughes is here, I have not seen him—I have not taken steps to get him here—I believe he was not at the Mansion House; not on the occasion that I was there, to my knowledge—I was not asked, at the Mansion House, whether the prosecutor had admitted the signature of the receipt, and that I believed it to be his—I was not attorney for the prisoner there—I merely acted on his behalf on that occasion, purely out of benevolence—I admit that I cross-examined the witnesses, but it was entirely from a benevolent motive—I thought there was no occasion to tender my evidence, because I knew there would be a com<lb></lb>mittal—I was examined on the part of the prosecution, and was asked the questions that I have been asked here to-day; whether I knew anything about the cheque, and I answered it as I have answered it to-day; further than that I did not go—I produced the letter and the receipt in the course of the examination—I told the Lord Mayor that it was a question as to the handwriting, and that if the prisoner had not committed forgery, the prose<lb></lb>cutor must have committed perjury; I think that was about as strong as I could put it—I did not give evidence that I believed it to be the prosecutor's handwriting; I put it as an advocate and I did not interfere further, because I knew that he must be committed on the oath of the prosecutor—I did not tell the Lord Mayor that I heard the prosecutor admit the signature to the receipt—that took place in the presence of Mr. Hughes—I did not take steps to have him brought here, it was the prosecutor's place to do that—Mr. Hughes was there on the first examination when I was not; so I have heard—I do not know—I got it from a newspaper report, in which it was stated that they would not allow the expenses of their coming up from Bath—I knew the Lord Mayor would not try the case—I knew it would be tried here—I did not consider it my place to take steps to get Mr. Hughes here; I am not the prisoner's attorney—I am perfectly impartial, as I told Mr. Mulleus and Mr. Beard also—I did not threaten the prosecutor, and advise him not to take proceedings against the prisoner—I will swear that (<hi rend="italic">looking at a letter</hi>)—I hinted that he could take civil proceedings—I advised him not to take criminal proceedings—I knew at that time that the charge of forgery had been made, and that the Bath police were in search of him—if you will allow that letter to be read, it contains my reasons.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The prosecutor had long before that told you that the documents were not his? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He had denied the one and admitted the other: and then he</p>

               <p>retracted as to the letter; that was the state of things—he had previously stated by letter that the prisoner had no authority from him—all those letters were anterior to the production of the two documents—I did not authorize the prisoner to sign the name of William Tood—I think it is the prisoner's handwriting—he had no authority whatever from me to do so—I saw the prosecutor write his name and address in pencil in his pocket-book while he was with me—I cannot identify the pocket-book—the one he had contained a vast number more leaves than this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I cannot possibly explain how it was, if he did write my address, that these letters were directed to No. 91 and 95—91 would be as likely to find me as 95, and the inference is, that if one came the other would—I do not venture to make a specula<lb></lb>tion as to whether the letter was sent or not—I do not say that the cheque was an imaginary thing altogether—I think it is possible it might have been returned to the prosecutor if you ask me; and I will tell you why, because in one of his letters he states that one of his letters, directed to William Tood, 95, was returned to him from the post-office—if that was so, I should think it very likely that the other had been returned; and in one of my letters I believe I put a question to him about that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Perhaps you think it very likely that a man at Bath would send up money, and the very day he sent it up, or a day or two alter, would authorize a person to go up and receive it, and pay back a portion to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I do not think it at all likely; but if you ask me what has passed between these parties, I will tell you what I do think likely about it—I understood afterwards that the prosecutor's son was a lunatic—I did not know it in the first instance—the body of the receipt is wholly in the handwriting of the prisoner.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was this at a public-house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; at a private house—I am quite June of that—I and my mother and father were there alone—there was a little child running about the house, but I can't say that she was in the room—there was no one else there—it was on 16th August; I am sure of that, on Friday evening—I was first asked about this when my father came to London, when I heard the charge made against him—my father asked me about it—he asked if I could recol<lb></lb>lect seeing Mr. Glass sign the receipt, and I told him yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where was Mr. Glass sitting when you say he signed it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, he generally stands, with his back to the wall—I can't recollect whether he was sitting or standing when he wrote—I was sitting having my tea—this part if Mr. Glass's writing (<hi rend="italic">pointing to it</hi>); father wrote the other—he wrote it before Mr. Glass's eyes when he was there—I don't know any reason why Mr. Glass did not write the other part—I am quite sure that it was not in July that he paid the money—I do not know of any money being paid by my father on 16th July—I did not go to the police-court—I was not asked to go—I was not at home at the time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> You have not seen me since I have been in custody, have you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I cannot say any more than that Mr. Glass signed the document, and I received the money in London to pay witnesses, and to pay Mr. Todd to go to trial; unless I had he would not do it. The prosecutor gave me a list of the witnesses. He gave me the order after I told him he had made a mistake in putting 95, Newgate-street, instead of 75. I paid him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of the money in August, as the receipt bears date, only it is dated the 17th, instead of the 16th, by mistake; the 17th was on a Saturday, and it was signed on Friday. I paid Mr. Todd 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and—I paid 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to a man of the name of Merry as a witness, and 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on another occasion, and the rest went towards my debt, for what I did for him, in going about the country. The reason of it all is this: I was to have 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for drawing up an assignment for him, upon which he has received 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. since I have been in prison. The man who deposited it in hits hands signed, in my presence, "William Henry" and would not sign any farther, and his relations have put in a claim for the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and I should never have been here had it not been that I made known my views of it, that it was signed "William Henry" only, and he wants to get rid of me. I leave it in your hands. I am inno<lb></lb>cent of the charge that is laid against me; if I had been guilty I should not have gone twice to the bank about the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note; but I told the clerk I would pay the expense of their sending the note up to the Bank of England. They charged 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for making the inquiry. I must have been well aware that the note had my name and address on it, and would be evidence against me if I committed myself in any way. He was going to pay me in sove<lb></lb>reigns, and I asked him to give me a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note. Had it not been for the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that this man got through my instrumentslity, I should not have been</p>

               <p>here, only he thought I should turn round and assist the widow; but he never gave me a shilling for it.</p>

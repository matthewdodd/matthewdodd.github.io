            . I am in the prosecutor's employ. The prisoner and the other man came and looked over the things - the other man said, "Put them into your bag, and go;" the prisoner did so, the other pulled off his own coat, and fitted on another - he then said he had no money; I said I could not let the clothes go without - I pushed past the other man to go after the prisoner; the other prevented me, and held the gate to - I snatched it out of his hand, and ran to the top of the street; the prisoner set off running -I called Stop thief! he was pursued, and stopped - I never lost sight of him; I asked him to give me the clothes, and after some persuasion he gave me them, and followed me back to the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then he might have ran away? A. No; the officer was close behind him - I was not present at the first bargain about them; I had not made a new bargain with the other man to let him have them for 25s., nor consented that the prisoner should have one of the articles for the 5s.; he was taken to the office - he was not allowed to offer the 25s. to me.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I went to lay down about six o'clock, and they were safe then; a little after seven o'clock I came down, and perceived the place had been broke, and all the things gone; it was a kind of closet with folding-doors, and it appeared to me that they had forced one of the doors, there being a button inside; on the Friday evening following, I saw the prisoner and the property in the possession of Tipper.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer: In consequence of an information of some umbrellas being stolen out of Watling-street, on Friday the 24th, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, in Houndsditch, in company with Mr. Holdsworth, the City-Marshal, I observed a new umbrella under the prisoner's arm, he was a neighbour on mine; I said, you have got a new umbrella there; I asked him to let me look at it, which he did; I told him I thought it was one of the umbrellas that was stolen in Watling-street; I told him I should detain the umbrella, and Mr. Holdsworth then came over to me; I stopped the umbrella, and let the prisoner go; I told him he must come to the Mansion-House, and I thought it would be proper for him to go with me to the prosecutor's; he said, very readily, that he would; I told him I could not go now; he said, then I will wait upon you in the course of half an hour; he came to my house, and I was not ready; I told him I would call upon him at the George, a public-house that he used; I went but he was not there; I stopped a few minutes and he came, and we then went to the prosecutor's; I asked the prosecutor if he had lost any umbrellas, and he told me he had; I shewed him the umbrella which I now have in my hand, he examined it, and said, to the best of his knowledge, that was his umbrella; Mrs. Rutherford said she was confident it was her umbrella; I told him I must take him to the Compter; he begged I would not, and said he would take me to the house where he bought it; I went, in company with my brother officer, to the house, the woman was not at home; I stopped about half an hour at a public-house just by, and when I went back she was at home; the prisoner was with me; I asked her if she knew any thing of any umbrellas, or if she knew the prisoner; she said, yes, he had been and bought some umbrellas of two men; I asked her if she knew their names, ans she did not recollect their names at first; she said he gave her a shilling to carry the umbrellas home to his house; the prisoner then said, if you will go along with me to such a house, I think you will apprehend them; I took the prisoner to the Compter, and then apprehend the woman; I took him before the Lord-Mayour the next day; the prosecutor said he had lost a great many other articles; and the Lord-Mayour asked him what he had done with them; and the prisoner said, he had sold them to one Mendez; I had a warrant for Mendez, and he brought the remainder of the things.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Every thing that this man told you turned out to be perfectly true? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you, in point of fact, know, that these two persons, who have absconded, were the persons concerned in stealing? - A. I believe they were.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been a constable? - A. Seventeen years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find, upon the apprehension of a person for a felony, any one more ready to give you the whole account of the transaction? - A. He acted as I have told you.</p>

               <p>Mendez. On the 26th of March, I bought of the prisoner half a dozen sticks, and between six and seven dozen pieces of whalebone; I gave him thirty shillings for the whole.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You would not have dealt with him if you had not supposed him to be an honest man? - A. No; I never heard any harm of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Thirty shillings is a very fair price for them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Rutherford. There is no mark upon any of these things; the umbrella is about the same size.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Rutherford. I believe this umbrella to be mine; it is worked all the way up with fourpenny thread.</p>

Yes; the prisoner came to my house to look at some umbrella-sticks belonging to two men that were in my house, he purchased them of the two men; I carried them home for him, and he gave me a shilling. <rs id="t18010415-129-verdict727" type="verdictDescription">

On the 23rd of May my son and my little girl were at home; I had some money in my till, which was near my front door; the prisoner drove up in a gig, and called for some beer, with which I served him; I then had occasion to go to the back of the house; I left my till unlocked - I do not know what was in it, but I know there was some money; I had been at it half an hour before - I returned in about twenty minutes; the prisoner was still at the door - I missed my money from the till, and I told him so - he said, "Have you," but I do not recollect his saying who could have done it; I told him there was one sixpence marked, which I could swear to, but there was not - I said if he would own it, I would forgive him; he then drove away, and I told the Policeman, who went in pursuit.</p>

            . (Police-constable N 132). I went in pursuit of the prisoner, who had got about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's; I said, "I want you" - he said, "What do you want?" I said, "You know I want that money which you took out of the till;" he put his hand into his waistcoat pocket, and took out two sixpences - he said one of them was his master's, and if there was any more money it was in his coat pocket - I took his coat, and found in the pocket of it eight shillings, and six sixpences; at the station-house he said it belonged to the landlady, and asked if they would transport him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was not all this after the landlady had promised him forgiveness? A. I do not know what she had promised.</p>

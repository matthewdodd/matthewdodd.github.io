               <p>Gregory. They were. We made inquiry after them, and got intelligence of the two prisoners at the bar and one Gore. We took up Gore, and carried him before justice Bever. He told us he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175802220018"></xptr> had no hand in taking them, but that the two prisoners took them. Tape was taken, and before the same justice confessed he was at the stealing them; but could not tell particularly the night, and that it was about the 23d of December.</p>
               <p>Q. What were his words?</p>
               <p>Gregory. He said that he and Lowder got over the park pales, drove the ducks up into a corner, and catch'd seven of them; that they gave three to

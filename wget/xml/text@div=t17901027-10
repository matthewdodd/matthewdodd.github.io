             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a poor widow with eight children. I lodge in Marybone. I know the prisoner; he went to fetch me the money from the Bank; I gave the prisoner the money in Marybone-street: I was walking in the park on quarter day; I cannot tell the month; it was in the spring of the year; the leaves were out; it was about half after one when I first met with him; he threw down a purse; and I said, you have picked up a present, and I must have half; we went and sat on one of the benches in the park, just right facing the clock; then there came up a well dressed man, very genteel, and said, your servant, and your servant, and he made obedience; and the prisoner had a long paper bill of a diamond ring, and he said, can you read this? I said, no, I have no eyes to read; so then the prisoner gave the bill to one Mr. Morgan, as he calls himself; he pretended to belong to the Prince of Wales, and looked after his horses; there was the account of the ring, and how much the diamond was worth: Morgan asked the prisoner what he was, and he said, he was a jobber in Smith-field; then Mr. Morgan said to the prisoner, do you go and fetch this gentlewoman some money; Morgan stayed with me: the prisoner returned in half an hour, and said, he went to a gentleman, who was not at home, but at four o'clock he told me I should have the money, and Mr. Morgan would go with me to put it into the Bank: Mr. Morgan asked me what I had? I said, a watch and half-a-crown in my pocket; but I had no more; so I left them in a coach, and went home, and fetched all the money I had, which was six guineas; and here is his brother-in-law; he has been dodging me all day, and offered<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179010270015"></xptr>to give me three guineas; and the watch is in pawn.</p>
               <p>What was you to have for the six guineas? - Upwards of fifty guineas from the prisoner and Mr. Morgan, when he fetched the money: I saw nothing of the prisoner, nor for seven weeks; then I saw him in the Bird Cage Walk? and he threw this paper away; a soldier that is here saw the prisoner throw it away.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you to have your watch back again? - No, Sir; they did not say so.</p>
               <p>At the time you delivered your watch to them did they say you was to have it again? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>What was to become of the watch? - I do not know; I did not ask them.</p>
               <p>Was it proposed you should have your watch again? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you mean to part with your watch finally? - No, Sir: my son gave it me that was abroad.</p>
               <p>Then you expected to have it back again? - To be sure, when they came from the Bank.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. On what day did this happen? - On a Thursday, quarter day.</p>
               <p>Upon what day of the month? - I told you before.</p>
               <p>To whom did you deliver your watch and half-crown? - To Morgan, while you was gone for the money.</p>
               <p>To whom did you deliver the six guineas? - To Morgan.</p>
               <p>Where? - Why, you went with us in the coach, and when I came up I did not see you.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the prisoner present when you delivered the watch and half-crown to Morgan? - No, Sir; he was gone to fetch the money.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner present when you gave Morgan the six guineas? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>While the prisoner was present, was there any talk about delivering the watch or money? - No, Sir; none at all.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the jury. There is nothing to affect the prisoner in this case; because, though very probably they both set out with intent to commit a fraud, which might be a larceny, yet you see the prisoner was not present.</p>

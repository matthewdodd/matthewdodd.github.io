On the 7th of February I called him into the counting-house, and told him I had strong reasons to think that he had been selling some of my property; he said he had not, and said something about a search, and he took me to his lodgings - I saw some property of mine there, and requested the key of his trunk - I found some property of mine among his clothes, which I can swear to - before I got to the trunk, I found two pairs of my lasts, and some leather; the remainder of the property was in the trunk - a variety of articles, consisting of leather, of goats' skin, and some galloon; he said, "If you will forgive me, I'll tell you all about it" - I said, he had been robbing me for a considerable time, and that he had better tell me who his accomplice was - I made him no promise; he appeared very much agitated, and said, he hoped I would forgive him, and said his cousin had some duplicates of some shoes, which had been pledged - we went to his cousin, and found one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The cousin was in your employment? A. Yes; but he had no opportunity of coming further than the passage - he could not steal shoes from the warehouse; this man never took work home - the prisoner did not work at home occasionally for other people; it is unlawful in our business to work for another - it is not regular to take cabbage out of leather delivered out - I know the writing on this piece of leather, it was signed by a person named Swift, who was my foreman, but not now, nor is he here - there is no private mark of my own on this leather; there is nothing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150056"></xptr>here in the state in which he should take it from my hand to make up; no leather is delivered out in this state for that purpose - none of it is in a fit state to make into shoes; it ought to be closed - we give work to different work people.</p>

            . I am foreman to Scott and King - I was present when the prisoner's lodgings were searched - the patterns are my own cutting, and I can swear to this piece as their property - this is a piece of basil skin; no mark is on it - I cannot swear to that, nor these; I will swear to this, because it is a peculiar sort of leather - there is no private mark on it - this peculiar sort of leather is made by a person in Golden-lane - I cut these soles about a month previous to their being missed - I did not hear him say the property was his own, when taken before the Magistrate.</p>

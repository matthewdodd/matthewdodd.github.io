                  </hi>. I am a watch-maker—I live in Upper East Smith<lb></lb>field—on Friday evening, the 31st of July, between eight and nine o'clock, a person, a gentleman in appearance, came into my shop and said he was recom<lb></lb>mended to me for a gold patent lever watch—my daughter Susannah was in the shop and a lady named Miss Harding, of Burr-street—when the person came in who enquired for the lever watch, he came to the glass-case and sat down in a chair which was further from the door than the lady was—I pro<lb></lb>duced him three watches with which he was not satisfied, and I showed him another—four patent lever watches I placed on the glass-case—in about ten minutes that gentleman was followed in by another person, who was, no doubt, the prisoner at the bar, but my attention was drawn off, attending to the lady with her ear<lb></lb>rings—I believe the prisoner is the person—he squeezed by the lady and got to the person who was looking at the watches—he said, 'Mr. Harris, what do you charge for cleaning a patent lever watch V—he had then squeezed in between the lady and the gentleman, which my daughter will be able to explain—I told him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was the price—the prisoner then went imme<lb></lb>diately out of the shop—I should think in about two minutes—he did not pro<lb></lb>duce any lever watch to be cleaned—when he came into the shop the four lever watches which I hadshown to the first man were safe, and two gold guard<lb></lb>chains</p>

               <p>were on the glass-case—the prisoner went out of the shop, and I should think in about a minute the other man went—before he went away he said, "I will call again to-morrow, Mr. Harris, and take one"—he went away, and my daughter hallooed out, "Father, there is a gold watch gone, and a gold guard"—I looked at the watches—there were only three on the glass-case then—one was gone.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of the prosecutor. I was in his shop on the occasion of this watch being lost—I saw the first person come in—he asked for patent lever gold watches—Miss Harding was not in the shop at the time—she came into the shop while the first person was there—our shop has a single window—it is a long shop—there is a long counter—it extends the whole depth of the shop—there is a glass case on the counter, which does not extend the whole way—it is at the farther end of the shop the other man went to the upper end of the shop, near the glass case, and there he wasshown the watches, on the case—Miss Harding was next to the man that was looking at the watches—she was standing, the man was sitting—Miss Harding is not an acquaintance of our family, she was a stranger to us—while the man was looking at the watches, the prisoner came, in—I am confident he is the man, I took such particular notice of him—Miss Harding was in the middle—the counter is on the right-hand side of the shop—the prisoner came to the right-hand side of Miss Harding—he said, "Mr. Harris, what do you charge for cleaning a three-quarter plate lever watch?"and he shuffled himself between Miss Harding and the man—it was not necessary, to have that question answered, that the prisoner should pass by Miss Hard<lb></lb>ing, and get between her and the man who was looking at the watches—there was two yards vacant at the counter before he got there.</p>

On Friday evening, the last day of July, I had occasion to go to Mr. Harris's shop for a pair of earrings I had left to be mended—it was about half-past eight o'clock—I found Mr. Harris in the shop, and his daughter behind the counter, and a gentleman on this side the counter, at the further end—I believe they were looking at watches—I cannot be posi<lb></lb>tive—I placed myself near the door—I had been in there three or four mi<lb></lb>nutes, when another man came in—I was then about two or three feet from the man who was looking at the watches—the man who came in pressed by me in a very rude way, and went by the side of the man who was in the shop—I am not positive, but I believe die prisoner to be the man who came in—he asked Mr. Harris what he would charge for cleaning a watch—I believe that was what he said—there was no necessity at all for him to have passed me for the purpose of putting that question—when he had passed me he was as close as possible to the other man—he did not stay in the shop above a moment—he was out of the shop in a moment, and the other man followed him—he said he would rather have a watch like his brother's; and they were out of the shop in a moment.</p>

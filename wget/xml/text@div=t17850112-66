               <p>Court. He might pick it up might not he? - Indeed to tell the truth, I believe he might, for the man was so much in liquor I do not believe he was capable.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. There is no pretence to charge the man with this, the prosecutor was so drunk.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Be more careful for the future, let this be a caution to you.</p>

On Sunday the 4th of September. between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, after I had locked up the church doors, Mr. Barker informed me I had locked somebody up in the church; I unlocked the church and there I saw the prisoner; he had a turban on his head, he was in the bellfry; I asked him what he did there, he answered he had been asleep and his head was very bad.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he answer you so as you could understand him - A. Yes, in very good English. I then desired him to come out of the church; he came immediately into the church yard; I told him he should not go till I saw what he had got; he said he had nothing but apples and pears; I put my hand round his waist. I saw something white; he had a turkian dress on; I pulled a surplice from him. I searched him round again and found apples and pears; after he was taken to the Compter I found two more surplices in the vestry, besides the one he had taken; there were three when I left the vestry, about a quarter of an hour before; there was one missing; I can swear to the surplice, I always attend the clergyman to take it off; I have no doubt it was one of the surplices belonging to the church. I have been sextoness four years.</p>

            . - Mr. Knapp. What are you - A. I live in Bell lane, Spital fields; I have known the prisoner eight years, he is a good sort of a man; I never heard any thing against his character.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he get his livelihood - A. By working as a tailor. About two years ago he received news from Gibraltar that his friends all died in the flames; that turned his head rather lunatic; he said his friends had left him some money in Gibraltar, and he would go and fetch it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you, after he had received this intelligence with respect to the loss of all his family, that he possessed his senses - A. I am certain it turned his head; I had constant opportunity of seeing it; he used to go out for five or six nights, and his wife did not know where to find him; he has been brought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180809140060"></xptr>home by a parcel of boys several times, with a rope tied round his waist; this sort of conduct happened down to three weeks of his apprehension. I saw him on the Saturday previous to his apprehension on the Sunday; he was then very melancholy, and said he would go to Gibraltar, he thought there was money there; I saw him on the Monday after; I asked him if he knew me, he said he knew nothing of me.</p>

I am the wife of Aaron Harvey, a sailor, and live at 43, Morris Street, St. George's—I live in the kitchen—the prisoner and her husband and son live in the first floor front room—on the 10th June, at midnight, I was in bed—I heard the prisoner's voice up stairs scolding some one—I did not hear any one answer—I then heard crockery being thrown about, and afterwards some one moaning—I heard the prisoners son say "Oh mother, you have stabbed my father"—soon after the same voice said "O mother, you have stabbed me; bring me a light, bring me a light"—on bearing this I ran out of my room, and saw the prisoner's husband coming down stairs—he showed me a wound in his chest—air was blowing out of it—I laid him on the stairs and ran up stairs—I met the son coming down—his thigh was bleeding—the prisoner was at the top of the stairs—I said to her "What have you done? and she said "I have done it and I will do the same to any one who comes up"—she was very tipsy—I screamed for the police, and presently a constable came and went up stairs—before the constable came the son went back into the room—I saw the policeman take a knife from up the chimney, and there was blood on it—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the blood was wet.</p>

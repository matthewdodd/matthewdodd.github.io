            . I am an officer. On Easter Monday I was in Newgate street, and when the possession had set down, there was a great crowd to get into the church; I followed the prisoner about a quarter of an hour, I saw him attempt to pick pockets, at last he put his hand into this gentleman's pocket and pulled this handkerchief the first time about half way out, the next time he pulled it quite out, and put it under his apron, and as I suppose he put it into his breeches; I tapped the gentleman on his shoulder, and told him to follow me, he had lost his handkerchief, and then I caught the prisoner; I found the handkerchief in the prisoner's breeches, the prosecutor was close by me. This is the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I don't know that I can swear to it, it looks like one that I had in my pocket; I can swear that I lost a pocket handkerchief, but not that this is the same.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was there about one o'clock, I was coming down Newgate street; I saw the handkerchief laying on the pavement; I picked it up and put it into my breeches pocket; there was a hole in the pocket, it fell through, the officer said it was not my property; he knocked me down; I asked him what he did that for, he said, to take me in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Philip James Chabot; he is a silk and worsted dyer—the prisoner worked there—on the 2nd of February he came into the room where I was, saying he wanted some tobacco—he went to his coat, and took something out of his trowsers pocket, which I supposed to be a handkerchief—it was something yellow—he looked at it, and put it into the coat pocket—I took an opportunity of seeing what it was, and found it was 2 1/2 oz. of silk—this was about twenty minutes to eight o'clock—I told my master, and about twenty minutes to nine o'clock he was going to breakfast—my master told me to follow him, which I did, from the dye-house in Fashion-street, as far as Spitalfields-church, when I took him—the officer took the silk from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. It was impossible for you to see me take this out of my pocket—it was hanging to my button when I went into the room—I did not want any one to see it, and I was determined to hide it a moment till I got an opportunity of getting to the parcel which it belonged to, and I had no opportunity of doing so—when I went to ray breakfast I thought to get back in time to put it with the silk—I had no occasion to take it out of my trowsers pocket, which I must have undone my apron to do, and put it into my handkerchief, and put it into my coat pocket, when a man was there, who was likely to go to my coat pocket as well as me—I only went to my coat pocket for a bit of tobacco—I would have returned it as soon is I could. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I saw him roll it up in his handkerchief, and put it into his coat-pocket.</p>

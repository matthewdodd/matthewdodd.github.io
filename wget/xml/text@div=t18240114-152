On the 23d of December, in consequence of an application to me from Mance, I saw the prisoner; and again on the 24th. I received two shillings and sixpence from the officers; I had no more money about me. The officers marked it before they gave it to me. Goodluck and I then went to the prisoner's lodgings. I had seen him there the day before, but he said he had nothing ready. The coin was to be ready in the afternoon, and if we did not call in the afternoon, he was to have it ready for us by morning; we had asked him for a score of shillings. When we went on the 24th, the prisoner said he had got half a score for Goodluck's order, and offered me sixteen sixpences and a half-crown, as he had no more shillings left; I bought them of him for 2 s. 6 d. good silver. I gave him the money I received from the officers. Goodluck bought the ten shillings for half-a-crown - we left the room, and when we came down, the officers being near at hand, I gave a signal, and they went up and took him. We gave Mance the coin which we had bought. Goodluck is the constable's son.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. - Q. Did you know him before - A. Not before the 17th; when Goodluck introduced him to me, at his father's house at Hoxton. The prisoner's father and mother were present when the agreement was made with us about the coin. I was out of sight of the house before the officers went in. They went with me to near the spot and searched me, before I went in.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live in White-Hart Court, Hoxton. I have known the prisoner two years and a half. In consequence of the directions of the officers, I accompanied Trotman on the 23d to the prisoner's lodgings, Marlborough-court, Petticoat-lane, and asked him for some shillings; he said he had none ready, and we were to call in the afternoon, or next morning; and on the 24th we went; his father and mother were there. The officer had searched us, and given us each 2 s. 6 d. which Armstrong had marked. I said I had come for the shillings - he produced ten. Trotman bought sixteen sixpences and a half-crown of him, as he had no more shillings ready. I gave him the marked 2 s. 6 d. for them, and directly we left him, we made a signal to my father, who stood opposite the end of the court. He and Mance immediately went up to the prisoner's lodgings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have known him two years - A. Yes; I saw him two years ago, but not since, till December. He did not know that my father was an officer.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. How did you introduce yourself to him - On the 9th, by mentioning a young man's name; he asked me what I wanted - I said some shillings. He and his father talked in a language I could not understand, and he let me have them.</p>

            . I am an officer, the witnesses went to the prisoner's lodgings by my direction. On the 24th, I gave Trotman 2 s. 6 d., which Armstrong, had marked. Van searched them in my presence. They had no money; after the prisoners were apprehended, Trotman gave me sixteen sixpences and half-a-crown; I searched the prisoner and found 9 s. 6 d. in his right hand breeches pocket, among which were the 2 s. 6 d. I had given Trotman, and the 2 s. 6 d. which I had given Goodluck, who brought me ten counterfeit shillings. I produce the counterfeit money; it was wrapped up in paper separately.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you lose sight of Trotman before he entered the house - I did. I saw nobody near who dealt in braces.</p>

            . On the 24th of December, I was at the Baker and Basket, public-house; and saw the witnesses searched; they had no money. Vann gave them each 2 s. and a 6 d. which I had marked. We watched them to Petticoat-lane, I saw them within one hundred yards of Marlborough-court. Mance gave me a signal, and I got into the house in two minutes, and apprehended the prisoner. I asked him how long he had had the money which was found on him, he said ever since yesterday morning. I said</p>
               <p>"Have you had change any where," he said he had changed a crown-piece in Petticoat-lane.

The four shillings and two sixpences found on him are what I marked. The other officers were nearer to the court than me.</p>

I am a widow, and live in Upper Gower-street, Bedford-square - I came to town on the 16th of March, from Farringdon, by the Stroudwater coach; I had two trunks and a portmantean, which contained all the articles stated in this indictment - they were all my property, and there were three medals which were not mine - I remember a passenger getting down from the coach at <placeName id="t18310407-79-crimeloc449">Knightsbridge</placeName>

            . I am a Police-constable. On the night of the 16th of March I was on duty, and saw the prisoner about a quarter-past nine o'clock, in the rear of Lyons-terrace, Knightsbridge; he was coming into Knightsbridge from the fields - this was about fifty yards from where the portmantean was missed; he had nothing with him; but I saw this portmanteau against the wall in the field from which he had come - he was walking when I first saw him - I followed him; I saw a woman named Howard, who directed me in my pursuit, and I took the prisoner on the opposite side of the way, about forty yards from where I first saw him - he tried to get away from me; I laid down the portmanteau, and told Howard to mind it while I secured the prisoner, but it was in my sight all the time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said at Queen-square that it was laying across the path, and he fell over it. Witness. I did tumble over it, but it was laying against the wall - the prisoner was about five yards from it when I first saw him.</p>

            . I came up by the Stroudwater coach on the 16th of March - I was sitting on the dicky with another female; we came on beyond Hammersmith, and I felt a blow on my left side; I cannot say what time that was, nor how near it was to London - I turned round, and saw a man in a dark coat, getting off the coach with a trunk in his hand; I called to the coachman, and the coach stopped.</p>

            . I live in Great Turner-street, and drive the Stroudwater coach. When I got to Slonne-street, on the night in question, I heard the alarm given by the witness opposite the Foot Guard Barracks; I got down and missed Mrs. Slater's portmanteau - it had been strapped to the iron; I had seen it safe about two hundred yards back.</p>
               <p>COURT to J. T. PRATLEY. Q. How long would it take a person to have carried it from the place the coachman speaks of, to where you found it? A. About three minutes - I did not see him nearer than two yards from it -I found no knife on him.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 5th of January were you at your master's house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Who was with you? - A. I was standing at the door with the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q.What time was it? - A.About half past nine at night; I was standing with my back against the waistcoat and the board where the shutters are put up; while the watchman and I were talking, a woman passed by the door several times, but I did not notice her at all; she came by again, and the watchman and I were talking about what fare he had met with in Harley-street; that he had had a dollop of turkey; my master's apprentice was standing at the door at the same time; his name is Lawrence Mawbey; the woman came by again, and said something to the boy, but what the words were, I did not hear; I then went into the road to make water; before I shut up the shop, and while I was there, I saw two persons go into the shop, whom I did not then know; one was Capt. Piers, and the other was the woman that I had seen pass the door before.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at the two prisoners? - A. I know that gentleman, but the lady I do not know; that is the gentleman that went in with the lady; when I went into the shop, he was knocking with a stick against the boards.</p>
               <p>Q.Who was in the shop? - A.Nobody, till the boy came out of the yard, and met them; the boy had gone back into the yard; as Capt. Piers met him in the shop he collared him; I came up, and asked what was the matter; he intimated that the lady had been infulted, but I don't remember the words he used; the turned about, looked at me, and said to Capt. Piers, that is the man that insulted me, pointing to me; upon which he laid hold of me by the collar, and said he would charge the watch with me; he took me from the shop to the door, he pulled me by the collar, and then a man of the name of Hales came up, and said, William, you charge the watch with him; I said, what for, there is no insult at all given; at that instant he insisted upon the watch being charged with me, and then I charged the watch with him; the watchman came up, and put his arm round my shoulder, and got me and Capt. Piers both hold together.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that watchman's name? - A. Buckley, I think; and while we were in custody of the watchman, Capt, Piers withdrew back from the watchman, got out of the watchman's hands, and when he had got away, I said, it is a sad thing I am charged wrongfully, and tried to get away from the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the woman? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did Capt. Piers go? - A. I cannot tell; he drew himself back from the watchman, and upon that instant he came up again.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he been absent? - A. Not half a moment; he withdrew himself behind me; he came up, and at that instant I was shot; I did not see him, nor I did not know I was shot; I do not know who shot me.</p>
               <p>Q.Whereabouts were you shot? - A.Under the right ear; at that instant the watchman let me go, and I was taken to a surgeon's.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you sure that you have told all that passed, as far as you are concerned? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you said any thing to the lady whatever? A.Not a word, if I was to die this moment.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q.What was the name of the watchman you were conversing with at the time the lady was passing backwards and forwards? - A.His name is Corbett.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to represent that the Captain shot you as from behind? - A.From behind; I did not see him shoot me.</p>
               <p>Q.You never saw him, or spoke to him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Nor attempted to lay hold of him? - A. No, I never attempted to lay hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q.There are some very respectable witnesses here, whom I shall examine upon that head; now do you mean to persist in it? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q.You did not see him at the time, did not attempt to lay hold of him, nor did not speak to him? - A.Not at that time, not after I had charged the watch with him.</p>
               <p>Q.Then of course you did not attempt to strike at any body? - A. No.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200004"></xptr>Q. That you are sure of? - A. I am sensible of it.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. Q.What are you? - A. I belong to the Stamp-office.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of this transaction? A. On the 5th of January, about half past nine in the evening, I was passing by; within about forty yards from the corner of Paddington-street, I heard some people hooting, and saw the lady passing; when I came to the corner of Paddington-street, I observed Mr. Sharp's man and boy standing at the door; they were hooting a lady who was passing by; when she had got about twenty yards down High-street, she returned, and went into Paddington-street, and then they began hooting at her again, and called after her, rag, tag, and bob-tail, those were the expressions they made use of; when she got into Paddington-street, she went to the fishmonger's, and then a gentleman came out of the fishmonger's with her; at the time the gentleman came out of the shop with her, I observed the man go across High-street, and the boy seemed to go back, as if it was to the yard; the person who came out of the fishmonger's-shop went into the butcher's-shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Capt. Piers that person? - A. Yes; he asked who it was that insulted the lady under his protection; there was nobody in the shop at the time he went in; Mrs. Sharp came out from the parlour; he knocked with a stick on the floor, and Mrs. Sharp came out.</p>
               <p>Q.Where were you standing at that time? - A. I was standing just at the door; Mrs. Sharp said, she could not tell who it was that insulted her, and then the boy came in from the yard.</p>
               <p>Q.Did she day no more than that? - A. I did not hear her say any more; when the boy came into the shop, Miss Johnstone said, that is the person who insulted me; when Capt. Piers immediately caught him by the coat, began to shake him, and asked him how he dared insult any body in the street.</p>
               <p>Q.What part of the coat did he take him by? - A.By the lappel; at the time he was shaking him, Cobb returned from the street, caught Mr. Piers by the arm, and asked him what he was doing; called him a stupid fool, and said, if he did not go out of the shop, he would turn him out.</p>
               <p>Q.Was Mrs. Sharp there at this time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the boy? - A. Yes; he immediately turned round, and desired him to take his arm off; he immediately returned, and went into the street from the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not touch Cobb? - A. I did not see him touch Cobb; when he got into the street, he called the watch; when the watchman came up, he desired him to take into his charge Mr. Cobb; immediately Mr. Cobb gave charge for charge, and they both went together; at that time Mr. Piers turned round, and began to speak to the watchman.</p>

               <p>Q. You saw him speak to the watchman? - A. I imagined him speaking to the watchman; I did not hear what he said.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you as near to him as when you heard what passed between him and Mrs. Sharp? - A. No; when he appeared to speak to the watchman, Cobb jumped down the steps of the door, and began to swear very much indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time there were a great number of people there? - A.There might be about half a dozen.</p>
               <p>Q.Then all those half dozen heard and saw what passed as well as you? - A.They might for what I know.</p>
               <p>Q.Were they in the same situation that you were? - A. It they chose, I should think they might; he jumped down the steps, began to swear very much, and said, let me at him, I will give him his gruel; and it appeared to me as if several people attempted to stop Cobb; there appeared to be a bustle, as if they wished to stop-him from getting to Capt. Piers.</p>
               <p>Q.What did they do? - A.One before me laid hold of him, but he broke from him, and I laid hold of him myself, but he got from me; then he went towards Capt. Piers, and made two or three blows at him; at the time that he aimed at him, Miss Johnstone happened to step between Captain Piers and Cobb; at that moment I wished to get away; I turned my head round, and saw Cobb making another attempt to strike at him; I heard the report of a pistol, and saw that Cobb was shot in the face.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you happen to know either of the prisoners before? - A. No; I have often seen Cobb before, and I have seen Cobb sneer at me frequently as I have gone past.</p>
               <p>Q.You were offended at him? - A. I thought it was very unmannerly.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you ever make any complaint to the master or mistress? - A. No, I thought it the best way to take no notice of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. I believe<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200009"></xptr>your father lives within a very few doors of this shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.You were not at all a friend or acquaintance of Capt. Piers or Miss Johnstone? - A. I don't know that I ever saw either of them before.</p>
               <p>Q.As you are a neighbour of there butcher lads, and have passed the door frequently, are they civil lads, or the reverse? - A. I have heard that they are not, and I have observed them behave very unmannerly to me.</p>
               <p>Q.Without your giving any cause? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.You have the honour of having a place in the Stamp-Office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you had it? - A.About a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Q.Was there any thing in the dress or manner of Miss Johnstone to provoke the derision of any person? - A. No; I thought her dress was very becoming.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it true or false that the had the least appearance of being disguised in liquor? - A. No, I did not imagine any thing of the kind; I thought her quite the contrary.</p>
               <p>Q.Was the decent in her dress and appearance? - A.She was.</p>
               <p>Q.You yourself saw several blows aimed by Cobb at Capt. Piers, before the pistol was fired? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Was the manner of Cobb violent at the time? - A.He appeared to be very much so, he swore very much.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you attended before the Magistrate, without being sent for by any body, to tell the truth of the transaction? - A.No, Miss Johnstone called upon me to request that I would.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of which you attended before the Magistrate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.You were bound over to appear before the Grand Jury? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you attend at the Grand Jury door? - A. I attended two days, but I was not called in.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known there butcher lads? - A.Some time, from seeing them in the neighbourhood.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q.Where do you live? - A.At Mr. Lowe's, the corner of Great Marybone-street, a pawnbroker.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any business which took you on the evening this happened into this neighbourhood? - A. Yes; I was going of an errand for my master to the fishmonger's that joins Mr. Sharp's shop.</p>
               <p>Q.Tell us what you observed? - A.Before I came to Mr. Sharp's, I saw Miss Johnstone walking; the turned back, and went past Mr. Sharp's; I passed her, and heard a boy hooting after her, the same as if they were driving a bullock or a sheep; upon looking round, I observed it was the butcher's boy.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you know him before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he when you first saw him? - A.Standing upon the steps of Mr. Sharp's shopdoor; I went on to the fishmonger's, and Mr. Piers was there cheapening a lobster, which was not boiled; the lady came in, and said, I with you would step out, for here are some boys that have very much insulted me; then the gentleman laid hold of her arm, and went to Mr. Sharp's.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that all the said to him? - A. Yes, that was all I heard; I saw the gentleman go into the shop, and knock hard with a stick; Mrs. Sharp came out, and asked what was the matter; he said, the boy had insulted a lady; Mrs. Sharp said, the boy had not, for he had just come out of the yard; then the person that was shot said, no, she had not been insulted there.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you sure it was Cobb said so? - A. Yes. I am sure it was him; then there was a quarrel between Mr. Piers and Cobb; I saw Mr. Piers come down the steps of the butcher's door, and he called the watch three or four times; the watchman came, and Mr. Piers gave charge of Cobb.</p>
               <p>Q.Did that draw any people round? - A. There was a vast concourse of people; upon that somebody called, give charge for charge, and there was charge for charge given.</p>
               <p>Q.After Cobb had given charge of Capt. Piers, what followed then? - A.Mr. Piers seemed to decline it, and was going up Paddington-street; Cobb finding that, seemed very much enraged; he broke away from the watchman, and tried to strike at him.</p>
               <p>Q.Tell us how he tried to strike at him? - A. Several people had hold of him, and he broke away from them, and tried to strike at him.</p>
               <p>Q.Shew us in what manner he did it? - A.He squared at him with his fist. - (Describing it.)</p>
               <p>Q.What happened upon that? - A.Upon that I saw Miss Johnstone get between them, and try to shove Cobb away, to keep him from striking.</p>
               <p>Q.What happened upon that? - A. A vast concourse of people assembled; I had a large dish under my arm, and I got out of the mob, and in two or three seconds after that I heard the report.</p>
               <p>Q.Was there any thing either in the dress, or conduct, or manner of Miss Johnstone, to induce these people to hoot after her? - A. Not the least.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she appear to be a woman disguised by intoxication? - A.Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q.Was there any thing indecent in her dress or manner? - A.Not at all.</p>

               <p>Q.How came you to be subpoenaed? - A. After<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200010"></xptr>I had seen what I did, I went home, and told it to my master.</p>
               <p>Q.In consequence of which, I believe he gave information? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.Could you see the parlour at all? - A. No, but I should suppose, by the door, it was the parlour; there are some windows in the shop, which I took to be the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q.Who spoke first? - A.Captain Piers said, some boys had very much insulted the lady.</p>
               <p>Q.Where were you when he said that? - A. I was by the door.</p>
               <p>Q.What answer was made to that? - A. She said, her boy was just come out of the yard, and the man came up, and said, nobody had been infulted there.</p>

               <p>Q.Must you have seen him, if he had? - A. Yes, I think I must.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Miss Johnstone accusing the boy of having insulted her? - A. Yes, the said, that was the boy that had infulted her. (Pointing to the apprentice.)</p>

               <p>Q.Did she not, after having said the boy infulted her, tell Captain Piers to let go the boy, for that it was Cobb that had infulted her; I heard her say, that they had both infulted her.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he take both into custody afterwards? - A. No, he gave charge of Cobb, and the boy said, he would go to the watch-house likewise, but charge was not given of him.</p>
               <p>Q.Did they all go to the door together? - A. Yes, they all came out to the door together.</p>
               <p>Q.You said Captain Piers went out to the door and called watch, did he not drag Cobb with him by the collar? - A.No, I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you mean to say, you did not see him touch Cobb at all? - A. No, I did not see him touch either of them.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see the watchman take hold of Captain Piers? - A. Yes, there were two or three watchmen got hold of him, after the pistol was fired.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see any watchman take hold of Captain Piers, before the siring of the pistol? - A. I cannot say I did.</p>
               <p>Q.You saw all that passed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Then, perhaps, you will swear he was not taken hold of by the watchman? - A.Not that I saw.</p>
               <p>Q.And you are as sure of that as you are of any thing else you have told us? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Then Captain Piers, being in custody, could not get out of custody, by shifting his arm? - A. No, he was walking away.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore, though he was charged, the watchman went away without offering to detain him? - A. Yes, he was going up Paddington-street.</p>

               <p>Q.And the watchman did not attempt to detain him, do you mean that? - A. Yes.</p>

Yes; I came up to Mr. Sharp's door<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200011"></xptr>just as the gentleman came down the steps with the lady, and he was calling for the watch; the watchman took Cobb into custody, and then some person persuaded Cobb to charge the prisoner; after that, Mr. Piers took hold of the lady, and seemed to be going away down Paddington-street; Cobb extricated himself frem the watchman, and followed him, he had put himself in a posture, as I suppose, to strike him.</p>

               <p>Q. At that time, no mischief had been done? - A. No, some bad language had passed between both parties; after that, I saw Miss Johnstone drive Cobb back again, and in a few seconds after that, I heard the report of the pistol, but I did not see it fired.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM WARNE. I am a watchman. The prosecutor stated this circumstance to me; I had seen the prisoner and another woman in and out of a house, and going down a street with two sailors - I took the prosecutor to a brothel, and the prisoner was there; he said she was the woman - she only said if she was to go she would go; this was near three o'clock: I asked her several times what was become of the things - she gave me no answer; I cannot say whether she was sober, but the prosecutor was as sober as he is now.</p>

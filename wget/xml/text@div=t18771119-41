I found my husband in bed—I don't remember anything more—I dare say we exchanged some words—I found myself in blood—I was kicked—this is his boot (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there is a stain on the end of it—I got no blows or kicks from anybody else—there was nobody else from whom I could receive the injuries.</p>

I am the wife of George "Whitman, of 9, Stacey Street, and am the daughter of the last witness—at about 9.30 on the night of the 20th October my mother came to me—her face was swollen and there was a little blood on her nose—I went home with her, and went back on the Dials again and finished my business, and then went home and found my mother had fainted, and was covered with blood—I live in the same house with her—when I went up the prisoner was lying on the bed—I cannot swear whether he had his boots on, or whether he was asleep.</p>

I am house-surgeon at Charing Cross Hospital the prosecutrix was brought there on the morning of the 21st—she was bleeding freely, and on examination she was found to have a lacerated wound about half an inch long in the lower part of the body, from, which blood was issuing—she had probably lost much blood—it would be occasioned by great violence—by a kick most certainly—apart from the loss of blood the wound was not very dangerous—I believe she can now follow her occupation again—she remained in the hospital a fortnight and was then dismissed.</p>

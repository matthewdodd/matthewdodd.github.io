                  </hi>. I am cashier to Hey wood &amp; Co., Liverpool—on 19th August, some person applied to me for a draft for 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on our London agents, Barclay &amp; Co.—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the draft we so granted—he also applied for a draft for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to William Gant, at the same time, on Barclay &amp; Co.—he gave me written particulars of the drafts in this small memorandum, in which he gives the name of Charles Rocher and W. Gant as the persons to whom the drafts were to be made payable—he gave me a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, 600,741, and I gave him the change—this is my original book—the large draft has been paid, and returned to us by Barclay's, but that for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is still outstanding—on 15th August, the same person came again fur a draft for 382<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Barclay's, in favour of Charles Rocher, and I issued to him this draft (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—part of the money be paid me, was two 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, M. 3. 78822 and 78823—this other draft for 382<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is forged, it is crossed "Midland Banking Company, Sheffield," and dated 15th August—it purports to have been issued from our place at Liverpool, but we did not issue, on 15th August, two drafts payable to Charles Rocher—holding this draft to the light, I can see part</p>

I have been reading the dates from the notes—I only note the numbers—I can say positively, that this 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note has passed through my hands, but whether more than once, I cannot say—it may occur on some days, that I do not give drafts on London—the number issued in a day varies, it is perhaps between 200 and 500 in a month—Mr. Anderton does not sign them all—this draft of 15th August, was the first piece of work I did that day—it is the first entry, and that enables me to say that it was shortly after 10 o'clock—this is the only book I used that day, and this is the original entry—the book also refers on the other side to cheques cashed over the counter—I am cashier—it is necessary that these entries should be made at the time, because there are not always vouchers for money received—it is very unlikely that I received no money before 12 o'clock—the very next entry convinces me that the first entry was made early in the morning; it refers to a bill which was due on the previous day, and which was handed by us to the notary, who brought back in the morning with the money—that would be done early—I will swear it was done before 10.30; and there is another reason, the next entry is a dividend warrant, which must have come to us by post, and it was intended to be sent out for collection—I have not got the dividend warrant here, or the envelope of it—dividend warrants are occasionally banded to us by our customers, but they generally come by post; this came by post, in all probability, as it is from a oust otter who is never in town, and who always sends it by letter—my attention bat never been called to this third entry till now, nor to the second entry—the person came on 12th August, about mid-day, I should say—it is rare for another cashier to take my place during dinner, and in both then cases I can swear I received the money myself—I say that it was in the middle of the day, from the position it occupies in my book—that it in reference both to the entries before and after it—I cannot tell to half an hour—the middle of the day is generally a slack time—the person would ant be there more them three or four minutes—this memorandum was left with me, it was not written in my presents, but handed to one—these figures on it are copied from my book—you cannot see the remains of these letters without a magnifying glass—I cannot say that the prisoner is the person I saw on either of those two occasions; there was nothing to call my attention to him—I think it was the tame person on both occasions.</p>

Arnold, Charing Cross Hotel—I particularly noticed him, because he was anxious to know if he could get the money at a moment's notice, which is a very unusual thing for depositors—I told him he could not have it till the expiration of fourteen days—he appeared to accede to the terms, and handed me 220<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes, and eighty sovereigns—I handed the notes to Mr. Ryan, a dark whose duty it was to enter them in a book—I issue the papers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) for the infor<lb></lb>mation of persons wanting to deposit—It is not a special form for one bank—I have no doubt this is one of our forms, but "Union Bank of London" has been torn off—I thought Charing Cross Hotel rather a vague address, and asked the prisoner whether he was employed there; he said no, he put up there when he came to London—I gave him the usual deposit receipt—we require no reference from depositors.</p>

I am clerk to Baum, Son &amp; Co., money dealers, of Lom<lb></lb>bard Street—on 26th July I was applied to by some person for a draft for 5600 francs on Paris, payable to Louis Pratt—I made out this draft, and it was signed by Mr. Baum, one of the firm—this was the only draft issued for this amount—the genuine draft was returned front our Paris agent as paid—this draft "B," dated 26th July, for 5500 francs, is a facsimile of the other, with the exception of the signature and the writing—it is on one of our forms, but it is a forgery—we do many transactions in small amounts, and it is impossible to say when the whole of our hills come in, especially since the war.</p>

On Wednesday, 31st August, about 3 in the afternoon, I was with Haydon, a brother officer, in Norfolk Street, Strand—I had received information and a description from Mr. Harris and Mr. Jones, at the Union Bank—I saw the prisoner come out of the Belle Vue Hotel, 21, Norfolk Street—we followed him to the Bavarian beer-house, Strand, where he remained till 4 o'clock—he then went to Castle Street, Leicester Square, and was looking in at a picture shop—I touched him on the shoulder, and said "How do you do, Sir?"—he said "I don't know you"—I said "I dare say not; we are two detective officers; there have been many forgeries committed in various parts of the country, Liverpool, Manchester, and Sheffield; and from the description of the person committing them, I think you answer it. On 10th August, a draft for 382<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was uttered at Sheffield, do you know anything at all about it?"—he said "No, I know nothing about it"—I said, "Perhaps you will give us your name?"—he said "Yes, my name is Spinelli, and I live in Norfolk Street, Strand"—I said "Did you, on 18th August, deposit in the Union Bank, Pall Mall, 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—he said, "No, I have no money in any bank"—Haydon said "Perhaps you will have no objec<lb></lb>tion to go into the bank with us?—he said "Certainly not, I will go"—he and I walked together to Pall Mall, and on the road he said "How far is the Union Bank; I don't know it?"—when we arrived I saw Mr. Jones, and said "I have called with this gentleman respecting the deposit of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 18th August"—Mr. Jones looked at him, and said to me, "Yes, I have a very strong belief that that is the man who deposited the money"—I then told the prisoner to consider himself in custody; he made no reply—Sergeant Haydon searched him—he asked his name; he said he should not give it till he saw the American Consul—I told him his name was Spinelli, but he would not have that name—I went on the same day to the Belle Vue Hotel, to a room which the head waiter showed me on the ground floor, and received this portmanteau and other things from the landlord—I opened it with a key, which Haydon took from the prisoner at the station, and found in it, among other things, two bottles, a brush, a sheet of glass, and between the leaves of a book was this draft on Rothschild's.</p>

I am in the service of James Howe, chemical apparatus maker, of 2, Foster Lane, City, I have a particular knowledge of chemistry—I have examined these two bottles, this one contains hyperchloride of lime and several other things, the other contains hydrochloric acid, and this is powdered resin; this brush has been used with these substances—either of these ingredients will remove ink marks from paper—It is best to use one first, and give a finishing touch with the other; it requires a little manoeuvring to do it well—a piece of glass would be useful to support the paper, which must be laid on something smooth—I have used it myself, and taken marks out of paper with it—I have seen this draft for 382<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and under the thick writing, I can trace some faint letters, which I have developed with gallic and tannic acid, which supposing it had been submitted to these solutions, would develope the parts where the iron from the ink remained—after I had done that, I saw the letters "W and "G" faintly appear, and part of the "E" in Esqre., and the "£" where the writing would be 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and part of the "d" in "pound, "and the "f" in "fourteen"—I could trace no letters on this plain form of Messrs. Roths-child when the police gave it to me, but I submitted it to a similar process to develope some of the ink, and developed "I <hi rend="italic">Aout</hi> "and some other words which I could not distinguish, and part of the amount—I have actually drawn out the ink marks from paper with these articles—I have also done it on one of the forms from Manchester, and on one of the Liverpool drafts; it takes the ink clean out.</p>

I actually used the contents of these two bottles; this green bottle was not originally sold with the contents I found in it—It has contained something for the teeth—It has a fresh label—I should think it very improbable that these chemicals were used for anastatic printing—they convert the organic substance into another combination—if I wrote with this fluid I know nothing to make it visible; it will merely decompose colouring matter—the original substance is washed out of the paper; it may leave a little of the ink behind, which tannic acid will reproduce—it requires care—the names of these acids are very similar in French—a person must know how to apply chemistry to use this process—it can be done so per-fectly that no trace of the ink is left.</p>

We put down the numbers of the rooms occupied in the book, and we put against than the articles which the person has in the day—this is the number of persons in the house, and we make a note of those who do not dine—the prisoner never had a bottle of Medoc with cold meat, from first to last—he dined there on the days that I find wine charged against him, and independent of that, his number is down among the people in my book—there is an absence of any memorandum that he did not dine—he dined on the days I find his number down and Medoc charged—a gentleman from the prosecution has been several times to look at the books, and has examined them carefully—there was nothing unusual about the prisoner's conduct at the hotel; some gentlemen have no visitors—I received plenty of letters addressed in the name of Spinelli, in due course of post, which I delivered to the prisoner—some of them were from Spain—Mrs. Culver well has been requited to attend to-day, but she is unwell—It would be very rude if I were to cross-examine gentlemen leaving the hotel as to where they are going—the prisoner did not converse with me on the subject of his movements—assuming for a moment that I had only seen the prisoner once and the other man once, I might make a mistake between them; but I was familiar with the prisoner from having seen him many times—they resembled one another closely.</p>

On the 23d of September, I missed a jacket, which I had hung up on the window at the office; it was there when I went to breakfast, and when I came back it was gone - we searched, and found it in one of the flues; we sent for the officer; I did not know the prisoner before, and never saw him in possession of my jacket.</p>

            . I am an officer, and have the care of these docks. On the 23d of September, I heard the coat was lost - I went and secreted myself in a place near the flue, and about a quarter-past six o'clock, the prisoner came and tried to get into the place where I was - the men should have left about ten minutes before that; he could not get in, he went down, and got into the flue, and came out with something; the bricks on which I stood gave way- he heard the noise, and crept into the flue again, and came out without any thing; he then caught hold of me; I called for the beadle, who came and took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Can you say you saw him with any coat or jacket? A. It was something dark - I cannot swear what it was.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you find any coat in the flue? A. Yes - I went into the flue, and found this jacket, but it was removed from where it had been; I have no hesitation in saying he had it; I cannot swear positively it was the coat - I suppose there are about two thousand men on the premises.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean you saw the prisoner take it from the nail it was hung on? A. No - the men go away about five minutes past six o'clock; the bell rings just before.</p>

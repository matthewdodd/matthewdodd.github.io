                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Joint Stock Registry Office, Somerset House—I produce the articles of association of the Artizans', Labourers', and General Dwellings Company, Limited—it is signed in the usual way by seven subscribers for fifty-five shares—the first is James Shaw Lowe, of 125, Devonshire Road, Middlesex,</p>

               <p>commission agent—he took ten shares—the date of registration is 8th January, 1867, and the memorandum is signed on 31st December, 1866—the second subscriber is William Swindlehurst, of 41, Guildford Place, Kennington Lane, Surrey, engineer, for ten shares. The object of the Company is the purchase or acquirement from time to time of leasehold, copyhold, or other land situated within the metropolitan district, and the erection thereon of dwellings for the labouring classes, and of buildings to be used as schools and working men's clubs—the capital is 250,0007., which was originally divided into shares of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each. Article of association 61 states that directors attending any meeting of the board shall be entitled to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as remuneration for their services—article 109 is as to the appointment of officers, and states that William Swindlehurst, of Kennington, shall be the first secretary, at a salary of not less than 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—on 21st December, 1869, special resolutions were passed, which were con<lb></lb>finned in January, 1870, and instead of the 109th section, in its original form, I find a resolution that the words "shall be the first secretary" shall be expunged, and the words "permanent secretary" inserted in their place—on 8th October a further resolution was passed, which was also duly confirmed and registered, "That the capital shall be increased from 250,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to a million"—the first list of share-holders is to December, 1868, and the last is to 1876.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer, of 4, Whitehall—in 1874 All Souls' College, Oxford, entrusted me with some property close to the Harrow Road, consisting of seventy-one acres two perches—I advertised it for six weeks in all the principal London papers and in the local papers, the auction to take place in April, 1874—the property was divided into five lots—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are my particulars of sale—lot 2 was sold to Messrs. Kelly, builders, for 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit was paid and the contract signed—that consisted of sixteen acres, three roods, thirty-five perches—on 16th April, two days afterwards, Saffery called on me—refreshing my memory from my diary, I told him that the price of lots 1, 3, 4, and 5 as a whole would be 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and nothing less would be taken—those lots were not sold at the auction, as there was not sufficient bidding, and they were bought in—my impression is that Saffery said that he was looking out for an estate for a building society—he came again on 23rd April, 18/4, and I have entered, "Attending Mr. Saffery, when I told him the price was 22,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for lots 3, 4, and 5, and that a portion of the purchase money might be on mortgage; that I. would not negotiate with anybody else for one month, and that a deposit of 10 per cent. would have to be paid—the deposit was not for keeping it open—on 18th Hay I saw him again, and have entered, "Attending Mr. Saffery, when he offered to purchase lots 3, 4, and 5 for 22,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if he Could purchase; lot 2 for 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;" that was the lot we had sold to Kelly at the auction—on the 22nd I have, "Attending Mr. Longeroft with Mr. Saffry and Mr. Kelly, and conferring as to the proposed purchase of lots 3, 4, and 5, and the relinquishment of lot 2, agreed to defer matter till to-morrow for certain preliminaries"—Mr. Kelly had been in communication with Mr. Saffery on the subject of selling the lot he had bought, and I believe he wanted several thousand pounds as a profit upon the transaction, as he, being a builder, would lose his</p>

               <p>profit through not covering the land with houses; and at a meeting at our office, not sought by me, the preliminaries were arranged as to the price Mr. Kelly was to pay to Mr. Safford I presume—Mr. Longcroft was there, but I do not think he took any part in the discussion; I only knew that he was a solicitor—I did not know for whom, nor had I heard of the Artizans' Company at that time—on 23rd I have an entry, "Attending Mr. Saffery with Mr. Surtees, cancelling the original agreement of lot 2, returned deposit of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. less 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and entered into fresh agreement with Mr. Saffery for the sale of lots 2, 3, and 4 for 32,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., receiving contracts, &amp;c."—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the contract that was executed—All Souls' College are the vendors, and the Artizans' Company the vendees—this is the original agreement with Kelly can<lb></lb>celling lots 2, 3, 4, 5.

Longcroft, on the part of the Artizans' Dwellings Company.</hi>) On 20th July Saffery came again and offered me 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for lot I—I think he called again on 7th August, when I did not see him—I saw him on 12th August, when he said that he wanted another fortnight, and I gave him till the 28th instant, the purchase to be paid to the commissioners, and we were, if possible, to get a mortgage—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a copy of the con<lb></lb>tract which was prepared, and I signed it on 23rd September—it is for the sale of lot 1 for 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and a deposit was paid of 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not got the original.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Me. Serjeant Ballantine. I have a memorandum of a letter to Mr. Purvis, the land agent—I cannot give you the date of it; it was some time in August, and a letter, dated 23rd July, from Saffery Brothers to Mr. Purvis—with regard to all the lots I was dealing with Saffery as the probable purchaser—I knew no one else in the matter, and he negotiated with me in a very straightforward manner—I had a certain price given me by the Bursar at which to sell, and not less, which was fixed by the copy-hold commissioners—those were the prices I gave to Saffery, and I gave him a certain point which was afterwards extended, and I should not have sold it to anybody else during that interval—Kelly bought lot 2 for 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and an arrangement was made in an adjoining room between them for Kelly to abandon his purchase for 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit was paid back.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Sir Henry James. The Harrow Road estate was rather more than seventy acres, and when Kelly's lot 2 was taken away, that left above fifty-three acres—Kelly bought lot 2 by auction, and I tried to get the best price I could—I knew of his obtaining 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Saffery—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is' a document entered into between Saffery on behalf of the Company and Messrs. Kelly—Saffery told me when he wanted to purchase lots 3, 4, and 5, that it would depend upon his buying lot 2 from Kelly, and he wished me to negotiate with Kelly as to the amount he would take by way of profit, but I left them to settle it between them, saying; that I could be no party to it—the property in Harrow Road afforded great facility for building purposes—property in the neigh<lb></lb>bourhood had been increasing in value, and this had been for sale for years—the land contained brick-earth—building operations had been largely extended in that district—they had built up to the</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I do not know where the money came from that Kelly got—I was no party to the transaction—when the agreement was cancelled this agreement (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was handed to me—this other agreement is with Mr. Longcroft—this I am a party to, but the other I am not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of 1, Clement's Inn, and have been in the profession eight years—I know the three defen<lb></lb>dants and also Mr. Lowe, who is not here—in 1869 or 1870 I was appointed solicitor to the Artizans', Labourers', and General Dwellings Company, Limited, through Mr. Swindlehurst's intervention, who was then manager and secretary of the Company—I had known him about a year before that—I did not know any of the other defendants before I was appointed—Swindlehurst was not a director when I joined, but he became a director about two years afterwards—from 1870 downwards he remained chairman—Mr. Lowe was a director when I joined, and continued so down to this prosecution, but he did not act on any committee that I know of—I do not know that there was a finance committee—I was aware during 1872 of business being done between Swindlehurst and Mr. Saffery in connection with the Shaftesbury Park estate—I have some notes here made by myself with reference to the Queen's Park estate—I do not keep a diary—the first entry I have is 19th May, 1874, "Attending Mr. Swindlehurst as to the purchase, conferring as to the arrangements, so as to attend to the different interests, and he is to see Mr. Saffery and see me again to-morrow"—I have no doubt Mr. Swindlehurst told me that it was proposed by the Company to buy the estate—I do not recollect whether Mr. Kelly's name was mentioned at that interview, but I believe it was—an arrangement was made for a meeting next day, and on 20th May I saw Swindlehurst again—he showed me the letter, which is in Saffery's writing—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated 20th May, and signed Edward Saffery, offer<lb></lb>ing to sell the estate for</hi> 45,312<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 3,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">to he paid on signing contract, and</hi> 16,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">to remain on mortgage at</hi> 4 <hi rend="italic">per cent.</hi>)—my entry is" 20th May, at<lb></lb>tending Mr. Saffery, terms of agreement arranged, and I was to prepare contract"—I did not know then of the interest of All Souls' College in the property, or that it was passing through Messrs. Driver's hands—the contract was prepared on the 21st, and signed on the same day—I did not consult the board before preparing it—I do not think Saffery was present while it was being performed—on the same day I have "Attend<lb></lb>ing Mr. Swindlehurst at Westminster, long conference thereupon, and arrangement with Mr. Langley"—I have an item here saying that I attended Mr. Langley in an interview with Swindlehurst the same day, but I should not like to swear to it because these items are not always correct: they are entered every two or three days, and I have been in the habit of entering not only what took place, but what I intended to do—those entries were generally made within two or three days of the event—I have an entry in my diary of attending Mr. Langley at Lincoln's Inn Fields and arranging further, "and on the same day "Attending Mr. Saffery in the City, when it appeared there was a difficulty between him and Kelly us to this contract, which was not cancelled, and he will see me to-morrow morning"—I did not see the Harrow road property till</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Sir Henry Lutes. I sometimes attended the board meetings, not often—I was aware that Mr. Walton was one of the directors, I learned that he had been a builder—the other directors, Mr. Hoskins, who principally attended, Mr. Russell, Mr. Lowe, and Mr. Langley, principally managed the Company—their object was to obtain property upon which cottages could be built for the poorer class of people who were dispossessed of dwellings elsewhere, where there was early commun cation with the places where they had to work—the Company increased in prosperity as it went on, and Mr. Swindlehurst apparently gave the whole of his time to its interests, he appeared to work hard and do his best—I know Mr. Mar in connection with the interests of the Company, he was a land agent or surveyor in the Adelphi—I don't re<lb></lb>member coming in contact with him, but I have known him very well by name, he was a person upon whom I would have relied—Mr. Walton also had, I believe, a sound practical knowledge of his trade—the first communication made to me as to Queen's Hall estate was on 19th May. 1874, by Mr. Swindlehurst, who was invariably the channel by which communications were made to me on behalf of the Company—I should have been surprised if I had received communications from anybody else</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187710220015"></xptr>
               <p>—the letter of 20th May was the next thing brought to my attention—I had nothing to do with preparing that letter, that was the first I knew of it—I drew the memorandum of agreement of 23rd May—the wording is mine, I did not receive any directions as to the wording from Mr. Swindlehurst—the deposit money to be paid was 3,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 32,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at 10 per cent. on the 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. premium which Kelly was to receive for profit, so that the deposit of 3,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had to be increased to 3,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went to Mr. Driver's with Mr. Saffery—it was openly discussed that Saffery was making over whatever was his supposed interest in the Artizans' Dwellings Company, and that All Souls' College was to convey direct to the Artizans' Dwellings Company—I signed as representing the Artizans' Dwellings Company—there was no concealment—although Saffery had negotiated with Mr. Driver it was I who paid the 3,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was no concealment about that—I was aware that Saffery had been the agent, and that he was standing out and letting me deal with Driver—there was no concealment about it—I had nothing to do with the negotiation between Saffery and Kellys as to that premium; but when I saw them at Driver's I knew that they were to obtain a premium, 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the auction was on 14th April—I knew they were going there to give up the purchase, but the consideration for doing so I did not know till 23rd May—I believe I gave the deposit direct to Kelly—I passed the 3,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque through my bankers—they received the money from the Com<lb></lb>pany's bankers, crediting it to my account, and I drawing a fresh cheque—obtaining lot 2 was always necessary to the beneficial holding of lots 3, 4, and 5—lot I was an advantageous purchase in the sense of render<lb></lb>ing the rest more valuable—I received first 3,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit, and afterwards a cheque for 11,912<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., out of which I paid 9,312<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Mr. Saffery—every<lb></lb>thing I received went into the general account, mixed up with my other money, and for a certain time lay to my credit in my bankers' hands under my control, so that I could have drawn it out—I believe Swindlehurst told me the manner in which the cheque for 9,312<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be cashed; but I should not like to swear whether it was he or Saffery—I cannot remember telling the board that Saffery was receiving money for his interest in the re-sale; my belief is that they were aware of it, or else I should have considered it my duty to tell them—I had no desire to keep it from them, and I had every reason to believe they all knew it; the cheques were drawn for separate amounts—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is an agreement between Mr. Driver and Messrs. Kelly, by which Messrs. Kelly gave up lot 2 for a consideration of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which is a nominal sum—the next agreement was on 23rd May also, by which the price of 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be paid by me to Messrs. Kelly—that arrangement had been made by Saffery, and that agreement would make a valid and binding contract between the parties—my counsel drew this release of 7th August, 1874 (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>), that is a formal release, and it is executed by Messrs. Kelly and Saffery—the next is a conveyance executed between the College and the Company, and the next is between Messrs. Kelly, Saffery, the College, and the Company, dated 18th November—that deed belongs to the Company, that forms their title deed, any of the directors would see what was the transaction carried out—that was prepared by me—if money was raised upon that, that would appear to the solicitor for the mortgagees—I conveyed lots 1 and 2 separately in February—the word "agreed" is left out of the deed of 30th October by which Saffery conveys lot 1—in</p>

               <p>relation to lot I there was no concealment that Mr. Saffery was obtaining the 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. advance—I am doing business for the Company now, and am aware that they have taken several proceedings to recover the sums alleged to have been received by the defendants.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. I have no retainer or salary from the Company—I am only paid in the way of costs—I have my own fees—I have attended some board meetings; not most of them; but only when I had notice to attend—no other legal gentleman was consulted—I was their only adviser on all questions connected with law—I took it for granted that Mr. Saffery was to gain more or less by the transaction—if he took exorbitant profits it was my duty to call the attention of the Company to the fact if I knew it—I never asked a ques<lb></lb>tion of the directors about that, nor did any of them speak to me on the subject—I mean to represent to the jury, that no communication passed between me and my client on the subject—the question of amount had nothing to do with me—I do not advise the Company as to the price they are to pay, and I never thought it necessary to inquire—I did not know, but I have since ascertained that a gentleman named Spence originally introduced the whole affair to Saffery—I think Mr. Swindle hurst mentioned Spence with reference to Shaftesbury Park—I cannot say whether his name was mentioned in relation to Queen's Park—I knew Spence was being sued—a large portion of the Queen's Park property has been built over since its purchase by the Company, as much as 900 houses, they are also occupied very quickly—I think it is a very valuable property.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I believe the proceedings were taken by the committee of investigation; the prosecution is by the Treasury; it has nothing to do with the Company—I should call Spence a general agent—I have known him personally—I never asked Saffery what he was getting, and he did not tell me—I first heard that he was obtaining 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when the contract was signed—my attention had been directed to the fact that the cheque was for 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and not for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I left for the Continent on 9th August, and returned home on 1st or 2nd September—when I said that there was no concealment I meant that the amount appeared on the contract with Driver—by my pass-book the cheque for 9,312<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid into my bank on 13th July, 1874; my balance was then 650<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid in at the same time—nothing was paid in to swell my balance between the time when the 11,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid in and the 9,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid out—turning to the other cheques, 3,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. first, and 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. afterwards, it appears that the sum paid out came from the money which was paid in before—as to the deed of 1st August, I received the information embodied in it principally from the document which had been signed—I do not think it was drawn by counsel—both Saffery and the solicitor told me that there was a contract between Kelly and Saffery—the same answer applies to the recital between the Kellys and Saffery.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). The Can Hall estate was first brought to my notice on 16th March, 1876—I had previously heard of a correspondence about it—I received a draft contract from Messrs. Cheston, Mr. Saffery's solicitors, on 7th March—the draft would be returned to Messrs. Cheston—I have a copy of it—I also received a letter referring me to Mr. Callington to proceed with the purchase—I saw Swindlehurst about 8th March, and I have no doubt I showed him the contract—the original price is 51,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and no mention is made of a deposit of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the original contract—I received a letter from Messrs. Cheston about 10th March, asking for a deposit—I communicated with Mr. Swindlehurst, and in consequence of what passed the draft contract was altered to its present form—the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit is inserted in red ink in consequence of what passed—the contract was signed on 16th March by Saffery and myself—there is also a counterpart—I do not know who signed that: either Swindlehurst or myself—it was subject to confirma<lb></lb>tion at the next board meeting, as regards the mode of payment—on the same day I paid Mr. Saffery 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by this Bank of England cheque crossed "Alliance Bank"—it is endorsed by him—I also saw Swindle hurst that day, and an arrangement was made for my receiving 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I think I had advanced for convenience, and my clerk received it the following day, the 17th—the contract between Saffery and Callington was then in my safe—Saffery brought it—Swindlehurst said he had lent Saffery 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to prevent his negotiating a contract with anybody else, and that Saffery would deposit the contract with me as security—I credited Swindlehurst with the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I produce the account—I saw Saffery on 17th with respect to how the property should be conveyed—as his contract with Callington ought to have been completed on 25th March, and there was not much time, I suggested that there should be one conveyance with</p>

               <p>Colgrave and Saffery—I think he said he would see his solicitor—I received the abstract from Saffery's solicitors, Messrs. Cheston—on 21st March I went to the Company's office for the 19,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Swindlehurst was not there—I saw Mr. Saffery and Mr. Cheston that day—I required that Saffery should be a party to the conveyance along with the original vendor—the cheque for 19,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid by a clerk—on 23rd March, I delivered the requisitions to Messrs. Callington, the solicitors for the vendors, and they and Mr. Saffery saw me on the 24th—Mr. Saffery did not like the conveyance being taken by the two parties at once—he did not care about his client seeing that the person to whom he sold it had sold it for a larger sum, and suggested that the conveyance should be direct to Saffery, and after discussion the matter was referred to Mr. Burrows, a convincing counsel, and it was arranged that the property should be conveyed direct from the vendor to the Company, and that Mr. Saffery should be a contracting party, and that a mortgage of 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. should be executed—I saw Mr. Saffery again on 27th March, and it was arranged that I should prepare a release of his interest in the property in favour of the Company—Mr. Spence called on me on 3rd April—on the 7th I prepared the release on the chance of our not being able to settle it in any other way, but it was not executed—I saw Mr. Callington on 10th April—I afterwards saw Saffery on the subject, and it was arranged that bills should be given for the instalments instead of cash—I do not know whose arrangement that was—I think I consulted Mr. Swindlehurst—I certainly consulted somebody—I had a special meeting with Swindlehurst to arrange how the conveyance should be carried out—I have an entry on 12th April to the effect that I saw Dr. Langley as to the Can Hall estate,' but I do not remember seeing him—I saw him very frequently, and I have letters to that effect—I believe I did not see him on that subject—the cheque for the completion of the purchase was paid on 12th April—it was my cheque, and made payable to Messrs. Callington for 14,158<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on that day I paid Mr. Saffery 9,408<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. by this cheque to his order on the Alliance Bank—I had previously received a cheque from Swindlehurst for 19,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to enable me to make this payment—I gave Mr. Saffery an undertaking to obtain from the Company in the course of a few days an acceptance for 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never received the bills for the Company—I have applied to Swindlehurst for them—he said he thought it would be objectionable for bills of the Company to be given, and suggested that I should see Saffery and arrange for immediate pay<lb></lb>ment—Mr. Saffery had applied for the bills two or three times—I com<lb></lb>municated that to Swindlehurst—I paid the 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Spence, drawing a cheque and sending to the bank for notes as I had done before, and I handed the notes to Spence—that was in consequence of a letter from Saffery requesting me to pay Spence, and requesting my undertaking for the bills—it is usual to pay a large sum in notes and not by cheque, but it depends upon whom we are dealing with—I do not remember Saffery asking me for the notes—I paid the notes two days after—I refused to pay till I had an undertaking—this is the cheque signed by Saffery and produced to me by Spence—it is dated 12th May, 1876—I do not remem<lb></lb>ber if the cheque was paid in anything else than 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—I have no doubt I instructed my clerk about it—until these proceedings com<lb></lb>menced I had no knowledge that the deposit put down by Saffery in the first instance had been found by Swindlehurst, or that any portion paid</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR HENRY JAMES</hi>. I first heard that Saffery had obtained the agreement of 30th December, 1875, about six weeks before I signed the contract with him, or before 16th March, 1876—I had casually heard of the Can Hall estate twelve months before—I wrote the letter to Swindlehurst of 24th January, 1876—Saffery obtained the contract with Colgrave—the contract was left with me—I have no memo<lb></lb>randum when I received it—the agreement was deposited with me as security for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said Saffery and Swindlehurst were at arm's length, but I did not know why I considered he wanted the contract lodged as security—I dealt in the first instance with Messrs. Cheston, who acted in the usual way for a person selling—I drew the deed of conveyance from Colgrave—it is dated 24th March, and it was executed on 12th April—the original contract price was 51,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was afterwards reduced to 48,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., being a reduction of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. an acre—I wished the price to appear on the face of the deed—it was left to me—the fact of a premium being paid is recited in the deed—the receipt is put in the usual way—Mr. Callington witnessed it—it was settled by Mr. Burrows—Swindlehurst and Saffery had nothing to do with the arrangement of the deed—the 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that Saffery was to receive was to be paid by acceptances in two sets of 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not remember any objection to that being done at that time, but it was said that it would not do the Company any good—when it was proposed that a change should be made from acceptances to cash, a suggestion was made by Swindlehurst that Saffery should make a rebate on account of receiving cash instead of acceptances—Saffery said he would not consent to a rebate unless he had a mortgage, and insisted upon having the whole sum, and he had to be repaid in full—I came into communication with Spence—I do not know who introduced him, or how the money was to be divided—I have tried to obtain some of this land since for myself—I received a letter on 7th of March from Messrs. Callington about it; 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. An acre was asked for it, and it was said that less than 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would not be entertained—I got it down eventually to 840<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. an acre for thirty-two acres after a portion had been taken away—I saw the land several times—I was offering for myself and a client—I wanted to make money by it—I wanted to buy and resell—it is a common thing for people to become middlemen—I was prepared to so act if I succeeded in buying it—people sometimes deal with private individuals at cheaper rates than they do with companies.</p>

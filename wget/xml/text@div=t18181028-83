On Saturday night, the 12th of September, I was returning from my pay-table. I was a little in liquor. I do not know the time. The prisoner came up, pushed me down, and another man picked my pocket of 19s. and ran away. I am certain the prisoner is the man. The watchman came up and took him. It was in <placeName id="t18181028-83-crimeloc488">Whitechapel</placeName>

               <p>DANIEL BEVAN. I am a watchman. At half-past one o'clock in the morning, the prosecutor stood at the corner of Black-horse-yard. I saw two men cross to him, one pushed him down. I went over; one got up and walked away before I could get over. The other was helping the prosecutor up, and begging his pardon. He missed his purse. I took the prisoner. The other man made off. The prosecutor said the prisoner held him, while the other man robbed him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The prisoner was in liquor.</p>

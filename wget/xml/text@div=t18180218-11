            . On the 31st of January I sold the meat to a retail butcher, and put it inside my shop, and left it in the care of Jarman - He delivers the meat; I was outside the shop about eight o'clock, when a person told me to go in, as a man was stealing it - I went in and found the prisoner detained. He said he came from Mr. Wilson, of Blackfriars-road, to fetch his pork. No person of that name had bought any.</p>
               <p>JOHN JARMAN. I am servant to the prosecutors. I weighed six sides of pork for Daniel Oakley, a butcher, and hung them on two hooks. At eight o'clock I saw the prisoner going out of the shop with three sides on his shoulder, I asked him where he was going with them, he said, he was going to take them to Mr. Wilson's cart; I told him they belonged to Mr. Oakley; he said it was all right, they were for Mr. Wilson. I told him to hang them up again, as they did not belong to him, and detained him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was employed to fetch it.</p>

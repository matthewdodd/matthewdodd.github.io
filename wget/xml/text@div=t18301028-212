               <p>MR. GURNISS. Measom never lived in Castle-street; I cannot remember this black cloth - I believe the waistcoat to be mine; I recollect this one being in my window - I know this remnant of cloth, pawned on the 30th of September, by certain marks about it; the prisoners had no authority from me to pawn any thing - I never knew Measom live in Charles-street or Charlotte-street; these two waistcoat pieces, pawned on the 15th of October, I am positive are mine.</p>
               <p>Measom's Defence. The black cloth Taylor bought of Mr. Gurniss, and I pawned it at his request; the black waistcoat with a roll collar Taylor had made up for himself - I went to fetch it home from Maria Bliss, and pawned it for him - I can say nothing to the rest.</p>
               <p>MR. GURNISS. Taylor had a yard and a half of black cloth placed to his account four or five months ago, and this is a yard and a half; but he told me he had had it made up a long time after - I am quite certain I never sold this waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Measom received a good character.</p>

            . I am accountant and principal officer in the Victualling Board Department. It is the custom for pursers in the navy to send us accounts of the provisions received by them, and the manner they are disposed of. The provisions are supplied agreeable to the demand which the captain may make. The purser usually writes the demand and the captain approves of it - it should be proportioned according to the number of men on board. The savings accounts are divided into messes - it is an account of such part of the provisions each mess takes up less than the proportion which is allowed.</p>
               <p>Q. What is done with these savings - A. When the purser renders an account of savings, the amount in money is placed to his credit in his account, in another department.</p>

            . I am post messenger to the Victualling-board, my business is to receive packets and letters passing through the post-office. I received a package<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182104110047"></xptr>dated the 20th of April, 1819, directed to the Commissioners of the Victualing-board. I made a memorandum of it at the time - it was in a square deal box. I received it at the post-office, and took it to Somerset-house. I opened the box myself, and saw the contents were the Purser's account of the Spartan. I paid twelve pounds fifteen shillings for the postage, on the 22d. When I opened the box, I took it to Mr. Geoghegan.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You received it at the post-office in the city - A. Yes; I did not make my memorandum from what is written on the outside of the box, but from the schedule of the accounts. I always look at the accounts myself, they are frequently in different parcels, and sometimes in one. The outside of the parcel generally has the contents written on it. It was done so in this instance, or I could not have taken the memorandum. I never recollect accounts being directed to be left at the post-office. The course of business is for me to go daily and fetch all the letters for the board - they are not sent.</p>

               <p>(Here the witness pointed out a variety of red ink marks, initials, letters, words, and figures, all of which he stated to be official, but as it was impossible to set them out in the indictment, it would only render the case complex to state them here.)</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury. - You have heard the charge on the part of the prosecution, I have therefore only to hope that upon mature deliberation you will clearly perceive, that no frand could have been contemplated on my part. First, as it regards the individuals in question, and next as it relates to my King. If these are forgeries my Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, they are in their tendency, of a most innocent and singular nature; Mr. Tills, Mr. Bell, and Mr. Gray, admit that they have not been defrauded; and that one member of their mess, has at different periods received various sums. Having said so much, and I trust carried conviction to your mind upon this part; I shall endeavour to shew, that so far from my King having been defrauded, the public have been benefited, in as much that by the documents in question I was returning to my country, a quantity of provisions at a lower rate than they could be procured under any other circumstances; at a lower rate than the government pay me upon the balance of my account, and thereby subjecting myself if in debt to the Crown, to four, five, and in some instances, six times the amount of the benefit I could possibly derive to be levied upon me, and my securities, to the extent of twelve hundred pounds, at any time the Commissioners for Victualling His Majesty's Navy might think proper. It now behoves me, my Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, to substantiate these assertions, by official documents under the different heads, to which I have alluded; in so doing it may be necessary to state for your information, the mode adopted for the renumeration of Purser's, which I am in hopes will more readily convey to you, an adequate feeling of the benefit derived by His Majesty's Government in a transaction of this nature; supposing for instance, my Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, there is one pound of bread due to any mess, I pay them one penny halfpenny; one gallon of rum, 2 s.; one piece of beef of 8 lb. 1 s. 6 d.; one piece of pork 4 1/2 d.; one pound of sugar, 4 d., and one pound of cocoa, 4 d. If I had a desire my Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, to defraud my country, I would pay this sum myself, and the Government must repay me 1/2 per pound in addition for bread, 4 d. per gallon in addition for rum; 2 d. per piece in addition for beef; 1 d. per piece in addition for pork 2 d. per pound in addition for butter as sugar, and 2 d. per pound in addition for cocoa, as cheese. If on the other hand my Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, I have drawn this money with a nefarious intent, I subject myself to be charged in place of one penny halfpenny for bread, four pence halfpenny; in place of 2 s. per gallon for rum, 12 s.; in place of 1 s. 6 d. per piece for beef 4 s. 8 d.; in place of 1 s. 3 d. per piece for pork, 3 s. 6 d.; in place of 4 d. per pound for sugar as butter, 1 s., and in place of 4 d. perpound for cocoa, as cheese, 1 s., or such other price as the several species may have cost His Majesty, in any part of the world. I beg most respectfully to state, that I have a wife with six children, dependent upon my personal exertion for support; I have received many wounds in defence of my country, and I trust that your verdict of this day, will be tempered with that humanity, which is so predominant in the breast of every English Judge and Juryman.</p>

            . I know the prisoner's hand writing - the receipt is his writing. The certificate purports to bear my signature, but is not my writing. I never saw the sums paid which it states I did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. What are the sums set opposite the persons names - A. Provisions saved by the ship's company, and for which they would be entitled to receive money.</p>

            . I was on board the Spartan, and at the head of the carpenter's mess. I did not receive this sum of 2 l. 4 s. 8 d. The receipt is not my writing. He never paid me that money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did you ever receive an equivalent - A. Not to my knowledge. I was in the habit of receiving one species of provisions for another. I am not indebted to him. He never made any demand on me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever authorize him to put your name to this receipt - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. How do you settle the difference between a superior and an inferior article - A. If I take more than the portion allowed, he would have a demand on me; but I took a less quantity. If I wanted wine instead of gin, the quantity of wine would be equal in value to the gin.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. I believe you admit that, at various times, you were creditor to different species of provisions - A. I kept no account.</p>
               <p>Q. I could have charged for the provisions you had, a higher price than what I should have to charge for the savings - A. Yes. One member of my mess was a boy, in the early part of the time, I believe he received sums from the steward, as savings for rum, but that is a separate account altogether.</p>

            . I was first steward of the Spartan. The signature to this certificate is not mine. The account is an account of savings paid to the men. No transaction of the sort took place on board the ship, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Were the boys paid grog money - A. They had an allowance of money instead of grog - but not under this certificate.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. This certificate is for meat and bread - A. Yes. I never knew him pay any money for savings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There are numerous documents taken to different officers to sign, when it is almost impossible for them to tell what they are. At times they write when the ship is reeling to and fro, and they sign them on their knees - and a few hours after, would say they had not signed them. I have sent Government regular accounts, and they have debited me with provisions, thereby subjecting myself to five or six times the amount I should be able to realize - they cannot be injured. The midshipmens' mess and the gun-room mess generously gave me leave to take what was due to them, in lieu of my contributing to their comforts. There are books in the office to prove the Government could not be injured.</p>

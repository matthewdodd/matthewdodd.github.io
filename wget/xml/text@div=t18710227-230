                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Ryder, who carries on busi<lb></lb>ness as London and Ryder, at 17, New Bond Street—on 12th January, in consequence of a message, I went to 4, Upper Berkeley Street, about 5.30—I took with me between 5000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 6000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of jewellery—the man who had called at our shop, and who gave his name Mark Tyrrell, opened the door—he apologized for his servant's absence, and asked me into a room on the ground floor, where I left my hat, and then I went up into the drawing-room—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a photograph of the man who called himself Mark Tyrrell—the prisoner was sitting by the drawing-room fire, and she remained sitting while I took out of my bag the ornaments which the man had seen at our establishment—I put the remainder of the jewellery in the bag, under a small round table—I stood on the nearest side of the table to the door, and Tyrrell and his wife on the other, looking at the jewellery, which was then in cases—I showed a necklace worth 1100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Tyrrell admired it and said he should like his wife to have that, or one with a diamond pendant which was worth 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one of two diamond half-hoop rings—the value of the things I had on the table was 2600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Tyrrell said that he thought his wife's sister had better see the things; he said to the prisoner "Go and call your sister"—she left the room, and I continued standing at the table, with my back to the door—she came back in I think two minutes, and said her sister would be there in a minute or two—I just turned round as the door opened; she came very quickly behind me and placed a handkerchief saturated with something over my face and mouth—there was a smell to it—as she did that the man rushed at me, caught me round the arms in front and clasped me—the handkerchief was still over my face—I struggled to get clear of the man, and also to get the handkerchief from my face—I managed to get it away for half a minute, but the man continued to hold me sometimes by the throat, and sometimes clasping his arms round my chest—the prisoner kept the handkerchief to my face when I allowed her to do so—it was applied to my face again continually—this went on for some minutes, and I was forced backwards on the sofa—I was becoming uncon<lb></lb>scious at that, time—when I was on the sofa the man held the handkerchief to my face—I became unconscious—I was strapped across my chest, and another strap went two or three times round my legs—I am not certain whether the prisoner was then in the room, but the man stood over me and said "If you move, I will murder you"—that was when I began to struggle to get up, having partially recovered my senses—I asked him to loosen the strap across my chest, and he did so, one hole—I then tried to get into a sitting posture, to look at the table, but he forced me down again and tied a handkerchief over my eyes—I do not think that was the same handker<lb></lb>chief which he had used before—he said that if I remained quiet, someone would be sent to me in ten minutes—I then heard him say "Quick, Lucy, with my hat"—after that I heard the street door slam—I ultimately got the straps that bound my wrists undone, and then undid that round my chest and legs, and broke the window and called for assistance—I have seen some straps in the custody of the police, those are what were used—I missed the jewels from the table, all except a small gold chain, but the cases were left about—the jewellery in the bag was left—the prisoner was dressed in fashionable style, as you would expect to see a lady—when assistance came, there was nobody in the house—these are two of the articles (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

I did not lose my senses at all while the prisoner had the handkerchief—I afterwards saw it in the man's hands, and all that time my senses were about me—after the man applied the handkerchief I lost my senses, and when I woke up I found myself strapped—I cannot form any idea how long I was in that state—I endeavoured to call out, but the handkerchief was over my mouth—I called out when it was away, as well as I could—I have said that before—I said that I endeavoured to raise an alarm—I fancy it was a few minutes only before I lost my senses—when the man went away I began at once to try to release myself.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">further submitted that there was no evidence that the prisoner was ever in Bath; he put the case of a wife stealing a watch in a shop in her husband's presence, in that case she would be entitled to an acquittal, and there was nothing in this case to take it out of the category of the cases quoted.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE RECORDER</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">considered that the presence of the husband raised only a presump<lb></lb>tion of coercion, which might be rebutted by evidence, and that Mr. Williams must address the Jury as to whether, upon the facts proved, the prisoner was acting under her husband's control or not.</hi>

               <p>Yes, you must; was it not for a sod - I attempt? - No, Sir, it was not, I was wrongfully accused.</p>
               <p>Was not you convicted before a Jury? - No, Sir, I was not, I was acquitted from this place.</p>
               <p>Oh, then you have been tried here besides? - I was tried without doubt in this place, and was acquitted; the person that prosecuted me about that was the boy's father.</p>
               <p>I ask you, Sir, have you never been in custody, under confinement? - Since that time?</p>
               <p>No, I mean then. - I believe that was four or five years ago.</p>
               <p>Somebody did think of committing you wrongfully; do you mean to swear that you was not convicted of that offence? - I do not understand you.</p>

               <p>Mr. Chetham. He was tried here for the actual crime, and acquitted. - I was not guilty of it, Sir.</p>
               <p>I did not ask you whether you was guilty; was not you tried for the offence itself, the capital offence? - I think I was.</p>
               <p>Court. Tell us what you have to say against the prisoners? - I live with Doctor Stence, a surgeon and apothecary, in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140118"></xptr> Drury-lane, I have lived with him some time.</p>

               <p>What gate was it you heard fall too? - That that goes into Piccadilly, opposite to Clarges-street.</p>
               <p>What gate was you at before the four young men came up? - I was near to the lodge gate, they put their hands into my breeches pocket, and took out four shillings and two sixpences, and a steel watch-chain and a steel key which I had not put to my watch, they were neither of them the prisoners at the bar that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Have you any thing else to say against the prisoners? - The prisoners were in company with the two that robbed me.</p>

               <p>Were the prisoners at the bar either of these two? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>You never had but four people come up? - No, these two were I believe in company, but they were not the men that robbed me, the other two escaped.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say that these men laid bands on you? - No, Sir, but they were present with those that did, I believe so, I have not sworn to them.</p>

            's.</p>
               <p>Was there any lamp in the neighbourhood near you? - No, Sir, but it was quite star-light.</p>
               <p>No moon? - No, Sir, they were rather close to me.</p>
               <p>Was there no moon? - I do not recollect that there was.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner Smith do? - He asked us a question, what we were, or something, he pulled out a pistol and asked me if I had any money, I told him I had but very little.</p>
               <p>Did Smith do any thing to Atwell? - No.</p>
               <p>After he pulled out the pistol what did he do to Atwell? - I cannot say, I heard one of the others ask Atwell if he had a watch, and he said he had.</p>
               <p>Did these men all come up together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you hear them converse together at all? - No, no further than that.</p>
               <p>What did the others do to Atwell? - The other said he has a watch, and one of the prisoners said rip him up then, and I saw them take a watch from his fob.</p>
               <p>What else was taken from him? - I could not see any thing else.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How long might they be there? - A very short time.</p>
               <p>Did you see them do any thing besides take the watch? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Had they time to take any thing but the watch? - Yes, they had, we were both together, I saw them have their hands in his pocket, but I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Can you describe the time at all? - No, I cannot, it was in the Park.</p>
               <p>Could you see the face of Smith? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you ever seen him before? - Never, I never saw him before, I could not distinguish the colour of his dress.</p>
               <p>Had he a hat on? - Yes.</p>
               <p>A round hat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long might they be there altogether? - I cannot tell how long.</p>
               <p>Can you make a guess? - I cannot.</p>

               <p>Were they there a minute? - I suppose they were, I cannot tell exactly.</p>
               <p>Now, can you safely venture to swear to the man's face by star light, no lamp nor other light, and with a round hat on, who was not with you above a minute? - When I went to Sir Sampson's, I said, Smith was the man.</p>
               <p>Was it a metal watch? - I take it to be silver, it was light enough to see it was silver.</p>
               <p>O, I forgot, how long have you been acquainted with Mr. Atwell? - I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>So you are a young gentleman living upon your personal fortune? - I must live by what I work for.</p>
               <p>That comes to the same thing in your way of trade; you was taking an airing in the Park in the evening? - I was going through the Park, I was going to St. James's.</p>
               <p>You visit at the palace perhaps? - I visit a sister that lives there.</p>
               <p>You was by the pond? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There are some seats there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What they call cooing places, I believe? - I never heard them called so.</p>
               <p>Was it a lady you was going to at the palace? - A young woman a servant.</p>
               <p>Does she paint her face? - Not to my knowledge.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140120"></xptr>You had the misfortune to lose a box of paint this night? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that now? - I had a box of lip salve for my sister.</p>
               <p>You are a single man, I think, Mr. Brown? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>How long may you have lodged in Butcher-row? - Not long, I lodged in Oxford-street, at Mr. Ward's, a druggist, before.</p>
               <p>You was coming in from Piccadilly into the Park? - I was, I had been into Piccadilly.</p>
               <p>With whom? - At a public house, I had been drinking tea.</p>


               <p>You never take any more vulgar liquors than tea? - Sometimes.</p>
               <p>What age may you be? - Seventeen last May.</p>
               <p>Is that the way you usually dress? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So Mr. Atwell asked you if you had a key of the park? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So then you entered into a little confab.? - We had no discourse at all only that he wanted the key.</p>
               <p>Are there not lamps at the gates of the park? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>No, why you know the gates of the park, as well as any body knows the pump at Aldgate? - I do not know that there are lamps.</p>
               <p>So you trusted you pretty person in the dark, and made this happy acquaintance? - No happy acquaintance at all.</p>
               <p>Have you enquired at all who he is? - No, Sir, he is nothing to me.</p>
               <p>When did you spend the evening with him last? - I have not spent the evening with him at all, I have not been in the Park since.</p>
               <p>The Park is a good pleasant place in the evenings? - It was not so pleasant to me.</p>
               <p>It was quite light enough to see a man's face? - I was immediately by the man, Smith was robbing me, I do not know that he touched Atwell, I have a letter in my pocket now that came from my uncle, which was found upon him.</p>
               <p>Pray may I ask you, as you have but small wages, though I tell you before hand, you have a right to refuse answering me, how you have supported yourself, what way of living have you had? - I had my money that I took in Bond-street, I lived there near seven months, my wages were small for the place to find every thing.</p>

               <p>minutes or half-past six in the morning, I came out at my door, and my attention was pointed to the iron railing, which I found had been forced out and put down in the cellar, on some baskets of potatoes—an iron grating had also been forced away and was in the cellar, so that any one could descend with the greatest ease—I went back, went to the back-parlour, and missed a number of things—I went into the cellar and found a small basket, four tumblers, a glass milk-pot, and a glass custard-cup, ready to be handed up from the cellar—they had been in the parlour the night before—I then went to the back parlour and missed a waterproof Mackintosh, a shawl, a pair of plated candlesticks, snuffers and tray, a silk umbrella, a teapot, and a small knife—I had seen them safe on the Friday night at half-past ten o'clock—on the table I found this cap and a screw-driver (<hi rend="italic">produced,</hi>) they are not mine, I never saw them before—on the following Sunday I found this other cap (<hi rend="italic">produced,</hi>) in the cellar at the back of the shop—on the following Saturday, the prisoner came and said he had come for a cap of his that I had there—I said, "I have a cap, but I don't know whether it is yours or no"—he said that it was a black shiney cap, with a piece of fur round the back—I said that was the sort of cap I had got; and he said, "That is mine, then"—I told him where I had found it, and I then observed that he had on my cap which I had missed from the back parlour—"This is it," I said, taking the cap off his head; "it is not a cap like this that I have"—he said, "No"—and I said to my boy, "Then, fetch a policeman"—he said, "Oh! if you are going to send for a policeman, I shall not stop; you know where to find me—if you want a policeman you can send for me"—I said, "I know where you are now, and if you will wait till the policeman comes, and give him satisfaction how your cap came in my place, you can go"—he said he should not stop—I said he should—he took a pipe from his mouth, caught hold of me by the neckcloth—I took hold of him, a struggle ensued, and he struck me—the policeman came—I went with him to the station, saw him searched, and this knife, which is one I missed from my wife's work-box, was found upon him—I am confident it is the same—this teapot and shawl are mine—the candlesticks are not found.</p>

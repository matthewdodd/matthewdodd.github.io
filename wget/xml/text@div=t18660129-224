                  </hi>. I am a provision merchant, of 1, Goswell-road—on the morning of 27th January, about 1 o'clock, I met Williams near the Angel, Islington—she said, "Good evening"—I went into the Bluecoat Boy public<lb></lb>house with her, and had something to drink—afterwards, we went a little higher up into another public-house—I had had a little drop, but I was sober—after leaving the second public-house, I wished her good night—she asked what time it was, and I took out my watch, a silver one, with a gold chain and seal attached to it—she snatched it away, and ran off across the road—I ran after her and overtook her, and had just got hold of her when somebody hit me on the back of the head, I do not know what with—I staggered, and somebody threw their arm round my neck and dragged me to the ground—I fell on my assailant's leg, or on some part of him—in falling, I managed to hold Williams by putting my legs round her legs—at that moment a policeman came up, and I became partly unconscious—my watch and chain were found directly afterwards—the police told me they had got it—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, N</hi> 44). I was on duty at half-past 1 o'clock on the morning in question, in Baron-street, and saw Mr. Robinson within a short distance of the Clinton arms, with Williams—I saw Deeley standing a short distance off—Williams suddenly ran away from the prosecutor, who followed her—they ran across the road, about thirty yards, and the pro<lb></lb>secutor took hold of her—Deeley was close behind, and as the prosecutor caught hold of Williams, he struck the prosecutor a blow on his head with his fist, and made him stagger—he then put his arm round Robinson's neck and they both fell down—the prosecutor clung his legs round Williams' legs, and she also fell—I saw all this as I was approaching—when I came up to them I spoke to the parties—Deeley's arm was still round Robinson's neck, and I said, "Leave go the man, you will choke him"—Robinson, as soon as he was released, said, "They have got my watch"—Deeley said, "I saw this man ill-using the woman; I have been watching them some time" Williams said, "I have got no watch; this man (meaning Deeley) is a stranger to me"—he said, "Yes, I know nothing of the woman, I am a respectable tradesman"—I then got them off the ground, and as they got up, I saw the watch lying between the prosecutor and Deeley on the pave<lb></lb>ment</p>

               <p>—the chain I directly after saw on the pavement, but nearer Williams' feet—the watch wee just as it is now; the glass was broken and the bow off—that was subsequently picked up and given to me by another person—I took the prisoners to the station—I searched Deeley, and found these two keys on him (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he gave his address 7, Gunpowder-alley, Shoe-lane—they were then put in the cell—after they had been there some time, Williams requested me to ask Deeley for her keys, and said, "I hare a baby locked up in the room"—I went to his cell door, and asked him if he had got the woman's keys—he said, "<hi rend="italic">Them</hi> keys that you took from me are hers; give them to her."</p>

               <p>Q. What made you suspect the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Apleford . I suspected her honesty.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Apleford. She used to come to me on days, to go of errands.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got them again?</p>
               <p>Apleford. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find them?</p>
               <p>Apleford. I found them at Mr. Hewitt's, a pawn-broker in Aldersgate-street. I taxed her with it, and she owned it.</p>
               <p>Q. When you taxed her with these things, did you tax her with stealing them?</p>
               <p>Apleford. Yes; and I went to the pawn-broker's, and found them there.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they pawned for?</p>
               <p>Apleford. She said she had pawned them for 40 s. and the pawn-broker said they were pawned for 30 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take her along with you to the pawn-broker's?</p>
               <p>Apleford. Yes.</p>

When she brought these gowns, I said to her, these gowns are not yours, for they are not of your size; and I said, who do they belong to? She said, to her mistress, and that she had sent them by her; and if I had not known her so long as I have, I would not have taken them in.</p>

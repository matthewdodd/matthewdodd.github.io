The prisoner came on Monday last to buy a ring; she came at near five in the afternoon, and said there was a ring in the window. she should be glad to look at; she had a companion with her whom she bid show me the ring as it hung in the window; her companion went out, and pointed to the ring. It had a couple of tickets to it; the prisoner plucked the tickets off, and put the ring on her marriage finger; she asked the price; I said six shillings and six-pence; she bid me four shillings and six-pence, then five shillings; I would not take that; she then returned me this metal ring in lieu of the gold one; I said that was not the ring I had given her; she swore it was; I insisted upon her returning the ring; she said that she was married at St. Martin's Church with that ring. This is a metal ring; she said would you sell me base metal for gold; I said no, but that was my ring which she had put upon her finger. I insisted upon her returning that ring; she held out her hand, and bid me touch it at my peril; she would not return it; I threatened her with a constable; she said I might do as I liked; she flung a shilling upon the compter, and said, if I would take my oath that the ring she had on her finger was my master's; she would pay for the oath. I called a fellow apprentice, and sent him for a constable; he went to Sir

               <p>Were the rings alike? - Very much alike; you would, not know the difference apart, but I knew the difference being a judge of the weight of gold; and besides I saw this ring concealed in her left-hand. When I gave her the other ring she had it between her thumb and fore-finger. This is the ring (producing it) that she gave me; it has been tried, and it is base metal.</p>
               <p>Are you certain the ring you missed was gold? - Yes; I had tried it myself, and here is the ticket that was upon it; we found upon her no more than a half crown and two shillings.</p>

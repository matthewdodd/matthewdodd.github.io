                  </hi>. I keep an outfitting shop, at No. 112, Upper East Smithfield, in the parish of St. John of Wapping. On the 3rd of October, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, I discovered my house broken open when I came down, and I found my parlour window open—my house having been attempted several times, I had had some iron bars fixed to the window—one screw was abstracted from the bar—the bar was not removed, but the window was open, and a window was broken in the yard, which goes into the wash-house—that was fastened with a bolt inside the tub-house—there were some bars there as well, and one of them was moved enough to admit the body of a man—I went into the wash-house immediately—I discovered the parlour window open between seven and eight o'clock—I had left that window perfectly safe between eleven and twelve o'clock the night before, I saw it fast—I missed various articles from the wash-house—there were three pairs of my own boots, two pairs of ladies' boots, three pairs of shoes, one plated egg-cup, a pair of plated snuf<lb></lb>fers and tray, a plated decanter-stand, and five silk handkerchiefs, which had been washed and left there to dry—the property all belonged to my<lb></lb>self—I had seen the wash-house fastened the night before, but did not look for the property then—the snuffers-tray, egg-cup, and decanter-stand were taken from the kitchen; the other things from the wash-house—I have seen some of the articles since—they are a pair of boots and a hand<lb></lb>kerchief, which had been in the wash-house with the others—I found a pair of boots in the cesspool which did not belong to me, and I gave them to the policeman.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 10.) On the 7th or 8th of October last, I went to Mr. Lazarus's house, and examined the premises—I found a pair of boots down the privy—I succeeded in getting one up, but the other I could not—I afterwards went to the House of Correction, on the 6th of January, and saw the prisoner there—he had been in custody there for three months, and was about to be discharged that day—I was the cause of his going there—I brought him to King David-lane station-house, and requested him to try the boot on which I had found in the privy—he did so, and it exactly fits him—I received a pair of boots and a handker<lb></lb>chief</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183801290060"></xptr>
               <p>from Mr. Hoare, the turnkey at the House of Correction, at the same time—I had taken the prisoner into custody on the 6th of October, lurk<lb></lb>ing about Brook-street, Ratcliffe, and I remember, on taking him into cug<lb></lb>tody then, observing him stoop, as if in the act of putting something down—it was up a court in Brook-street—having no further assistance but my. self, I could only secure him and take him to the station-house—I then returned and found two chisels exactly at the place where he had stooped—I have examined the place at Mr. Lazarus's, and there appears to be a pressure on the sill of the window, such as would be made by a tool of this description—the smallest of the two chisels—I do not consider it is at all a mechanical tool—it is not like one—the impression seemed to me to be made by such an instrument—at the time he was at the station-house I desired him to take off his boots, which he did—I remember he had a pair on, similar to those taken from him at the House of Correction, and they were turned down with red as these are—I believe these to be the same he had on when I took him into custody and took him to the sta<lb></lb>tion-house—I have shown those boots to Mr. Lazarus, and he has iden<lb></lb>tified them as his property—they are lined inside with a sort of red leather.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ask the prisoner to give any account of these boots? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did at the time I first took him into custody—I asked how he came into possession of them, and he said he had bought them in Rosemary-lane, of a man who stood in the lane, and he has told me so again since—I had no idea of the burglary at the prosecutor's then—these are the same boots, to the best of my belief.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is not Rosemary-lane a place where articles of wearing apparel are sold in large quantities? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I have no doubt there are other boots like these in London—there is nothing particular about them, nor about the chisel—I tried the other boot on to the prisoner, and it fitted him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief turnkey at Coldbath-field's prison. The prisoner was in my custody there for three months—he came on the 7th of October—he was committed from the Thames Police Office, and was brought in the prison van with other prisoners—he brought some clothes with him, part of which he has now on—these boots and this handkerchief are the same he brough't with him—I am quite sure of them—I had them in my possession after he came in—the clothes are taken from all the prisoners that come in the next day, and are delivered up to them again the day they are discharged—they wear the prison dress while they are there.</p>

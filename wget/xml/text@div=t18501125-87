                  </hi>. I get my living by sticking up bills in the streets—I live in Dudley-street, Soho. On the evening of the 29th Oct. I was going into the shop of Mr. Needes, a pawnbroker, in Old Compton-street—I saw the prisoner standing outside—I saw her take down a victorine and two cloaks from inside the door—she folded them up and put them under her arm, and walked away with them—I went and told Mr. Needes and then followed the prisoner—she went to Dudley-street, and into a woman's clothes shop about 300 yards off, and tried to sell them—she came out—I went into a beer-shop which was near, and a young man went for a policeman and took her.</p>

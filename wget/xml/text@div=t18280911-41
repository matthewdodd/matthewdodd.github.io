            . I am the wife of George Garrett. The prisoner and prosecutor lodged in our house in Compton-street: I was in bed when the prosecutor went out, and did not hear him go - but the prisoner awoke me as he went out by slamming the door - I sleep down stairs; both Taylor and the prisoner used to leave their keys behind the door for me; I got up at seven o'clock, went up at half-past seven, looked behind the door, and Taylor's key was gone; I immediately went up, and found the door open, and the key in the lock - I missed his box the moment I entered the room - the prisoner was gone then; I do not exactly know at what time he went, but he awoke me with shutting the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was him? A. The prosecutor goes out at six o'clock, and it was after six - I did not see him: he had lodged with me for ten months; and the prosecutor a year and a half. When I missed the box, I was alarmed, and called Stillwell, a lodger; I did not go up to the prisoner's room till the prosecutor came - I then found the box close to the prisoner's door, which was locked, and the key behind the street door - I opened it, and found a chisel in the room, which the officer tried on the 12th, when the prisoner was brought home; I did not know of his going away; he owed me 5s. for a fortnight's lodging.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me go out? A. No; I had another lodger up stairs - it was Stillwell and his family.</p>

            . I am a gas-lighter, and lodge at Garrett's, in the first floor front room. On the 6th of August, about a quarter or ten minutes to six o'clock, I heard the prisoner call Taylor - I then heard him go up to his own room; I heard Taylor go out of his room about five minutes to six o'clock - and about half-past six I was awoke by a lumbering noise over my head - I awoke my wife; the noise lasted about ten minutes - it was like a shaking about; and a few minutes afterwards I heard a person come down stairs from the second floor; I cannot say who it was - nobody but the prisoner slept on that floor; I heard of the robbery about half-past eight o'clock, and went up stairs with the landlady - we found the box broken open, just by the prisoner's door: I saw the chisel found - it was not tried that day.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the afternoon of the 12th of August, I was fetched to Garrett's house, and found the prisoner there; Taylor gave him in charge - Fletcher and Stillwell were there: I searched the prisoner and found 14s. in silver on him - there were three half-crowns, the rest in shillings and sixpences; the chisel was given to me - I tried it and it exactly fitted the marks on the box; I asked the prisoner, in the house, if the chisel was his - he voluntarily said it was: it is a common one, but what I call a centre chisel, not a flat one - it is fit for wrenching anything; it is bevilled each way: I asked where he had lodged since he was absent - he said "At the Nag's Head public-house, opposite Whitechapel church."</p>

            . I am a porter and am Barrett's brother-in-law. I have seen the prisoner several times at his house; I met him on the 12th of August, in Somerset-street, Whitechapel; I asked why he left his lodging - he said he had no money to pay for them; and had brought his things away, or they would be stopped for the rent: I said I wished him to come back with me, as there was a disturbance at the house, and he came back; I did not say what it was about - we sent for an officer, and gave him in charge; he went readily with me; I had not told him there was a charge against him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not say, Taylor wanted me, because he had lost a box from his room? A. I did not- I said nothing about taking him for felony.</p>
               <p>MRS. GARRETT. A young man lodges in my cellar, with his mother and supports her - they have been there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110042"></xptr>six years; I know he was in bed and asleep at the time - I sleep one room above them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I left my lodgings because I was getting short of money; I had left once before, and when I turned myself round, I came back and paid them - she had told me if I took them out any more, she would swear a robbery against me; I paid her 5s. to redeem them: they swore at Hatton-garden that the box was found in my room, then said it was on the landing-place, and when they found they were swearing false, they brought the chisel and said they found that in my room - one said the door was locked, and the other that it was not; if it was locked, the same key that locks a door, will unlock it again. There is a suspicious character lives in the cellar - she swore at Hatton-garden she had no lodgers but those up stairs: this man goes out every night, and comes home at all hours, and brings others with him - they are concealed there till night approaches, and then go out on their prey.</p>

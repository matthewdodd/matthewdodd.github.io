On the 9th of February, about twelve o'clock, the prisoner Cass came to my house, and remained there till nine at night - he sat in the tap-room till about half-past eight, and then went down stairs into the kitchen, where the brandy is kept; he had been in the habit of sitting in my tap-room for the last fortnight, being out of employ - I sent the boy down after him; he came up about nine o'clock, and told me something - I immediately went down stairs, and found the door open; it opens into a court, which leads into the street - I missed a cask, containing five gallons and a half of brandy: I found Cass next morning, at half-past seven o'clock, at the Flask public-house, in Ebury-street, Chelsea, sitting by the tap-room fire - Sullivan, the officer, was with me: in my absence a pot was sent for - my boy went with it; he came back, and in consequence of what he said, I immediately went down into the field by Lord Grosvenor's canal, and found the cask and brandy; Cantwell had got it on his knee, and Flinn was pouring it out - several people were round them; I took hold of the brandy, and said, "I can swear this is my property;" Cantwell said if it was mine they would have nothing more to do with it - I sent my boy for an officer, who took the brandy and Flinn to the watch-house, which is about an eighth of a mile off, we then came back and took Cantwell; he had remained there till we came back, and was not in custody at all.</p>
               <p>Q. When they first saw you coming to them, was there any thing done to the brandy? A. They were in the act of pouring it out - I staid there with it till the officer came; it was covered up with two coats before I got there: I had never seen Flinn or Cantwell at my house - the field was about an eighth of a mile from my house; the door below stairs was always kept locked, but the key was kept inside - any body within could open it and go out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you been out of your house the day the brandy was taken? A. No, except just outside the door; I do not think above four or five persons had been to the house all day - only Cass was there in the evening: the side-door opens to a private back yard, where there is a privy, but there is another for the customers; I locked the door twice that afternoon, as I had been into the yard to look at some cottages; the pot and glass was borrowed of my house-keeper- I might have called her my wife before the Magistrate, but I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long was it before you returned and took Cantwell? A. In about ten minutes; he had seen the officer take Flinn away - about a gallon and a half of the brandy was gone; eight or ten persons were round - I gave 29s. 6d. a gallon for it.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Odwell. On the 9th of February I saw the prisoner Cass at our house, about twelve o'clock - he staid till about nine at night, in the tap-room; about half-past eight o'clock, I saw him down in the passage; master sent me down to look for him - I had seen him go down stairs to the place where the privy was, about twenty minutes or half an hour before; I found him in the privy, and asked what he did there - he did not say any thing; I went up stairs, and he came up again to the tap-room, stopped there about half anhour, and then went down again; I went down about twenty minutes or half an hour after, and found the back door open, and Cass was gone (when I went down the first time it was locked;) I came up, and told master the door was open - he came down, looked about, and missed the brandy; he then went out - I went out, and looked about, but found nothing; I was sent out next morning, about seven o'clock, to watch, after the pot was borrowed, and saw the cask of brandy covered over (a person lives at the house as mistress;) I had seen the brandy safe that evening - nobody lives in the lower part of the house: I know Cantwell - I had not seen either him or Flinn near master's house that day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where was the brandy kept? A. In the kitchen - the servant works there sometimes, but the victuals is not cooked there; I had not seen Cass drink any thing that day - I know nothing of his being sick; it is not a house of much <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182902190004"></xptr>business. When I saw the brandy by the canal, Cantwell was with it, but not Cass.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had the customers any business in the kitchen? A. No - the servant is generally in the bar.</p>

             re-examined. I saw the brandy in the kitchen about half-past six or a quarter to seven o'clock that evening; the servant is generally in the taproom - we only use the kitchen to clean the things up in; I do not recollect Cass having any thing to drink that day- I did not hear him complain of being ill; it was about half-past eight or a quarter to nine o'clock when I missed the brandy; Cass had no lodging - he slept in some outhouse.</p>

            . I am an officer. Odwell came to me; I went with him, and found the brandy covered with two coats; there was a great many men at work in different barges - he pointed out Flinn and a man named Limbrick; I took them out of two different barges, to the house, and handcuffed them, and while I was in the watch-house Odwell, another person, and Selby, an officer, came in with Cass - Odwell said, in the presence of Flinn, that he was the man he thought had stolen it -I locked them up, returned to the barge, and found Cantwell; Odwell said that was the man he saw with the cask on his knee - he made no answer, and I took him; he went very quietly - the officer who took Cass is not here.</p>

               <p>CASS' Defence. At twenty minutes to nine o'clock I went out at the front door; I was down in the privy four or five times, and between twelve and one the boy came and threw some water into my face in the privy; there were twelve or fourteen navigators in the house - he lets the people out at the side-door on Sundays.</p>

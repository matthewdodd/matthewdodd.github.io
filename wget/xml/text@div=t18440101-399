                  </hi>. I keep the Boston Arms, Boston-street, Regent's-park. On the 23rd of Nov. a check was presented to me—I refused to cash it, because it was crossed to a banker—I am not able to recognize the prisoner as the person presenting it—a second check was afterwards produced to me by the same person, for which I paid 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this is it—the party brought a decanter with her to take away some rum and shrub, which came to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I deducted that from the change—I presented the check at Drummond's next morning, and they made a note on it, "The handwriting differs," returned it to me, and declined to cash it.</p>

I said, "Yes"—she said, "Well, then you are a very cruel man"—she said a gentleman had given her a check to take to Mr. Coleman to change—her mother lived in the apartment—it is not in the same street as Mr. Coleman'i, it leads out of Boston-street, and is about twenty yards from his house.</p>

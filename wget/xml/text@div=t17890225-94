             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Little Moorfields; I had ordered some goods to be removed to Sugar Loaf Court; there was a fire on the 15th of last January, which fire consumed a great many things; I was then possessed of some iron stove-grates; I did not know where they were removed to; that house was for the purpose of making a sale in, I was not insured, the fire was at that house; I lost a number of articles, I recollect two stoves in particular; I heard they were somewhere, and I applied to the sitting Alderman for a search warrant, it was granted me, the officer went with me to search the premises of the prisoner; I begged the officer to stop at the public-house 'till I went to see whether I could get my property of Morris; I went to his house, he was not there; some conversation passed between Mrs. Morris and me respecting the stoves, in consequence of which I saw Mr. Morris, either the morning following or the morning after it; on Thursday the 5th of January the fire was; this was either the Friday or Saturday after, I was on the ruins seeing what I could find; between the ruins and Mr. Morris's house, I saw him standing, when I came off the ruins, I then missed the two stoves in particular; I was saying to Morris what a cruelty it was of people robbing at that particular time; I asked him, whether he saw any body take any of the things away? he said, no, he did not, nor he knew nothing at all about them; that passed on; about a week after, when I had information that some of my property was in Mr. Morris's possession, my having spoke to him before, I thought it most prudent to apply to the magistrate for a search warrant, which was granted me; but before the constable executed it, I begged of him to wait at a publick-house 'till I went to Mr. Morris's; Mr. Morris was not at home, then I came back for the officer, and went with him, I think it was the 26th of January; in the one pair of stairs I saw one of my Bath stoves with a fire in it; we came down stairs, and in the yard we saw Mr. Morris, he then was come: I told him then our business; that we had a search warrant, and what we had found; I begged of him to be generous enough to tell me where the rest were; he flew into a very great passion, and used very indecent language; I told him that would not do, we would go on on; we did so, and under a heap of dung, in one of his yards, we found concealed another Bath stove, that was covered over with dung, I suppose there was a foot of dung laid over it; we searched there by information, the stoves were brought forwards opposite to Mr. Morris's door, which is close to Ludgate; Mr. Teag was standing at the door; and Mr. Morris said, that he borrowed the stove which had the fire in it of Mr. Teag; I immediately replied, what! Mr. Teag, did you lend that stove to Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250115"></xptr>Morris? His answer was, no: I lend the stove! that I did not; the prisoner was taken before the magistrate, I cannot recollect whether what was said was taken down in writing; he begged the favour of Mr. Teag to accompany us, which he did, he was there during the whole examination; Mr. Morris there said, that he thought the stove was his own; the Alderman asked him, when he saw it, did he know it was not his own; he said, yes, he did, but he thought it was his partner's, Mr. Cole; the Alderman asked him, whether he had inquired of Mr. Cole, whether it was his property or not; he said he did; that Mr. Cole's answer was, it was not his. I have seen both the stoves, they are my property, to the best of my knowledge; I have not the least doubt about it; my people are perfectly satisfied they are mine, and they know better than I do.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. What way of life are you in? - A sworn broker.</p>

            , of Dove-Court? - I am his son.</p>
               <p>Now I want to get a little acquainted with the geography of those premises; there was a wheeler's shop near the premises of the defendant? - There was adjoining.</p>
               <p>Upon that wheeler's shop you had a distress, and brought those goods to make a sale? - I had made a distress, and I brought in other goods to make a sale there, by permission.</p>
               <p>How long before that intended sale was this fire? - The things were hardly taken in, the sale was advertised for the next day; I believe the fire broke out on my premises; I have no other reason but to suppose so; I mean to confine myself strictly to truth.</p>
               <p>I believe you was not the only sufferer by that fire? - I cannot say, I should suppose not.</p>
               <p>Do not you know you was not? - No, I do not know that.</p>
               <p>Why, upon your oath, do not you know that the prisoner was obliged to move his family, his wife who had lately lain in, and all his children, into the prison of Ludgate? - I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that he was obliged to remove his goods? - I believe his goods were removed.</p>
               <p>Were any part of his premises burnt? - I believe there was a loft burnt, I do not know he lost any thing.</p>
               <p>In the first place, Sir, are you the prosecutor of this indictment? - I am.</p>
               <p>You carry on this prosecution? - I do.</p>

                  </persName>
             any premises there? - Upon my life I cannot tell that, I was quite a stranger there; I understand since that Mr. Cole is a partner of Mr. Morris's, I do not know Mr. Cole, nor I do not know Mr. Morris.</p>
               <p>Does Cole's house adjoin to the prison of Ludgate? - Morris's house is joining; the premises where the fire broke out is directly opposite Morris's.</p>

               <p>Did you attend at the premises at the time of the fire? - I did, indeed.</p>
               <p>Were any of your goods carried into the prison of Ludgate? - A great many.</p>
               <p>I believe you stood at the gate to mark them with the letter D? - Some I did, I could not mark them all in the confusion.</p>
               <p>It is probable a number of them might not be marked? - Upon my oath I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect whether you marked those two stoves? - I am sure I could not; the large one that was in the fire we found on the dunghill, that I am sure I could not.</p>
               <p>Do recollect marking the others? - I cannot swear that.</p>
               <p>Do you think you did? - In the confusion it is impossible to swear.</p>
               <p>Now, Mr. Dias, you have told me that information had been given you before you went to Mr. Morris's? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Who gave you that information? - I believe I had it from Mr. Teag, and from the apprentice of Mr. Jarman, his name is

            , and from Mrs. Jarman.</p>
               <p>Now, what had Mr. Teag told you before you got your search warrant? - Why, that my property was there, it is impossible for me to say what he said.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250116"></xptr>Cannot you say what Mr. Teag said about your property? - That there was a Bath stove of mine there.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you how it came there? - No, upon my oath, he did not.</p>
               <p>What did he say to you about it? - He said that my stove was there, and to the best of my recollection nothing else.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that he said nothing else? - I do swear it.</p>
               <p>Then Teag did not tell you that the prisoner at the bar had borrowed a stove of him, which they both supposed was Mr. Cole's? - Upon my oath he did not at that time.</p>
               <p>When did he say so to you? - He never said so to me.</p>
               <p>Was this stove concealed in the prisoner's apartments? - No, it was in the chimney-place, and had a fire in it.</p>
               <p>Any body that went into the room might see it? - They might certainly, it could not be covered over.</p>
               <p>Now, had you any acquaintance with the prisoner at all? - No, Sir, none.</p>
               <p>It did not occur to you to go to him when you went with the search warrant? - Upon my oath I went for the purpose of getting them before I went with the search warrant.</p>
               <p>After Teag told you the things were there, did you ever go to ask this man if he had got them, before you got the search warrant? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you happen to know how long the prisoner had lived in that neighbourhood. - I understood a great many years.</p>
               <p>A great many more years than you have lived any where? - I do not know, I live in a great deal of credit, and I hope I shall continue to do so.</p>
               <p>What family has he? - Upon my oath I do not know, he keeps a woman as I understand.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that? - I am told so.</p>
               <p>Who told you, upon your oath, that that man keeps a woman that he is not married to? now name me any one man or woman that ever said so; because I have the Court full of this man's neighbours, and I will not suffer his credit to be whispered away by such a fellow as you; I will have an answer? - That is rather a delicate point, I understood so, Sir.</p>
               <p>Who ever told you so, man, woman, or child? now dare to name to me any more falsehoods, because I know this is an infamous falsehood? - It is a delicate point.</p>
               <p>Court. You see your delicacy is rather late? - Please to excuse me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Now look to these Gentlemen, and tell me, name me a child of six years old that cannot come and convict you of perjury, and I will be satisfied; look at the Jury, if you can? - I do look at them; why, then, Mrs. Jarman hinted to me.</p>
               <p>What did Mrs. Jarman say to you?</p>
               <p>Court. You cannot ask that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I may ask what she said.</p>
               <p>Court. I think not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Who was present when she said so? - I do not know that any body was, she and I had a deal of conversation; I cannot tell when it was, she said this woman was not his wife, she hinted it so; she hinted the woman was not his wife.</p>
               <p>Court. I think you cannot carry it further than this; you may call Mrs. Jarman to deny it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Now tell me of any one expression she ever used; tell me what she said? - She alluded that she was not his wife, I say she hinted it, she hinted that she was not his wife; I can say no more.</p>
               <p>Can't you tell me what she said, what expression she used? - No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>I believe the defendant was admitted to bail by the magistrate? - He certainly was.</p>
               <p>And has surrendered himself here on your charge? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You said, you found this other stove under a dunghill? - Yes, I did, concealed in the dung.</p>
               <p>Who was present when it was found? - Why, there were two or three.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. I admit it is not the prisoner's own; the fire overtook them, and they were not removed out of the room. - There are but two rooms, they are in a stable-yard, they are supported by beams, they are up one pair of stairs; the two grates of Mr. Morris's were left in the room; they were grates with bright fronts, not Bath stoves; I saw Mr. Morris assist in taking one stove out from the second yard in Ludgate, I mean a Bath stove; we were looking for Mr. Morris's partner's back of his stove, it was after the fire, Mr. Morris was removing his things from gaol after the fire; I saw the other Bath stove covered with dung the Sunday morning afterwards, it was covered over with burnt mats.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The stove was laying on the dunghill, and these burnt mats were a part of the rubbish of the fire? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see Morris meddling with that which was in the dung? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Was it day-light when he moved the other? - Yes, they were all in confusion, we were looking for a Bath stove.</p>
               <p>He did not do this secretly like a fellow stealing a stove? - No, it was done in publick.</p>
               <p>How many persons were there present? - I cannot say, there were a score.</p>
               <p>How long had you known this impudent thief, this Mr. Morris? - Ever since I have been in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Had he been used to be such an impudent thief as this? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>He lived in a wooden building in the yard? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The fire began at the broker's? - Yes, the prisoner's hay-loft was on fire.</p>
               <p>What became of his wife and children? - They were taken into Ludgate.</p>
               <p>How many children has he? - Three.</p>
               <p>The poor woman had not long lain in? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morris had a dungheap, and Mr. Cole had a dungheap? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You would not have put a pewter spoon there that you had stole, would you? - Not I.</p>

               <p>(Looks at the Bath stoves.)</p>
               <p>I am sure they are Mr. Dias's; I know the prisoner by sight.</p>
               <p>Court. Are they stove-grates? - They are called Bath stoves; I know no other name for them.</p>
               <p>Jury. They are Bath stoves, not stove-grates.</p>
               <p>Court. If the Jury say, that these are not stove grates, I expect the Counsel for the prosecution to shew that they are stove grates.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, my client had rather go into his defence, and call his witnesses.</p>
               <p>Jury. We are satisfied; it is loss of time to carry this on any longer.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I went to Green-dragon-court to make a search, by desire of Mr. Galloway. I found the prisoner at Mr. Galloway's, and he took me to his lodging - I brought a box, containing the articles stated in the indictment, away from his bed - all he said was, that Mr. Galloway might do as he liked; he could not hang him, but transport him, and he could live as well in another country as in this.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Where did you find him? In the counting-house; it was the day before Christmas-day - I think he pointed his bee room out to me - the box stood in a chair; I saw no signs of his working there.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Was there any vice or bench there? A. No.</p>

            . I have seen all these tools - they are all my father's; here is the workman's name on one - the prisoner was in his employ, and <rs id="t18270111-212-deflabel1175" type="occupation">worked at the manufactory</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What name is on that tool? A. Flynn, and I know it by the form of the tool - I believe Flynn has been convicted here; my father keeps a retail shop for the sale of tools; we never sold a saw finished in the manner this is - it was finished for our own use; we finish them better for sale; we have a number of tools under the care of the store-keeper, who gives them out as the men require them - he is not here. The prisoner never had to take work home; he could not work at home - he had no lathe or vice; I saw the box found; I think it was under a chair, but cannot be certain. I know these taps by the figures on them - we have never sold them with figures for the last two years.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Have you any doubt of any of the property? A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I worked at home because I had not work enough, according to my indentures - I have a vice in the room.</p>
               <p>MR. GALLOWAY. He always had work, if he would do it - he frequently stopped away, and said he was ill - he was not to work at home.</p>

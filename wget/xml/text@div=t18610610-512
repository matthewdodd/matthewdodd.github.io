                  </hi>. I live at Thames-street, Camberwell, and am a pig Butcher—I have known the prisoner from a child—on the evening of 23rd Hay, I was in the Duke of Wellington public-house—I went in with Mr. Hale and the prisoner, and remained there about half au hour—we went in at a quarter to 11, and went out at a quarter-past—I had 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold in my pocket when I went in, one sovereign was loose in my pocket and the other fourteen were in a Bag—after we were in the public-house, Mr. Hale Borrowed a pound of me and I took out the Bag—the prisoner was near enough to see the Bag and the money—he did see it—I put the Bag in my pocket again—that was about ten minutes before I left the public-house—I did not take out my purse after that time—we all came out of the public-house together, and the prisoner went back to finish the Beer we had left—Mr. Hale and I came out together—my house is between three and four hundred yards from the public-house—I next saw the prisoner just as I was going into my own gate within a yard or so of it—he came and put his arm round my neck, and I thought my head was off my shoulders—I lost my senses and my money—no one was with me at that time—Mr. Hale had left me about three minutes before I got to the house—I knew what I was doing then—I had bad a drop of Beer with the prisoner previous to Mr. Hale coming to me—I am positive the prisoner is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hairdresser, at 57, Amelia-street, Walworth—I was with the prosecutor and the prisoner at the Duke of Wellington—the prosecutor lent me some money—for that purpose he took a Bag out of his pocket—I did not see whether it contained other money—he afterwards left the public-house with me; he was able to walk—he knew very well what he was about—the prisoner was on the step when we left the public-house—I left the prosecutor twenty or twenty-five yards from there; has house is about one hundred yards or a little more from the public-house—he would have to walk the rest of the distance alone.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You took hold of his arm did you not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think he took my arm—I went with him about half-way to his house, a little way down the turning—he seemed to have been drinking—I did not notice any other men at the public-house—there might have been others without my noticing—I did not see any money in the Bag—I could hear it.</p>

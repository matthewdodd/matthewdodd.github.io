                  </hi>. I live in Southampton-street, Pentonville. On the 6th of February I was in St. Andrew-street, Seven-dials—I received informa<lb></lb>tion from a woman—I felt in my pocket, and found my handkerchief was gone—I had seen it about a quarter of an hour before—I saw the prisoner running across the street—I ran, and caught hold of him—I said, "You have stolen my handkerchief"—he said no—some other person had the handkerchief, who was a few yards from the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father, in Field-lane, Holborn. About a quarter past five o'clock in the afternoon of the 6th of February, I was at the corner of Great St. Andrew-street—I saw the prisoner throw this handkerchief from his left hand—I saw the prosecutor with him—he got <hi rend="italic">bounceable</hi>, and wanted to get away—Goodchild took him—I never saw the prisoner before, and had no quarrel with him—I do not know who picked it up—he threw it away before any thing was said to him—he was running.</p>

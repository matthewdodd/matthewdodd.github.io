               <p>Q.(to Mr. Ward) Is that letter your hand writing. It is my writing.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Mr. Smith.) Upon his producing this to you what did you direct to be done. - A. I then told him that I had not heard from Dublin; as it appeared<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180610290041"></xptr>to be a question to come before the board of directors, and not to be decided by myself, I desired him to write a petition to go before the board; (the petition read in court) I saw him sign it, after he had signed it, I told him that he must wait a few days longer, that he had better come the next Saturday, as I had directed him first to do, in order to receive an answer from my letter. On Saturday the 24th of May he came and produced a duplicate of the letter of administration, on that day, the 24th, I told him that I had received an answer from Dublin to my letter, by which it appeared that the person he had referred to knew nothing of his family or person.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of these persons. - A. Mr. M'Gennis, (our agent to whom I wrote to did not think it necessary to apply to Mr. Curran,) he did not know any such person as James Neason, or any of the family. He affected much surprise, and said that Mr. M'Gennis knew his family very well, for that he had worked for him a long time, he then gave me other references to persons in Dublin, one of the name of Figgeny, a mealman, and one Flood, that kept an eating house in Dublin; I told him that I would write to Dublin again, that he might attend in a few days, but as I had every reason to believe him an impostor, I referred him to a board that is put up in my office, stating part of the act of parliament, and several persons annexed to it who had been convicted under it; I told him if he was not sure that he was the real brother of Mr. Neason not to let me see him again; he persisted in it still that he was the real brother, and asked me if I thought he would come so often if he was an impostor; he then went away, I told him to come again some day, he came again afterwards; at that time I had another letter from Dublin, I told him the contents of that letter.</p>
               <p>Court. What time did he come afterwards. - A. I do not know exactly the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it time enough for the return of the post. - A. It must be in the beginning of June I think, I then told him I had another letter from Dublin; that one of the men he had referred me to, Mr. Figgeny, the mealman, had been dead six years (he had told me that he had left Dublin six weeks); he described Mr. Figgeny as a person then living, and had referred me to him for his character; I told him that Mr. Flood, the other person that kept the eating house, was dead near ten months, and the widow kept the house still, never heard such a name as his; he seemed to be surprised as before, and begged that I would write again to Mr. Curran. After that he came twice upon the business, once with a letter from an attorney, requesting to know why the money was not paid, and the second letter was to know why the letter was not answered; the first letter came by the post, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q.At either of the times that he came did he see the secretary. - A. He did, one Mr. Dyer; I took him down to the board, in course the secretary, Mr. Dyer, spoke to him, I was with him all the time he was before Mr. Dyer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see the prisoner when he was taken in custody. - A. I saw him in the Poultry Compter.</p>

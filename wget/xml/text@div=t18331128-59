               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is the house your own? A. No; we lodge in the second floor, and my daughter does for Mr. Evans, who lodges in the first floor; when he goes out, he locks the door, and puts the key in the cupboard, that we might clean the place; the prisoner left on the 2nd of September, about two o'clock; Mr. Evans went out after breakfast, and came home to dinner, and the prisoner, instead of cooking his dinner, had left it on the table; I have pawned my own watch; I think not more than twice - I will not swear I have not pawned it ten or twenty times; I did not make a mistake, and pawn Mr. Evans watch, instead of mine; mine is in pawn now for security, not because I wanted money.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to tell this Jury, that your watch is not in pawn by way of advance to you, but by way of security? A. I don't know what you mean by security.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not been in the habit of pawning it once a week or more, frequently? A. No; it was out of a pawn in the beginning of September; I cannot tell who I pawned it with - it is in Hatton-wall; I never took it to any pawnbroker's but that one; I will not swear I have not pawned it fifty times.</p>

            . This is my watch, I left it on the bed rail at the bed-head in my room on the 2nd of September, at seven o'clock, when I went out; I saw it when I came to breakfast, and when I returned at two o'clock, it was gone; the room was left in the care of Wilkins and his daughter, but she had a severe fit of illness; the prisoner had the same opportunity of going into the room as they had.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were there two keys to the door? A. No, only one; when the door was locked, the key was put into the cupboard by the side of the door; I never saw Wilkings have a watch; there were two other females in the house.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When was it that any inquiry was made of you about this? A. A few days after it was pawned; the duplicate was sent to Mr. Evans in a twopenny post letter; I had not seen the prisoner before; but few low persons come to pledge with us; the prisoner was dressed respectably; I did not say I could not state positively that she was the person - I hesitated so far as to turn and look at her; but when the prosecutor first applied about the watch, I described her to him.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Upon the solemn oath you have taken, are you perfectly certain she is the woman? A. I am perfectly certain; she gave the name of Ann Holmes, No. 9, Park-street, Camden-town.</p>

             (police-constable G 198). I apprehended the prisoner; I told her it was on a charge of stealing a watch and a handkerchief; she said she knew nothing about the handkerchief, but that she took the watch and pawned it in Tottenham-court-road.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you make this statement before the magistrate? A. No, Sir; Mr. Bennett said it was not lawful; he will not hear what the prisoners say; he always tells us it is not lawful, and he will not extract any evidence from us.</p>

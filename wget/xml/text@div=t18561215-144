                  </hi>. I was at Enfield on Friday, 29th Nov. I was out late that night—in the course of the evening I went to the Hollybush Inn—the prisoner was in the tap room when I went in—after I had been there about ten minutes he came into the bar where I was, and said to Mr. Matthews, the landlord, "Give us two or three lucifers, governor" Matthews turned round, and gave him two or three, or more; I could not swear how many—he put them in his waistcoat pocket—he then went into the tap room, and wished them all good night, opened the front door, and went out—I went out almost directly afterwards—the prisoner went straight across the road to Mr. Shewell's front gate, that leads up to Mr. Shewell's house—I could not swear which way he turned after he got to the gate—the place where I afterwards saw the fire is, I should say, about thirty yards from that gate—the gate is right opposite the public house—I staid there about ten minutes—at the end of that time the pri<lb></lb>soner came running up the alley from the direction where the fire afterwards was—I told him he was enough to frighten any one, coming running up there like that—he answered that I was like all the rest of the b—girls; he thought I knew a b—sight too much—he went into the Hollybush again, and I followed him in almost directly—from about twenty minutes to half an hour after I got in I heard the alarm of fire—A young man who was in the house opened the parlour door and gave the alarm—the parlour door opens into the road—upon that, all the people in the house ran out, except the prisoner and another man, an old man, who was sitting in the tap room asleep—the prisoner was in the tap room—there was no one in the tap room all the evening, only the prisoner and the other man, not while I was there—I went to the fire, and went and called my father up—I then came back to the Hollybush, and I asked the prisoner if he was not going over to the fire?—he said, "No;" he was not going to work at the b—fire for nothing—he was still in the tap room when I returned—he then went into the parlour, and I saw him take a piece of paper from the table and light it by the gas, and light his pipe—I said to him, "You had them lucifers from Mr. Matthews, and you came up that alley while I stood there"—the answer he made me was, that if I did not mind what I was saying I should get a b—prop—I do not know what he meant.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Holly bush, at Enfield. On. Friday night, 28th Nov., the prisoner came to my house near 12 o'clock—he staid for some time; it must have been near 2 o'clock when he went away—he came to the bar, and asked me to give him a lucifer—that was before 2 o'clock, as near as I can judge; it did not particularly call my attention—I gave him four or five lucifers—the words he used were, "<hi rend="italic">Governor</hi>, will you give me lucifer?" as near as I can say, that was it—I do not know whether he said "a lucifer," or "two or three lucifers;" but I gave him four or five, if not more—he put them in his waistcoat pocket—he stood at the bar for a short time, then wished some one good night, and left the house—I should say it was full an hour after that, that I heard of the fire—the prisoner was not away very long—I could not swear to the exact time—I thought at first it might be from twenty minutes to half an hour; but I do not think it was so long as that—I went to the fire—the stack was then burning all round—it was burnt down at last—the shed was entirely burnt, and a great portion of the hay was consumed—the stack was in the shed—I cannot say what time it was when I first went to the fire.</p>

I made the best of my way over to where it was—several were there before me—the first thing I saw was the horse being got out of the stable, which was close to the shed—there might be five, or six, or seven persons there at that time—I did not take particular notice of the number—I know there were several—the fire was simultaneous all round the stack—the general remark was, that it must have been set on fire—it was burning up like torchlight all round, about the same extent of fire in every part.</p>

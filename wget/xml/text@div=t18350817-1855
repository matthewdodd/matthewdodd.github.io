On the evening of the 18th of August, I marked four shillings and two sixpences, and out them into my till—I went to Crown-street, and, on my return, I found an increase of four shillings in my till, but one of the marked shillings, and one of the marked sixpences was gone, and there was no larger piece of money in the till, for which he could have given change—I sent Miss Brown down that eve<lb></lb>ning for change, and the prisonerr gave her the marked shilling, which I missed from the till.</p>

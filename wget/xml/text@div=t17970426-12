About half past six o'clock in the evening, it was dark, and we had lights in the windows; I was sitting close to the left-hand door, there were two doors to the parlour, and I saw those goods taken out of the window.</p>

             sworn. - I am sister to Mrs. Cook: I was at my brother's house on the 17th of of February, I saw the prisoner, John Darley, there; he was directed to mind the windows while we were at tea.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you live with your brother? - A. Yes; I heard a noise; I cannot tell what noise, but it alarmed me; I went into the shop and found the goods were stolen out of the right-hand window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the prisoner, Darley, in the shop? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did he return afterwards? - A. It was upwards of half an hour; my sister was sitting near the left-hand door, she stepped momentarily out, and saw the man; there were three bundles of silk stockings, two coloured, and one black.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. The prisoner generally wears a cocked hat? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was an immediate alarm made when the stockings were missed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>ABRAHAM ALLEN sworn. - I am brother-in-law to Mr. Cook: I was at his shop on the 17th of February, in the back parlour at tea; the prisoner at the bar was porter; I was there at the time that he had orders to go and watch the window; Mrs. Cook was near the door. I heard a noise, and Mrs. Cook immediately moved and went into the shop; I did not see the prisoner afterwards for half an hour or rather more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. I believe you attended the second examination? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not asked by the Magistrate where a person of the name of Cox was to be found or not? - A. No; he did not ask me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the name of Cox never mentioned? - A. When I pursued the thief, I should say that Cox said he had met a man running up the court, but he did not know who he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did you not tell the Magistrate that you did not know where Cox was to be found? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not go yourself and converse with Cox? - A. I asked Cox whether he knew the man that run up the court.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the porter constantly wear a cocked hat? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>SARAH FARR sworn. - I live next door to Mr. Cook's house; the prisoner came to my house between six and seven o'clock in the evening for half a quartern of gin; about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour afterwards, Mr. Cook came, and enquired if Darley had been to my house, I told him he had.</p>

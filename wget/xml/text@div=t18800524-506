I keep a sausage shop at 34, Old Compton Street, Soho—on 22nd April, about 7 p.m., I served the prisoner with twopenny-worth of Swiss cheese—he gave me a half-crown—I had it still in my hand a few minutes afterwards, when my son came in and found it was bad—I gave it to a constable; this is it—on the 24th the prisoner came again for twopennyworth of Swiss cheese—I recognised him directly, and called Mr. Fisher, as the prisoner was holding his hand over the money—he produced a half-crown—I asked Mr. Fisher to see if it was good, and said to the prisoner "This is the second time you have been here"—he said nothing to that, but asked Mr. Fisher to go out and see the gentleman who gave him the half-crown and sent him in to get the cheese.</p>

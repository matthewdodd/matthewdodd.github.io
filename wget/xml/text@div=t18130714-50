I came from the Coach and Horses, Whitechapel; I came up Whitechapel to the end of Church-row. The prisoner seized hold of me by the collar. I had one foot on the curb of the pavement, and the other off. The prisoner seized hold of my handkerchief by the collar. I asked him what he wanted. I took him a little pat by the side of his head. I had two behind me; one took hold of my arm, and the other my leg, and pulled me so that I laid sideways by the post, some part of me up and some part down, while I kept my hold. When they caught hold of me I seized hold of the prisoner, but I did not hold him long. I found myself pretty well choked; I could not halloa. They tore my breeches, and my breeches pocket was turned inside out. Then when I recovered myself I found they had taken two ten-pound notes, two two-pound, and two one's, all bank notes, and I believe there were two three-shilling pieces and an eighteen-penny piece, but I will not be certain. I said I was robbed. I jumped up; they ran away up the alley and I after them. I caught hold of a lad that I supposed to be one of them. He told me he was not one of them. He took me to a place where I knew his master; he was not one of them. I went into a public-house, and described the man. I described the man to an officer. On Monday the man was taken, and when they brought him out of a public-house, I said that is the man, I should know him out of five thousand. I am sure the prisoner is the man. I intended to hit him under the eye, and that is where I took the features of his face. I have never had him out of my sight. I do not know that the prisoner took the money out of my pocket; one of the three did. This is the one that seized me by the collar. I do not know which of the three took the money. It was about half after nine o'clock. There was a kind of a picture shop by; I had a view of his features all over.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your notes ever found - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. You came from the Coach and Horses - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of clothes had the man on that seized you - A. I do not know; I saw nothing but his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a rainy or a moon-light - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you drank a good deal at the Coach and Horses? You went up to a lad and seized him, and said he was one that had robbed you - A. I supposed he was. I am quite sure the prisoner is the man that had me by the collar, and no other. I always said I should know him out of five thousand.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you heard there is a forty pound reward - A. I have. I do not want a shilling.</p>

               <p>Q. You knew him before, did you - A. Yes, and before I went a step further I saw Mr. Mold coming by at the Library, the corner of the passage, in Church-row, by the picture-shop. I saw

He followed me in Church-row to the cork-cutters; he catched hold of me, and insisted knowing who I was I told him it was immaterial who I was. He said he was robbed; he never was done so in his life. I told him he was robbed by the three men that run away, if he run after them most likely he would catch them towards Aldgate. I told him I lived with Mr. Homan He let me go, and walked home with me to Mr. Homan's He told Mr. Homan that he had been robbed in Church-row of twenty-six pounds. I told him then that I knew the man by seeing him in the street at different times, where I am in the habit of going with meat.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew the person of Abrahams well, did you - A. I knew him well by sight. I did not know his name at that time. I am quite sure he is the person.</p>
               <p>JURY. Was it light enough for you distinctly to see his face - A. Yes, it was a light night, and at this picture shop in the corner there were two candles in the window. There is where I saw Mr. Mold. I never saw the face of the other men then.</p>

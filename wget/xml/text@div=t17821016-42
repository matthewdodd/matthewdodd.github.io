            , and Senhouse, I knocked at the door, and I was let in by a woman that afterwards turned out to be Mrs. Green, the sister of the prisoner; I came to the cellar door, I pointed out the door to Carpmeal, and Mrs. Green ran to the door, and began to thump at the door, and kick at it, I then desired Carpmeal to break open that door, he did so, I heard a noise in the cellar, I ran backwards and opened the back door, where I found another door that was open, belonging to the cellar; I saw the two prisoners come out of the cellar and run into a little shop that was within four or five yards of the door, I think there was two or three steps to come up, it was a work-shop where they had been making locks formerly; I followed them into the shop where the rest of the officers came in, and each of the prisoners picked up a gun lock, there were two gun locks that were finished, all put together ready for hardening; I took them then into the cellar where they came from, and in the cellar was a large press fixed, with the dies fixed likewise within the press; a quantity of halfpence round the press, about twenty shillings worth, they were quite finished; by the side of the press a candle had been burning which was put out, but the wick was then a-light; in the same cellar I found a quantity of blanks and sciffil, and a cutting out press; I found another cutting out press in the front cellar; and all together there was a compleat apparatus for coining, I then searched the prisoners, particularly William Yardley, and in his pocket I found a bill, in which was inclosed this halfpenny that had been struck from the dies that then were fixed in the press; there is a great deal of difference in the weight of the halfpence, I suppose it would take 2 s. 9 d. to the pound weight, and at the Tower I believe there is but 2 s. to the pound weight.</p>
               <p>What may be the profits of a day's work? - It has been proved to this court, that whosoever employs three or four of them, the master clears 3 l. a day after he has paid his servants; they strike up a piece as they call it, which is thirty, and some thirty-two which is 8 d. and they strike up sixteen of them in a day; I suppose these halfpence when finished would not be above 28 s. for a guinea, they are so good, they are the best counterfeits I ever saw: I then searched the house, and in a garret I found these halfpence on a mantle piece, with every apparatus for the finishing them, where it is supposed this young man lay, but I will not swear that, only that his box and clothes were there, and he must either lay there, or lay with his brother and sister, as there was no other bed in the house.</p>
               <p>Court. He owned these clothes to be his?</p>
               <p>Yes I delivered them to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. This house was kept by Mr. Green, and this was his wife, she let you in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Afterwards you saw these men in a workshop? - I saw them come out of a cellar.</p>
               <p>I ask you if you saw them in any workshop? - I did so.</p>
               <p>And there were instruments fitted to the carrying on a Lock-smith's trade? - Not a doubt of it: there is a cellar door which opens upon the stairs, and another door that opens and lets them into this work-shop; the other people went through the cellar, and in the cellar was the press.</p>

               <p>I went to this house, Mr. Clarke went first to the door, he got entrance, I followed him, he was asking a question of the woman, and she kept kicking at the cellar door, I put my foot and knocked it open, I saw the light of a candle when the door opened, I ran down and the candle was put out, but the snuff was then burning; before I got to the bottom of the stairs, I saw three men come out of a door that was then open, that led into a kind of back area; the two prisoners at the bar, the young man was first, and the lusty one was the last, these men run into a work-shop, which was up four or five steps, I followed them up, and Mr. Clarke met them at the top of the steps going into the work-shop, we took them and brought them back, they run and caught hold of a gun lock each of them.</p>
               <p>Court. That is their business, is it? - I do not know, it is a shop; in the cellar we found that cutting out press, one in the fore cellar and the other in the back cellar, with a die fixed; the snuff of the candle was in, and we blowed it and got a light; the other man got off, and got over a high wall, and Mackmannes could not follow him; we took them into a kind of kitchen, the dies were fixed, there was a great quantity of blanks and half-pence struck, and sciffil, and implements for coining, and in the room of one of the prisoners there was a paper of halfpence, which were made up in a 5 s. paper, it was burst and thrown under the grate, they were coloured, they appeared to be some of the same dye that was in the press.</p>
               <p>Court. What was there 5 s. marked on the paper, or did you count them? - I only suppose them to be 5 s. as they are usually tied up in 5 s. worths.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's counsel. What became of the third man? - He got away.</p>
               <p>Then there was a way to escape, and that person got an opportunity of running off? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The other man escaped, these men did not, they went into that work shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You followed Clarke? - Clarke met them I was so nigh Yardley, when he went up I had like to have cut his leg with my cutlass, I was glad afterwards I did not.</p>
               <p>Clarke knocked at the door and was let in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had not the good luck in this case to find a halfpenny warm in the die? - I believe there was a good many warm in the place.</p>
               <p>Why do you believe so? - Because they were warm, when I took them several of the inhabitants saw it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. How came they to be warm? - The striking of the dies makes them warm.</p>
               <p>Court. You said the third man got over the wall, did you see that yourself? - No I saw him go to the place that led to that wall, he was the middleman.</p>
               <p>Then he might have got into the shop, as well as the rest, if he close it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then he must have got by before Clarke met the other men? - He did not go the same way, he turned to the yard.</p>
               <p>The monier of the mint proved the half-pence to be counterfeits.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178210160079"></xptr>Yardley had no concern with the cellar? - No.</p>
               <p>Gun-lock making was his constant employ? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did there appear to be any connection between Griffin and Yardley at any time? - None at all; I never saw them together; he had three small children which obliged him to be attentive to his employ.</p>
               <p>Counsel for prosecution. He had so little connection that he did not talk to him? - Never that I knew of, unless it was good night.</p>
               <p>Then these men never went into the cellar? - Griffin and his men: but Yardley never, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>You recollect kicking against the door, do not you? - No Sir, I opened the door to Clarke, I knocked at the cellar door with my hand.</p>
               <p>What relation are you to the prisoners? - I am sister-in-law.</p>
               <p>Is your husband alive? - Yes Sir, he is out of town.</p>
               <p>Does he live with you? - Yes he lives with me; Griffin had been gone out about five minutes, one of Griffin's men was in the cellar when Mr. Clarke came.</p>
               <p>What made you knock at the door? - Clarke went and peeped between the door and the door-case, and I imagined he wanted Griffin, and I went and knocked at the door, I supposed he wanted Griffin, by his standing.</p>
               <p>Did you go into this cellar? - I never was in the cellar since Griffin had it.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect some cloaths being found in the cellar? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath? - Clarke brought a coat to me, and asked me if I could own it, I told him I did not; I did not tell him whose it was.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, at that time was not these two men down in the cellar? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath? - Upon my oath.</p>
               <p>There was some half-pence found up stairs where the young man laid, how came they there? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Who made the young man's bed? - He slept in the room, they had a make-shift bed in the same room, that they slept in, on the one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Why he is married, is not he? - Yes, and has three children.</p>
               <p>The other is his apprentice? - Yes, and the apprentice laid in the same room as they, with one of the children; there was another bed that they made occasionally; there were two of Griffin's people that slept in the bed up stairs; my husband asked one of Griffin's men to give young Yardley leave to put his cloaths in his box in Griffin's room; there was no room in the house for it elsewhere; their room is quite crowded already.</p>
               <p>What business is carried on in this cellar? I never saw any business carried on in this cellar.</p>
               <p>Have not you heard a noise? - I have heard a noise, but I never went down, I had no right there.</p>
               <p>Give me a positive answer, will you say it again, that neither of these two men were in the cellar when the officers came in? - I will.</p>
               <p>Court. How can you say that when you was not in the cellar? - I was folding some clothes in the kitchen, the window was open, I saw Yardley and his brother in the shop, I will venture to swear they were not in the cellar.</p>

               <p>Court. One of these men swear he was going to chop him with his cutlass.</p>
               <p>Mr. Clarke. My Lord, Mr. Green's clothes were in the cellar, and his wig; I knew nothing of Griffin.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Green. I wish you would recollect, you are upon your oath, I would not willingly throw any aspersion upon you, you swear positively your two brothers were not in the cellar; in two minutes they might have gone from that place into the cellar? - They could not possibly go into the cellar without my seeing them, I was so close to the window that I must have seen them.</p>
               <p>Which is Griffin's way to go to this place that he rents of you? - Sometimes he comes in at the front door, and sometimes at the back door, and I imagined<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178210160080"></xptr> by Mr. Clarke's standing at the door they wanted him.</p>
               <p>Court. This garret belonged to two of Griffin's people, and they had given young Yardley leave to put his clothes and his box there? - Yes by my husband's asking.</p>
               <p>Court. Where is Griffin now? - I cannot tell: I saw him about five minutes before, he went in at the front door.</p>
               <p>Did that come by you? - No only when I hear the door open, I make it a point to see who was going out and in.</p>
               <p>Did you make it a point to see who was going in at that time? - No my Lord.</p>

               <p>(On the part of the prosecution).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's counsel. My Lord, I applied to your Lordship at the very beginning of this trial, that the witnesses might be examined apart.</p>
               <p>Macmannus. I have been out all the time when Clarke or Carpmeal was examined. - Clarke knocked at the door, and got admittance; the woman knocked at the door with her hand, as hard as she could; the two prisoners were coming out of the cellar, and the other man turned into a yard, and I run after him.</p>
               <p>Did you see these men come out of the cellar? - Yes, it was only two steps to go into this workshop.</p>
               <p>Did Clarke ask for Griffin? - No, his name was not mentioned that I heard of.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's counsel. This workshop is close almost to the cellar? - There is very little way between them.</p>
               <p>There it was you saw these men? - No, we saw them come out of the cellar, and Carpmeal would have struck them, but I said do not Tom. She knocked several times; immediately after I saw these men.</p>
               <p>At the time the knock was given you did not see the men? - No.</p>
               <p>When you did see them, they were near to the workshop? - They were coming up out of the cellar.</p>
               <p>In consequence of you three rushing in, you were between her and the cellar door? - When I passed

             I was between her and the shop door.</p>
               <p>She saw you coming in and you her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. You could not see them before she opened the door? - The door that she was knocking at was on the landing place; I saw three men, I saw the prisoners both, I am sure: here are some of the halfpence I got upon the shelf in the kitchen; Mr. Clarke says they were struck in the same die.</p>

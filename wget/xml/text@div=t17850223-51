            , to take charge of Medley, for stealing a watch out of his bar, in consequence of an information, I went to the prisoner's house in Chick-lane, a chandler's shop, and pawnbroker's: I took Warren with me, Medley was asked who he had sold the watch to, and he shewed us the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the prisoner present? - He was.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner say? - He said, he had got the watch, and he went up stairs to fetch it, and Warren followed, and I saw the prisoner take the watch out of a bureau facing; I did not go into the room, but it was facing the door, I could see him; he then turned round and came down stairs, and I followed him, then the prisoner came down stairs, and said, it was pledged with him, and Warren, me, and Greentree, wrenched it out of his hands, he refused to deliver it without the money that was paid for it, but they got it away from him; after Medley was tried, the watch was delivered up to Greentree.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, Prisoner's Council. The prisoner was in a back-room? - Yes, there was a partition, but the door was open.</p>

               <p>On the 21st, it was a Sunday evening, I went with Jones to the prisoner's house, I took the boy (Medley) before me, I told him to shew me the person that bought this watch, and he pointed to the prisoner; I told the prisoner I came about a watch that was stolen, and must have it, he seemed a little confused: he said to his wife, give me the keys, I followed him, he said, you need not, I said, I will, and he opened a bureau, and took out the watch; the boy declared in his presence, that he gave him half a guinea for it, and he told him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230097"></xptr> he would make it up another time; the boy asked him a guinea and an half.</p>
               <p>What answer did this prisoner make to what the boy said? - He said, he lent him half a guinea on it, but the boy persisted that he gave him the half-guinea for it; he would not deliver the watch without the half guinea, I laid hold of the watch, and took him to the Compter with the boy.</p>
               <p>Did any thing pass in your presence afterwards? - We preferred the bill of indictment against him after Medley was tried, and says the prisoner to Greentree, who was over the way, I am surprized you should go and prefer a bill of indictment, when I have paid forty pounds into the hands of your attorney, and you have signed a paper.</p>
               <p>Did he say for what purpose he had paid it? - Not to prosecute him, and that the other had signed an agreement for it; and I said to the prosecutor, I thought there was some villainy work in this, says he, I know I have done wrong by signing the paper I did sign; this was said in the presence of

             the constable, and in the room where he was, he must have heard it.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the watch that was produced upon the trial of Medley, the same watch that you found at this man's house? - Yes, I produced it, it was the same I found on the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Will you take upon you to say that you heard the word prosecute, when this conversation passed? - Yes, upon my oath I will; they came to me very often and wanted me to be concerned in this business, but I did not chuse it.</p>
               <p>Who was the prisoner's attorney in this business? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court. If I knew who he was, I should direct him to be prosecuted for a misdemeanor, in compounding felony.</p>
               <p>Court. Where does Greentree live? - He keeps the tap at the King's-head eating house, in Ivey-lane.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. The prisoner keeps a pawnbroker's shop? - Yes; there was no duplicate upon this watch.</p>

               <p>Court to this witness. Be careful what you say, because if you are caught tripping, I shall certainly direct a prosecution against you; therefore take care to say nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Fishpool. On the 21st of November there was a lad come into the shop, with a silver watch, and asked Mr. Goldsmith to lend him the sum of a guinea upon it; he refused to take it in several times, but upon pleading very hard, that it was his father's, and that he should take it very kind if he would let him have that money, as he was distressed; with a great deal of persuasion, he told him he would lend him the sum of half a guinea upon it; he said he should be very thankful if he did, and that he should certainly redeem it the next day, for his father was much distressed: upon this Mr. Goldsmith ordered me to enter it in the book, which I have done; I made the entry myself at the time the lad was in the shop.</p>
               <p>Court. Produce the book.</p>
               <p>(The book handed up.)</p>
               <p>Jury. Has your master a licence to keep a pawnbroker's shop? - I do not know indeed.</p>
               <p>Warren. He acknowledged he had not to me.</p>
               <p>Court. It appears from this book, Gentlemen, that this article is plainly made in the usual course of business, at the time.</p>
               <p>Court to Fishpool. How long have you lived with this man? - Above two years, he is a painter by trade.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. So you work with the prisoner sometimes? - Yes, but I am constantly in the house.</p>
               <p>What character does the prisoner bear? - A very good character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two other witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

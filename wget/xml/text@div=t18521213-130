               <p>Holywell-lane, with another female, and two young men—while I was there the prisoner came in—he spoke to me and drank with me—he then went outside, and called me out after him—when I got outside he was cutting a piece of wood with a knife—I said, "John, will you lend me that knife, to cut a biscuit I am eating?"—he refused to give it me, and I made a snatch at it to take it from him—a struggle then took place; I held his hand very tight; he then had the knife in his hand; we were strugging with the knife, and by some means or other the knife stuck in me, but I will not swear he did it; we were struggling together, and I believe firmly that partly my own hand <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it—I do not know that he gave me the wound—I Was wounded in the side of my throat; I fainted, and I do not remember anything after that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a horsehair dryer, and live in Woolley-street, Curtain-road. On this day I was opposite Mr. Couzins's beer-shop, and saw the prisoner call Mitter out—she came out—they were talking together, and then there was a bit of a scuffle took place between them—I saw the prisoner lay hold of Mitter, and draw his hand across her throat—I did not see any<lb></lb>thing in his hand—she then made a kind of a fall, and a young man came up, pushed the prisoner away from her, and took her into the beer-shop—the prisoner turned round, seemed to pick up something out of the gutter, and ran away—I did not see anything in his hand.</p>

I was outside this public house, and saw the prisoner come out, followed by Mitter—I was standing about three yards from them—I saw them begin talking; I saw no scuffle between them, till I heard her cry out, "Help! help!"—I was not looking in that direction—when I heard the cry I ran to her, she was about to fall on the ground, and I caught hold of her, and <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> the prisoner away with the other hand—the prisoner's arm was round her neck—as I was taking her into the beer-shop, I heard a noise like a knife dropping on the ground—I turned and saw this knife lying there (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the point was bent—when I came out again, the prisoner was gone—I went after him as far as the top of the street, but could not find him—there was no blood on the knife, but there was on my coat.</p>

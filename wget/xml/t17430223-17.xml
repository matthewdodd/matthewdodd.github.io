I lost all the Goods mentioned in the Indictment, and a Silver Salt. - The Street-Door was locked when I came home, I unlocked it, and found the Yard-Door open: - I suspected the Prisoner, because No-body knew where the Plate was put but himself: He lived in the Neighbourhood, and used to go to Rumford, and unload Carts for us. - I am a Poulterer, and stand in Clare-Market; he said he never was out that Day, and I can prove he was out, and borrowed a Ripping Chissel.</p>

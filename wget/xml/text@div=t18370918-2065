I recollect on the 12th August being in Cleveland-street, New-road—I saw both the prisoners—I had known them before as being charged with an offence of this sort, and I watched them, and they walked along Cleveland-street till they came to a chandler's shop—West went in, and Russell and another who was with them went on—in a few minutes West came out, and joined them—they went on, West going into several shops—when they got to the corner of Mortimer-street, Russell took something from his righthand pocket and gave it to West—they went on to Poland-street, where they all three stood in conversation, and then went on to Walker court, where Russell again gave something from a piece of paper to West—I then saw West go into a baker's shop, and come out with a loaf in a handkerchief—I gave the policeman information, and he took Russell—I saw Russell throw something behind him, which the constable picked up—I pursued West, and was present when he was secured.</p>

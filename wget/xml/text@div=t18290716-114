               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you mean to insist that your "Mistress," as you call her, is your wife? A.

Witness. There were no words about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182907160051"></xptr>the girl; I said I had dropped some money - Flood picked it up and gave it to me; I was squaring with Sawyer - I fell down, and it came out; we struck each other, but not in malice.</p>

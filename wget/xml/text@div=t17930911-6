When the gentleman took her she wanted to give me the bed gown, and the pocket apron; I asked her how she came by them? she told me if I would let her go she would find the rest for me; I told her I would not let her go; then Mr. Fonseca took custody of her, and brought her down to the watch-house; the pocket apron was tied before her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dark when you went to bed? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you fasten your door? - I locked the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Nobody else lived in the house but you? - Nobody else.</p>
               <p>Q. In the morning you found the staple of the door out? - Yes. The constable has got the things.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. This bed gown was in my house the night of the robbery, I took it off my back, it lay on a chair, I missed it in the morning; the apron is mine, I know it by the marks that is in it, it is my own making; the pocket apron laid on a chair with the money in it; there was five shillings and three-pence in it, five shillings in silver, and three-pence in halfpence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The way I came by that pocket apron and bed gown, is this, I was coming home looking after my husband, as far as Holborn, there was a drunken man met me, and he had this apron and bed gown, and he made me stop with him in the street, and gave them to me, he told me they were his wife's things, and that he was going away from her. They took five duplicates out of my pocket, and four shillings and six-pence in money.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Do you know whether she is an unfortunate woman? - She is, I have heard so, she had no money about her.</p>
               <p>Fonseca. I took nothing but the duplicates, and a key from her.</p>

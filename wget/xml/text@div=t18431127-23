                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Hearn, a refiner, in Jerusalem-passage. On Saturday, the 11th of Nov., the prisoner came and offered me some gold for sale, which the officer has—I asked where he came from—he said, from his brother, Mr. Jones, No. 11, Wynyatt-street—I asked if he had a note—he said he had not—I requested him to fetch one—he went away—I kept the gold, and on the Monday evening following he came again—I said, "You did not return on Saturday evening"—he said, "No, I was unable"—he then gave me a note purporting to be from his brother—Mr. Hearn, who was in the shop, questioned him—he could not give a satisfactory account of the gold, but kept saying, "Come with me to my brother, it will be made right;" but I had sent to No. 11, Wynyatt-street before—I gave him in charge—the gold weighs about 12dwts.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gold and silver dial maker, and live in Skinner-street, Clerkenwell. This gold is my property—I had given it out to the prisoner, who was my apprentice, on Thursday evening—it is part of a large quantity—I delivered to him between two and three ounces, in addition to six or seven ounces—this was an additional slip of wire for the purpose of finishing the edges of watch cases—it was then in one piece, but it hap<lb></lb>pens to be an outside slip, and in the evening we could not find what had become of it, and when I saw it I knew it immediately—there is no private mark on it.</p>

Q.</hi> I believe while with you, you were perfectly satis<lb></lb>fied with him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Most decidedly—I gave him the gold on the Thursday before he was apprehended—he was working under a young man rather older than himself—I should not like to swear it is all mine, but it is my firm opinion—Saunders was questioned by Mr. Coombe, and to the best of my knowledge admitted the crucible was kept hot night as well as day.</p>

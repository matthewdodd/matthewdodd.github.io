                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Newholme.

The prosecutrix gave me some things to take care of—I put the bundle of things in an empty room—the prisoner was there at the time the things were brought—she worked occasionally as charwoman—when the prosecutrix came and fetched away the things, she said the cloak was missing—no one had access to the room where the things were, but the prisoner and a little girl—they were left tied up in a bundle; I never saw them open—I heard the prisoner say she bought the cloak in White Horse Place, Commercial Road, for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I never sent her any time with a pawn ticket, and I never had a pawn ticket in my possession in my life—no one slept in the room where the things were but the little girl, who is about thirteen years old.</p>

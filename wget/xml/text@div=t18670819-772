                  </hi> I am a mantle maker, and live at 126, St. John Street Road—at one o'clock on 8th July I was walking down Gracechurch Street, and a party came behind me, threw me down oh my back, and kept down my legs, and took a chain and gold locket from my</p>

               <p>person, but I succeeded in keeping my watch—there were three persons there—the prisoner is one of them—I was held down by the collar by the prisoner with one hand—the other kept my legs from stirring—I do not know what the third one did—I was wearing a watch with a vulcainsed chain and a gold locket—the prisoner tore my coat, and pulled the chain and locket away and ran off—I succeeded in keeping my watch—I had my hand on it—they did not go away, but began to assault me again, and one who got away hit me from behind, and then all three ran away—I followed the prisoner, calling out, "Police! "—he ran down Gracechurch Street as far as Bishopsgate Street, where he was stopped by a police-constable, and I gave him in charge—I never lost sight of him for a moment—I am quite sure he is the man—the locket and chain were never found—my cost was torn, and my vest as well.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 896). I was on duty in Bishopsgate Street between one and two on the 8th July—I heard a cry of "Police!" and saw the prisoner running in the middle of the road—the prosecutor was following him—I stopped the prisoner, and the prosecutor said he would give him in charge for stealing his watch chain and locket—the prisoner at first said he knew nothing about it, he was passing by at the time—he afterwards said he would make the loss good—he was given into custody and taken to the station—I searched him, but found nothing on him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> He gave a correct address, did he not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he was stopped about 300 yards from the spot where the robbery took place, in a different street, but in the same line—I went down to the prisoner's master, who said that he worked for him occasionally, and expected him to work that morning.</p>

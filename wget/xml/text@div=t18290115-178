            . I am a constable. The prisoner came into my shop in Peter's-lane, which is six or seven minutes walk from the prosecutor's, on the 14th of December, about ten minutes after four o'clock, for a 1d. loaf; I asked what he had got - he said a lamp, and he would sell it to me; I looked at it, and the oil was streaming down; I said it was a strange thing to bring a lamp on a Sunday afternoon, and asked where he was going to - he said to St. John-street, and had brought it from Long-lane; I went after him and said, "You say it came from Long-lane, we will go there" - he swore he would not; I then took him to the watch-house - he told me several different stories, but at last I found the prosecutor; the lamp fitted the bracket exactly.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

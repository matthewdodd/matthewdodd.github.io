             sworn.</p>
               <p>I went by, on the 19th of May, about ten o'clock in the evening, to carry a letter to Carnaby-market from Chick-lane; I saw a coach stand by Union-court; as I passed it I met the prisoner and another person just by the coach. I knew the prisoner to be a bad lad, I had a suspicion of him. I stopped about thirty yards from the coach; I saw him open the door and step in the inside of the coach and take this box and run up Holbourn. I stopped him when he had got about thirty or forty yards from the coach.</p>
               <p>Did you secure him? - No, I could not hold him and the box too. I gave the alarm of Stop thief. The coachman was standing by the coach; I gave the box to him after the man was stopped.</p>
               <p>If the coachman was standing by the coach how could this man get into the coach? - The coachman was on one side going to give some hay to his horses, the prisoner stopped on the other side and got in; he was stopped in Hatton-garden.</p>
               <p>You knew him before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner is the man? - Yes, he was not out of my sight till he was stopped; when he was stopped the mob came round him so that I could not see him when I got almost to him.</p>
               <p>Is the coachman here? - No.</p>
               <p>You do not know what the box contained? - I did not then, I do now; I saw it opened before the Lord Mayor; I am sure it is the same box.</p>

             was with him.</p>
               <p>To Haley. Who did you deliver the box to? - To the coachman, and I saw him deliver it to Mr. Sutton, and saw Sutton deliver it to the constable.</p>
               <p>Was it ever out of your sight till the constable had it? - It was out of my sight when the coachman had it, because there was a crowd came about the coachman.</p>
               <p>To the Constable. Have you kept the box ever since? - Yes; the things were locked up in it; the prosecutrix has had the key ever since; they have all been in my possession, except the cap which she begged the Lord Mayor to let her have the use of, being short of caps.</p>
               <p>(The goods were produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutrix.)</p>

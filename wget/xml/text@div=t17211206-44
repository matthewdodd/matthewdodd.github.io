That the Marquess was <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172112060008"></xptr> pretty well satisfied with that Answer; but soon after, when they were at Paris, the prisoner play'd some Tricks with the Marquess's Mistress, for which he was discharg'd from his Service. The Marquess returning to London, and not finding the Goods, caus'd him to be apprehended for stealing them. The prisoner said, his Master gave him the Wastcoat, and brought witness to prove that he had often wore it in his Master's Service. As for the rest of the Goods, the Marquess could bring no proof that the prisoner had taken'em.

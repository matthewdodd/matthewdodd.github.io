            . I was, on the 10th of November last, in the employ of Mr. Winch; the prisoner was so also at that time; I was desired by him to carry about a bushel of beans about the 10th; I was to carry them to his lodgings, at his mother's house; I did not see them put into the sack - he gave me them out of my master's granary; he said he wanted me to take a bushel of beans; he went with me - when we got there, he took them out of my hand, in a shed on his mother's premises - it was about eight o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. It was at the time when farmers are in full business? A. It was about eight o'clock in the morning; he met me at his mother's; the prosecutor's house is opposite to the farm, and any body could see what he was taking along; Mrs. Roake's house is about a quarter of a mile off; he never said such a thing as, "Don't let my master know it;" I did not know that my master had dealings with Mrs. Roake; he had his victuals at his mother's, but I believe he mostly slept at Weybridge; the prisoner remained with his master till February; he passed by me on my way to his mother's.</p>
               <p>GEORGE WINCH. I am a corn-factor, at Shepperton. The prisoner was authorized by me to sell at all times; he was to make every entry on the day it happened - my book is here; I have examined it - I find no entry of beans sold to his mother on the 10th of November, nor to any other person - not on his own account, nor his mother's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. The prisoner is executor under his late father's will? A. I believe so; I am not under any obligations to him - I am not aware that he had lent me money - if it was so, it was his own fault, for not making up his accounts; many times there were monies received, but he never lent me 50l. - I have had money when I have applied for it and he has said, "That is all I have got;" the balance has been sometimes in my favour, and sometimes in his; I remember his going to town on executorship business; he told me he was going to prove the will, and some other business, but I do not know whether it was for dividends; he did not always make entries of advances - I never made any against him; I do not recollect owing 18l. for hay - I owed the mother 15l.; on recollection, the 15l. 18s. 6d. is due to the estate; I have dealt with the mother for coals only; he paid attention to all orders given; the mother owes me 10l. - I owe the estate 15l.; I have tendered the balance; I made out an account, and gave it to Roake for his mother - the bill was not sent back, because the items for which the prisoner is indicted was not therein; Mr. Hyde had lived with him - he gave some information; the prisoner conducted himself well until within the last two months.</p>

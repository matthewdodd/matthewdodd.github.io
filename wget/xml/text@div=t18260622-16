On the 13th of May, about eleven o'clock at night, I was standing outside the door, speaking to Barton and White; Barton asked me to go over the way - I was in the act of going over when the prisoner called me, saying, "I want to speak to you;" I went within the threshold of the door, to hear what he had to say - when he caught me by the right wrist, and took a step further inwards; I put my ear forward to hear what he had to say, and he instantly stabbed me. I soon became stunned by the fright and loss of blood, and do not know what passed - he stabbed me below the pit of my stomach. I recovered in about a quarter of an hour, and found myself in bed; he said nothing to me before he stabbed me. I saw a sharp pointed knife in his hand, as I got from him, just after he stabbed me; I never had the least quarrel with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Without your doing any thing, or having any quarrel, he gave you this blow? A. He did - there had been a quarrel between his wife and mine, about his grand-daughters, but I never had a word with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he not some bread and cheese in his hand? A. I think not, for he caught me with one hand, and stabbed me with the other. I do not know William Hildyard - I never heard the name.</p>

            . I live opposite Westerfer. I went home about eleven on this evening, and heard a sad noise - I crossed, and saw Mr. and Mrs. Westerfer, Mr. and Mrs. Collier, and two young girls - they were making a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182606220013"></xptr>piece of work with each other; I asked Westerfer to go and shut himself in doors out of the way, and to settle it on Monday, by a peace-warrant - he came from the door, and said he would go over to my house, and have some beer, to get out of the piece of work - we were going from the door when Westerfer was called; he went to his own door, and I lost sight of him - I turned to speak to his wife, and in a moment he came out and said, "I am stabbed;" he pulled up his waistcoat and shirt, and I saw the blood flowing from the wound. I walked into the passage to look for Collier; two watchmen were going up stairs, and by their light I saw Collier standing in the passage, opening the cellar door; he exclaimed, "Go on - he is up stairs" - I said, "This is the man," and put my hand on his shoulder. He went down the cellar stairs so fast I was obliged to loose my hold; I got a light, and searched the cellars and back gardens, but could not find him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It is not uncommon for there to be a noise in this house? A. No - they were all wrangling, and in a state of irritation - I cannot pretend to say Westerfer was in the row, farther than that I asked him to come away. I did not hear Collier call him back. Whether Westerfer was quarrelling I cannot say.</p>

            . I live nearly opposite to Westerfer. I was going home, and heard a noise at his door, with Mrs. Collier and her grand-daughters - Westerfer stood at the side of the door, with Barton. I was going up to them - Collier came down stairs, clapped Westerfer on the shoulder, and said, "Westerfer, I want to speak to you"- I fell back for him to go in - there was a bit of a skirmish in the passage. Collier ran, and stood on the first stair, and said, "I have done for the b - r;" he then went up stairs, came down with his hat and coat on, and went down the cellar stairs. I and Barton caught hold of his coat, and he said the man who had done the murder was up stairs; he got away from us, down into the cellar. I saw no more of him till he was in custody. Westerfer was taken over to Barton's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Barton was alongside of Westerfer when Collier tapped him on the shoulder? A. Yes - he was close to him. Barton must have heard it.</p>
               <p>Q. Barton must have heard him say "I have stabbed him?" A. I do not know that - he came into the passage after me, and caught hold of his coat. The quarrel was between Mrs. Collier and her grand-daughters - they were often quarrelling; the passage is dark.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On Sunday afternoon, the 14th of May, the prisoner came to our office voluntarily - he seemed rather drunk, and said, "I have come to give myself up to Justice - I have been guilty of murder." He said Westerfer was the man. I went to Hare-street, and found Westerfer in bed - his sister gave me his shirt, which is bloody.</p>

            . The prisoner afterwards told me voluntarily that he had intended this for the last eleven months - there had been such disturbances in the family, and he was determined to do it; he had stabbed him, and knew he had murdered him, and therefore gave himself up; it was at four o'clock in the afternoon. I understood he had been at the office that morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it your habit to talk with prisoners? A. No; I asked him no questions at all; he told very thing himself. I have no doubt of his being a little in liquor, but not much - he had told this story to other officers, but they sent him away, as a drunken man.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I saw the prosecutor on the night of the 13th - he had been stabbed or cut with some sharp instrument; the wound was rather more than an inch long - I should not term it a grievous harm; it was just on the edge of the cartilege of the chest, in an oblique direction.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. They have all sworn falsely. I came home about ten minutes past eleven o'clock, and found my house surrounded. I was informed my wife and the prosecutor had been quarrelling - I went up stairs, but my wife took no notice of it to me - at supper time I said "I find you have had a quarrel with Mrs. Westerfer"- she said, "Yes, she has got drunk, and has been abusing the girls;" I called one of the girls up - she did not come, and I went down with a piece of bread and the knife in my hand; I said to the girl, "Why don't you come up." The prosecutor heard my voice, and began striking at me, but could not hit me - he turned out of doors went out to ask why he hit me; as soon as I mentioned his name he rushed in, and said, "You have been telling somebody that I said something about you;" I denied it- he said, "You lie, you old b - r," and struck and kicked me; I resented the blow with the knife in my hand, and he said he was stabbed. I immediately thought of the knife, and was so frightened I got my hat and coat and made my way out. I was drinking, and mentioned it to a man in Drury-lane; he advised me to go to Bow-street, which I did, and they laugthed at me; I said we had been at variance for eleven months, but with the man himself I never quarrelled. I never said I did it wilfully.</p>

I was coming home between eleven and twelve o'clock on this night, and in Hare-street I heard a quarrel; I saw the prisoner come down stairs, eating his supper; I heard the prosecutor's wife call the prisoner's two grand-children, two wh - s, and using dreadful language; Westerfer came out - the prisoner said it was very wrong for the prosecutor's wife to use such language, which she knew was false - he called Westerfer a rogue and villain, for suffering such language - Westerfer immediately struck him - Collier appeared quite calm and cool - he returned the blow, but I did not know he had a knife; I thought he struck with his fist.</p>

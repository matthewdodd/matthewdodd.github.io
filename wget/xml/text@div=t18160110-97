             BULL. I live in Holles-street, Cavendish Square. I was robbed on Thursday last, between twelve and one at night; it happened <placeName id="t18160110-97-crimeloc541">near Blenheim Steps</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18160110-97-crimeloc541" type="placeName" value="near Blenheim Steps"></interp>

I had been out to dinner at a party; I was returning from the Free Mason's Tavern; I had been drinking more than usual, but was not intoxicated. There were three of us in company, one of which, my youngest brother, was very much intoxicated. The gentleman who was with me had volunteered his services to assist me in seeing him home. Three persons were coming the coutrary way to ourselves, in a direction towards us, and passed us. We were arm in arm together; I had hold of one of my brother's arms, and Mr. Dupins, had hold of the other. The three persons returned, and said we had run against them. I said I was extremely sorry, but they saw the condition of the young man whom we where conducting. They did not pass on my side. I told them if it were so, I was sorry for it, but they stlil followed and abused us; my friend turned round to speak to them, and I looked towards them and lifted up my hand, to tell my friend he had better let them go on their own way. As I just lifted up my hand, I felt my watch drawn out of my fob; that was not the way I expected any injury to be presented to me. I brought my hand down quick, and caught the watch on the swing; it was entirely out of my pocket. I pulled, and the person who had got hold of it pulled, and the chain broke from the watch. It was a gold chain, cost me five guineas, it was worth two pounds, There was a seal, which was worth one pound, which cost me two guineas and a half. There was a gold mourning ring, which was worth ten shillings. As soon as the chain broke, I pursued the person with whom I tustled. He turned down a dark street, and was about to return down Winslow-street; I still pursued him closely; he was not out of my sight. He went about half way down the street, and was about to return. I seeing his intention, threw myself in his way, and put out my foot; and he came with such force against my leg, that he threw me down; I saw him falling when I was getting up; and a watchman came round the corner, and stopped him. He had not got out of my sight; I am sure the man who was stopped by the watchman, was the man whom I tripped up. My chain and seals were not found. At the time I put out my foot, there was nobody else running in the street, but the person who had struggled with me, and who had then my chain. I had an opportunity of seeing his face. I had not lost sight of him, and the person whom the watchman stopped must have been the man.</p>
               <p>MR. CHARLES DUPINS. I was in company with this gentleman. I had been to the Freemason's Tavern; I considered that I was not inioxicated. The prosecutor did not appear to be intoxicated. When I was near Blenheim Steps, three men passed us, who returned immediately, and accused us of running against them; Mr. Bull apologised, and I believe I aggravated it; for I said if they did not proceed, I should call the watch. Mr. Bull then tapped me on the shoulder, and advised me to proceed I had hold of his brother, at the time by the arm. Almost at that same moment, I observed Mr. Bull n a scnffie with the man, and then I called out watch. I did not see what they or either of them were doing. My intention was intirely taken up with Mr. Bull's brother, and I did nothing further than calling out watch.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Mary-lebone parish; my beat is at 29 box, in Wells-street, at the Oxford-street end; I heard a cry of watch, when I was in my box, just after I had finished caling half past twelve. When I heard the watch called, I proceeded towards the cry; the first I saw was the prisoner running without his hat, as hard as he was able; I first caught sight of him within half a dozen yards of Winslow-street, which faces the Pantheon; it is a small street with a brewhouse in it. I did not stop him then; I made a catch at him, but missed my catch; he was then in Oxford-street, close to Winslow-street; Mr. Bull was within two yards of him. I laid hold of him in Winslow-street; Mr. Bull tripped him up first, and as he fell, I caught hold of him by the collar. There was nobody in company with him at the time; and nobody of his party came up. I asked Mr. Bull what was the matter, and he charged him with having robbed him of his watch. The prisoner denied it; the prisoner appeared as if he had been drinking, but he was sensible; he was capable of running, and did run.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in his defence, called some witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

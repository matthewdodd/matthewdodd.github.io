                  </hi>. I am agent to George Augustus Ward and Co, mustard manufacturers, of Pudding-lane. On the 20th of February I saw the prisoner Vincent—he represented himself as Thomas Wittenham, and said he lived at No. 15, Beauchamp-street, Leather-lane—he said he had not long been in the shop, but he had been in that neighbourhood about sir years—he wished to become a customer, and said he would call again next day—he called the next day, and talked on terms of credit—I said our usual credit was two months, with a good reference—he said he did not want two months, but one month, and that I should have money any time, by giving him two days' notice—he ordered some mustard and pickles, to go to Beauchamp-street, to the amount of 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—in a day or two the prisoner Wittenham came—he represented himself to be a nephew of the other prisoner—he brought a letter and an order—he brought several other orders at different times, and I supplied them to the prisoner Vincent—I occasionally sent them by my boy, and occasionally the prisoner Witten<lb></lb>ham took them—I think Wittenham first came on the 23rd of February, and we went on till about the 3rd or 4th of March, when I began to press for money—the account then amounted to 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I called at Vincent's repeatedly, and I think the last time I saw anybody there was about the 22nd or 23rd of March, when I saw the woman who represented herself as his wife, and he came into the shop, and promised to pay me on the Satur<lb></lb>day, and to bring home some books he had to bind for me—he represented himself as a bookbinder—on the Saturday he did not come—I went on the Tuesday following, when the shop was shut up, and they were all gone—the prisoner Wittenham brought me a number of orders in writing—I mentioned these orders to Vincent, and asked him if the young man was his nephew—he said yes, it was all right.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and live in the Strand. On the 8th of March Vincent came to my shop—he stated his name was Wittenham, and that he had just taken a shop for the purpose of his wife commencing a</p>

               <p>little business in Beauchamp-street, Leather-lane, and that he himself was a bookbinder by trade—he said the trade in this shop was for his wife, and that he was about commencing the next morning—I went to the shop, and from the appearance of it, and his representations, I supplied him with a variety of articles in the grocery and Italian line—the whole amount was 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the first parcel he had was 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and before I supplied him with that he said his account should be paid regularly every Monday, but I was never paid any thing. I let two Mondays go by in consequence of a representation made by Wittenham, who called on the first Monday, and said his uncle would be very much obliged to me, as he had a large order to execute, if I would let the account stand over till the Thursday—I said yes; but they did not call—the last time I supplied them with goods was on Saturday, the 24th, and on the Tuesday following I went, but the shop was shut, and all things cleared away, and many of the fix<lb></lb>tures of the shop were removed—I never was paid any thing at all.</p>

Q.</hi> You had no reference? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, in consequence of the very limited period he required-had it not been for the appearance of the shop I should not have trusted him to any amount—there were a few things there, just as a shop would appear when it was about to be opened.</p>

                  </hi>. I was carman to Timothy Edward Dubugh. On Sunday, the 25th of March, I was engaged to have my cart ready by half-past five o'clock on the Monday morning—I went at half-past five o'clock on Monday morning to Beauchamp-street-as I was going along I saw Wittenham—he said, "Are you going to Beauchamp-street?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Come along with me," and he took me to No. 15, Beauchamp-street-when we got there, Vincent opened the door, and, began <hi rend="italic">having</hi> the things in before I could get out of the cart, and Wittenhams likewise—there was a bed, and mustard-casks, and pickles, and tea-chests, and other things put into the cart—I cannot say whether any thing was left behind, as I did not go into the house-when the things were put in, the two prisoners and a woman followed me—I drove to Slade's-place, down by Goswell-street-all the three prisoners were with me-when I got there the things were taken out of the cart, and taken into a small room in a little house—the woman paid me for the hire of the cart-about a week after, when we went to inquire, I saw the things that I had taken in the grocery line, at a house in Coleman-place, Bunhill-row, and the woman was there—there were the tea-chests and canisters, and the mustard-casks, which I had taken from Beauchamp-street—the chests had something in them, I know, by the weight, but what I cannot say.</p>

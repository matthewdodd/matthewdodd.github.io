               <p>Q. You were surrounded by five or six men - A. Yes; it was a moonshiny morning, very light; my arms were pinioned by some of them, and the prisoner pulled at my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at him; are you sure that he was the man that was pulling at your watch - A. Yes, I am positive that he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he before he was able to get the watch out of your fob. Did you lay hold of your watch - A. Yes, I clapped both my hands to my watch, to prevent it going from me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you think the struggle might continue before he was able to wrench it from your person - A. From three to five minutes; and, by the violence of the pull, when he did get it out, he fell backwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the people still continue to pinion your arms - A. No; as soon as the watch went I received a blow on my face; it did not knock me down; the prisoner got up and ran away, and I after him, and cried out watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did the prisoner run - A. Down William-street, along King Edward street, and when I got into King Edward street, he ran into Bridge-street again.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he out of your sight at all - A. No. I pursued him, and cried out watch, and a fireman stopped him in Bridge-street. I was nearer to him then than I am now; I never lost sight of him at all.</p>

I said, that is the man that has got my watch; he said he had not got the watch, and offered to strip himself, and he ran from the fireman across the road.</p>

            . I am a fireman. I was in Bridge-street upon this morning. I was going to fetch an engine for a fire at Ratcliffe. I heard the cry of watch. I saw the prisoner in Bridge-street. I do not know exactly what street he came out of; he was in Bridge-street when I saw him. I saw the prosecutor follow him. I took to my heels and overtook him, and stopped the prisoner in Bridge-street. The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181205130033"></xptr> prosecutor gave charge of the prisoner for having stolen his watch. The prisoner broke from me once. He said he was not the man they were calling after, he was running the same as other folks - he got away, but he did not get out of my sight. I picked up the watch, it laid about four or five yards from him, in the direction he had been moving; it was in a spot he had passed by in running before I stopped him. The outside case was gone and the glass broke; I did not see him in possession of the watch.</p>

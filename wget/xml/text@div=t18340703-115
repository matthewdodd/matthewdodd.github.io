            . I am sofa and chair-maker, and live in Windmill-street. I was at John Harris's timber-yard on the 26th of May - I saw the prisoner near the counting-house paying the clerk for some wood - the clerk went into the counting-house for change - I saw the prisoner take some veneers, put them between those that he had bought, and give them to a person who was with him - he then took up two deals and a cedar board, and went away - I told the clerk what I had seen - I went after the prisoner, and came up to him in Long-alley - he put the boards against the wall - I asked where the man was who had been with him - he said what was that to me - the clerk and the porter came up - I asked where the man lived - he said if we would go to a street in Bethnal-green, he would show where he lived - he went with us to the end of Church-street, then put his boards down, and would not go any further - the clerk left us to go for an officer - a woman came up - the prisoner spoke to her - she took a cedar board which the prisoner had, and went away with it - I sent the porter with her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. There was a man named Lloyd taken up? A. Yes - I have heard the woman who came to the prisoner was Lloyd's wife - Lloyd brought the veneers back.</p>

            . I am in the service of John Harris. The prisoner purchased some things of me - I saw him going out with two sides of deal and a cedar board - he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030055"></xptr>had not bought of them me, but I cannot swear it was my master's - I saw Lloyd bring back these veneers.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? A. Yes; by coming to the yard to buy wood - he is a looking-glass frame maker - Lloyd said he lived in Bethnal-green.</p>

            . I am porter to the prosecutor. I went after the prisoner - when the woman came up, he gave her the cedar board to carry - I went with her - she asked me to carry it - I did - and when we got to her house she came back with me - I then went back to get the board.</p>

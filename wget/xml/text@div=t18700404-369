                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Chapman, of the Railway Hotel, Clapham—on 28th March I got out of a Brixton omnibus, at the corner of the New Cut—I got to the corner of the Cornwall Road, where I saw Hall, and asked him the way to Roupell Street—he paused some few minutes, and I thought, he did not exactly know—he then said "You cross the road and go down the Cornwall Road, and the fourth turning on the right-hand side—the fourth turning was a railway arch, and there I saw Cherry—I said "Will you kindly tell me if this is Roupell Street?"—he said "Yes, it is," and made a dash at me, and seized me by the throat—I clasped the lappel of his coat, and he struck me a violent blow on the chest—I turned round, and Hall was behind me, who said "Hush, tell me what is the matter—a third man dashed past me, but I only saw his side-face—I cannot swear to him—the three men run away—a man came up</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187004040074"></xptr>
               <p>and I begged him to go after them—I saw my watch and chain in Cherry's hand, and he split my brooch in half—it was found at my feet—I have been under medical treatment ever since—the trinkets were on my chain—I have never seen my watch and chain since—I gave information, and the next day saw nine men at the station, and picked the prisoners out—I have not the least doubt of them—I shall never forget Cherry's face; he had a cap on—I am still suffering, and have been obliged to take a dose of medicine since I have been here.</p>

I am a carpenter, of 94, Aubyn Street—on 28th March I was in Roupell Street, and saw Mrs. Chapman in an excited state—she spoke to me, and I ran after the prisoners and another man, who were running away from her—I was four or five yards from them when I started after them—I followed them to Victoria Court, which leads to the Cut; but did not think it prudent to go through the Court—I had kept four or five yards from them—I saw them in the Waterloo Road next day, and pointed them out to Sharpe, and they were taken—the prisoners are the persons—I was first examined I said that I was not quite sure—I was frightened, I had never been in such a place.</p>

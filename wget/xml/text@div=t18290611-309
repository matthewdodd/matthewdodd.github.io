               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you recollect the prisoner? A. He had asked me for work some time before; he had not contracted with me about these timbers.</p>
               <p>MARGARET HOWARD. I live opposite the prosecutor's premises. On the morning of the 6th of June, I saw the prisoner get over a partition, put over three boards, and then put them on his shoulder; in a few minutes he came, and took three more boards - he was taken on the 10th of June.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to the prosecutor for work- he said he could not employ me till that day week, as he had no materials ready; I went to a public-house, where Mr. Brown was, and begged him to be sent for - he came from the parlour, and said he was going to put most of his work out of doors, as he believed he had a parcel of thieves about him; he was a little elevated, and I left him - I came down to the place that morning, and saw the materials; I said to myself, "I will get about these doors," which he said he would let out to me - I took these boards, which are the regular thickness, for common pannel-doors, and I said "I will make them on my own bench, and let him allow me what he likes;" there were two officers, whom I knew, in the street, and I should have been mad to take them if I intended to steal them.</p>
               <p>MR. BROWN. I did not employ him to do any work; he said he was going to make some doors - I said it was not proper stuff for doors - I do not recollect seeing him at any public-house, but I might at the Black Boy publichouse, where I usually breakfast and dine.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received an excellent character.</p>

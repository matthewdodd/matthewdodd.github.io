               <p>Q. Had you supplied Mr. Hunt's horses with a sufficient stock of corn and hay - A. Yes. My ostler knows more about it than I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you examined any of the corn found in the basket - A. I have; I compared it with the corn in Mr. Hunt's bin; the corn agrees with the corn in Mr. Hunt's stable, and that corn came from my place; I believe it to be some of my corn.</p>
               <p>Q. Has Mr. Hunt any horses but those that you lend him - A. I believe not; I never saw any horses in his stable but my own.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer. I apprehended the prisoner. I saw him with something under his arm; it appeared heavy. I asked him what he had; he said, nothing. I felt it, and told him he had oats. It was covered with a cloth<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181309150067"></xptr>in a basket; he said he had brought it from the stable, he was going to take it to No. 17, Keppel-mews; he did not know the man's name. I then asked him whether it was with the knowledge of his master he had borrowed this corn; he said he did not know it. He had told me that he had borrowed corn of this man, and he was going to return it.</p>

            . I am ostler to Mr. Wilcox and Clark. It is my duty to give the corn to the prisoner for Mr. Hunt's horses. I deliver him corn every fortnight; seven bushels of oats for two horses for a fortnight, eight trusses of hay, four trusses of straw, and two bushels of chaff for a fortnight. Six weeks ago he had an extra horse for two nights.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. About six weeks ago I had a lame horse; I was obliged to have an extra horse. I borrowed a bushel of oats for the extra horse. I asked the ostler for a bushel of oats for the extra horse. He said I should have it. He sent it me. I was going to pay the coachman I had borrowed of, with this bushel, when the officer stopped me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a looking-glass silverer—I was at the concert-room—I saw the prisoner and Hamilton fight in several streets—they fell several times—it was a fair stand up fight—after they refused to take Hamilton in at his lodgings he was put on a board, and carried, and the board broke, and he fell on his head—he seemed to recognize nobody after that—I picked him up, and put his head on my shoulder—they said that his head was bleeding, but there was no blood on my coat—I saw no blood except where his mouth was cut.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon, at St. Bartholomew's Hospital—on 4th July, early in the morning, the deceased was brought there in a state of insensibility, with a very small scalp wound, and a small bruise on the left side of his neck—he remained insensible for a week, till he died—we made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>, and found the scalp bruised on the left side, and an effusion of blood over the left hemisphere of the brain, caused by the rupture of a small blood vessel, which was caused, probably, by the fall—there was no fracture of the skull—the scalp wound gave no indication of what caused the effusion of blood.</p>

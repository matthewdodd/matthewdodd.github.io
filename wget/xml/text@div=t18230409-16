             was a scholar under my care for two years and a half. I have seen him several times since Christmas about his settling in life. I received a letter purporting to come from him; I sealed that letter up with half a sovereign in it, and delivered it to one of my servants, directing it to Mr. B. Winter; I told the servant to deliver it to him, or to any person calling in his name. I subsequently received other letters similar to that, and always sent them back in the same way, but all of them containing larger sums than the one in question. The letter was signed R. Winter, and requested the loan of 10 s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. You ordered it to be delivered to whoever called for it - A. It was left at my door by a young man who said he would call in a quarter of an hour for an answer.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were frequently in his company - A. Yes; we went to different places together. He sent letters to people in my presence, and I believe he received answers to them; and some enclosed money. I never received any money in a letter. I had mentioned Mr. Bellamy's name to him as a gentleman disposed to do a generous action. I wrote a letter about a situation, as the prisoner said he could get me one. I never saw any of his letters to Mr. Bellamy till after this was discovered. I have seen him write letters to persons who he expected would do him a generous action; he was to reap the benefit of them himself; I had nothing to do with it. I never received any money whatever from him - he never paid any tavern bills for me. There was a letter which he wrote for me in consequence of my writing a bad hand; I delivered that to a friend of mine, and waited for the answer. I mentioned my brother's address to him, and he wrote to him, representing himself as Lieutenant Whitworth, and that he could get me a situation. I had told him Mr. Bellamy's address, and that he had assisted me, and told him I had an uncle named Wheeler. I have seen the prisoner since he was apprehended, and told him that he was in danger of being transported; that it was entirely owing to himself, and said I should pity him. I knew what he was charged with at that time. Mr. Bellamy had shown me the letters.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When did you first become acquainted with him - A. A week before he was taken; he introduced himself to me on Saffron-hill. The first transaction between us, was his sending a letter to Sir

A letter came to Mr. Bellamy while I was there; Mr. Bellamy shewed it to me, but I had no knowledge of it. The prisoner was apprehended in consequence of it.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. You met him on Saffron-hill - A. Yes, at an eating-house - he came up stairs, and introduced himself to me. I was out of employ at the time.</p>
               <p>MR. BELLAMY. In consequence of what passed between Winter and me, the prisoner was apprehended, and brought to my house - I charged him with this; he said he had made the application, and received the money, and trusted I would forgive him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner in his Defence, stated that by the prosecutor's request, he had exerted himself to get him a situation - that he had got him to write letters in his name, to Mr. Bellamy, by his consent. He came, and said</p>
               <p>"his uncle would forgive him if I let the blame fall on me."</p>
               <p>MR. BELLAMY. Martin brought him to my house two hours after the letter came.</p>

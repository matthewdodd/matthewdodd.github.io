               <p>Q. You drove the cart did you - A Yes, this cart and horse belonged to Mr. Sparrow; I came to Mr. Wells in Philpot Lane and took up some Sugar; there came up to me a young man, and said he had two boxes to take to the Belle Savage Ludgate-hill, he would give me eighteen-pence to take them, he went up Philpot Lane with me while I loaded the cart, from there we went into Lombard Street; he said it is up this Lane, I went with him about half down the Lane, I asked him which house it was; he said it was a mistake he had led me across Cannon Street to Crooked Lane, and then run away, and when I came back the cart was gone.</p>

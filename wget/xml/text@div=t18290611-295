These things were in my bed-room - the prisoner lodged in the same room. On the 14th of April I got up at six o'clock in the morning, and went out, leaving him in bed; another person slept in the same room, who got up, and went out when I did - I returned about twelve o'clock, and the landlady mentioned to me about a new sheet being taken off the bed; I went up, and missed these articles - I met the prisoner on the 18th of May, and asked him if he knew me - he said he did not, and I gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>JOHN BOURNE. I am a pawnbroker. On the 13th of April, this razor and strop were pawned in the name of Wright, for 9d.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to my lodging: the landlady told me the prosecutor wanted me at a public-house- I went there, and asked what he wanted; he said, "D-n you, it is all right, drink a glass of ale;" I did, and then he said, "Have you any objection to a young man sleeping with us?" I said if they had no objection I had not - he said, "D-n me, that is all right," and he gave me another glass of ale: at half-past eleven o'clock the landlord came to clear the house; the prosecutor said he would have some more, and he had some rum - he said to the other man,"You must stay till they are gone to bed;" he then came up, and we went to bed; I heard them talking in the night - when I awoke they were gone.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Who was that young man? A. A butcher, named Lawson, who lived just by; I am certain he left the room with me; the prisoner was searched at the watch-house, but we could not find the duplicate - I asked where it was: he took me to two places, but the things were not there - he then took me to the right place.</p>

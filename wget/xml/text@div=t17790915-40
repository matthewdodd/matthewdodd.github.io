               <p>I am servant to Mr. Weaver, who keeps the Dolphin in the Strand at the top of Essex-street. The prisoner came to my master's the night the things were lost, and desired him to let him leave a bundle or two there; he said he had had a quarrel with his master, and should leave him in a few days; at the first time he brought the gold cane and the hat; he went out again and brought another bundle; there was the cape of a coat stuck out; he brought another bundle with eight new books. They were taken away again the same night. His master and Mr. Adams came and had the things. I cannot tell what the bundles contained.</p>

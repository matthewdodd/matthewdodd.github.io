She was in my house all the same as one of my family; she was very seldom from me a day. I missed the things mentioned in the indictment, on the 7th of this instant May, at night. They used to be always in my kitchen, not locked up. The prisoner had been at my house that day, but was gone. I sent for her twice; she did not come. Then I went to her, and said I wanted to speak to her. She came with me to our house. She fell a crying, and said, I know what you want with me; you want a shirt that I have taken. Said I, Where is the cap and handkerchief, and the rest of the things? She said, she had pawn'd them to Mr. Lane, and got drunk with the money. I took her to Justice Welch, and then went to Mr. Lane's, in Purple-lane, and found the things accordingly.</p>
               <p>John Lane. I took these things in of the prisoner at the bar; the first on the 13th of April, and the last on the 10th of this instant. I lent her 3 s. 10 d. upon them. She said the prosecutrix sent her with them.</p>
               <p>S. Lane. I never sent her to pawn any thing in my life.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>She sent me a great many times to pawn things. She has been out till one or two in the morning, and left me with the children: I pawn'd these things to maintain them. She owes me money.</p>
               <p>S. Lane. I do not owe her a farthing: I always paid her as soon as she had done her work, and sometimes before.</p>

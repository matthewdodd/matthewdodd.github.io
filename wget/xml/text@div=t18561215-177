                  </hi>. I am a sailor. Last Thursday night week I was at a house in a street near Tooley-street, sleeping with the prisoner, somewhere between 11 or 12 o'clock—while we were in bed the deceased Cox came into the room, and began abusing the prisoner—she called her a nasty, dirty, stinking thing—after a little while they went out of the room together—they were both in liquor—I heard them <hi rend="italic">jawing</hi>—in about two minutes the prisoner came back, and remained with me the rest of the night—Cox after<lb></lb>wards came into the room with two policemen, and took the prisoner into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 20, Unicorn-square, Tooley-street, in the same house with prisoner and deceased—the deceased's name was Mary Ann Warren, she was generally called Mrs. Cox—on the night in question I was in the back room up stairs, and, hearing a noise, went into the front room—I there found the prisoner and Evans in bed, and Cox was in the room—she had burst the door open—I heard her speak angrily to to the prisoner, but did not hear what she said—the prisoner made no reply—Cox</p>

I was sent for, and saw the deceased Cox at No. 20, Unicorn-square; she was in bed; she had received a wound in the upper and back part of the right side of the head—it was a deep seated wound, extending to the bone—I should say it was such a wound as might have been inflicted with a glass with a stem to it—I caused her to, be removed to the infirmary that same day—I should say the wound must</p>

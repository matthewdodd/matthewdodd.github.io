                  </hi>. I live at 21, Hatfield-street, St. Lute's. I am the wife of Michael Isaacs—he has five names—I do not live with him—we have been parted nearly three years and a half—I live with Charles Reed—on Wednesday evening, 23rd Oct., a little before ten o'clock, I went out with a half-sovereign in my left-hand, sent by Reed for half an ounce of tobacco—I met the prisoner and several of her companions in Goswell-street—the pri<lb></lb>soner said, "Here is the <hi rend="italic">Jewess"</hi> meaning me, and she caught hold of me and gave me several blows in the face—I made an effort, got away from her, and went back home—the street-door opens with a string—there are many lodgers in the house besides ourselves—I pulled the street-door open, and not finding Charles at home, I returned back to look for him, when I was attacked at the bottom of Hatfield-street by the prisoner and another, held up against the wall, and the half-sovereign forced out of my hand by the prisoner, who made my hand black and blue—there were several round, and one who assisted her is outside now—I went into Goswell-street to look for a policeman, but could not find one, and went to Featherstone-street station—as I was going, I again met the prisoner, and several of her mob—she said, "Here is the <hi rend="italic">lagger,"</hi> and called me a horrid name, and gave me several kicks in the lower part of my body, and said before I should serve her as I had others she would gouge my eye out with her thumb nail—she put her thumb nail in this eye, but fortunately it did not go into it, it did not hurt me much—I fomented it and it got better—I was very much injured at the lower part of my body, but my face has healed—a few weeks before this occurred I had been a witness against some companions of the prisoner's for hocussing and robbing a sailor, and that is why they are so inveterate against me—I and Charles Reed could scarcely move outside the house for them—the prisoner has often threatened me about it.</p>

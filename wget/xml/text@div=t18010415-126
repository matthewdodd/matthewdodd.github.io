             sworn. - I am a watchman at Islington, near Sadler's-Wells: On the 13th of April, as I was crying the hour of four in the morning, I saw the prisoner coming down by Mr. Lane's pales, on the other side of the way; I followed him, and asked him what he had got upon his head; he told me it was lead, that he had brought it from Mr. Crowder's, in Lower-street, Islington, and was going with it to Mr. Marsh's, upon Mutton-hill; he said that was his master, and he should have been there an hour ago; I then took him into custody; as I was going along, he slung the lead off his head ar me, and knocked me down; I followed him and sprung my rattle; he was taken in Mr. Bailey's back place, in Rosoman-street; I am sure the prisoner is the same man, I knew him again immediately, it was day-light; I found upon him a pair of pincers, and a chissel. (The lead produced);</p>

               <p>Mr. Wase. The building is of a particular construction of my own, and the lead is cut to sit it exactly; I am sure it is my lead.</p>

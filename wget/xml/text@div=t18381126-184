                  </hi>. I live in Holland-street, Bethnal green. I knew the deceased Robert Royal about two months—he was about sixteen years old, and was a lucifer match-maker—we were all three in the employ of Mr. Molyneux—I and Royal worked in one room, and the prisoner in another—on the afternoon of the 20th of November, between five and six o'clock, Marsh was tying up bundles, standing outside the room where we were at work—Royal went into his room and took down his candlestick to seal up some parcels—that left Marsh in the dark-Marsh seized the can<lb></lb>dlestick again, and said "Put it up, <hi rend="italic">Boneynose</hi> "—Royal said nothing, but went round and hit Marsh directly a <hi rend="italic">punch</hi>—it was not a severe blow-Marsh had a penknife in his hand which he had been working with, and he said, "If you come and hit me again I will run it into you"—Royal hit him again a box on the ear as he was standing against a bench—he held op his hand towards Royal, with the knife in it, and I think he may have ran on it without Marsh moving it or striking at him—he had it held out in his hand before Royal ran in on him to box his ears—Royal was bigger than the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Hoxton. I examined the person of the deceased—I observed an incised wound on the left side, about three inches above the groin—he was much taller than the prisoner, so that his groin would be considerably above the same part of the prisoner—I think it possible the wound might have occurred by the boy running against the knife if the point was held downwards, and it might also be caused by striking downwards—there was nothing to exclude the supposition that he might have run on it—the wound was about the same size as the blade, which would the rather import that there was no strikings but that the knife was steady at the time.</p>

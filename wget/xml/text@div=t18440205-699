                  </hi>. I live in Coleman-street. On Monday night last, about half-past ten o'clock, I was coming from Gloucester-place, Hoxton—the prisoner came up to me, and laid bold of my left arm—she asked me to go with her—I said, "Pooh, nonsense," and told her to go home—she then gave me a pull, and <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> herself against me, put her hand into my pocket, took out my purse, and ran away—I missed my purse, and ran after her—I had seven sovereigns, a half-crown, three shillings, and a sixpence in it—I had seen it safe about three minutes before—I caught her, and said she had got my purse—she said she had not—I called "Police"—several persons came about, but they did not interfere, except one woman, who swept her hand round, as if she were feeling for something—the policeman came up, and took the prisoner—I went to the station, and saw my purse there—this is it.</p>

               <p>Walbrook—on Friday evening, 13th December, Coombes and Williams came in—they asked for a pint of porter, which came to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Coombes gave me a florin, which I tried in the tester and bent it—he then gave me half-a-crown, and I gave him the change—he asked for the florin or a piece of it, but I refused it—Henderson then came in and took the change from him—I gave the florin to Henderson, and he took them both in custody—Betts, the constable, then brought in Wheeler, and they were all three taken to the station.</p>

I generally serve in plain clothes—I was with, Betts, in Cheapside, on 13th December, at twenty minutes past 8 in the evening—I saw Coombes and Wheeler walking together in conversation; they passed me and looked at me—they went on for a little distance, and looked at me for a considerable time—in consequence of that, I followed them, and saw them meet Williams a few yards past Queen-street—they all walked towards the Mansion-house in conversation, and at the corner of Charlotte-row, which leads into Walbrook, Williams parted with them, and crossed the road in the direction of the European—the other two men walked in front of the Mansion-house, and returned immediately and went down Charlotte-row, and joined Williams who was there—I remained them, and saw Wheeler put his hand into his pocket, take something out, and hand it to Coombes—they all three looked at it minutely by a lamp-post, and went in the direction of Walbrook—Williams and Coombes crossed over and went into Deacon's coffee-house; and Wheeler went down a little further towards Cannon-street—I and Betts got into the coffee-house and heard the barmaid saying to Coombes, "This is a bad one, I shall not give it to you"—I seized hold of his hand seeing a florin in it, and said, "Give me this, I am a police-officer"—I said to the barmaid, "What has he given you?"—she said, "A bad 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece"—I said, "Mark it and give it to me"—she did so; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Betts went out and brought Wheeler in—I searched Coombes, but found nothing on him—we got assistance—Williams was placed between two civilians, and we took them to the station—Coombes tripped me up on College-hill—I fell gently on my back, and he on top of me; and as he got up, he jumped twice on my chest with his knees in a violent manner; and when he got up, he made a most desperate kick in the lower part of my stomach, and kicked a gentleman on the thigh—I was very severely injured—I held him by the scarf, and he bit a piece out of my thumb.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoners statements before the Magistrate was here read as follows:—</hi> Coombes says. "We, me and Williams, were coming down Eastcheap and overtook Wheeler, and he asked me whether I would buy a pawn ticket; he said he wanted ninepence for it, and all three of us went to look at it underneath the lamp. I offered him sixpence for it, and he would not take it. I then bid him good night, and went across the road to get a pint of beer; I gave a florin piece, and she said it was a bad one; I said I was very sorry, and gave her half-a-crown, and asked her to let me look at it; she gave me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out, and said she would show the florin to her master; with that the constable came in and wanted to take the money out of my hand, and I would not let him. I asked him what he was, and going along to the station-house, he still tried to get the money out of my hand, and in the struggle he fell, and I fell atop of him, and another gentleman on the top of me, and I was pulled off and thrown on my back; and I asked them to let me get up and walk, as I was choking, and I went to the station."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Wheeler says:</hi> "When I left Coombes and Williams, I went to the bottom of Walbrook and leant on a post, waiting for Williams and Coombes to come out and take sixpence for this pawn-ticket, and I saw the constable Betts, coming down the street, and he said there was two men wanted me in the public-house, I said there were no two men wanted me, as there was no one there that I knew, but I would go; and we all three went to the station.

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and live in Somerset-street, Port<lb></lb>man-square. The prisoner came into my service in August last—he had been working for Mr. Price, of Staple's Inn, previously—I observed his situation, and offered him employment—while he was with me I missed a variety of trifling articles, and on the 8th of February I missed some papers, and spoke to him about it on the morning of the 9th—I told him I thought there were a great number of papers gone out of different boxes and pigeon; holes, and taxed him with taking them—he denied having done so—I went to his lodging, and, in consequence of what I saw there, went on the 11th to Mr. Marner, a pork butcher in Charles-street, Hatton-garden, where I saw some of my papers, consisting of briefs, drafts of deeds, office copies, bun<lb></lb>dles of original letters, bills and answers in Chancery, and legal proceedings of every description—I understand there was about 5lbs. weight altogether—I never authorised the prisoner to dispose of any of them—they were of great value to me—some were papers in cases now pending—most of the letters were on matters now concluded, but they are always important, as we never can tell when we may have occasion to refer to them—some were agents' letters—this letter (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) is in the prisoner's hand<lb></lb>writing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of Hatton-garden police-office. I took the prisoner into custody on the 9th of February, at his lodging, in Tash-court, Gray's Inn-lane—I told him he was suspected of robbing his master, Mr. Nation, of papers—he said he had never taken a paper out of Mr. Nation's office in his life—I examined his premises, and in a cupboard found a bundle of papers—I brought it to the office, and afterwards went to his lodgings, and, in consequence of what his child told me, went to Mr.</p>

             sworn. - I am a Policeofficer, and apprehended the prisoner on the Saturday evening; the robbery having been committed the Tuesday night or Wednesday morning before: I went to inspect the place, and Miss Green and the prisoner went up stairs with me; the prisoner held the candle, and I found the lines which hold the weights of the window were cut; but it appeared they were cut in an awkward manner, and not in the way a house-breaker would cut them; and my reason for supposing so is, that the knife must have missed in the cutting, because it broke a bit of the window, about an inch broad; in my opinion there had been no breaking on the outside, there being no marks; I also saw that it was impossible to cut the cord on the other side of the window, because the hole in the window was not big enough to admit an infant's hand, therefore it must have been cut inside; I then thought it proper to ask the prisoner some questions, and took her to the counting-house,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180212010058"></xptr>and asked her about her father, mother, and relation; I told her to be cautious in what she said as I did not mean to take any advantage of what she said, but only wanted to know if she could inform me any thing relative to the robbery; she said, that sometime before she had seen a man in a sailor's dress walking very often backwards and forwards before the door; that was all she told me; I called Miss Green, and said I should be obliged to take her servant with me, which I did, to a public-house, near the office, and ordered the master to let her have every thing proper, and not confine her too close; the prisoner did not appear at all agitated, but only pleaded ignorant to the transaction; next day being Sunday, I told the landlord not to let any body see her, she being very young; and as I did not suppose her to be an old offender, I did not search her so much as I otherwise should have done, so that I found nothing upon her that night; on Monday, I took her before the Magistrate, and Miss, Green attended.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. This was the one-pair of stairs window, could a person of the prisoner's description safely get out of it? - A. There is a sort of penthouse under it, which I did not examine; though I don't think it is very probable that such a girl could get down from it, it would be dangerous, as it is a loftyhouse. Miss Green, Daniel White, and the two Daltons, attended at the Magistrate's, who thougth proper, upon the evidence, to recommit the prisoner for further examination, but did not send her to prison; the day following, in consequence of information I received, that she had some letters which she was looking at, I went up stairs, and took the servant of the house with me to be present; I desired the prisoner to set me see her pockets; she took off one which was empty, and handed it to me; I told her, I was not satisfied with that, but must see the other; she said, she had no other, and set herself down upon the bed; I then said, I would not do any thing that was wrong, and desired the servant to take notice of what I did, and had done; I insisted on having the pocket, which was refused; and at length I felt under her petticoats, and found a bundle, I took it out, and found it to be her pocket, in which was this lace, and a small lace called Tooting, (producing them); I asked her how she came by it; she said, she found it, but Miss Green swore to it, and the prisoner was committed for trail.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hart. Q. What part of the window was broke? - A. The window on the right hand entering the room; the cords were cut, and a pane broke.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it large enough to let in an instrument from without side? - A. It might be put in, but it could not cut the line on the other side, and yet they were cut on both sides.</p>
               <p>Q. You searched the prisoner the first night? - A. On the Saturday night, I very gently searched her, I only rubbed her things down, I was very delicate with her, she being a young girl, and not supposing her to be guilty of any former offence.</p>
               <p>Q. You found some letters in her pocket, which she did not like you to look at, I believe? - A. Very likely that might be her reason for refusing her pocket.</p>
               <p>Q.Does Miss Green keep more servants than one? - A. She has some men who cut corks in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Was the glass inside the room, or outside? - A. It was a very small bit of glass, I searched for it, but could not find it, it was dark, being eight o'clock at night when I looked for it.</p>

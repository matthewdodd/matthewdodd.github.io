One Ledyard called on me, and asked me to give him the cash for a bill of 6 l. I gave it him. The prisoner was present, and offered Ledyard 5 l. for it. I gave him 6 l. - he owed me 20 s. - I gave him five sovereigns, and kept the bill in my possession about three weeks, and the prisoner told me he had a friend who would discount it. I gave the bill to him for that purpose. He made the proposition himself. I told him, if he could get it done at five per cent. I would give him a glass of grog for his trouble. No particular time was fixed for him to bring the cash. This was about the 18th or 25th of August - I asked him for the money a day or two after; he said his friend was out of town, and he could not get it done; he returned it to me afterwards, and in three or four days said his friend was in town, and asked for it I gave it him. I asked him for the money next day; he said his friend was not at home - I saw him every day till he was taken up, but he never gave me the money.</p>

             sworn. - I am an Officer: I apprehended the prisoner last Tuesday, about one o'clock; I was sent for to Mrs. Burr's, to take the prisoner into custody; as soon as I went into her room Mrs. Burr gave me charge of her, and told me she missed two sheets and one blanket; the prisoner told me she had pawned them, and I immediately asked her for the duplicates; she pulled out her hussiff from her pocket, and presented it me; these are the duplicates I found in her hussiff, with sixteen more duplicates of other articles; she told me she expected her husband home that afternoon with money to redeem them; I asked if she was a married woman; she said, no, the man she lived with was a soldier in the Tower-Hamlets militia, and a weaver by trade.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the prosecutrix.) Did she come to your house as a married woman? - A. Yes, and the person who gave her the character said he was a soldier; he did not come with her when she took the room; I have seen him go up and down stairs; I thought it might be her husband, but now it seems he is not. (The property identified by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I did not intend to defraud her of the sheets, or of her blankets; I was out of work at the time and the young man too, and I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180501090045"></xptr>was very much distressed; when they sent the Officer, on that day the young man was to bring home half a guinea, which he did, but before he was come home I was at Clerkenwell; I meant to get the things out with that money; I hope you will have mercy on me; I never mean to do so again; when I was taken to prison I was all that day and the next day without any thing to eat till dinner time.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I had a good account with her.</p>
               <p>Court. Why were you in such a hurry?</p>

On 22nd June, about 9 o'clock, I saw the prisoner and two others in Billingsgate Market, packing a quantity of fish baskets together—I watched them some time—the prisoner placed a, large quantity of baskets on his head and went through Nicholson's Wharf, leading to Fresh Wharf—I waited till he came out—he threw the baskets down and ran away—he was stopped on London Bridge without my losing sight of him—I said "I shall take you for stealing a quantity of baskets from Billingsgate Market—he said I should not have taken them if I had not been drinking—he was not tipsy—there were seventeen baskets—I produce one of them—Nicholson's Wharf was on his way to where he threw them down—it was not a place where he could be as easily observed—it was more out of sight than if he had gone through the market, where he would have been stopped—the police do not patrol the wharf—he saw me before that—the baskets belonged to different people.</p>

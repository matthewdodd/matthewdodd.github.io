                  </hi>. I am a policeman. About half-past three o'clock, on the morning of the 17th of August, I saw the prisoner in Brook-street, Ratcliffe, with a blue shirt on, and this work-box under it—I stopped him and took it from him, and asked where he brought it from—he said, "From the West Indies a long time ago," and that Johnson, a shipmate, left it him there—I asked where Johnson lived—he said at Shadwell—I said I must go to him—he then said all he had said was untrue; that he picked it up in the Back-road.</p>

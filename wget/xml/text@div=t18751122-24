                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector</hi>). In consequence of information re<lb></lb>ceived from Paris, I obtained a warrant to search the house, 11, Ashley Road, Tottenham—accompanied by Sergeant Greenham I proceeded to the stable adjoining the house, where I found what appeared to be a carpenters bench or work table—the stable did not present the appearance of being used for ordinary purposes—upon removing the cloth from the table I found underneath a wooden case, which turned out to be a press machine, weighing about 16 cwt. to a ton—I found a turner's lathe, this crucible (<hi rend="italic">prodiked</hi>), a lot of tools, files, shears, gauge, spanner, pincers, and some metal—in the coach house I found a large crucible, which from appearance bad been recently used—from the coach house I went upstairs into the house, and found these two die dishes—in another room I found some metal, a tin of potash, tin of charcoal, some quicksilver, and a small phial with some fluid in it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant</hi>). About the second week in October I received certain communications from the French police authorities, in consequence of which I, in company with Davey, went to the house of the prisoner—I talked with him in the back parlour while Davey made the search—I told prisoner he must consider himself in custody—he replied that any one might possess the machines he had, which were for the manufacture of Oriental necklaces—I searched him and found a pocket-book and some platinum clippings—he begged hard for the pocket-book to be resumed to him, and asked if he were imprisoned what would become of his wife and two children; he referred to her afterwards as his companion; he also inquired whether she had been arrested in London, or New Haven, or Paris, stating he had sent her to the latter place for some articles for the manufacture of Oriental necklaces and the Queen was so much liked all over the world that. her profile stamped upon them would be the best—I took him to the police-station, where he gave the name of Raymond Joseph Laving—I found in the pocket-book amongst others a letter dated "London, October 6th, 1875." <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not very well know that he had not a wife, nor of her arrest in Paris—I knew of her arrest when I made the search—I did not know he was a widower—I made no demand for the pocket-book, I searched him and took it—some of the letters were from his daughter, which I gave him back—I believe she is in a situation as governess.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">interpreted</hi>). I am brigadier inspector at Paris—I well know Foconee, the engraver—some time last September I got instructions from my chief to watch Foconee's house—I did watch, and saw a woman named Valestoe go in there—on the 6th October I saw her go into 5, Rue des Been Finance; Madame de Chateau View lived there—she walked up and down as if waiting for some one, then Mrs. Foconee came and handed her a parcel—she came out, and I followed her to the railway station—she claimed this basket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) she had deposited there—she was arrested and searched at once; upon her I found two dies, nine or ten francs, one 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece wrapped up in paper, and these articles (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in the bag—the basket was searched the next day before the Magistrate; in it was a galvanic battery and this metal plate (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), a piece of platinum, a bottle of potash, and other articles.</p>
               <p>

               <p>she said also that Lavigne did not want to go himself for fear of being taken into custody, and sent her, knowing that people did not pay so much atten<lb></lb>tion to women—she said that Lavigne had told her that these articles were to make necklaces from, but at the same time she did not believe if that was the case he would have made such, precautions—nothing was said about contraband.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">interpreted</hi>). I am an engraver on steel, living at 2, Eye Anuaire, Paris—I know the prisoner—I first saw him at the com<lb></lb>mencement of August—he gave me instructions to reproduce exactly the two sides of this coin (1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and stated he wanted them for Oriental necklaces—I have received letters from him and on the 30th August he called again bringing two pieces of steel—he, in referring to the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., said the work must be perfect, and it would only be the commencement of further orders—he paid me 250 francs in advance, for which I gave a receipt and told him the work would be finished exactly on the day named—his letters were headed High Holborn, and he left the name of Lavigne—the next day I gave information to the police, because we are not allowed to do any work of this kind without informing them—I finished the work, the two dies, two pun<lb></lb>cheons and collar—I wrote to him this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), (dated 25th Sep<lb></lb>tember and found in prisoner's possession by Greenham)—about the 4th or 5th October a woman came to my premises from Lavigne, produced my receipt, which I tore up, and gave another for the full amount—she gave the address, 5, Hue des Bien Finance, where I sent my wife with the collar to deliver.</p>

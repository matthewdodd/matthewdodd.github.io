I am the waggoner, my master left me in Hammersmith, the prisoner got into the waggon, just at the other end of Hammersmith, he asked me whether I would get up and ride, and then he would take a turn, he rode till he got to Brentford, and then he got out, he walked by the side of me as far as <placeName id="t18090920-141-crimeloc823">Hounslow</placeName>

The prisoner is the same man, he was taken up about a week afterwards.</p>

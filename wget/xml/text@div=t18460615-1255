                  </hi>. I am secretary of the Marine Insurance Company, No. 27, Cornhill. On the 25th of May, I met the prisoner coming out of the board-room of the company, which is on the second floor, with a bundle under his arm—a clock stands in the board-room on a bracket, about six feet from the ground—I asked what it was he had—he told me it was a clock—I then untied the handkerchief, and saw it was this clock, belonging to the company—I asked what he was going to do with it—he said, in very broken English, that he was going to give it to Mr. Spiers, I understood him, or, at all events, to some person who was then waiting for him in the house—I accompanied him down stairs to see this person—when I got to the basement I proposed to go into the porter's room—he declined to go there, and with so much effron<lb></lb>tery that I thought it possible he might have come from M'Cabe's, who winds up the clock—he pointed to an opposite room—I asked if the man was there—he said yes—I went there, but no one was there, and I had no reason to be<lb></lb>live</p>

               <p>any one had been there—I sent for the policeman, and gave the prisoner in charge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi> (<hi rend="italic">through the interpreter.</hi>)I told him somebody gave me the clock who was a watchmaker, and was waiting for me; I have been five weeks in London; I came over from Hamburgh for the races; one Sunday I went to Greenwich-park, I met an Englishman; he came in conversation; we went to a hotel; I w as very glad to meet an Englishman who could speak German; he stated he was a watch-maker; be noticed I had no watch, so he offered me one for sale for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I bought; I afterwards went with him to my lodging in Houndsditch; that was on Sunday; a fortnight afterwards I went out to go from my lodging to the West, and was arrested; as I came to the Royal Exchange I met the man; he had a parcel under his arm; he asked me to oblige him to carry it for him; I do not know what was in it; I followed him; he took me two stories high in the house; he took the clock which beloogs to this gentleman from the mantelpiece; he put it into a handkerchief, and gave it me, and asked me to wait whilst he went down to see the parties who the clock belonged to; the party did not come; I went down stairs, and was stopped.</p>

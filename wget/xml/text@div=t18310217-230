            . On the 2nd of February I told my wife to pay the prisoner 5s. 3d. for three hours and a half, at 1s. 6d. an hour - it was for moving some goods in Mr. Daffurn's van: the prisoner had the management of it -I saw the money paid to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Have you a person in your employ named Charles Franklin? A. No-I had sent a person to the yard for the van, but he is not here; I do not know who he delivered the message to.</p>
               <p>MR. DAFFURN re-examined. Q. Had the prisoner any permission to attend with the cart? A. Certainly, if a job came in; I had not that day given him authority to go with it - I was not at home; he had a general authority to go with it, and receive money - he had been a regular servant at one time, and has worked there two or three years.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you a person in your employ named Charles Franklin? A. Yes, but he is not here; it would not have required any authority for the prisoner to go with the van.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Hancock came to me with a message from Mr. Dairy to remove some goods; I went to do the job on my own account - I met Mr. Franklin, and asked him for a van, which he said I could have; I went, received 5s. of Mr. Dairy, and there was a man with the van who had 3d. - I went home, and paid my master 3s. 6d. for two hours and three-quarters, at 1s. 3d. an hour - I kept the other 1s. 6d. for my trouble.</p>
               <p>MR. DAFFURN. If he had asked me to let him do it, I, perhaps, should not have refused him, but he ought to have asked me - he would have received 6d. an hour for the job.</p>

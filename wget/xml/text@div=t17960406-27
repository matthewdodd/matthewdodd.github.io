               <p>Q. Do you remember, on the night of the 9th of February, any thing happening, and what? - A. Yes; on a Wednesday I heard a noise between four and five in the morning; I slept in the warehouse below stairs; I saw three men enter the room, one of whom came before the rest, with a lanthorn in his hand; he ran up to me, pushed me down in the bed, and told me, if I did not he quiet, he would shoot me; they then covered my head over with the cloaths, and asked me for the keys of the iron chest, which, I told them, were out of the house; they broke open all the locks, and took out the lace; and then they asked me questions where the key of the till was, which I told them was up stairs; they said, that would not do; they then asked me if that was my watch that lay upon the counter; I said, yes, it is, but, I am sure you will not take that; they said, no, they would not; but they did take it; after lying sometime, and asking me a few questions, they broke open the till, and all the drawers round; and they were quiet some time; I heard the man next me take one step from me; and I supposed they were gone; I got out of bed and holloa'd as loud as. I could, and the watchman sprung his rattle; I opened the street door, and ran round to the back door, and the watchman pursued them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know either of the men at the bar? - A. The man in the brown coat, Smith, is the man who stood by my bed; the other man, Parrock, is the man that had the lanthorn in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure of that? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see them again? - A. A very little time after; it might be a quarter of an hour, or not so much, at she watch-house; when I came to the watch-house our goods had been taken from them; they were both in custody; one at the Mary-le-bonne watch-house, and the other at the watch-house in Mount-street, Grosvenor-square.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has the property? -

            Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore, whatever persons you saw, you saw them with all that terror upon your mind? - A. Yes; I saw them two minutes before they came to me; as if they were surprised to find me there; I had a full view of them from head to foot.</p>
               <p>Q. For a short time, and that only by the light of a dark lanthorn? - A. They turned round, and were all over the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Still you were under considerable alarm? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If a person was likely to be mistaken it would be at a time when under considerable alarm? A. When I awake from my sleep. I know what I am about, as well as if I had been awake a long time.</p>

               <p>Q. Over which they have no controul? - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard this alarm given by your nephew? A. Yes; I had been disturbed for a quarter of an hour or more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe where the house was broke? - A. Yes; I ran into the street with a cutlass in my hand; I thought my nephew had pursued the prisoners, and went to assist him; I always make it a rule, every night that I am in town, to see that the doors are fast; and I can answer that every thing was safe; there were three or four hundred empty cards of lace lying about the floor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You have two partners in your business? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the rent of the house paid out of the partnership account? - A. It is from the general account.</p>
               <p>Q. The rent is paid from the joint account of al of you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. To whom is the lease granted? - A. To me.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the rent paid generally, or is it paid to you, by them, as a consideration for the trade? - A. It is paid out of the general account.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the sum allowed out of the trade the sum you paid for the rent? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Still that rent is paid out of the partnership fund? - A. Yes; and so is every thing else.</p>
               <p>Q. It arises out of the profits of that trade? - A. Yes; my nephew comes to town once a year, as a visitor.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. And he does contribute to the rent when he comes? - A. There is no room appropriated to him at all; and when he comes to town, he always comes as a visitor.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Don't you conceive that all the partners have a right to sleep there? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. You never lost fight of Smith? - A. No.</p>

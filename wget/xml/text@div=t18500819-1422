I am parish-clerk, of Marylebone, and produce the marriage register—here is an entry on 1st Aug., 1824, of the marriage of Samuel Fitzgerald and Mary Tilley—a person named Parr, the parish-clerk at that time, was a witness; he has been dead some years—"Mary Tilley, her mark, †" is signed to it—that appears to have been written by the Rev. William Baker, the clergyman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoemaker. Samuel Fitzgerald was apprenticed to my father—I recollect the time of his marriage in 1824—I was not present at it, but I saw him the same day—I afterwards saw the prisoner with him as his wife—her name was Mary Tilley—they lived toge<lb></lb>ther two or three years, I think—Fitagerald left my father before he was out of his time, but he continued to work at his trade for some time—after three or four years he left his wife, and enlisted as a soldier—I saw him again in 1842, where he came from abroad—he called on me—he had then got his discharge—I do not know the month they were married, it was summer.</p>

In Jan., 1831, I was married to the prisoner at St. George's, Bloomsbury—I lived with her sixteen years, and have five children alive by her—I saw Fitzgerald six or seven years after I married her—the prisoner was present, and he said, "I have come to claim you on a charge of bigamy; I suppose you thought I was dead; you will find out your mistake"—the prisoner then sent her daughter to get some poison—I continued living with her after that—I left her last July three years—I last saw Fitzgerald before the Magistrate, at Richmond.</p>

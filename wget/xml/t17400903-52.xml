            . The Prisoner was put into Possession of Drury-Lane Play-house, on Account of Mr Fletewood's Misfortunes, and he declared to me, on the 15th of August, that he stole the Lace off the Prince's Canopy; there were 7 Yards and 1 Foot of narrow Lace taken away, and he owned he sold it to Mr. Dinely for 6 d. I have laid it in the Indictment, but at 10 s. tho' I believe 5 l. would not make good what was taken away. I can't be a Judge what it was worth, if it was to have been sold.</p>

            . When the Lace was missing, the Boy was taken up; and for 2 Hours he would confess nothing. Afterwards he own'd it, and said he had sold it to Mr Dinely. It was a narrow single Lace, upon the Canopy which is put up when his Royal Highness comes to the House.</p>

            . I keep a Silversmith's Shop in Drury-Lane . Mr. Hobson came to me, and asked me if I had not bought some Silver Lace? I told him I had bought a Six-penny Weight. I saw no more, and it was as black as my Hat, and good for nothing but the Fire. I gave the Prisoner Six-pence for it, - it weighed no more. I knew the Boy to be a Neighbour, and had not heard any Harm of him. I asked him how he came by it? And he told me he had it off an old Elbow-Chair</p>

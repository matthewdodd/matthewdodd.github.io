               <p>MR. WHITE. I am a surgeon. I was called in on the 9th of May, to attend on the deceased, at a public-house in Theobald's-road, and found him in the arms of three or four persons, in the back yard; he was very black in the face. I ordered him to be put to bed, when I opened his arm, but could only extract two ounces of blood - I then opened the jugular vein, from whence came about fourteen ounces; he died soon afterwards, as I was informed. I left him because I knew nothing could be done for him. I opened the head next evening, as the Coroner's Inquest sat on the body - I found about four ounces of extravasated blood pressing on the brain. His death was caused by some violence; I should think external - there have been instances where a vessel has been ruptured by violent exertion, but I have never witnessed one myself. I consider the agitation of the mind of the deceased might contribute to form the rupture.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. A rupture might be caused by the mind being violently affected with passion, and a great effusion of blood, pour on the brain - A. Yes.</p>

            . I live at Mr. Bridges, in Hatton-wall, and am a baker. I knew the deceased - I saw him last Thursday week, in Copenhagen-fields, about six o'clock in the evening; I saw the prisoners there. I had seen Lake on the preceding Tuesday, and went to see him and the deceased fight - when I saw Lake on the Tuesday, he said he would rather not fight. I saw them fight; it lasted eighteen minutes, when the deceased was carried off the ground - I went the same evening to the Cross Keys, public-house to see him. I observed he was discoloured about the head and neck; he was dead, The prisoner Butler was second to the deceased; they fought for four sovereigns. I held the stakes, because I was requested to do so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I heard Butler persuade them not to fight, and tried to prevent it. There was another second to attend the deceased, who rendered every possible assistance. I never knew M'Cloed by name before. He was considered a taller man then Lake. I was not near enough when they were fighting to learn what Butler said to the combatants. I believe Butler and the deceased lived together as fellow servants.</p>

            . I keep the Bedford-head, public-house, in Upper King-street. I only knew M'Cloed, by his coming into the house with others. On the Saturday before the fight, they were there at a singing club; this was on the 3d of May - Lake was the chairman - words arose, and a quarrel ensued, which induced me to clear the room; then M'Cloed made some allusion to the unfitness of Lake, for being the chairman; having my business to attend to, I did not pay attention to the precise words uttered - I remember a person coming afterwards from the deceased, with a challenge for Lake, and two sovereigns; Lake said he had no money to fight for, nor did he wish to fight - one of the persons put down his watch as a stake for him; I recommended them to go away and make it up - I heard no more about it till the accident, except that Lake called on me the next day, and said he felt very uncomfortable, and did not wish to fight.</p>

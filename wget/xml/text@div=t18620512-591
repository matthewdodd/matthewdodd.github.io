I am a fish-hawker—on Thursday, 10th April, I went my round, and saw the prisoner several times in the course of the day with another man who was selling fish—about half-past 8 I was coming home and saw the prisoner alone along the pathway before me, a very little distance from Sidcup-gate, and saw him pick this parcel up between the pathway and the hedge—I asked him what he had got there, what sort of a prise—he said, "It is either tea or tobacco," and he showed it to me—I said, "When are you going to take it to?"—he said, "To Deptford station"—one corner of it was undone when he showed it me—next morning I was in Billingsgate by 6 o'clock, or else I should have been before the Magistrate—his <hi rend="italic">missus</hi> came and told my <hi rend="italic">missus</hi>—I have seen him working at the sewers many a time—that is all I know about him—I gave him a ride along the road that night, and then I was going to bait my donkey, and he got out and walked on and said he should take it to the Deptiford station—he did not take the</p>

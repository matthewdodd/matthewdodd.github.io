               <p>Last Thursday night I was going up by St. Sepulchre's Church, I believe it was a quarter before five, and I saw the prisoner with another man standing at the post just by the watch-house, and he had a white frock on, and I saw something under his frock, and I says to him, says I, what have you there, says he, nothing; I saw it was a half hundred weight; says I, how did you come by that; says he, my master gave it me to carry; where does your master live, says I; says he, I brought it from Whitechapel, from the church with the high steeple; the other man that stood by said, we are going to carry it to Smithfield; says I, then you know something about it; I took hold of one with one hand, and the other with the other and the half hundred weight, and as I took them up the passage the other man tore off part of his coat, and he picked my pocket of my handkerchief; we put him in a coach, and took him before the alderman, and there appeared the broad arrow on the weight.</p>

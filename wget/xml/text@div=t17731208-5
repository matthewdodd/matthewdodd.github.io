            . I live in East Smithfield. On the 21st of November, about a quarter after eight in the evening, I was coming home from the opposite side of the way, and four or five men met me; one of them, which I believe was the prisoner, knocked me down and robbed me of my cloak.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the same person that knocked you down that took the cloak?</p>
               <p>Langdon. I cannot say: the cloak was a figured sattin.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with these men?</p>
               <p>Langdon. No, I never saw them before.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of the men was it that knocked you down?</p>
               <p>Langdon.

I ran out, and the prosecutrix said she had been robbed of a cloak; I pursued the men; there were five or six in company; when I came up to them, the prisoner set a running, and said here we go; I followed him, and laid hold of him; I turned him round and said I believed he was the person that had knocked the woman down, and pulled this cardinal from under his jacket (producing it); he had on a nankeen waistcoat, a blue jacket over it, and a pair of white trowsers; he said a man gave him the cloak, and struggled to get it out of my hand.</p>

               <p>I did not knock her down. A parcel of men at Iron-gate asked me to go and take a drink with them; we went to Salt-Petre-Bank and drank very hard; coming back there were three men walking with me, and seven or eight behind me; a man came to me and gave me a cardinal and run down an alley; there were people running; I asked what was the matter; I did not hear what these gentlemen said.</p>

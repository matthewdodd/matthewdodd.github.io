                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Richard Prickett. The prisoner was in my service, to carry out coals and run on errands—I sent him, on the 1st of June, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, to go to Mendency-wharf, near Cambridge-heath, to order half a ton of coals—I gave him two half-crowns, six shillings, one sixpence, and the rest in copper—he did not return—I waited till five o'clock, and sent another lad there, but could not find him—I saw him again on the 7th of June, and gave him into custody—he said he was robbed of the money, and had lost it—he said he had tied it in a pocket handkerchief and put it into his pocket, that he was looking at a broken glass, and went to look for it just after, and it was gone—he said he missed it when he got to the turnpike-gate—I had sent him with 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to my landlord on the Monday before, which he took safe.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner on the 6th of June, at twelve o'clock in the evening, close to the prosecutor's door—I heard a cry of "Stop him," from a female, and stopped him—the female came up, and said she was his aunt—I asked if he had taken any thing from any body—she said, "Not from me, but from his mistress," and that he had absconded six days—he told me he had lost 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.,—that it was picked out of his pocket.</p>

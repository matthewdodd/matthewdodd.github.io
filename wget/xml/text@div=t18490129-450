                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Phillips, a carpenter it Great Titchfield-street. On 21st Dec. I had a petticoat and shawl hanging on a line in the yard—I saw them safe about five o'clock—about eight I saw the prisoner in the yard—I bad a candle in my hand, and I am certain she is the woman, I was about two yards from her—I went into the passage, shut the street-door, and gave an alarm—when I did so, the prisoner rushed through the passage, opened the street-door, went out, and held the door in her hand—Sarah Turner came down and took hold of the door inside—the prisoner let go, and we went out and took her about two yards from the door—I went into the yard, and found the petticoat and shawl down in the corner of the yard where the prisoner had been standing.</p>

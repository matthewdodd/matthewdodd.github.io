                  </hi>. I am the wife of Richard Edwards, who is a turner, and lives at No. 6, St. Ann-street, Westminster. On Wednesday evening, Nov. 25th, about six o'clock, I was going through Hyde-park on my way home, and overtook the prisoner about a quarter of the way down the park, coming from the Bays water-road, and not very far from the trees—I was going to pass the prisoner when he caught hold of me, and tried to pull up my petticoats—I tried to shove him away from me and could not—he then said if I did not yield to him and let him have my money he would murder me—he spoke in English and used the word "yield"—I still resisted him, and he knocked me down, and tore my bonnet and cap from off my head—when</p>

               <p>he had knocked me down he unbuttoned his trowsers, and dragged me away some three or four yards from the foot-path by the hair of my head—I continued calling "Murder!" and just after that the park-keeper came to my assistance—I began to cry "Murder!" when he first began to insult me—he knelt himself down to me—I kept calling "Murder!" and resisted—a policeman came up soon after the park-keeper, and I gave him in charge.</p>

                  </hi> I am the park-keeper and constable at the Serpentine lodge. I recollect the evening of Wednesday, the 25th of Nov.—I was in Hyde-park, between the Magazine barracks where the guard is kept and Grosvenor-gate—about six o'clock I heard a violent scream, which I paid very little attention to at first and walked on—I then heard screams of "Mur<lb></lb>der!" five or six different times—I hastened to the spot as quick as I possibly could, and found the prisoner and the prosecutrix standing against a tree fifteen or sixteen yards from the path, where there are young trees protected by rails—they stood about a yard apart—the prisoner had an organ on his back or by his side—I saw the strap—the organ might be on the ground—when I got up the prosecutrix said she was very glad to see me, for the man had been wanting to rob and murder her, and taking liberties with her—she ap<lb></lb>peared in a state of agitation and alarm, and he was exposing himself, his trowsers unbuttoned, and his shirt hanging out between his thighs—a police<lb></lb>man came up just after, and he was given in charge—the prisoner and the prosecutrix were quite separate, a yard apart.</p>

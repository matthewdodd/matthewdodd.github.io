               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not give me the watch and seal to take care of - A. He denied that to me. I said I had lost my watch and money, and he was sent for, but he denied it and said, I had given him 1 s. I asked if he had got it - he denied it.</p>

            . I was at the Two Sawyers on the 10th of May, and saw the prosecutor with three sovereigns, some silver and halfpence. - he put into in his waistcoat pocket - the prisoner was a friend of his - I saw them go out of the box, but not go up-stairs.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I was coming out of the house with the watch in my hand he asked me for it - Witness. I did; I thought it was the watch of the prosecutor, and he refused, and went away from me directly - the watch was in his pocket - I was standing at the corner of the street, about one hundred yards from the Two Sawyers - I first mentioned to him about giving it to me, and he would not.</p>

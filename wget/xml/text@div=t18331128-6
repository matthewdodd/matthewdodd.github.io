            . I live at No. 136, Shoreditch. On the morning of the 31st of October, about eight o'clock- I saw the prisoner opposite Mr. Attenborough's shop, which is opposite my house in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch - I saw him standing there about twenty minutes, and then he took his cap in his hand, and thrust it through the window, and with his own hand took something out; he broke the glass of the window, and his own hand was put through the window - he took a medal and several other things out - he ran away; a witness came out of Mr. Attenborough's shop, and stopped him in my presence, and brought him back to the shop.</p>

            . They keep a shop at No. 110, High-street, Shoreditch, and are pawnbrokers and silversmiths. On the morning of the 31st of October, I was in the shop, and heard the breaking of glass; I ran out and followed the prisoner, and took him about two doors off - I took him back to the shop window, and as I took him along, I observed a metal button in his hand, and on the pavement I observed two medals, a ring, and two snaps - I had seen those articles in the shop the night before in the window; they are here - the prisoner appeared to me to be feigning intoxication; I did not think him really intoxicated - these are the things I saw on the pavement; I know them to belong to Mr. Attenborough, by private marks on them.</p>

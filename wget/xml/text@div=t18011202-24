             sworn. - I am clerk to Mr. Hobson, who lives at Stamford-hill; On the 9th of April, 1800, I received an order from Mr. Peat, of Clerkenwell, to send him a thousand of place bricks that afternoon; I gave directions to the prisoner to load them, which he did; I gave him his ticket and his turnpike-money, and he went away with the bricks; the next morning Mr. Peat sent for the bricks; I told him by whom I sent them, and recollected the prisoner was in the field loading another load; he said, he had set them down against the gateway adjoining Mr. Peat's building; the bricklayer, trusting to what he said, returned to see; as soon as we were gone, the prisoner absconded, and we have not seen him again till last Thursday was a week, when I overtook him in Cock-lane, Whitechapel, and took him into custody; he said, he sold the bricks for ten shillings; the fair price was twenty-seven shillings; but he did not know the person's name.

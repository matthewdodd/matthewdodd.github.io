Pall-mall; I then remarked to him I thought it was very thin paper, he told me it was the same paper as always used; them were the words; he then said, that he was not a judge of the watch, he would not buy it, unless I would let him know what he should lose by it, in case it was not approved of, if he returned it; and I made an agreement to give him thirteen-pounds for it.</p>
               <p>Court. So he only was to lose the difference between pounds and guineas? - Yes, I desired him to indorse the note, upon which he wrote upon it Captain T. Freeman; there were no other indorsements.</p>
               <p>What is the date of it? - Fourth of November, 1783; I did not observe the date, I gave one pound seven shillings in change; he took the watch, it was No. 4281, H. Tylor, London; a gold watch capped and jewelled, I have the name and number taken from my watch book at the time.</p>

               <p>But at that time you put no writing upon it, nor was there any mark of yours? - No, I remember the name of T. Bowles.</p>
               <p>I want to know, whether you put any mark upon it when you sent it to the bankers? - I did not.</p>
               <p>But whatever mark or writing was put upon it, was after it was returned to you, or after it was sent to the bankers? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You never saw the person again till last Friday week? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. He had indorsed it? - Yes.</p>

               <p>The body is not like it, the paper is not like it, on the corner there is a different scroll, it is not in any respect like your notes? - Not the least in the world, nobody could have mistaken it; if I had been purblind I should have known it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I believe you have no plates fabricated for the purpose, but for the partners? - No, we have one for each of the partners.</p>

            , a pawnbroker; I live in Princes-street, Leicester-fields; I saw the prisoner on the 19th of April, he came into the shop of Timothy Parker, between nine and ten in the evening, in company with one Robinson, whom we knew before, to sell a watch; Mr. Robinson came in first at the door, I was then busy with some other customers, he and Mr. Robinson were both together; Mr. Robinson says, Mr. Parker, I have brought you a particular friend of mine, to sell a gold watch, he has just now taken it of Mr. Jessop, he has had some bills discounted, and he has taken this as part of the money; this was said in the prisoner's presence, Jessop is a watch maker.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you know Robinson before? - Perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Did you know Mr. Freeman? - I never saw him before, that I know of.</p>
               <p>Did Robinson tell you his name? - I cannot say that he mentioned his name, he said, he knew we should give more money than any other shop, and the prisoner gave me the watch, and I gave him the money; I gave him seven pounds thirteen shillings for it, it was a gold watch, double cased capped and jewelled, made by H. Tyrer. No. 4281.</p>
               <p>Court. Turn to your book? - The book has not the number in.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at the book, and see what is set down? - A gold watch by H. Tyrer, seven pounds thirteen shillings.</p>
               <p>On what day? - We always post our book up every week, and it is there the 17th, and we always cast up every Friday night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I observe you have no other date till you come to the 24th? - No, from one week to another, I remember perfectly well, it was on the 19th I went out of town.</p>
               <p>Court. I see here is an entry, commencing with the 17th of April, do you happen to know what that day was? - On Saturday.</p>
               <p>What reason have you to believe it was on the 19th, do you remember Mr. Pearson applying about the watch? - No, I do not on my own knowledge, I went out of town on the Wednesday, and I know it was before that time, and from some papers and memorandums I have since found, it was the 19th.</p>
               <p>What induces you to believe it was on the 19th? - I know it from other business.</p>
               <p>What other business, state the reasons of your belief that it was the 19th? - Here is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200112"></xptr> bill of Exchange which was paid on the 7th, on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>How does that help you to the recollection of what passed on the 19th? - From my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Give us some reasons why, is there any circumstance that induces to believe it was the 19th, why that day more than any other? - I know it was not on Saturday, I am positive of that, nor Sunday.</p>
               <p>What do you say to Tuesday? - My brother can inform you that it was not on Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You are perfectly accurate in taking down every thing in your business, you put down the watch-maker's name as it really is? - We may make a mistake.</p>
               <p>You may put down Smith for Johnson, then you do not mean to be exact in the name when you write it down? - We mean to be exact.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear you are exact? - I do not mean to swear that there is the same name in that book as on the watch.</p>

               <p>If you was to put down my name Silversides, that would not do you know? - I made a private memorandum of it.</p>
               <p>Court. In whose hand-writing is that entry in the book? - It is mine, I made a private memorandum.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Upon your oath, did not you say before the Magistrate you was not sure that the prisoner was the man? - I said I did not know for a certainty.</p>
               <p>Did not you even swear before the Magistrate, that it was upon a Saturday? - No, Sir, I said I believed I had a receipt, and I would go home and see for it.</p>
               <p>From whom did you say you had a receipt? - From Freeman.</p>

               <p>Robinson you know perfectly well? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Robinson was the man that had all the conversation with you? - He said he brought a friend.</p>
               <p>Did not you swear positively to Saturday before the Magistrate? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Upon your first examination, did not you swear it was the Saturday? - There were two examinations.</p>
               <p>Upon the first did not you swear it was the Saturday, and that you did not know this man, you knew Robinson, and would produce Robinson's receipt? - No, Sir, it is no such thing.</p>
               <p>Court. Who did you think you had a receipt from? - From the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>In what name? - I did not recollect the name.</p>
               <p>Then what reason had you to suppose you had a receipt from him? - From recollection, it is common for us to take a receipt, I looked for one and could not find it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. I caution you, whether before the Magistrate, you did not swear positively to the 17th? - I was cross-examined by the attorney to that man; I did not swear to any time at all; I believed it was the Saturday, that was all I said.</p>
               <p>Did not the Magistrate desire you to go and fetch your book? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Did you come back with your book? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long was it? - I looked some time for the receipt, I do not know how long it might be.</p>
               <p>Did you find the receipt? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Was not the examination postponed to some future day for the purpose of your producing the receipt? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>It is a plain question; I ask you upon your oath? - I was desired to look for the receipt; I did not know what it was put off for, he was fully committed I believe on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Do not prevaricate, Sir, you had not two examinations on the same day. - No.</p>
               <p>I ask you, whether the examination was not put off on your account, and for the purpose of your producing the receipt the second day; it is a very plain question? - I cannot answer it.</p>
               <p>Why? - Because there are people that may be better acquainted with it than I am.</p>
               <p>You understand me, do not you; if not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200113"></xptr> I am sorry for you. - Other people may be able to inform you better than I can.</p>
               <p>No, Sir, I will have it from you upon oath. Was not you desired to come a second time? turn in your mind how you can evade the question? - I do not want to evade it.</p>
               <p>Then answer it. - I think it was on Friday he was fully committed.</p>
               <p>That is not an answer; was the examination postponed to give you further time to look for the receipt? - I think the examination could not be postponed, because he was fully committed.</p>
               <p>Court. That is reasoning Sir, I must have a direct answer to a plain question; was the examination postponed to give you further time to look for the receipt, yes or no, it is a plain question, or do not you know it? - I do not know: I know that Mr. Gilbert or Sir Sampson Wright desired me to attend on Monday.</p>
               <p>Court. Was not the examination postponed till you should so attend; it is my duty as a Judge to insist on an answer to a plain question; there are but three answers that you can, as a conscientious man, give. - I understood, my Lord, that he was to be further examined.</p>
               <p>And did you understand that it was put off to give you further time to look for that receipt? - I understood so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Was not it because you neither could swear to the date nor to the name, (for they both differed) and for the purpose of producing some receipt; which you told the Magistrate you had? that is a plain question: now, upon your oath, will you answer that question? - (No answer.)</p>
               <p>Do you remember the Magistrates suspecting you of a fraud in this business? - No, on the Friday they desired I would look further, and see if I could get any further account of the watch, or see if I could find the receipt.</p>
               <p>Who spoke about the receipt? - I mentioned it myself.</p>
               <p>You take a receipt for your own safety, because this watch might might have been stolen you know? - We mostly do, we very seldom omit it, this might be through hurry of business.</p>
               <p>Was not you told by the Magistrate and by the prisoner's attorney, Sir, if what you now swear is true, it must be a mistake, this cannot be the watch? - I had not swore at all.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it said by anybody in your presence, that if the matter was as you then stated it, it must be a mistake, and that could not be the watch? - It might.</p>
               <p>Was it, Sir? - They said it could not be on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Was not you cautioned over and over again? - I told them that the date when it was bought was not in the book at all.</p>
               <p>Was not you told that men's lives were not to be quibbled away in this manner, Sir?</p>
               <p>Jury. We wish to see the book.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. If I understand you right, you was sent for on the Sunday, and had not your book on your first examination? - Not at first.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner fully committed at the first examination? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You attended at the subsequent time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner there then? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you ever attend any other examination of him after he was fully committed? - Never, I went there, supposing that the prisoner was to be brought there again, but he was not.</p>
               <p>Court. What day was you first examined before the Magistrate? - On the Friday.</p>
               <p>When were you examined again? - On the Monday.</p>
               <p>Then you were sent back again on the Monday for further examination? - It was on the Monday or Tuesday, I am not sure.</p>
               <p>Then you had from the Friday to the Tuesday to examine your papers and to look for this receipt? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It was on the Friday that it was said that there was a mistake, and that it could not be the watch? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200114"></xptr>Then it is examination that you have given an account of, was on the Friday? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now on the Friday you were not sure that the prisoner was the man? - I would not swear then positive to him.</p>

               <p>You said before the Magistrate, that you were not sure that the prisoner was the man; did you grow more sure of his person by a longer time having passed? - At that time I described his dress and clothes.</p>
               <p>What has made you sure since, Mr. Parker? - I am very sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>What has made your memory better now than it was nearer the time you had seen him? - From my recollection of his size.</p>
               <p>(The witness's brother ordered to withdraw.)</p>
               <p>Could not you recollect the man's size when you had him in your eye? - I did not take upon myself to be sure.</p>
               <p>You were not sure when you first saw the man before the Magistrate, whether he was the same man or not, and you have worked yourself into a persuasion that he is the same man, by seeing him at the Magistrate's: what happened between that time and this to make you more sure; if it was from the recollection of your own eyes, the sooner you saw him the better you would know him? - I believed that he was the man.</p>

               <p>At that time, to the best of your recollection, you believed it was on the Saturday? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What happened afterwards to make you believe it was not on the Saturday; what further information had you on the subject, and from what materials did you draw that information; you hear the question? - I know it was after some other business that we did, a bill of exchange that we paid on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>What do you recollect it by? - I said a bill of thirty-five pounds.</p>
               <p>When was that bill of thirty-five pounds paid? - On a Saturday.</p>
               <p>Was it the same day? - No.</p>
               <p>How do you know it was not the same day?</p>
               <p>(Looking for memorandums.)</p>
               <p>Are these memorandums your own making? - I am looking for the bill.</p>
               <p>Your brother has it. (The bill sent for.) But before the bill comes, do you recollect the name was Myers? - Yes, the drawer of the bill for thirty-five pounds.</p>
               <p>When was the date entered of the payment of that bill, was it entered the day it was paid? - Yes, but the bill was paid the day before it was due, being due the Sunday it was paid the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Do you make these entries at the times the money is actually paid, or the things sold? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Look at that entry of fifty pounds, paid to Mr. Peele on the 17th of April? (Hands him the book.) - This is when the money was paid, but it was put down before it was paid.</p>
               <p>Do not you enter a note for fifty pounds on the day it is paid, for what purpose did you keep it out of the book? - He sent to borrow it, but I did not know what account was between my brother and him; I kept his note, and when I shewed it to my brother, he said I might put it down.</p>
               <p>Court. That transaction seemed in some measure to be consistent with his account of it, because the putting the date of the 17th to that article, seems to imply, that some articles had been entered of a subsequent day: still you have not given any reason why this was on the Saturday, except the payment of the thirty-five pound<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200115"></xptr> bill; can you swear it was not on the same day, can you form any recollection: you have swore that this watch was not sold after the bill of the thirty-five pounds was paid? - I am positive it was not, it was late in the evening.</p>
               <p>What reason had you then for saying it was the Saturday, and what has altered your opinion since? - I am very sure it was not on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Why was you of a different opinion when you was first examined? - The book has altered my opinion; I cannot say at that very instant that I recollected.</p>
               <p>You believed that you had taken a receipt? - I did.</p>
               <p>But you have never found any receipt from this Robinson? - No.</p>
               <p>What is Robinson? - He is an attorney I believe.</p>
               <p>How long have you known him? - I have known him by sight about three or four years.</p>
               <p>Where does he live? - He once lived in Dean-street, the last time he informed me where he lived was No. 4, Rose-street, Petty France.</p>
               <p>How long is it since you have had any dealings with Robinson? - I do not know exactly, about four years.</p>
               <p>What did you mean by saying at first that you knew him by sight? - I know him perfectly well by sight.</p>
               <p>But you knew more of him than that? - I have no other acquaintance with him than any other person coming to our shop; I had dealings with him.</p>
               <p>You must have known him well, or else he would not have come to recommend a particular acquaintance to you? - I have frequently sold him things, and bought things of him before; I sold him a diamond ring and a diamond shirt pin.</p>
               <p>When did you produce the watch; at your first examination? - The watch was never produced, I do not know whether it was ever produced; I sold it to a person that lived in Piccadilly.</p>

            ; I he would attend at Bow-street, which he did; the watch was traced, but the watch was not produced.</p>
               <p>Turn to your book to the entry of the sale of it. - It is not in that book; I was informed this watch had been obtained by some false pretence or other, and it was found in the possession of Mr. Dobree.</p>
               <p>Then you had parted with it twice? - I went there for the watch, and received it; when I came back, I desired our man to enter this watch down, and it should be put in the window, which was done.</p>
               <p>When was that? - When I brought it from Mr. Dobree.</p>
               <p>Have you any entry of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Let me look at that: what is the reason that there was no entry in your book of the sale of this watch; do not you enter sales as well as purchases? - Yes there is, but not the number of the watch put down.</p>
               <p>Is the name put down? - I am not sure.</p>
               <p>Where is the entry of the sale of it to Mr. Dobree? - It was never sold to Mr. Dobree, I think somebody else offered it for sale to Mr. Dobree.</p>
               <p>When had you sold it? - I did not sell it.</p>
               <p>But it was sold at your shop? - So I understood.</p>
               <p>When? - I believe in two or three days after it was purchased.</p>
               <p>Then in the next week you will find an entry of the sale of it? - It is not in that book at all.</p>
               <p>Then you must send for your sale book; who is this entry on the 2d of August written by, when it was returned from Mr. Dobree? - I wrote that.</p>
               <p>Who is that additional entry of the number of the watch written by? - By one of my brother's servants.</p>
               <p>When was that added? - After I had it from Dobree, directly when I brought it home, that is a particular account<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200116"></xptr> of at we had in our win-</p>
         
               <p>number is not written at the same time with the line? - No.</p>
               <p>When did you add the number? - When it was put in the window, and brought from Mr. Dobree.</p>
               <p>When did you write the line that precedes the number? - On the day it was brought from Mr. Dobree.</p>
               <p>"Gold watch, capped and jewelled, by Tyrer," when was that written? - I do not know the day, it was when I brought it home from Mr. Dobree; the number was written at the same time.</p>
               <p>Look at it, and see if you will venture to swear it was written at the same time? - It is not my writing, it is a servant of my brother's.</p>
               <p>What is his name? - Grayson; the number is the same hand-writing with the other.</p>
               <p>You do not know when it was written at all? - I do not.</p>
               <p>What was the reason of that particular attention to that watch in August? - No otherwise than any other watch.</p>
               <p>How came you to get the watch again? - Mr. Dobree stopped it, and brought it back to us in August, the person who offered it to him for sale, he stopped it of him; then the person applied to us, and we paid the money back.</p>
               <p>Dobree was informed that Mrs. Fairis had sold it for a bad bill? - I should suppose so, I do not know the particulars; I did not know Dobree: when I brought it back from Dobree, I desired the servant to enter it down in that book, and put it into the window among our other goods.</p>
               <p>Was there a price mark put to it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You were informed Mr. Dobree had stopped the watch when you got it of him of course? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You knew the reason he had stopped it? - No, I did not know the particular reason why.</p>
               <p>Did not you enquire the reason why it had been stopped? - I was in the country, I did not sell it to this person; I went for it to Mr. Dobree's.</p>
               <p>Did not you ask the reason? - I did not ask Mr. Dobree.</p>
               <p>You asked somebody? - Yes, they informed me that the watch a person brought that came with Mr. Robinson had been obtained from Mrs. Fairis by a false bill.</p>
               <p>When you knew this watch had been stopped, as having been fraudently obtained, by Mr. Dobree, how came you to put that up for sale in your window with a price mark? - To sell it again.</p>
               <p>What, when you knew it was the property of Mrs. Fairis, and had been stopped by another pawnbroker? - They said a bad bill.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not Pearson inform you of this the very day after the watch was lost? - I never saw Pearson, I was not acquainted with it at all; I never knew till the latter end of June.</p>
               <p>Court to Pearson. When did you first leave the information at Mr. Parker's shop? - After I had been at Mr. Croft's, on the 20th of April.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You will observe there is not a number of any watch in the whole book but this.</p>
               <p>Court. I have no doubt but that number is entered since, let the Gentlemen of the Jury look at the entry of the 2d of August, you will see an entry of a watch in one line, which seems to be all in one hand-writing; you will see afterwards a different entry of the number, which is manifestly written with fresh ink.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester to Pearson. Do you remember this man producing a bill to shew it was on Saturday?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Pearson. Did he give as a reason for its being on a Saturday, that it was late at night, and he was busy? - I believe he did; we keep open till twelve of Saturdays.</p>
               <p>Court to Parker. Go for your sale-book, or send Pearson for it; is not the watch forth-coming?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Parker. Have you been able to procure the watch, so as to produce it to day? - I attended on the person to whom I sold it,

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I am perfectly innocent of the charge against me. My Lord, when Mr. Robinson gave the note into my hand in order to purchase the watch I had no reason to think is false, and therefore believed it to be a proper and a good note; when I went to the pawn-broker in order to purchase this watch, as I was going up the steps Mr. Robinson came close to me, I concluded of course he was going into the shop with me, as I was going to the counter I found he was gone, I then began to bargain for the watch myself, I purchased the watch and gave the note, I then returned from the shop down the steps I then saw Mr. Robinson, it appeared to me as if he had been talking to somebody at the door, I gave the watch to Mr. Robinson which he put into his pocket: Robinson asked me where I was going, I said to the other end of the town, he then said I am going to Princes-street we will walk together, I said I was going a little farther, he said I will go with you and we will return and walk together to Princes-street; I was as far as Princes-street, I did not know him to whom he was going; when we came to Mr. Parker's he then stopped me, he told me he wanted to see Mr. Parker in order to sell this watch, he said I can get more money for it here, I said I would wait for him, I acknowledge I did follow him into the shop; when Mr. Robinson saw Mr. Parker, he said, Mr.

             I want to speak to you; Mr. Parker said, wait two or three minutes; presently Mr. Parker came to Robinson him his business, Robinson had bought a watch but he wanted to sell it, there was a kind of a whisper between them, and from that I concluded of course there had been a former acquaintance, and some intimacy, in consequence of which I went from the shop to the door, and walked into the passage some time; then Mr. Robinson came out, and I said, have you sold the watch? he said, yes, Sir, I have, I said have you sold it well; I am perfectly satisfied, says he; he asked me to sup with him, I said no, we went to Oxford-road and drank six-penny worth of brandy and water, then I wished him a good night and left him: my Lord, I am charged with a matter of which I am perfectly innocent, I rest, and I hope the Gentlemen of the Jury will see clearly I am an innocent man, and I intirely leave the rest of my defence to my councel.</p>

               <p>Court. Have you used any diligence to find Mr. Robinson? - I have.</p>
               <p>What was the result of your enquiries? - I made many enquiries, I sent to many houses where he used, but I could not find him.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Garrow. Has any enquiry been made on the part of the prosecution?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. We know nothing of him my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Parker. What is become of Mr. Robinson? - I do not know, I saw him only once since, and I enquired about this business, I asked him to explain this business to me, and I desired him to give me his direction, which he did, No. 4, George-street, Petty France; I gave this direction to the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Have you enquired for him? - No.</p>
               <p>Why had not you stopped him? - He said he would come forward at any time when he was called upon; says he, I understand my friend got this watch with a bad bill, I did not know it was so then.</p>

             I know very well, I then asked the question of Mr. Parker very closely, Sir Sampson Wright said, I see what you are driving at; it appeared then upon Robinson's name being mentioned, as coming to enquire after the watch, that there were many complaints against him, and that another note was then produced; I enquired no farther because they told me that several charges were mentioned.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You contented yourself in making enquiry at Bow-street? - I heard he was in France.</p>

               <p>In whose possession was it? - In Mr. Robinson's, he asked me to buy him a dozen of silk stockings, and I thought he meant to give me the money to buy them, but he said, he had a note of a bankers, of fifteen pounds, and he offered this note to me; I think that was about the 16th or 17th of April last.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The date of the note I perceive, assists you to recollect when he offered to you? - No, not at all, I clearly remember his offering it to me.</p>
               <p>You had the note I suppose at that time in your hands? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Where are your wares rooms? - When I buy goods, I have places to take them to.</p>

               <p>How long have you been out of business? - I have not been out of business.</p>
               <p>Where was your last large fate that you disposed of them all? - I had a sale about a little more than a fortnight ago, called the Marybone coffee house, at High-street, Marybone.</p>
               <p>O, you are an auctioneer? - I am not an auctioneer, I sold them by hand.</p>
               <p>How long have you known Freeman? - I have known him five or six years.</p>
               <p>Have you known Mr. Robinson as long? I believe I have, I knew him when he was an attorney, in the Temple; I do no know where he lives now.</p>
               <p>How lately is it since you saw him? - I met him in the street, about a month ago, he went on the other side the way, I did not speak to him.</p>

               <p>What makes you remember it, it was not anything remember? - I thought it was very odd, because I said to him, I had better go and get the calf first, he objected to that.</p>

               <p>Then he lived there? - He lived there to be sure, because I apprehend it is what they call a shop bill.</p>
               <p>Then it is not a bill of Exchange? - No.</p>

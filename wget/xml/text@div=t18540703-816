                  </hi>. I am single, and live in Westbourne-terrace, North Bayswater. On 21st June, about the middle of the day, I got into a Strat<lb></lb>ford omnibus at the Bank of England—shortly afterwards the prisoner got in, and sat down close to me on my right hand—about five minutes after he had been in, he held a sixpence across me to pay the conductor, and he put his foot very violently on my dress—I requested him to remove his foot—he said, "Oh, oh," but he did not remove it—before that I had had a purse in my possession; it contained 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but I did not know the amount at the time; it was all together—I had seen it safe just before I got into that omnibus—I had paid another omnibus, and it was then safe—in two or three minutes after treading on my gown, the prisoner got out—I then felt, and missed my purse—I said to the conductor, "My purse is gone"—the conductor went after the prisoner immediately, and brought him back—when he came back I accused him of taking the purse—he said I should be very careful how I accused a young man—he got into the omnibus again, and in the course of a minute, he said, "There is your purse," pointing to where I was sitting; and he said, "Did you see me drop it?"—I had before this moved to the end of the omnibus, and looked on the floor of it, and there was not any purse—there was only one lady in the omnibus—when the prisoner first got into the omnibus another person got in with him, and sat next to him on the other side.</p>

                  </hi>. I am conductor of a Stratford omnibus. The last witness got into the omnibus about half past 1 o'clock that day—I went on my journey, and between Cornhill and Leadenhall-street the prisoner got in—I am not aware that any other person got in with him—when we got to the corner of Houndsditch the prisoner gave me a sixpence—I gave him some coppers, and he got out and went down Houndsditch—shortly after<lb></lb>wards the last witness stopped me, and said something—I went after the prisoner, and asked him to come back—he said he had paid his fare, and he asked what I wanted him for—when I got back to the omnibus, the lady was sitting inside, and she accused him of having robbed her of her purse—the prisoner got in and sat down—I saw him drop a puree in the omnibus, close to the lady—this purse resembles it—after dropping the purse, he said to the lady, "Dear me, Ma'am, there is your purse on the ground"—he wanted to leave, and get away, but I would not let him—I had four passen<lb></lb>gers altogether; two ladies, and one gentleman, and the prisoner.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long before the policeman came, did you see the prisoner drop the purse? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About three minutes—during that time he was in the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>—I saw the purse on the ground—I do not know who took it up; some one did—I was outside, standing on the ground, and the door was shut—the prisoner was sitting down when I saw him drop the purse; I was outside then, and the door was open—I shut the door to keep him in—I am sure I saw him drop the purse, and I heard him say, "There is your purse"—I did not say to the lady that I saw him drop it—I was confused—I did not like that such a thing should happen in my <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>—I continued con<lb></lb>fused till the constable came.</p>

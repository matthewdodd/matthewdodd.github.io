                  </hi>. I am a sawyer, and reside at Pimlico—last Saturday night week I was in the Market Arms at a little after 10 o'clock—on my way home I saw a female—she addressed me and I told her to go—the prisoner then came up, and made use of obscene language—I told her to go away, and she tripped me up with her foot and shoved me—at the same time she threw me down, and as I was falling she made a snatch at my watch-chain—she did not get it—as I got up the prisoner ran away—the policeman came up, and I gave him a description of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> You came up to me with a constable, and said you gave me in charge for shoving you down; I said, "I have never seen you." I went to the station and there you stated about a watch-guard; I said, "Have you got a watch?"; and you said, "I have taken my watch home."</p>

               <p>home and change my things and leave my watch at home, which I did—when I came back I missed that policeman, and saw another, not the one I had seen before—I told him, and he said, "You had better come up along with me and we will see if we can see the party"—and when we got twenty or thirty yards from where I was knocked down, he said there was somebody coming, and with that the prisoner and another female came up together—he said to me, "Do you know either of these persons?"—I said, "Yes, that is the party," pointing to the prisoner—the prisoner directly said, "You good for nothing blackguard, I never saw you before with my eyes, nor did I ever try to push you down or take anything from you"—I had not said that she tried to push me down—the policeman said, "That I will do, say no more, but come along with me"—and we went to the station—I had only been home—when I was first knocked down it was within a few yards of the gun factory—the policeman must have heard me fall.</p>

On Saturday night week I received information from the prosecutor—he was then close by his own door—I walked with him about 100 or 150 yards, and he described the assault—it was then a few minutes after 12 o'clock—I saw the prisoner—I told her she was charged with assaulting him—she said she had never seen him before—she was quite drunk—the prosecutor was sober—he had no watch then; he had left it at home.</p>

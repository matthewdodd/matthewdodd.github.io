                  </hi>. I live with my mother, Harriet Portington, a widow, who keeps a linen-draper's shop, in Paddington-street. About half-past seven o'clock in the evening of the 29th of Aug., the prisoner came, to our shop and bought this piece of calico, for which she paid—I saw her in the shop but did not serve her—a witness came in and told me something, in consequence of that I ran into the street after the prisoner, and found this piece of flannel under her arm, which she dropped on, my taking hold of her—it is my mother's.</p>

On the beginning of January I was applied to in the leather-market at Leadenhall, by one of our own buisness to know whether we apprehended our men were honest; I told him I hoped so, I desired to know his reason for asking; he told me, he heard a man was seen to sell leather about in Essex, that was suspected not to be honestly come by, and shewed me some part of those goods, which he said a shoemaker at Woodford had bought, which he suspected were not honestly come by; he said, he told the person he suspected they came from our shop; after that, he brought a pair of upper leathers; I looked at them, and sent word I would come down to Woodford and look at the rest; or if the shoemaker chose to come to London, I should be glad to see him; he came to London, and told me the man he bought them of was a shoemaker, or rather a shoe-mender, and lived at Mileend; I went to Mile end, and found the man out, and told him my business; he said he had been employed by a man, to sell some leather for a man; he and Mr. Mead the shoemaker at Woodford came with me home; then we set all our porters in a row, for him to pick out the man he had the leather of, and he pitched upon the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker by trade, but make very few new shoes now, I am what you may call a translator, or cobler; the prisoner came to me some time before last Christmas.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I knew him three or four years, but had not seen him for twelve months before.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way was he when you knew him?</p>
               <p>Taylor. He was at a tallow-chandler's; when he came, we went and had a pot of beer together; he asked; me I was acquainted with any shoemakers in the, I said, yes, he had got a quantity of upper-leathers, and it I him to some customers, he would give me half a crown a day, and pay my Accordingly I went with him to several masters that for; after this. Mr. Newman came to me, and asked me if I knew such a gentlemen at Woodford as Mr. Mead, and if I had ever sold any leather to him; I said, yes, twice; he asked me how much I sold him; I knew the first quantity, but not the last; he said he had been rob bed, and desired I would go with him, and shew him which of his men it was; I went with him, he brought some porters, and put them in a row, and I pitched upon the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner tell you who he had the leather from?</p>
               <p>Taylor. No, he did not; I was with him before the Justice, there he confessed he took the leather for a support to his family.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he pay you the half crown a day?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Yes, he did, all but one day; then he gave me only 2 s. because the goods were not all sold that he brought out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I am sorry I have abused such good masters as they have been to me, in so bad a manner; they were very kind to me. I was tempted to commit this wicked act, to support my wife and four young children, at the time of her lying in, she had a very bad time, and my wages but 11 s. a week, would not buy sufficient necessaries to support six of us these dear times; I hope there is nothing but the greatest distress could have tempted me to use the best friends I had, in the manner I have done; and as it is my first offence, for the sake of my poor wife and dear helpless children, I humbly beg the mercy of the court; and if I should be so happy as to get my liberty again, I will always endeavour to provide for my poor family in an honest way.</p>
               <p>Q. to Newman. Do you think the prisoner has made a common practice of taking things?</p>
               <p>Newman. It is impossible for me to know that, in an open shop as ours is.</p>

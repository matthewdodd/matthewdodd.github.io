My husband is a harness-smith—he makes springs for Mr. Warne, who is a currier.—The prisoner was in Mr. Warne's service—he came to my husband on the 11th of October, respecting the work, as he had had none for some time past—we lost it in consequence of some differences about the prices—the prisoner said that my husband was to go on with the work for Mr. Warne as usual—that was to make springs for the patent autocropolis—my husband said, "I have got no money to go on, will you ask Mr. Warne or Payne if he will advance 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Monday?"—the prisoner said yes, he would—on the following Saturday night, the 13th, I went to the warehouse, and asked him if he had spoken to the governor, or to Payne, about the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said no, he had not, as he had not seen them—he said if he did not see me between that time and Monday, by two o'clock, I was to come to his house, or to the Strand, and he would write a note for me to take to Payne, in Bond-street, to let me have it—on the Monday following, Mr. Warne came to me—I never got the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

The prisoner was in my service in cutting out feather, giving out work, receiving it, and paying the men their wages. No. 414, Strand, is the wholesale manufactory—on the 13th of October, Saturday week, I paid the prisoner a sovereign—it was his department to attend to persons connected with this business—he had then to present papers to me, with the men's names, and the money on it, and I paid him on that night, these two bills were presented to me, for which I paid him a sovereign and a half—one of them is on account of "Rutter, 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., "</p>

               <p>Q. Have you ever had any children? - A. I have.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. I know no further than her coming to lodge with me; I was a lone woman, and she came for a lodging; my room was in Mary Willis's house; she was to sleep with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who slept in the next room to you? - A. A man and his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. What family has Mrs. Willis? - A. They have got two children in the house; one is a niece, five or six years old, and a boy older than that.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell us what day of the month it was? - A. She came to me on the Thursday night; it was the Wednesday night after that this affair happened; I cannot say the day of the month; she came from Mrs. English to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her before that? - A. I never saw her but once in my life before she came for the lodging; but I knew where she came from; in about a couple of days after she came to me, I told her my neighbours said she was with child, and she was very angry, denied it, and asked me if I was not with child; I told her of it again, and told her to provide herself with a lodging; she continued with me till the Wednesday night, and on the Wednesday night I went to bed, and went to sleep, and the cry of a young child, three hearty squalls, waked me; I went to bed about nine o'clock, and waked about eleven; the prisoner went to bed first; I was greatly surprised, and said, I heard the the cry of a child; and she said, no, there was no such thing; I said, then did you cry; she said, what for; I said, I am sure there was a cry, and I will get up; she said, what should you get up for, lie still; she said, she did not all any thing; I got up between six and seven o'clock, I cannot say exactly, and left her in bed; it might be half past six;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180110280008"></xptr>I went to fetch some milk; when I came back, I met Mrs. Rowland; she went with me; the prisoner went down stairs as we went up; she had her clothes on just the same as any other time; a black bonnet on, a black gown, a black silk handkerchief; Mrs. Rowland waited half an hour for her, and went away; in consequence of suspicion, I looked all over the room as close as I could, to see if I could find any thing; but I did not find any thing but the state of a lying-in woman upon my bed, and all over my room, and that; I was sure there must have been a child or a miscarriage.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that appearance? - A. Every thing was very bad, very bloody, just as if it was dipped into a blood-tub; the bed, blankets, and sheets, all through; and there were a great many spots of blood about the room, as if it was wiped or smeared about.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any appearance of that sort about the room the night before? - A. No, in no part of it; when the prisoner came back, I asked how she could make the woman wait so long for her; she said, I have been a good way to the shop to fetch some tea, and I will follow her; I said, no, you must not follow her, you are not fit to go; the prisoner said, I am; I said, no, you are not; then she said, yes, I am, I all nothing; and she went after her, and did her day's work.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing particular about her dress? - A.Nothing particular.</p>
               <p>Examined by the Court. Q. Where was the prisoner when you heard the crying you speak of? - A.In the bed by me.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard no more cries than that? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And you heard that so distinctly, that you heard three cries? - A. Yes, I waked with it.</p>
               <p>Q.How many days did she continue to lodge with you? - A.She went away from me on the Monday following; I turned her out.</p>
               <p>HANNAH ROWLAND sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const.

             in the street, as I was going to my day's work; I went home with her, and the prisoner was up in the room; when I went into it, Betty was very near the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean the prisoner? - A. Yes, she said to me, Mrs. Rowland, are you going to work so soon, it is not seven o'clock? I told her it was seven, but it was not eight; and she pressed me to stay for her, as she was going out for butter; she went away that instant, and I staid about half an hour; I looked round the room, and saw small clots of blood and trickles all about the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to be fresh? - A. It looked very fresh.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present with Mrs. Moss when she looked at the bed? - A. No, about ten o'clock she came into the field to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing particular in her appearance when she came to the field? - A. She looked very ill; her petticoats were very much soiled, and her stockings; and we persuaded her to pin her petticoats up, and gave her pins to do it; and we advised her to drop her gown down, for fear the men should observe her; she told me she was taken very ill in the night, so much so, that she thought she must have died; she told me the bed was in such a situation with her illness, that, if I had seen it, it would have frightened me; I said, was it; she said, it was through every thing.</p>
               <p>MARY WILLIS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. Mrs. Moss lodged in my house; the prisoner lodged with Mrs. Moss; she came on the 20th of August, and went away the 31st; Mrs. Moss lives there still.</p>

I have seen her twice; I saw her early in the morning, between six and seven o'clock; she had a darkish coloured own,a black cloak, and a close bonnet; she went down a little field, called the Slipe; it is a grass field, and a pound in it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Const. Q. You heard that the woman, who was in custody, had put a child into the pond? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Court. You say it was yesterday fortnight, which, from the date of the examination, would bring it to the 2d of September.</p>
               <p>CHARLES MACLEOD sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I am a labouring man in the parish of Tottenham; I was at work in a field, called Twelve Acres, in the last September.</p>
               <p>Q. Before that did you know the prisoner? - A. No, I never saw her before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her at any time so as to know her? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that? - A. Yes, the first time I saw her was going through Twelve-Acre Field.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean to say that you saw a woman go down the field? - A. Yes; she had on a dark gown, a dinsey-coloured cloak, and a close bonnet.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was she from you? - A. One hundred and fifty yards ; or more; she went across Twelve Acres to a little field, called the Slipe; she had a bundle under her arm; I observed to Bliss what that woman could do down the field at that time in the morning.</p>

               <p>Mr. Const. Q. You lost sight of her? - A. Yes, we both looked a considerable time to see which way she went, but we could see no more of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember what day you were examined before the Coroner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you were examined before the Coroner? - A. I cannot say; I did not recollect the woman going down the field till after I heard that the child was found.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I live at Tottenham; the last witness is my son.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his informing you of any thing he had seen in the pond? - A. Yes, I think on the 7th of September; it was on a Monday; I went to the pond, and found a female child lying upon its belly in the water; I took a stick, and turned it up to the side of the bank; it looked very fresh in the face; I then sent for the beadle; two men took the child to Mr. Bartlett's, the first public-house.</p>
               <p>JAMES SHEFFIELD sworn. - I am assistant to Mr. Holt, surgeon, at Tottenham; I was called in to examine the child; I looked over the body; I found it in a very putrid state, insomuch that I could not discover any marks of violence whatever about the child; I examined the navel-cord, and found it lascerated; that it had not been properly attended to by a surgeon or midwife; and, from its appearance, I think it was a full-time child.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Then, finding the child in this state, you can form no judgment how it came by its death? - A. By no means.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not the navel-cord, not being properly attended to, of itself occasion the death of the child? - A. It would undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe it is a very frequent thing for the child to die in the birth in the very act of delivery? - A. Most assuredly.</p>
               <p>Q. Even where a skilful practitioner attends the birth? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is the more likely when an ignorant woman delivers herself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you yourself can form no judgment how the child came by its death? - A. No.</p>

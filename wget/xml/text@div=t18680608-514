                  </hi>. I am a civil engineer, and have an office at 9, Liverpool Street, City—a Mr. Hammond has the office, and I am his clerk—I keep an account at the City Bank—I had an account there on the 4th April—the balance at that time was somewhere about 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner has been in my service since the 4th December—I kept my cheque book locked up in the top drawer in my desk at the office—I cannot say when I last saw it safe except from the last cheque that I drew, that was on 28th March—my desk was safe on Friday, 3rd April—I left that evening and returned to the office about 5 o'clock on Saturday the 4th—I found the drawer of my desk broken open—the first thing I looked for was my cheque book and I missed it—I afterwards went to the Bank and this cheque for 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., was shown to me—it is not my signature, or in my handwriting, or written by my authority—the cheque was taken out of the cheque book which was locked in my drawer—the prisoner was not at the office when I got there—I saw him on the Thursday before—on Monday the 6th, I met him at Mr. Mullens' office—he had an interview with Mr. Mullens, but I did not hear it—I believe the endorsement at the back of these two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes to be the prisoner's handwriting—he never said anything to me about having changed two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes.</p>

I am the solicitor conducting this prosecution—I was instructed on Monday, 6th April—after I saw Mr. Cave I expressed a desire to see the prisoner, and he came to me between 12 and 1 o'clock—Mr. Cave was then in another office—I told the prisoner that a forged cheque had been passed at the City Bank on Saturday afternoon, that I had been told that he was the last person in the office, and I asked him to give me an account of where he had been, and what he observed when he had been in and out of the office, during the day—I told him also the cheque had been paid in four 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and I put a great many questions to see if he could throw any light upon it—he said he had been there early in the morning, that he went out for a few minutes and returned, and went out again about 11 o'clock, he came back at 1 and left at 1.30—he told the housekeeper that if he was not back in a few minutes he should not return that day—the matter then rested for about ten days, till the notes came in, and we traced them—I sent again for the prisoner on the 20th—he was brought to my office by the officer—I then showed the prisoner the two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and pointed out the name and address on them, and asked him if he knew the handwriting, he said "No, he did not"—he turned the notes over and handed them back to me, and said he had not seen them before—I then sent for Mr. Dixon—he was waiting, in another room—I showed him a note, and asked if he had received it in payment for some articles of clothing, and if he would know the person from whom he received it—he said yes, the prisoner was the person—the prisoner said "No you are wrong" or "You have made a mistake"—Mr. Dixon said "I have made no mistake, I saw you write that name and address"—the prisoner said "That is not the note I gave you, Mr. Dixon"—"Oh yes it is, I am quite sure"—I asked the prisoner if he had any further explanation to give, he said nothing whatever—I then gave him into custody.</p>

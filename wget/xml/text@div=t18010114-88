             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. My husband keeps the White Swan, East Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prosecutor and the prisoner? - A. Yes: On the 23d of Dec. In the evening, the prosecutor and the prisoner came to my house, and called for a quartern of gin, I came to the bar and served it; not long after my servant came and told me there was another quartern of gin wanted; in the course of half an hour after the girl was gone out, the prosecutor asked for a pint of five-penny.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you see him at that time? - A. Yes, I was sitting in the parlour; he asked for change for a 2l. note, and put down a piece of paper; I told him I could not change it, and I dare say he had smaller change; he then gave me a half guinea, I founded it upon the table, and gave him change, with some halfpence; he then said, I won't take them, I have got halfpence in my pocket; I took my halfpence and change back, I told him to take care of his money, and put it into his pocket before I took the light away.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you give him that caution? - A. Because he laid down his note on the table, and he appeared to be in liquor; I saw no more of him till the next morning, they both came with a constable, he was in liquor then; he called for a quartern of gin, and I served it him; he asked the prisoner, will you drink with me, and the poor girl was crying, and refused a great many times to drink; he said, drink with me, and I won't hurt you; upon that I said the man speaks very good,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140090"></xptr>drink a little, may be he won't hurt you; they stood talking some time, and then he promised her, with very sacred oaths, that if she would confess, he would not hurt her; she cried very much, and said very little, and seemed very much affected; then after that he turned upon his heel, and said to the officer, take her away, hang her; I said, I hope not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by the Court. Q. Your husband keeps this White Swan? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they go into a room? - A. No, they sat in the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him give her watch? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Frazer). Q. Did you stay there after the girl was gone? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you offer to change your note? - A. Before I offered half a guinea I did.</p>
               <p>(To Bassett). Q. Did you hear this man, with sacred oaths, promise he would not hurt her? - A. Yes he did, provided she gave the watch and the note back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say afterwards that he would hang her? - A. Not in my hearing.</p>

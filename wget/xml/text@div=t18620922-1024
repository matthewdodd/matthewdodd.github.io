                  </hi>. I reside in King's-road, Chelsea, and am a leather-dresser—on Tuesday night, 12th August, I was in the Borough-road, South-wark, between 12 and 1 o'clock—I had been drinking in a public-house, and was the worse for liquor—as I was going along, I received a blow on the back of the head—I fell on my hands and knees—I did not see the party who gave it—my assailants then commenced to kick me violently; I tried to get hold of their legs but could not succeed—I then got a violent blow on the jaw, which fractured it; it is very bad now—I was an inpatient at the hospital for a fortnight, I am now an outpatient—I had been two or three hours at Bermondsey with some friends, drinking—when I fell, my impression was that I was going to be robbed, and I put my hands to my pockets.</p>

On Wednesday morning, 13th August, between 12 and 1, I was in Market-street, Borough-road, South-wark—I saw the prosecutor there and told him to go home—he was having a dispute with some girls in Market-street—I followed some distance be<lb></lb>hind him up Market-street, to see that the girls did not molest him—just before he got to the end, I saw the prisoner and a companion of his, cross the other side of Market-street, and knock the prosecutor down—I ran up to his assistance, and just before I got up I saw the prisoner kick him—I took the prisoner by the collar and almost at the same moment I received a violent blow at the back of the ear with a life-preserver, I believe—I had a full opportunity of seeing the prisoner, I had known him before—on the morning of the 19th, I took him into custody—I told him the charge—he said he knew nothing about it, he was at home in bed at the time—I believe the prisoner was brought to the station that same morning, from the statement of the other constables—I could not swear to it—I did not identify him that morning, I was not able; I had not my senses for two days afterwards—I did not know what I was doing—at the time this assault happened the prosecutor was lying insensible—as soon as I came to, I sprang my rattle and was taken to the station, a brother officer got a cab and took the prosecutor to the hospital.</p>

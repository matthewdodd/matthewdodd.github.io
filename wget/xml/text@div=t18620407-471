                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>). I was staying at the Hotel Gertun, in St. John-street, Minories—I am a foreigner—I came to this country on Friday morning with the prisoner and the witness Zach—the prisoner and I lodged in the same house and slept in the same room, but in separate beds—I ob<lb></lb>tained this bill of exchange (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) for 200 Spanish dollars—it is a banker's bill, payable at New York—I saw it last Sunday morning; it was then in my pocket-book in my coat—I could not say which pocket; sometimes I carry it in my breast pocket, and sometimes in my trousers' pocket—I missed it at 9 o'clock on Monday morning—it was brought to me in the course of the day by Zach—I had given information to the police before that—I also lost a sovereign from my pocket—when I missed the bill I went to the prisoner and told him if he had it to give it up, and I would not say anything—the prisoner had known that I had a bill of exchange in my pocket-book—before I went to him I went to the cook, and the mistress of the house, and the servants—when I missed the bill I went upstairs, told the prisoner that nobody else could have done it but him, because nobody else was in the room—the mistress of the house wanted to send to the police and search him, to see whether he had the bill or not, but the prisoner went out—I cannot say whether he knew that the police were to be sent for when he went out—I cannot say that he heard what the mistress of the house said—when the police came he was gone—the bill was given to me by Zach about two hours after he was gone—I saw the prisoner again about two hours after he left the house.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>). I am a mariner, and live at 3, Haydon-square, Middlesex—I came over to England from Rotterdam with the last witness and the prisoner—I saw the prisoner last Monday in the street—he said that when Detroy, whom I lodged with, went down early in the morning, he went and stole the cheque—he said he had been to several bankers and wanted the bill cashed; but they would not cash it for him, because they had to write first to New York and see if the bill was paid or not—I then proposed that I should get it cashed for him, and that we should divide the money between us—he did not mention any banking house to which he had been to get it changed—I said he should give me the cheque, as I went to a banker's before, and got some Prussian money changed for English, and he should go with me and get it cashed, and then divide the</p>

               <p>money—the prisoner gave me the bill to do so, and I went to the bank—the prisoner was to wait outside to be ready to receive the money if I should be able to change the bill—that was after the prisoner had told me he had stolen it out of the prosecutor's pocket—I had never changed any money at all; I only told him so, to induce him to give me the bill—I went with him under the pretence of changing the bill, and the first policeman I met I told the circumstance to—I gave the bill to the policeman—it was in the neighbourhood where the robbery had taken place; and, when I told the policeman that was the person who had taken the bill, he ran after him and caught him, and we went together and saw the prosecutor almost imme<lb></lb>diately.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman,</hi> 595). On Monday last I recieved information from the landlady, in consequence of which I waited shout for some time—the witness Zach came running over to me, gave me some information, and pointed out the prisoner; and I went after him, caught him, took him in custody, and took him to the prosecutor—Zach gave me this bill, which I produce—I took the prisoner to the station, in custody—the bill is a bill of exchange for 200 dollars, payable in New York; town on a house in New York.</p>

I took it, and only kept it to frighten him. When I went out about 11 o'clock I did not say I had it, but went out with the view of changing it, and bringing him the cash for it I thought it would be more agreeable to him. I could not change it, and I met Zach, and told him; he proposed to change it, and that then we would run away with the proceeds between us. I could not get it back from him, and so I thought I would let him change it, and then try and get the money from him, and bring it back to the prosecutor.</p>

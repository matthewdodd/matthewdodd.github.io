                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman living at 3 and 4, Aldermanbur?—on 24th September, about a quarter to 10 o'clock at night, I was turning the corner of Ironmonger-lane—a female came up and asked me where I was going—I told her I was going home—she followed by my side, for about ten yards—then she got in front of me and stopped me—I looked down and saw my watch-ribbon hanging down—my watch was gone—it was a silver watch—I had it safe, to my knowledge, half a minute before that, in my right hand waistcoat pocket—I accused her of taking it—she said, "Oh! my God, this gentleman accuses me of taking his watch," and at that moment two men came up to me; the prisoner was one of them—he asked the woman what was the matter, and during that time she put her hand behind her in the direction of the men, who were standing behind her—while she did that, the prisoner told me to search my pockets and see whether I had lost my watch or not—I pulled the female from him, and she ran across the road and went up a narrow court, I pursued her and caught her again—I called out "Stop thief!"—the two men had followed me during this time, and came up tome again there—I held the woman in my left hand—directly the men came up, I caught hold of one of them, not the prisoner, and then the prisoner was between the two, as it were—the female then held out her hand, and I saw her give him my watch—I told him he had my watch in his hand, for I could see it—he then struck me a very violent blow on the eye, and gave me a severe black eye—he struck me again on the ear, and on the mouth—those were just as violent blows as the other—they cut my mouth all to pieces in the inside—he ran up Church<lb></lb>passage—that is a thoroughfare—I came up with him there—he concealed himself on some steps there—I was crying "Stop thief 1" at the time he came up the passage again, and at the top of the passage the policeman caught him—I afterwards saw my watch: it was found inside the railings near where the prisoner had been.</p>

               <p>supper at about half-past 8—this occurred at a quarter-past 10—I had been walking about between half-past 8 and a quarter-past 10—I went up Holborn, down Regent-street, and up Ludgate-hill—I had made no calls at any place whatever; not at any public-house—I took my watch out to see the time by Bennett's clock, not half a minute previous to its being taken—I don't know who the other man was; he was dressed in dark clothes: I cannot describe them particularly—my attention was more par<lb></lb>ticularly drawn to the prisoner—I know the other man had a cap on—the prisoner had a hat—when they first came up I had accused the woman of taking my watch—I was holding her—she was not struggling particularly; merely to get away—she was struggling to get out of my grasp, and I was endeavouring to hold her fast—I did not see what she did with her hand when it was behind her—the other man was at her side at that time; not behind her; about half a yard from her—the prisoner, when he came up, I said, "What is the matter?"—the watch had been passed when the woman put her hand behind her—I saw the female with her left hand give that man my watch, and I then told him that he had my watch, for I could see it—he was then at liberty, standing between the two—we were all three very close together—it was under the lamp—directly the female gave the prisoner my watch, I let go of the other two and pursued the right one—the other man did not struggle when I had hold of his arm—he did not try particularly to get away from me—he may have pulled a little—I was holding him with one arm, and the woman with the other, at the time I saw the watch passed—the prisoner struck me directly I told him he had my watch—I did not strike him again—I did not lose sight of him when I ran after him—I was as quick as he was—he endeavoured to conceal himself but I could see him—he merely went down some steps, and stooped down a little—I was crying out "Stop thief!" at the time, and then he ran again up the passage, and the policeman caught him—the policeman was not coming up the passage—he was at the top of the passage, in Ironmonger-lane, when he caught the prisoner—I saw a policeman, or some one, up at the end on the passage—I don't know whether the prisoner saw the policeman or not; he ran into his arms—I did not first charge the other man with stealing my watch, I never accused him; I accused the right one—it was not raining—I did not take particular notice whether it was cloudy—there was no lamp where this concealment took place; it was perfectly dark—only the prisoner ran there—the female and the other man went down towards Guildhall—the prisoner was running alone at the time he concealed himself—the female had not run up the court where he was taken—she ran away twice—I caught her once—she ran quite the opposite direction to the passage the first time—the other man did not run down Church-passage at all—I did not keep my eye on the other man and the woman, to know which way they turned—I could not tell whether they doubled back—there are not any side entrances communicating with that passage, that I am aware of—I never was down there before, or since.</p>

On 28th Nov., about three o'clock, I saw him at the Dock-gates—I went with him as far as Maxwell's, the Phœnix public-house—I went by this direction to the Dock-Coffee-house, and fetched a half-dozen basket containing half-a-dozen wine-bottles—I did not deliver them to the prisoner, I kept them myself—I met him again at the Phœnix public-house, and he gave me a one dozen basket and this order, No. 4—he told me to go, as I did on the 26th, and sample the wine—he said if the cooper asked me any questions I was not to answer him, but was to say I came from Dingwell and Co.—I went to the proper office at the East-vault, London Docks, and got the samples of wine—as I was coming away I was spoken to by Clements, the officer—I made a communication to him—I was to meet the prisoner at the crescent vault, and if I did not meet him there I was to go on to the Dock Coffee-house—I did not go there with Clements, as he took me to the Guard-house, so that there was some delay—I had never seen the prisoner before I saw him at the Dock-gate on the 26th Nov.,</p>

                  </hi> I am clerk at the East-vault, London Docks. There is wine there consigned to Dingwell and Co.—on the 17th of Nov. the prisoner produced a sample order (No. 1) to me, purporting to come from Messrs. Dingwell—I know it by my initials to it—the name of the vessel and captain is mentioned—it would require some knowledge of those particulars to fill up an order of this kind—I signed the order, "Sample, R. M.," in red ink across the middle, and gave it out—that would entitle the cooper to draw the order—I received the sample order on the 21st, and order No. 2 also, from the prisoner, and signed it in the usual way.</p>

               <p>(The property produced, and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner delivered a paper, which was read in Court.</p>
               <p>"My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, Permit an unfortunate young man, who, never deviated from the paths of honour till this time, to relate the circumstance in which he is involved. I lodged at the prosecutor's house on Monday in June last; being very intimate with the prosecutor, we having frequently conversed together, I requested him to accomodate me with the clothes, my own being out of repair, and they were livery; and being in company with the women above stated to you, I was apprehended in the one shilling gallery; the reason I had them, was only to appear gay in the eyes of these incorrect women, nothing but that induced me to behave so imprudently, and I hope you will believe me, that, though I acted as with the intention to rob the prosecutor of the property, I would not have kept the clothes so long, nor would I have took them, had I not the prosecutor's consent; I beg leave to state, that my box was at the lodgings at the time; I trust I am an object that will experience the lenity of your Lordship and the Gentlemen of the Jury. Be pleased to bestow mercy, for which I shall be bound in duty ever to pray,</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. (To Prosecutor.) Had you lent him these clothes? - A. I only saw him of a morning when I was going to work, and of an evening; I never lent them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he leave his box there? - A. I believe he left an old pair of breeches and a red waistcoat in his box.</p>

No, I lived in the last place in Charterhouse-square, with Mr. Swainston, a coal-merchant,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040024"></xptr>It was not my intention to steal the clothes; upon my life I meant to bring them back.</p>

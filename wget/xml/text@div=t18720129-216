                  </hi>. I lived in the house with Mr. Rosenstein when this affair took place, as errand-boy—on Saturday night, 9th December, they had been to some place of amusement—when they came up stairs the deceased began swearing at the prisoner, and he said "The idea of a woman like you going out and getting drunk, and giving a good half-sovereign for a bad one," and he swore at her—she did not quarrel with him—I was in the workshop, and they were in the bedroom, on the same floor—next morning I was lighting the fire, they were in the bedroom, and I heard him swearing at her—she answered him, but not to blackguard him in any way—they sent me out to get some soap—that was about 11.30—the quarrelling commenced about 11.15, in the morning—I was lighting the fire then, and that was when I first heard him swearing at her—I went out for the soap, and as I came back I saw him coming out of the barber's, with his head bleeding—my mistress was not at home, and I went with my master to Mrs. North's house—I met him coming out of Paget's—he went to his own house, and then to Mrs. North's, in Dean Street—I did not see the prisoner there, and from there we went to King's College Hos<lb></lb>pital—I saw his head dressed, and I then returned home with him—he went to bed, and he sent me down to fetch Bosman, his foreman—he had about eight men and two or three women working for him—Bosman came about 6 o'clock in the evening, with his mother, and they remained some time with my master—Mrs. Rosenstein came home on the Tuesday week—my master was very ill then, and confined to his bed—she attended to his heads, and dressed it when he returned.</p>

               <p>in the habit of drinking—I saw him partake of the best part of a pint of rum on the Sunday night, the same day that it happened—he took it neat—he was drinking after that on the Wednesday night; he drank rum then—I fetched three half-quarterns, and he and a man named Fisher shared it between them; that was neat—he had a fall on the Wednesday—he was sitting on a chair, leaning his head on the table in the workshop—he fell off the chair, he fell sideways, and struck his head against the leg of a side-table—that was about 9 or 9.30 after he had finished the three half-quarterns of rum—the workmen had all gone—Mr. Fisher had gone—I lifted him up and led him to his bedroom—on the Thursday morning we were going down Lincoln's Inn Fields, and he complained of a pain in his head—we were going to the Civil Service—he worked for them—I used to keep his books—he said "I have got a pain in my head this morning" and I said "Yes, you had a fall last night," and he said "Yes, I know, I had been drink<lb></lb>ing"—coming back from the Civil Service he had some drink, he generally calls at one house—he went into the public-house and I waited outside—when I led him to bed on the Wednesday he was intoxicated; he could not walk—that was from drink—he generally took his meals in the workshop—he had been drinking rum before in the day, before Mr. Fisher came—I fetched it from the <hi rend="italic">Ship</hi>—I had fetched two half-quarterns, I think, no one shared that with him, that was in the day time, and he had been out alone before Mr. Fisher came—I went to the hospital with him on the Tuesday—after the Thursday and before his death, he drank port wine and rum—every day he drank something—he took port wine four or five days before his death—Dr. Mumford was there then—I don't know whether he ordered the port wine—he used to drink rum at the same time as he drank the port wine—I had been with Mr. and Mrs. Rosenstein about four or five months—I have seen the deceased drunk a good many times, and when he was drunk he was very quarrelsome—he was always quarrelling with his wife and fighting when he was drunk—he has thrown things at her—the quarrels generally commenced on his side—she was a sober woman, and her conduct was always kind towards him—when she came back during his illness she used to make him everything he wanted, and she dressed his head.</p>

I am a tailor, and live at 33, New North Street, Red Lion Square—at that time I lived at Grower's Walk, Commercial Road—I worked for the deceased for six months—on Sunday evening, 10th Decem<lb></lb>ber, I was sent for and went to his house—I found him with his head ban<lb></lb>daged up, and I remained with him about three hours—I got there about 6 o'clock, and left between 9 and 10 o'clock—my mother and my intended also went, but I was there before them—I did not see the wound because the bandage was on his head—he seemed the same as usual, and told me how it all happened—he dressed himself and sat by the fire with me—he kept up the conversation during the time I was there—we had two half<lb></lb>pints of rum between us—Timms went for it—the deceased had the best part of it—I saw him again on Monday morning when I went to work—he appeared sober when I left him the night before, but he was sitting down all the time, so I could not tell whether he was the worse for what he had taken—he was in bed on the Monday—I just went in to ask him how he was—he seemed pretty well—he got up and I saw him during the day—I saw him on the Tuesday morning, and regularly every day till he died—he was intoxicated when I left him on the Wednesday evening—I usually left work between 9 and 10 o'clock—I saw him just before Mr. Fisher came, on the Wednesday—he was the worse for drink then, and after Fisher came they had something more to drink—he had a peculiar look on him, a pleasing look when he was intoxicated—his manner was cheerful in gene<lb></lb>ral when he was not drunk—I know he took the bandage off on the Tuesday—he went to the hospital on that day, and when he came home he took the whole bandage off, there were five or six yards, and he went out with his hat on and no bandage—I saw there was a wound on his head—I did not see any blood—he came back afterwards with his head strapped up—he took the bandage off because he wanted to go about his business—he said "I can't go like this to the Civil Service"—I was present when Inspector Greenfield came to take the prisoner into custody on 27th December—I told her to speak the whole truth.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was he drunk on the Tuesday when he took the bandage off his head? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I believe he took it off about 11 o'clock, after he came from the hospital—he came in in about five minutes, and said "I have been to the barber's and had my head strapped up"—I don't think he had taken anything to drink that morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Timms went out with him that morning to shop—the deceased was very passionate when he was drunk—whenever he had had a drop to drink the first thing he did was to begin quarrelling with his wife.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> On one occasion I recollect he dragged her by the hair, and held my large shears over her and had I not snatched them out of his hand I believe he would have cut her head open—he used to throw irons about, but they never struck her—he had hold of the blades of the scizzors and the part where the fingers go in would have struck her—he would throw things at you when he was quarrelling—I have seen him throw 14 and 16 lb. irons at her, but they never hit her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons and house surgeon at King's College Hospital—John Rosenstein came there about mid-day on Sunday, 10th December, with a severe wound of the scalp, which was bleeding very profusely—I examined it, but could detect no fracture at that time—I probed it—the wound was on the upper part of the head, almost in the middle line, but slightly on the right side—it did not present any severe symptoms of any kind at that time—it was about an inch long—I felt that the wound had penetrated the scalp and reached the skull in one small point—I dressed the wound in the ordinary way—I saw him again on the Tuesday, about 10 o'clock in the morning, at the hospital—I dressed the wound again, and I did not see him after that until the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>—I should think such a wound as that was would be more likely to be caused by an instrument than a fall, but I should not like to give an opinion as to the kind of instrument that inflicted a scalp wound—it seemed to me to have been caused by a blow—I was present at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, and I identified the same wound which I had dressed on the Sunday—when we removed the covering of the skull, we found the periosteum of the bone bared in one small point—upon scraping away the periosteum, we found a depression about the size and shape of an almond on the skull—on removing the skull cap, we found the inner table of the skull fractured at a point corresponding with the depression on the outer table—the fracture had not penetrated the brain, but one of the sharp points had slightly scratched the membrane between the brain and the skull, causing a slight extravasation of blood there—we removed the membrane and found a large amount of <hi rend="italic">pus</hi> over the right hemisphere of the brain running down the middle line between the two halves of the brain—underneath the right hemisphere of the brain between it and the lower brain there was another clot of blood, and there was a small amount of <hi rend="italic">pus</hi> on the left hemisphere—there was also a bruise on the right groin and another on the right collar bone, but I could not tell how they had been caused—I should think the bruise on the shoulder was caused by several blows—I don't think one blow would have caused it—the cause of death was undoubtedly the effusion of that matter on the brain which was caused by the irritation of the splinter of bone, which rubbed the membrane outside it—the fracture, such as it was, was in the interior part of the scalp, and the fragment irritated the membrane outside the brain, and so caused the effusion—when I dressed the wound there was nothing which led me to detect that depression or fracture which I found at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>—there was a depression on the outer part of the bone, the fracture was inside—I think the fracture was produced by a severe blow from some instrument with a projection of some kind—I should think that this rim of the poker would be most likely to have caused the wound—if it had been caused by any other part, I think the fracture would have been different—you would</p>

               <p>have a long fracture—I don't think it was caused by the flat part, but either by the knob or the rim—the external wound would have been different—it would have been a wound with two or three angles to it, I think—I have heard about the deceased falling and striking his head against the table leg—that would not produce such a fracture, in my judgment—if it opened the wound so as to cause blood to flow, it would not affect the fracture, only the wound—his chance of recovery from the first was very slight; almost nil, I think—intemperate habits, such as drinking raw rum might have ac<lb></lb>celerated the effusion of matter, and so accelerate death, but it would not otherwise have affected the fracture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Although you did not discover the fracture on the Sunday, it might have existed from the commencement? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, there was a very slight chance of his recovery from the commencement, and although there might have been imprudence on his part in drinking rum and so on, which would accelerate the effusion, still the effusion was due to the fracture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not make the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination myself—I assisted—Mr. Mills made it, and I made the notes—I said I should not like to give an opinion as to the instrument which caused the scalp wound—the almond-like depression might have been there when I used the probe, and I should not have discovered it—it was not a fracture at all—the roughness could not be felt by the finger or the probe—the periosteum covered the bone, and it was only in one point that bare bone could be reached, and the probe, although touching the bare bone, would run over the periosteum—the almond depression must have been caused by a blow of some kind, and there can be no question that the blow which caused the scalp wound caused the depression—an injury might have caused it subse<lb></lb>quently to the time I saw it—it is most improbable, I think, that a fall would cause such a fracture, with such a laceration of the skull—the singular leg of a table would be very much like the rim on the poker, but I don't think a fall against it would cause such a fracture—in the one case the man would be passive and the object active, and in the case of a fall the man would be active and the object passive—the scalp wound would be different in that case—I am against the theory that the fall against the table caused the injury we found at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>—I admit that that and the use of the rum would accelerate death—I think the fall would accelerate the consequences of the fracture, if it struck the same part, but it would not cause the fracture itself—a man of temperate habits would have a much better chance of recovery than a man who indulged in quanti<lb></lb>ties of raw rum—the wound would be more fatal to an intemperate man than a sober man—I should say the poker was the most likely instrument to have caused both the scalp wound and the fracture—when the man came on the Sunday, from the wound and his general bearing I did not apprehend that his life was at all in danger—I did not see him after the Tuesday—I had told him to come again—I did not discover at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examina<lb></lb>tion ny other wound on the head than that which I have described.</p>

               <p>careful probing of the wound, the injury to the scalp, such as you saw at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, would not be detected? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it is very possible that it existed, but could not be detected—the depressed portion was quite smooth—there was no crack in the bone there—if there had been the probe might have got into it—I have found in my experience that a latent fracture has existed and the external indications have not been pro<lb></lb>duced for some time—the head was opened, and in my judgment I found the cause of death there—the viscera of the body generally were all good.</p>

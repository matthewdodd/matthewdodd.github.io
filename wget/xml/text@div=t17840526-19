               <p>ABINA HOBART sworn.</p>
               <p>I was going out of the Opera house on Saturday fortnight, at the King's door as I was going into my coach, I felt a person take hold of my ear, and pull my ear-ring, and endeavour to pull it out.</p>
               <p>Court. Was your ear-ring taken out of your ear? - Yes, it was separated from my ear, it was a gold ear-ring set with diamonds; the tearing my ear down hurt me very much; my ear bled, I screamed out, and missed my ear-ring; I then got into the coach and got home, after I went home my ear-ring was found in my hair; I did not see the prisoner at all.</p>

            , Esq; sworn.</p>
               <p>I was in company with Mrs. Hobartat at this time I was coming out of the Opera with her, I had hold of her hand at the door, I heard her scream very loud, and said she had lost her ear-ring; I immediately followed the prisoner, and took hold of him; I saw him when she screamed out with his hand up to her ear; I immediately seized him, and gave him to the centry that was upon guard at the Opera-house door; the prisoner was the person.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure his hand was the only one that was up to Mrs. Hobart's ear? - The only one that I saw.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178405260045"></xptr>Were any other persons near her? - There were other persons about her to be sure, her servant and a soldier; when I seized the prisoner, he asked me very particularly, whether the lady said she had lost her earring.</p>
               <p>Court. Then had you said any thing about an ear-ring? - I gave charge to the constable, and told him at that time that the lady had lost her ear-ring, and the constable immediately examined the man's pockets.</p>
               <p>When you seized the prisoner, did you tell him that he had taken the lady's earring? - I told the constable; I laid hold of him just as he was passing by the sentry, I gave him to him at that moment, and I mentioned something of Mrs. Hobart's earring; he did not ask the question till I had given him in charge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I beg to ask the lady, whether she can swear that the ear-ring was in her ear when she came out of the Opera-house? - Yes, I swear that the ear-ring was in my ear till it was pulled out; I saw that the person that took hold of my ear put his arms across, I saw his back, and I immediately said, that is the person that pulled my ear.</p>
               <p>Jury. Do you think the prisoner is the person that pulled your ear? - I never saw his face.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Mr. Lascells. Whether you ever saw me ha hold of the lady's ear or ear-ring? - I never saw the ear-ring in his hand, but I saw his hand up at her ear just when she screamed out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether or no, when he took me into custody, I did not say to him, I have stole nobody's ear-ring, and he said yes, you have stole that lady's I said ask the lady? - The very words were, has the lady lost her ear-ring?</p>
               <p>BLACKBURN CLARKE sworn.</p>
               <p>I was upon duty at the Opera-house on Saturday fortnight, I saw the prisoner make up to the lady and lay his hand over her right shoulder, and make up to her ear, and dragged it till the lady called out, O Lord! my ear-ring is gone; that is the lady.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at the prisoner, and be certain whether it was him or not? - I am sure it was him; that gentleman made up to him first, and I immediately followed him, and he laid hold of the prisoner, and I took him to the watch-house; the prisoner asked the gentleman to ask the lady whether she had lost any thing.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner deny having touched the lady's ear? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Whereabouts was you stationed if you was upon duty when the affair was done, at which door? - I was stationed by the constables that patrol the street, I was near the King's door at the time.</p>

             took me forwards towards the great door; if the man was before me, which he says he was, he could not see what was done behind him at the distance of forty yards; he took me by the little door, which is forty yards from the King's door. - I was at the lower part, next to Pall-mall, the door that he speaks of was up above; I was near the King's door, I was about six yards behind him.</p>
               <p>Could you see him do that? - Yes, plainly.</p>
               <p>ANN - sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the watch-house keeper's wife, the prisoner was brought on the 8th of this month to St. James's watch-house at twelve at night; on the 9th, between eleven and twelve, there came four men to the door, he was locked and bolted there, one of them asked if he could go down and see his friend, I ventured to let one down, and in three minutes the three men came up, the prisoner had a chissel, the first came up into the watch-house, the other had a bludgeon, and the third had a stick, and the prisoner held the chissel to my breast, and said, you bitch, I will kill you if you make any resistance.</p>
               <p>Court. This has nothing to do with the fact. - No, but I am in great danger, I am frightened out of my life.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, as I have it not in my power to employ Council,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178405260046"></xptr> if I say any thing that is not strictly proper, I hope you will impute it to the want of a better understanding; the day of the month I cannot recollect, but I was coming by the Opera-house when that gentleman took hold of me, and accused me of stealing that lady's ear-ring; I said I had stole no lady's ear-ring; the soldier came up, and said, you villain, I saw you; you scoundrel, said he, you deserve to be hanged; says he, I will have a new suit of clothes at your cost, thank God; says I, then by that you mean to swear my life away: I am sure he is biassed by the hope of reward to swear what he does; this is all I have to say, and I leave my case to the consideration of the Gentlemen of the Jury.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you get your livelihood? - I am a Taylor, I work with my father and mother, No. 20, Church-street, Saint Ann's, Soho.</p>
               <p>(The witnesses called, but none appeared: His father came in and said, his friends were here last night till nine o'clock, and I cannot now find them, they are gentlemen of character and respect, in the neighbourhood where he lived.)</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, I have a difficulty in point of law upon the subject, for in all larceny there must be a taking and carrying away, these are necessary and essential parts to constitute the offence, here there was a taking, the earing was separated from the ear; a number of cases has been decided upon this subject, two of them came before my Lord Mansfield, since I have attended, which I will mention to you; one of them was, a person got up in a waggon where there was a bale of goods, it lay horizontally, but he set it up on the end, and whilst he was taking things out of it, he was detected by the waggoner; that was reserved for the opinion of the Judges, the Judges were of opinion that it had not been at all removed or carried away in any degree, therefore they were of opinion, that it was not a larceny; there was another case which I tried, that was where a parcel of goods taken out of the Uxbridge waggon, went through Oxford-road, and at a grocer's door, a parcel of sugar or other grocery was taken up there, and put into this waggon; a boy that was tried, got up into the waggon, he had taken these to the tail of the waggon, and there he was seized, and that was held to be a larceny, for there it was removed. There is in print a very leading case, where a man lay at an Inn, he intended to steal the sheets, and he took them off the bed, and bundled them up and removed them, but he was detected before he got out of the room; the Judges held that to be a larceny, in this case the ear-ring was removed, and she apprehended it was actually taken away: upon these authorities it is in my apprehension, sufficient in point of law to constitute the offence, but however if you are of opinion, that the prisoner is the person that committed this fact, I will reserve that case for the opinion of the Judges, and they shall decide upon it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant.</hi>) On the 20th of April, in conse<lb></lb>quence of instructions, I went with Tate and White to a house in New Court, Duck-lane, Westminster—we got there between two and three o'clock in the afternoon—I went up to a room on the first floor of the house—I found the door fastened—we were prepared with sledge-hammers and tools—we broke the door, and before it was broken down we made an opening in it, which enabled us to look the room, and I saw the prisoner standing by the fire-place with something white in his left hand, which he threw on the floor, and stamped on with his right foot—there was a clear fire burning with a pipkin on it, containing metal in a fluid state, which the prisoner took off and placed on the hearth—that was after he trod on what he threw down—I ascertained the state of the pipkin after I got into the room—we got into the room, there was nobody there but the prisoner—he was without coat, handkerchief, or hat, and his shirt-sleeves were tucked up—I looked at the place where I had seen him tread on what he threw down, and found this half-crown and one shilling, which I produce, among the plaster of Paris which he had trod on, and which appeared to have been crushed by a foot—the half-crown had a get to it, which I have broken off—it was extremely hot, I could not hold it, and dropped it into my coat-pocket-the get broke off in my pocket—I found another half-crown on a chair near the fire, on which stood three galvanic batteries—that half-crown was cold—the window was half open—when I went in, the prisoner turned towards it, and threw something out—I saw his hand go towards the window, and he turned round, and began crushing something again with his foot—what he threw down went into the court—there were about 200 people outside—he called to them, "I am to rights"—there had been a call before that of the police being there, and the people assembled—I and my brother officer handcuffed him—we were attacked by the people assembled were very severely beaten, and the prisoner was rescued—I produce the two counterfeit half-crowns, and a good half-crown, and two shillings, which I found in the prisoner's jacket-pocket on a bed in the room—I have been looking for the prisoner ever since—I took him on the 16th of Dec., in Henry-street, Kent-street, Borough, with the assistance of other officers—I am certain he is the man.</p>

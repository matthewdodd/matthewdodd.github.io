Fifty-two pounds weight of salt; he told me he bought it at Mr. Hawkins's, in Bishopsgate-street, and a young man in the shop served him; I asked him if he should know the young man again; he said he should; I lodged the prisoner in the watch-house, and went to Mr. Hawkins's, and brought the young man with me; I asked the prisoner if that was the young man who served him with the salt; he said, yes; the young man said he did not serve him with it.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. ive it from a large salt manufactory?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180505290030"></xptr>- A. Yes, I believe they do not serve any other people.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the salt on his knees, and on his sleeves? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to be of the same quality as that in the bag? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing in the warehouse? - A. Yes, two bags of salt that were brought there and filled with salt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Q. I take it for granted if there were any holes in the sack, the salt would fall on the man's trowsers, and different parts of him, he carrying of it: are you sure that that on his knees was of the same quality as that which was inside of the bag? - A. The quantity was so little I could not be certain.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. On the day I was taken I had been a portering for a man of the name of John Brown, who lived at the upper end of Brick-lane; he had a sack that he used to keep salt in; he told me to sew the sack about the bacon; the sack was nearly full of salt, it clung to my trowsers; I carried it on my shoulders till I went to Billingsgate with it; and after I came back, I bought a quartern of salt at Hawkins's; I gave the bag to that boy; he had a sack of salt, some of it was sewed up with this bacon, and the remaining part was put in my bag; I was coming home with this sack of salt when this gentleman took me in Somerset-street.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

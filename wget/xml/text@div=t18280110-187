On the 9th of January I saw the prisoner take this cotton from the lobby of our door; she undid her pelisse, and was going to put the print under it - the officer came up, and she dropped it; it had been tied to a chair in the passage.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was at the shop, and saw the prisoner there; a little before four o'clock; she was looking at some prints; I saw one piece on the ground; I went three or four yards off and watched; she was pulling one, as if to get it from the chair, which she did - she then went to the shop door, and came out in about two seconds - she then took up the print, and turned her back to me, but appeared, by the motion of her arms, to be putting it into her pelisse; I went up, but when I got up, it was lying on the chair.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I passed the prosecutor's door, where I saw some prints exposed for sale - I stepped to look at them, and another woman (a stranger) did the same - one of them fell off the chair on the ground, I picked it up, and placed it on the chair, and I solemnly declare that I have no further knowledge of the charge. I unfortunately was in liquor at the time.</p>

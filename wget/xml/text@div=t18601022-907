                  </hi>. I live at 4, Elizabeth-terrace, Blue-anchor-road—on Sunday, 27th September, about 7 o'clock, I went out leaving nobody in the house—I fastened it up securely—I returned about 12 at night, and I found things strewed all about the house, and a window broken, so that the catch could be opened—the drawers were broken open—I found the bolts of the yard door open, which I had left fastened—I missed a coat, waistcoat, pair of trousers, shirt, some spoons, and a tea-pot (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 4, William's-terrace, Blue-anchor-road, a hundred and fifty yards from Mr. Moon, and keep a general shop—on the morning of 23d September, between half-past 9 and half-past 10, the prisoner came and asked if he could get any conveyance to Bermondsey police-station—I said "No"—he asked if I had any refreshment—I said "Yes, some ginger<lb></lb>beer," and he had a bottle—he had no handkerchief round his neck, but had it round a parcel which he had under his arm—he asked me for an old handkerckief, and I offered him a large newspaper, and thought he would take the handkerchief off the parcel and tie it round his neck—I heard a jingle of plate, which aroused my suspicion, and about ten minutes after he had left I gave information.</p>

I was sent for on 23d September, to 3, Bank-chambers, and found the prisoner there—he had a parcel with him, tied up in this red handkerchief, in which I found the property produced—I asked him how he came by it—he said that it was not his, but if he was let go, he would restore it to the lawful owner—the shirt was left at Mr. Hughes—it has the name of Thompson on it.</p>

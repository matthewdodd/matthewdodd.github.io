                  </hi>. I am foreman to Frank Sandon Thomas, the manager of Iron-gate Wharf. The property on that wharf is in his care—the prisoner was in the employ of Mr. Neal, a town-carman, who has dealings at the wharf—on the Saturday before, 27th May, between eight and nine o'clock, the prisoner and his cart came for a load of paper—it was given him, and he took it away—he afterwards returned for the remainder—I then heard some<lb></lb>thing, in consequence of which I went to where his wagon was, and saw a bag lying on the shaft, and the prisoner's arms folded over it, partly conceal<lb></lb>ing it—I asked what he had got there—he said if I could not load him he had other orders, and must go to another wharf—I said I must see what he had got—I saw some paper, and knowing we had such paper I went to the pile, and found a bundle of double post missing—his order was for a soft sort of paper, not writing-paper—I know it to be from our wharf by the num<lb></lb>ber on it, which number was missing—there were three reams in the bag.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman. I was at Iron-gate Wharf, and saw the prisoner come from between the hind and forewheel, with a bag in his hand, and when I got to the end I saw him and another man together—I told the foreman—I saw the prisoner put the bag on the shaft—I do not know where it came from—the other man caused my suspicion, because he is about there doing nothing.</p>

On the 5th of November I came to town; I got in liquor, I met with this young woman, I went into a room with her, and when I came out I missed my money; I went after her and asked her for my money, she said she was not the person; I said I could not be mistaken in her person.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in company with any other woman before you had picked her up - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then she might have taken the half crown and the half guinea - A. No, I am sure I had it when I was with her.</p>

            . On the night of the 5th of November I saw the prosecutor, he said he had been robbed of half a guinea and a half crown; he charged the prisoner with being the woman that had robbed him; I asked her for the money; there was half a guinea, half a crown, two shillings, and some halfpence, she took out of her pocket; he charged me with her; she said that if he had behaved like a gentleman to her she would not have took the money; he promised her two shillings, he only gave her one; she did not take the money from him, she found it on the bed where they were.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Might not the money have dropped out on the bed - A. I cannot say; I was on the bed. There is SW on the half crown, it is mine.</p>
               <p>Kennedy. He did not speak to the mark on the half crown till he was at the office.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Saturday night the prosecutor had been in company with another woman; he said if she could recommend him to a Welch or Scotch woman he would pay her for her trouble; I asked him two shillings; he gave me one shilling, and two pennyworth more halfpence; as for the money I did not see it; he said he had lost some money, I said I had seen no money; he shook the quilt and the money flew on the table. I cannot say whether it was his money, as I had some company before.</p>

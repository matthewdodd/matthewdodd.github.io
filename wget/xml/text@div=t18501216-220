The prisoner was in our service for a considerable time—there is a book kept for wages, which is checked by the foreman—I or my brother pay what is due, as attested by the initials of the foreman—I see here a charge 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and an erasure before the "7"—in consequence of something, I called the prisoner, and, in presence of my brother, I charged him with having robbed us, and altered the book, by adding a figure, to make the amount more than the foreman had signed—he hesitated a good bit, and then he said, "Yes, I have"—I asked him how many times he had done it, fifty?—he said, "No"—I said, "Twenty-five?"—be said be did not know; he had done it many times.</p>

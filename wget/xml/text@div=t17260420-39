             thus depos'd. The Deceas'd made dayly complaints of ill Usage that she receiv'd from the Prisoner, and particularly that she had struck her in the Face. The Deceas'd I believe was near 100 Years old, and I my self saw the Prisoner give her a sort of a Jumble.

             thus depos'd. I heard the old Woman cry out Murder; went and found none but the Prisoner with her, I ask'd her if she was not asham'd to strike her old Grandmother, who was grown Childish with Age, and she bade me get about my Business. The Prisoner in her Defence said thus. My Grandmother was a very unsatisfied old Woman, and had made a great deal of Mischief between me and my Husband, and yet I never struck her, not abused her, not let her want for any Thing. Several Witnesses depos'd, that they never heard the old Woman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172604200004"></xptr> complain of the Prisoner, but that on the contrary, she had often said that the Prisoner was very good to her, shew'd her Hand to them, and told them that it was growing black, and that she was afraid she should loss the Use of it, but did not say that it was any way occasion'd by the Prisoner. <rs id="t17260420-39-verdict198" type="verdictDescription">

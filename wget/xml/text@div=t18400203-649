                  </hi>. I live in the service of Mr. George Arnot, a stationer in Soley-terrace, Pentonville. On the 9tb of January, just after seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came and asked for apartments—I showed him some unfurnished apartments which we had to let—he said he wanted them for a friend coming from Boulogne, and he would call next day at two o'clock to see my master—we went down stairs together, and then he asked me to oblige him with a glass of water—I went down into the kitchen to get it—I was not away more than three minutes—when I came up he was gone, and I missed a great coat, which had hung at the foot of the stairs—when I went up stairs I saw it.</p>

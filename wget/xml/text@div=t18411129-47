                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Burrell, who keeps a bottle-warehouse in Lee-street, Burton-crescent. On the afternoon of the 8th of November, I found the prisoner behind our counter, near the parlour-door—he was stooping, with his back to me, as if tying his shoe—I repeatedly asked what he wanted—he made me no answer—I followed him out of the shop, calling, "Stop thief—on coming up with him I heard a very loud noise as if something broke—when he was stopped I looked down an area, and there saw part of the gallipot broken, with some farthings, halfpence, and pence—I had had some farthings in a gallipot behind the counter in the till drawer—there had been about 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver in a small wooden bowl in the till—I saw the bowl at Hatton-garden—the policeman found it on a chair just by the drawer in which the money was kept, and a halfpenny in it—the officer came up and took the prisoner—I had hold of him my<lb></lb>self at the time—before he got to the station the gallipot was picked up,</p>

               <p>and given to the officer—he did not leave go of the prisoner—forty far<lb></lb>things have been found, three penny-pieces, and six halfpence—he must have come five yards into the shop to get to the drawer—a customer has no business there—the officer also produced one shilling and sixpence at the office.</p>

I was up stairs at my lodging, I heard a cry of "Stop thief" and saw the prisoner running by, and Mrs. Burrell after him—just before he was stopped, I heard a noise, and saw the prisoner stop opposite the area, where the money was found—the noise was like breaking of glass—the prisoner was stopped when I came up—a woman in the area picked up several farthings and halfpence, and gave them to me—I have kept them in my possession—the pieces of the gallipot are here—I took the prisoner to the station, went back to the area, and found some more farthings—forty, altogether, were found—I afterwards found a halfpenny on a chair in the prosecutor's shop, and a small wooden bowl—I found a duplicate, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—in halfpence, on the prisoner—he said it was the money he had pawned his waistcoat for—the duplicate was for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the woman accused him, before me, of being in the shop—he said he had not been in the shop—he desired me to let him go, and said I had no business to stop him—I had been looking from a window at the time, and saw the prisoner stopped—I heard the noise as he turned his back to me—no one else was near enough to have done it—the galli-pot was broken.</p>

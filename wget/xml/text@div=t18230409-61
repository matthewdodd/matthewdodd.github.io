I missed a pair of strong men's shoes on the 8th of March; and on the 9th I went after him, and found him at his brother's, in Homer-street. I called him out of the room, and said,</p>
               <p>"Let me have what you have got of mine." He took me into the street, and begged I would not discharge him. I asked what he had done with the shoes. He said, he did not take them with intent to keep them, but he had got a customer for them, and he would bring me either the money or shoes in an hour. I never authorised him to sell any. He then left me and went in doors. Ward afterwards brought me a pair of shoes. I saw the prisoner about fifty yards off at the time, watching him. He came to work next day. I told him Ward had brought a pair. He said he had five pair at a pawnbroker's, he was very sorry, and did not know but there were more; and that he had one pair in pawn in Stingo-lane, and one pair in Crawford-street. I fetched an officer - he said, he did it for drink.</p>

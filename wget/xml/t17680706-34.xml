               <p>Q Did you know her before?</p>
               <p>Campbell. I had seen her long before.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been with her before?</p>
               <p>Campbell. I had, she was sitting at her own door, and I went into the house with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been drinking that afternoon?</p>
               <p>Campbell. Why with company that I met with, I had been drinking a good deal.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect what past?</p>
               <p>Campbell. There was a good deal past between me and her, I was not so stupid in liquor but I remember what she did; she took away my purse and four guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. What room did she carry you into?</p>
               <p>Campbell. The ground floor in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. What money had you in your pocket?</p>
               <p>Campbell. I had eight guineas and a half in my purse, she took four guineas of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she give you the rest again?</p>
               <p>Campbell. She dropped it on the floor, and went out to an alehouse opposite where she lives.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you discovered she had robbed you?</p>
               <p>Campbell. I soon discovered it, I went after her immediately, and charged her; she pretended she had given the money to another, and she would endeavour to find it out; she left me there, and ran away; I took her up, the next day I got a constable, and searched all over for money; she denied it.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times had you visited this lady before?</p>
               <p>Campbell. I never was in her house but once before.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the occasion of your going there the first time?</p>
               <p>Campbell. She pretended she knew me, I having been in the army last was she called me serjeant, so upon the account of that, and the effect of liquor, I went to see her again.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure you have not lost your money somewhere else.</p>
               <p>Campbell. I am quite sure that I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her take the four guineas out of the purse.</p>
               <p>Campbell. I saw her working about it.</p>

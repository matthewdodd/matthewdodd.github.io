                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Coppins—I dealt with the pri<lb></lb>soner for milk.

In consequence of information from my wife, I went after the prisoner, overtook him, and told him my wife had made a mis<lb></lb>take, and given him a sovereign instead of a farthing—he said, "It is no one thing, your wife bought a halfpenny-worth of milk of me, and gave me two farthings"—I said, "If you are an honest man, turn out your pocket, and I shall be satisfied"—he said, "I tell you what it is, I have no sovereign about me; if your wife gave me one, I must have paid it away"—he re<lb></lb>fused to tarn his pocket out—I kept him in sight till I found a policeman, and the sovereign was found on him, and two or three farthings.</p>

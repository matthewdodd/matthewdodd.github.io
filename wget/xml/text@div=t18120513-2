               <p>Q. Who was the last person in your house the night before? Who fastened your house - A. My own son. This was done before the shop was shut up. On taking the window-shutters down, the window was found broken, the knives were near tumbling out; on which my son ran up stairs to me, and said, there must have been some knives taken out of the window on Saturday evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Your son alarmed you - A. Yes, about seven o'clock on the Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know when it was broken open - A. It appears that it must have been about half past eight on Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was Saturday night - A. Because if the window had been broken it must have been seen by people passing the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. That is your argument. The window was not discovered to be broken on Saturday - A. We know no further than we suppose it was done on Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. I must not have suspicion alone. We cannot affect a fellow creature's life upon supposition - A. I cannot swear when it was done. The first time it was discovered was on the Monday morning following.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thin lead to the detection of the prisoner - A. Mere chance, I made no alarm about it.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw nobody break your window, nor did you miss the knives untill Monday morning - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. All you know, is, you found your shop-window broken on Monday morning, before breakfast - A. Yes, and afterwards a constable called upon me.</p>

            . I am a constable of Spital-fields. On Saturday night, the 25th of April, I was returning home, near eleven o'clock at night, saw three boys running, I had suspision that they had been after no good, I ran after them, and laid hold of the prisoner at the bar; as I laid hold of him, two knives dropped from underneath his jacket. I picked up the knives, and asked him where he got them, he said he knew nothing about them. I was going to take him away to the watchhouse, I discovered some forks laying where I took up the knives. I picked up the two forks, I took the prisoner to the watch-house and searched him, I found two pence in halfpence upon him, and a metal broach. I questioned the prisoner at the watchhouse, where he got the knives and forks; he said he found them upon the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what stairs - A. In the house where one Arnold lived, he said he went to look after Arnold's boy to get him to come down and play with him.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know at all where these knives and forks came from, except from what he told you - A. No. I went to Mr. Johnson's house on the Monday morning, I did not take the prisoner with me. These are the knives.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The knives and forks are my property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I found them knives and forks.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Did not you say before the justice, that the window was broke, and puttied up before? - I do not believe I said so; the window was broke and puttied up, and had been so since I lived with my master; and I have heard him say that it it had been so for seven years; the window was in the same state I had ever known it.</p>
               <p>Court. What was there standing in the window of your master's shop, at the time you heard the window crack? - Sets of knives and forks papered in a roll for shew, that was usually placed there.</p>
               <p>Were these within reach of a hand? - They laid close to each pane of glass, therefore some of them could be drawn through the broken pane; there is always one knife and fork outside of each paper, for shew; there were about three papers against each pane.</p>

I pursued him; he ran a little way up the lane, and crossed to Wild-passage, on the opposite side of the way; I got to that passage before the prisoner: he crossed the way immediately, and ran into Duke's-court; Mr. Minns was at the corner of the court, and I called to him, there he is, that is him: Minns pursued with me up Duke's-court; Williams followed after: the clerk at the public office, in Bow-street, was the person that stopped him; he is not here; I saw the prisoner stopped in Duke's-court; we brought him back to the shop, to see what was missing; there was nothing missing, as I found, or did learn; I observed nothing in the shop window.</p>
               <p>Court. Let me now remind you of the situation in which the prisoner stands, and ask you whether you are sure you saw the prisoner's hand in the window, or whether he was attempting to put his hand in? - No, his hand was through; I am sure of it; it was his right hand, not the hand next me; his coat was not through.</p>
               <p>Did you lose him in the pursuit? - Not at all.</p>

               <p>I am a cutler in Drury-lane; on New Year's day, about six in the evening, my man, Williams, says he told me something, but I did not attend to him; in that instant Carns gave an alarm; he opened the door, and said, thieves! thieves! but did not come into the shop; in consequence of that, I went immediately to Duke's-court; and Carns had ran after the prisoner; and when I came up, he said that is him; I pursued him, and hallooed out stop thief! stop thief! and in Duke's-court, he was stopped; I am sure the person stopped, was the man pointed out by Carns; he never was out of my sight; after that, he was stopped by a man, who I understand since, is the principal clerk at Bow-street office; I collared the prisoner, and brought him back to my shop window; and I observed the glass was broke, a very large hole, big enough to put my arm in; I looked through the glass, to see if any thing was lost from the window; nothing was lost; I perceived one of the sets of knives that were tied up, was moved from the situation in which it was placed; my knives and forks are placed opposite to the glass, and as close as possible: and one set of the knives was pushed from the glass at a greater distance.</p>
               <p>What sort of light was it when you had the alarm first? - It was a little before six, on the first of January; I had lighted candles upwards of an hour; this pane of glass has been cracked and puttied up for seven, or I may safely say ten years; but this day it was in its usual security; that I can safely say, because I frequently observed it whole that day, when looking at the window frame which Williams had that day painted.</p>

I said, nothing, I am going about my business; I went up this court, and they came after me, and challenged me with breaking the window: I said, you know my master, and I told him who he was; Mr. Dean of Petticoat-lane; he said, I know him very well; but he would not let me send for him; and they took me to Tothilfields.</p>

               <p>I am a horn turner, No. 26, Petticoat-lane; I know the prisoner; he was my journeyman at that time; I sent him on New Year's day for some horn tips; and I had asked him several times to go to different persons to enquire about them, and see if they had any; and that very morning I gave him a guinea to go to Old Montague-street; I gave him a guinea; he brought it back, and he told me they had none; then I told him to finish his work, and go up to Oxford-street, he went away from me about half after three; he has lived with me ten years, with me and my father; I was with my father; he had been apprentice to my father; he had his time given him at my father's death; about three years ago, he was taken very ill at his work, and I did not see him for some time; but between that time and this, he has worked for me three different times, and I never found any thing in him dishonest; we used to trust to him; but of late I have left off trusting any body; the week before he had earned fifteen shillings, and that week he had money owing him; I might owe him half a dozen shillings; he did certainly make the work that Mr. Minns had, about a week before; he made it in my work-shop; that was handles for butcher's steels: was he at large again, I should employ him again; for I never found any body that I had more reason to trust.</p>

He asked the other woman that was with me, whether she had got any blacking; she said, no: the prisoner then gave her a bit of blacking, and she gave it to me in the presence of the prisoner: there was one sixpence that I objected to, it looked very yellow, he changed it and gave me another. On the Tuesday following I went again, with the same woman, and the officers, Armstrong, Ray, Ferris, and Peach; we knocked at the door, and the prisoner said he should not be ready for two hours; the officers did not go within sight of the door; I went to the officers and told them, and they went into the house and took them into custody. Armstrong has got the money and the blacking that I had of the prisoner; I gave them to him that same day, in the presence of Mr. Colquhoun.</p>
               <p>JOHN ARMSTRONG sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am an officer belonging to the Police office, in Worship street, in consequence of information, I went, on Tuesday the 26th of September in the morning, to the prisoner's house in Bridgewater-gardens, in company with Clark, one of the Marshalmen, and the other officers; with a warrant from my Lord Mayor; they refused to let us in, we pushed very hard at the door, and the bolts or something gave way, and we went in; I saw the prisoner in bed, we took the prisoner in custody, and proceeded to search the house. This money I had of the last witness, on the 23d of September, and this blacking, (producing them).</p>
               <p>Q. Is that good money or bad? - A. It is counterfeit; there are six sixpences and two shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Of what particular use is blacking in the process of coining? - A.This blacking is used upon the money, to take the white off, to make it appear as if it had been in circulation.</p>
               <p>JOHN CLARK sworn. - I am one of the City-Marshalmen: I was in company with Armstrong and the other officers, at the house of the prisoner; Armstrong and myself searched the house, it is in a court, just by Brackley-street, Bridgwater-gardens, a place called the Wooden-world; there was a man and his wife in bed; the woman made a terrible piece of work; I held the man, and we searched the house, and on the mantle-piece, we found two bad sixpences; I searched his pockets, and in his breeches-pockets, I found two that I cannot tell whether they are good or bad, and two shillings, one of which is a bad one; I found this pot with some blacking in it.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Armstrong). Is that the sort of blacking that is used for blacking shoes? - A. It is the sort of blacking used by coiners.</p>

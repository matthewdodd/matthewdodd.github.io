On the 17th of March, I had been counting my halfpence up to take to the pawnbrokers. They were all in five-shilling papers. I turned my back to go into the parlour; a gentleman came in; he said, have you lost any thing. I looked upon the counter, and said, I have lost some papers of halfpence. He said, he saw a man go out with them; his son and the officer had gone after him. I went out, and the officer had taken the prisoner in custody.</p>

            . I am an officer. From information I watched Mr. Sheppard's shop; I saw a man come out. He looked round, saw me, and then he mended his pace. Another man was with him. They both went up Drury-lane. I took the man that came out of Mr. Sheppard's shop, and searched him. He had nothing on him. I pursued the prisoner, and took him in Wych-street. Directly I laid hold of him he threw the halfpence in the street. I picked up seven shillings and seven-pence. Here they are.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sheppard. I believe I lost four papers. I am sure I lost two.</p>

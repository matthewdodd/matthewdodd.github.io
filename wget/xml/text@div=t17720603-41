               <p>Q. How long have you been clerk?</p>
               <p>Bark. Ever since the 3d of September. Hitchcock became a member of that society on the 4th of August, 1766. He became a steward on the 5th of November 1771; (the note shewn him.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see that before?</p>
               <p>Bark. Yes; before it was missing the 5th of January, the quarterly night.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you keep the money of the society?</p>
               <p>Bark. In the box. The keys are kept by the two stewards, each has one, and the landlord of the house has another. On the 5th of January I saw the prisoner put the note in the box; the box stands before the stewards and me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it continue open any time?</p>
               <p>Bark. No.</p>

               <p>Bark. Yes; but not after he put it in, for that was the last thing; I did not see it afterwards, till I saw it at Mr. Deacon's, just before the last sessions.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the note?</p>
               <p>Bark. Yes.</p>

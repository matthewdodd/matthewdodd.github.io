            . The prisoner came in the morning about half past eight, and gently rang at the bell. He told me he was employed to measure the drain. I lit him down stairs. He pulled a rule out of his pocket and measured the area. He likewise measured a part of the kitchen. He told me he should come on the morrow to repair it. He asked me if there were any water closets up stairs. I told him we had a drain in the back area, and I shewed it to him. He asked me if I would take a pail of water into the back area, and throw it down the sink. He told me he thought I was called up stairs. I replied I should not go up until the bell was rung. In about a minute the bell did ring, and I went up stairs with my master's coffee. I left the prisoner in the kitchen. When I came down again, he was gone. I never mistrusted the man in the least, until a neighbour came and said, "have you not had a man been to measure the drain," and I said yes. Then she asked me, "was he sent for," and I said, I suppose he was, and she said, "had you not better enquire, for he has been to my house also; and our's was in full repair, and I knew he was wrong," and said she, "I don't like the person of the man, and I sent the servant to see where he went, and the servant saw him in your area, measuring your area." I then went up to my mistress and told her what this lady said. I went down again, and missed the tea pot which had been in the kitchen whilst the prisoner had been in the kitchen. No other person had been in, and we never found the tea pot, and I am sure he is the man.</p>

            . On the 15th of June, Saturday morning, I heard a pull at the bell twice; went up to the door; I opened it, and two men stood there, and said they had come to measure the water pipes. I let them in, and they went down into the kitchen, and I let them into the scullery, and looked at the pipes round about, and in the lodger's servants' room, and in the back area. Then they went into the lodger's servants' room, and looked about there, and then they came into the kitchen and asked if we had got a back kitchen. I told them we had no back kitchen; but we had places which were locked up. So I told them I could not get at them until my master was up; I told them we had a parlour backwards up stairs, and one man took the rule out of the other's hand and went up stairs with me into the parlour, and measured the parlour twice across, and once along. Then the other went down stairs, and down to the kitchen. Then he came back again. I was in the parlour, and he came up to me again, and told me he would come back again in an hour's time, when my master was up. The first thing I missed when they went away, was one tea spoon that had been on the lodger's servants' dresser. I gave the alarm directly, and then on searching, we missed the other things. I am possitive the prisoner was one of the men.</p>

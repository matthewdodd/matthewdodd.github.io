            . I live in Change-court in the Strand, on the 8th of May about a quarter before Twelve o'clock. coming home there were two soldiers about a yard distance from each other, and the prisoner, who is a <rs id="t17530607-3-deflabel12" type="occupation">soldier</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17530607-3-defend37 t17530607-3-deflabel12"></join>, about six yards from them; he met me and took fast hold on me: it was a very light night, and a lamp burnt bright just opposite me.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see the prisoner's face?</p>
               <p>Mibous. Yes, my lord, I did, when he laid hold on me, which was on the bosom of my coat and arm : I said, friend, what would you be at, immediately came up the other two, one of whom took hold on my left arm, the other took hold on my other side ; on which I call'd out thieves and watch. Then the prisoner loosed his hold, and took off my hat: they all three ran away, and I pursu'd them, calling out stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did none of them say any thing to you ?</p>
               <p>Mibous. No, my lord, they did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they any weapon ?</p>
               <p>Mibous. No, I saw none. When they came near the Savoy steps, the prisoner quitted the other two, and made towards Savoy-hill: at the alley he said, catch me now if you can. I pursued him in the alley, and a soldier stopp'd him, but let him go: then, with some threatening language, the prisoner turned about and gave me a kick; on which I ran into the Strand, and went to call a gentleman that I knew, to go with me into the barracks, but he could not go: I then went by myself, and call'd for the corporal of the night, who call'd for two other soldiers, and they, with the corporal, went with me. We found the prisoner in Exeter-street at a door, and took him. We carried him to the watch house near the New-Church in the Strand, from thence to New prison, and from thence the next day before justice Fielding, where he said he was set upon and lost his hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he charged with taking your's off your head ?</p>
               <p>Mibous. He was, but denied it. When the soldiers took him, he resisted and fell down, and his hat fell off his head, it had a cockade: after that he threw it into an area, which hat is mine that I lost, and I describ'd it by a particular mark in the crown, and a mark withinside: after they went with him to prison, the next morning, a little after six o'clock, they went and found it in the area. (The hat produced in court, and deposed to.)</p>

            . I am a corporal in the Third Regiment on the Barrack-guard, the prisoner is in the Second Regiment: the 9th of May in the morning, between 12 and 1 o'clock, Mr. Mibous came and knock'd at the back door in the Savoy, and on my opening it he said he had been robb'd of his hat by a soldier, who came down towards the barracks; I asked the centinel if he had seen any person go past ; he said no. I told Mr. Mibous I did not know what to do in it, but that I'd go with him to any place he thought proper, which I did, with two soldiers, to a place of ill same in that neighbourhood in a court, but they were gone to bed. I found no body there; but going up Exeter-street the prisoner was standing at a door, seeming to call to a person to let him in. One of the men with us had been drinking with him that afternoon, and had likewise seen Mibous pursuing him, said that is the man: but Mr. Mibous said, I will not swear to the man till I see his face, so a soldier and I went and took hold on him, and asked him to go us, which he refused. After we brought him to the light, Mibous said, that is the man, I'll swear to him: the prisoner had a hanger under his arm, which one of the soldiers took from him, and in the scuffle he fell, he had a hat on at this time, I held him by his neck; a gentleman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175306070004"></xptr> came out of the house and said, don't murder the man, as he fell, the hat fell off upon the ground, one of the soldiers took him up, and the third soldier took up his hat, and put it upon his head, and going on five or six steps, the prisoner tossed his hat off into an Area; he had to hand at liberty. The next morning, when we had conducted him to New Prison, we concluded to go by the area to see for this hat; one of the soldiers got over, and took it up: I went to Mr. Mibous's house, and told him, by his description, I had got his hat; he came with us, and saw, and swore to it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mibous. Had the prisoner a hat on his head when he took yours?</p>
               <p>Mibous. He had one without a lace, with a mettle button on it.</p>

            , the two soldiers that were at the taking the prisoner, confirmed the testimony of Woolfe; the latter of them, with this addition, that he had been drinking at an alehouse with two shoemakers (the prosecutor was not of the company) and two soldiers, that he parted with them, and they went towards Savoy Hill, and he home, he had got a candle in his hand ; about half and hour after he had parted with them he heard a cry of stop thief, he went out, and saw the prisoner running by, and the prosecutor after him, that the prisoner was stopp'd by a centinel, he went and was certain it was one of the soldiers he had been drinking with. That the prosecutor there said he had been robbed of his hat, while he was looking for it the prisoner got from the centinel; after which he, with the others, found him at a door in Exeter-street, and that they had a struggle, and his hat fell off, he took it up, and put it on the prisoner's head, that he then observed it to be too good for a regimental hat, and the cockade being loose, he was positive it was the same that was found in the area the next morning, were he saw the prisoner toss it from his head.</p>

             thus depos'd. About 4 a Clock on Monday Afternoon, I went to drink at the New Spaw, which is kept by Mr. Sanderson. The Prisoners and others were playing at Skettles, I made one among them, we afterwards went to Cards. Cundell lost a great deal, and having no Money left, he desir'd me to pay 4 d. for him, which I did, and he in pretence of returning the Civility, would needs go home with me over the Fields, for it was then about 11 at Night, and Turner said, he was going the same way, and would bear us company. When we came near <placeName id="t17260831-11-crimeloc49">Lambs Conduit</placeName>

So I went to the Spaw next Day, and enquir'd after them. There happen'd to be somebody that knew Cundell, who was taken that Day.</p>
               <p>The Constable depos'd. that when Cundell was taken, he discover'd Turner, and desir'd to be made an Evidence. Mr. Sanderson and his Wife thus depos'd. The Evening before the Prosecutor was rob'd, he was Drunk and very abusive, and the next Day he said that they forced him to lay the Wagers, and so got his Money from him. The Place where he lost his Money, was near some Houses in Lambs Conduit Fields, where a Watch was kept, but he did not call out. And said farther, that he did not know the Prisoners but by their Cloaths. <rs id="t17260831-11-verdict50" type="verdictDescription">

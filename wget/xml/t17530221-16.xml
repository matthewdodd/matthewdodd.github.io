From thence we went into Field-lane, to Mrs. Ridge, and she bought the other two pair for three shillings; we asked her half a crown a pair; I never knew her before, she trades in women's cloaths. Then we went to Mrs. Pearce who lives two or three doors from the other, and asked her if she would buy any silk stockings, and she desired to see them, so we went to our room and fetched 4 pair, which she bought of us at 2 s. a pair; we asked her three; as we went out of her shop Mrs. Ridge called us to her, and asked us if we had any more stockings to sell, and said if we would bring them she would buy them; so we went with some, and she was to give us a shilling a pair; then we went and fetched more; we carried at the last time 14 pair; in the whole we carried 40 pair; she paid us 6 s. and was to give us 32 or 13 s. more.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175302210009"></xptr> She bid us come o n the next Sunday, so we did and she said us 3 s. then she bid us come the next Sunday, we went, and she, paid us 5 s. we bought two handkerchiefs of her, which in the whole came to 7 s. 6 d. we went to Mrs. Pearce's the same day that we carried the 40 pair to the other; we wanted to know if she would buy any more, and she said we might bring them down that she might look at them, so we carried 20 pair, and she said she did not know what to do with them. We desired her to lend us 20 s. upon them, which she did, and desired we'd fetch them away as soon as we could; we told her we would as soon as we found any body that would give us more.

             . On the first of this month there came a parcel up by the Towcester waggon, which unloads every Thursday morning about four or five o'clock in Newgate-Market; the bag was in the bill of lading, and the bag was missing after it was unloaded, it was directed to Mr. John Hookham in liread street . After I had an answer to a letter that I sent into the country about it, I advertised it 3 guineas reward twice, and at another time 10. The first information I had was from one Mr. Price, who had stopped one pair of them. The boy was taken up, and I was present when he owned that he took this bag of stockings from under the waggon, and he said there was a bag of halfpence which he could not carry, or he had taken them (there was a bag at that time with 3 l. 10 s. in halfpence in it) he said he carried it to the house of Moor, and opened them, and burned two pocket books that he took out of the parcel, and had an apron made of the cloth they were in. I saw that.</p>

            . I have several workmen that make stockings for me in Northamptonshire. I received a letter from John Shepherd of Hertford to let me know he had sent me 71 pair of silk hose . and four pieces of silk for breeches by the Towcester waggon, which never came to hand. On the 6th of February I saw an advertisement from Mr. Price on Snow hill, of a pair of silk hose that he had stopped; I went there, and saw a pair of crimson silk stockings that he had stopped, and said they were brought to his house by

I went and found them to be two pair that came from two of my workmen that I had the general account of, (for these in the parcel were from several workmen) which I know by the clocks and colour. I have seen of them 42 in one parcel, and 24 in another, besides this pair which

After that, I was necessitated for a little money, so I opened them and took two pair out, thinking I might make free with them as they were in my house, so I carried them to pawn for 10 s.

I answered, then she had better carry them to the principal owner and get the reward; the answered, there were but three guineas reward, and that money was not sufficient to destay what she had given for them, so she would not carry them home, as they were advertised supposed to be dropped.</p>

Catharine Taylor brought two pair of silk stockings to me to pawn on the 12th of this instant; I asked her how she came by them ; she said she bought them for her husband's and her own use in Chick Lane last summer, and that she gave 16 s. a pair for them ; I asked her where she lived; she said in Field Lane, and kept a cloaths shop ; I told her there had been some stockings advertised, and it was not improbable but these might be part of them, but I would look into the advertisement and send for the persons, and if they were not part of them, then she should have them safe again; she seemed to be in a great hurry to be gone, and said she had left her shop alone, so she went away and came no more. Then I advertised them (the stockings produced in court) I found she lived where she said, and I directed the prosecutor to her.</p>

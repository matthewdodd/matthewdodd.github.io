The prisoner was in my employ; on the 13th of March, in consequence of information, I marked 26 shillings, and put them into my till, about half-past twelve in the day - I remained in the shop till half-past one, and then went to dinner - on my return, I found one shilling gone - I sent him to his dinner, and then marked two shillings more; and about three o'clock I went out, calling him to mind the shop; I returned in a quarter of an hour, and in that time I found he had taken about 8s. 6d., but on examining the till, there were only twenty-five marked shillings, &amp; seven shillings not marked- I stated to him that I had missed money; he said he knew nothing about it - I said I must send for an officer - he then pointed to where he had concealed some money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you not tell him, it would be better to confess it? A. No; I said I did not wish him to confess it.</p>

To some straw under the counter - I saw Angel examine the straw, and take a shilling out - two officers came, one of whom went up with me to examine the prisoner's box, and on the top of it he found two shillings and some copper; and at the bottom of it two marked shillings, and other monies; here is one of the shillings.</p>

            . On the 25th of April last, about 12 at night, I was returning home from White-chappel, I had got about half way down Houndsditch; I saw two fellows arm in arm: I did not like the looks of them; I crost the way, they walk'd on, till I came to a place call'd Church row; I stood considering with myself, which way I should go; I went through <placeName id="t17510911-29-crimeloc139">Church row</placeName>

The other unbuttoned the wasteband of my breeches,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175109110015"></xptr> and put his hand in my pocket, and took out 3 s. then I button'd them again; then he took off my hat, and upon my telling him it was a very old one, he gave it me again; after that the fellow that collar'd me insisted upon bussing me. He put his hand round my neck and did buss me; then he bid me stand still till he was out of sight; I told him I would, he walk'd about 10 or 12 yards from me, and turn'd about with his pistol and said, if I stir'd he would shoot me; there I remain'd till I thought they were quite gone; then I went home. I was very near a lamp, I did not see his face that pick'd my pocket, I saw a good deal of the other's face; I cannot pretend to swear it was the prisoner, but he is exactly the shape, make and voice, of him that collar'd me. I believed him to be the man when I saw him in Justice Fielding's house; I said the same I do now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said at the Justice's he was rob'd of 5 s.</p>
               <p>Bright. I said five or six shillings: I think still I lost five not knowing what I had in my pocket, but I swore safely to 3 s.</p>

               <p>yes, they would—I saw him again the same time, or within a day or so, and he said he had paid Mr. Stevenson—I said, "Then will you come in and bring me all receipts, the County Court receipt, and Mr. Stevenson's receipt for this 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.? "—an evening was arranged when my husband should be in the house at seven o'clock to receive these things—I was resent, and we sat down at the table together—the prisoner first of all handed me these two copies of the writs produced, and said, You had better burn them, Mrs. Wilkinson"—he did not say why—he said, "Don't have them in your possession"—that was all, and from his saying that I rather thought I should like to keep them—he at the same time gave me: this receipt of Mr. Lamb's for 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., saying, "There is the receipt for the money"—I said, "Is it all done with? with regard to Mr. Stevenson, is it all paid up?

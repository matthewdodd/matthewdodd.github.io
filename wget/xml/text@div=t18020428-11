             sworn. - I am shopman to Mr. Warren: On Friday, the 19th of March, the prisoner came, and asked me to change two lawn handkerchiefs which she had bought a day or two before, and left at the shop, saying she would call for them in a day or two; she then had them changed for two policat handkerchiefs, and wished to look at some muslins, saying, she wanted a dress for a friend; there was a piece in a manner fixed upon, but there was not enough of it, and she said she would only take half a yard; I pressed her to purchase a quantity, and in looking over the wrapper to find a piece of a sufficient length, I missed a piece of muslin, but did not take any notice of it to her then; the only reason I had to suspect her was, that she had been twice before to the shop, and I saw her put her hand under her cloak, and rather suppose she took it at that time; she paid the difference of the handkerchiefs and the muslin, and went out of the shop; I followed her, and brought her back, upon which she gave Mr. 
               <persName id="t18020428-11-person97">Warner</persName>
             the muslin, as he has related; I fetched Mr. Saunders, the constable, who has had the muslin ever since, which I am sure was in the wrapper, and which I afterwards missed.(Nathaniel Saunders produced the musli, which was identified by Mr. Warren.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I brought it away in a mistake; for I put the things I had bought and that muslin all in my pocket at the same time; I was not over the threshold of the door when the gentleman laid hold of my arm.</p>
               <p>Jury. (To Baxter.) Q. Did you wrap the things up yourself? - A. I put them in a paper, and rolled them up, and gave them to her; the muslin she stole. GUILTY, aged 26.</p>

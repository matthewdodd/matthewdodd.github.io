I am the wife of William Lucking, An auctioneer, of 2, Linden Cottages, Brixton Road—on 19th September last I went out, about 7 o'clock in the evening, and returned about 8.20—I left the house quite safe, with no one in it—on my return I found the gate in front of the house unlocked, and the street-door open—I had locked them before I went out—I missed a quantity of property, worth about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—these spoons were amongst the property stolen—I can swear to them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Botwell, in the parish of Hayes—I am horse-keeper to Mr. Shackle. On the 11th of May, between seven and eight o'clock, I fastened the door of his stable at Botwell—there is a corn—bin in the stable—there was some oats, beans, and pollard mixed in it for the use of the horses—about three in the morning I was called by the policeman—I went to the stable, and about half the mixture was gone—I have seen some mixed food in the hands of the policeman—it is mixed in the same manner as what I missed, and it agreed in quantity and quality.</p>

I was on duty about three o'clock in the morning on the 12th of May—I met the prisoner within twenty or thirty yards of Mr. Shackle's stable, with a sack on his shoulder—I asked what he had got—he said chaff that he had brought from a stable—I took him back to Mr. Shackle's stable—he entered the stable, and said he got it from the corn—bin there—I asked him if any person there gave it him—he said, "No"—I called Morland up, and showed him the mixture—the pri<lb></lb>soner refused to say where he was going to take it.</p>

(The prisoner received a good character.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live in Grafton-street, Finsbury-square. On the 30th of August, about half-past two o'clock in the afternoon, I was in my parlour by the side of my shop, and saw the prisoner behind the counter, with his hand in the till—I stepped out of the parlour, and caught his band in the till, with some silver in it, which he dropped into the silver box, in the till—he had removed it from its place—I con<lb></lb>sidered he had got no more money, till I put my hand to his cheek, and out dropped half-a-crown, one shilling, and two sixpences—my man came up and took hold of him—I asked him How he came to do this—he said two other boys had sent him in—I saw two other boys, they had run away—I do not know How much money was is the till before this—I know I had got some half-crowns.</p>

On the 18th of October, in the morning, I missed a 5l. and a 2l. note out of my pocket-book, which was locked in a drawer in my parlour; I had put them there on the 14th, with the other notes which was left; I sent for Turner, and called the prisoner down in the evening and told Turner to search him; there were no notes found on him; he tried to get out of the room - I called him back, and while we were counting 19s. 6d., which was found on him, Frischi said he was swallowing the notes - I seized him, and Turner laid hold of his throat and forced a key out of his mouth, which opened the drawer; it is a common lock-he said he found the key in the passage.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM TURNER. I am an officer. I was searching the prisoner, and found 19s. 6d. on him; while I was counting it, Frischi said he was swallowing the notes - I turned round and saw something in his throat, I laid hold of it, forced the key up and took it out of his mouth; I told him to open the drawer with it, which he did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I had not finished searching him.</p>
               <p>ELIZA FRISCHI. I am housekeeper to the prosecutor. On the 18th of October, the prisoner was being searched, while they were counting the money, he turned from them and put his hand to his mouth; I saw something like paper between his teeth, and told them-it was white; it might not be paper. They took a key out of his mouth-the key was a dull colour.</p>

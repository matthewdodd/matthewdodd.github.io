The prisoner worked for me about a fortnight - he called on the 18th of April, and staid about an hour; about half an hour after he was gone I missed the scissors, and when I left work at night I missed a black silk handkerchief. Next morning I took the officer, and found him in bed; the officer found the scissors in his pocket - he was taken to the watch-house, and there stated that the handkerchief was in pawn at Mr. Baylis's, in Hampstead-road; that he had pawned it, but did not take it. I had left him in my room while I went to tea.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Have you a shop-boy of the name of Henry? A. Yes; he is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Henry owe the prisoner 1 s., and they changed scissors for the 1 s.? A. No.; they did not. -

               <p>Ollof Werge. I am a Swede, I live in Wapping: the prisoner at the bar borrowed a seal of me to seal a letter; I handed the seal watch and all to him, he went away with it; I did not see him till after he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Werge. This will be six weeks ago to-morrow.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he a letter to seal</p>
               <p>Werge. I do not know that he had; I went on board my ship, and forgot to ask him for my watch. He was taken up about 8 days after; before the Justice he said he sold it in Whitechapel road for a guinea and half.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get it again?</p>

            . The prosecutor lodged at the same house which I do at present, the Ship in Wapping, so did the prisoner; he absconded six weeks ago to-morrow: as soon as he was taken up, he confessed he had taken 3 s. out of my chest, my property, and that he borrowed Mr. Werge's watch to seal a letter, and afterwards sold it for a guinea and half.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose any money out of your chest?</p>
               <p>Hudson. I know I lost 3 s.</p>
               <p>Henry Hall. Campbell own'd to me that the watch was safe enough; I went with him in order to get it; he made a break away from me, and was taken again, I carried him before the Justice, but we never could find what he did with the watch.</p>

               <p>I borrow'd the watch to seal a letter; I put it in my pocket in a hurry, and forgot to return it; I met with two or three men that made me in liquor, and they got me to pawn it for a guinea and half.</p>

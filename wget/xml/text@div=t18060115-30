               <p>Q. Do you live with your brother? - A. No, I carry on the business myself, I am a <rs id="t18060115-30-viclabel169" type="occupation">linen-draper</rs>

On the 18th of December, the prisoner came in the shop between the hours of one and two in the afternoon; he asked to look at some muslin for neck handkerchiefs, about ten or twelve shillings a-yard, I told him I had none so good as that, I would shew him the best I had; I shewed him one at four shillings, he told me that was not good enough, he must go elsewhere and get them; with that he left the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any more of him in the course of that day? - A. In the afternoon between six and seven o'clock he returned to the shop, and brought another with him who was lustier than himself, he then asked me to shew him to i same muslin he had seen in the morning; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180601150026"></xptr>reached a bundle of muslins which happened to be a bundle of worked muslins, I untied the string, I said this is not the right bundle; I was turning myself to reach the second bundle, I saw the prisoner go towards the end of my counter which is next to the window; the other young man was near me, to look at the muslin.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you on the counter at that time? - A. I had placed single pieces of cloth and lawn, and two table-cloths, which had stood in the window in the day, the two table-cloths I had placed one at one corner of the counter near the window, and the other at the other; as soon as I had taken the second bundle of muslins from the shelf, I saw the prisoner with his left hand draw the table cloth from off the counter, and with his right hand he shoved it into his bosom.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the table-cloth in his hand? - A. I saw him draw it from the window under the skirt of his coat, I cannot say I saw it in his hand, because I had hardly the glimpse of it, but I saw his hand draw it from the window, and I saw his right hand shove it into his bosom, as he drawed it; it appeared from under his coat; seeing what he had done, I threw down the second bundle of muslin, went round the counter, and set my back against the street door; I says to them gentlemen, you have more than belongs to you, I told them they had a table-cloth of mine, which had stood at the corner of the counter, I said it was there when they came in; the prisoner began swearing to me, I told him it was of no use to have words, and seeing a woman passing, I asked her to call the butcher in to my assistance; when I turned my back to let the butcher in, he chucked the table-cloth to the other side of the counter.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him do it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you only suppose that he chucked it there? - A. It was throwed over there by some means or other; my brother came in, he said go round and count the table-cloths; I had them in that morning, I had sold but one of them, I had nine sent in, and one I had sold, seven was on the shelf, and this one which the young man took, I found it doubled up in three creases on the floor; when I picked it up off the floor, the prisoner offered to purchase it of me ask what money I would for it; I told him I could not sell it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you had seen this table-cloth in the situation that you describe? - A. When I went to open the door to let them in I saw one of his side on the counter, and one of my side. There was no other customer in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look to see if it had sell there, it might have been thrown down? - A. It was impossible, because no one had been there but myself.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner was the table-cloth folded up as it lay on the counter? - A. It was folded up as it came from the maker, I had never opened them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it folded up in the same manner when you saw it down on the floor? - A. No, it was in three doubles; by his shoving it in his bosom.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of this table-cloth? - A. Five shillings.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examined by Mr. Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. I am sure you do not mean any thing wrong, you have told my lord you are positive that the prisoner chucked the table-cloth over the counter? - A. I am positive he must chuck it over.</p>
               <p>Q. That is argument, you did not see it done? - A. No.</p>

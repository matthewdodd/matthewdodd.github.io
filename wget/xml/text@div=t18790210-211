                  </hi>. I am clerk to John Cooper, of Bishopsgate—a short time since I advertised a bicycle for sale, and on 15th January last the prisoner called and asked to see it—I fancy I have seen him travelling on the line of railway I use—I showed it to him, and told him it was for sale only for cash—there were one or two others present, and he called me on one side and said, "I shall not take my money until the 25th February"—I replied, "I shall not part with the machine without the money," or words to that effect—he said, "I am living with my uncle, Mr. Wildsmith, of Leyton<lb></lb>stone, in whose employ I am"—I think he said he had 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month—I said, "I shall not let you have it"—he then said, "Mr. Charrington, the brewer, is my uncle, and Mr. Morgan, of Walthamstow, is a great friend of ours, and Mr. St. Alvins is a friend of mine"—a gentleman I well knew—" and Mr. Walker, of Snaresbrook—he seemed to laugh at me because I doubted him, and eventually he took the machine, which he was to bring back that night, or the 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I have not seen it since—he pawned it within an hour and a half.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. He did not say, "Mr. Morgan is my uncle"—I cannot recollect saying at the police-court, "I will not be sure whether you said Mr. Morgan was your uncle; you might have said he was a friend"—I believe the prisoner is not related to the Charringtons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. He said his uncle would not advance him the money for the bicycle if he did not see it—he took it between 5 and 6 o'clock.</p>

Frederick Wildsmith. I am a builder, of Leytonstone—the prisoner is my nephew—I am almost sure Mr. Charrington is not his uncle or Mr. Morgan—none of my sisters married a Charrington.</p>

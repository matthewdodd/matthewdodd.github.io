               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Would you have seen the handkerchief if he had not shown it to you? A. No; he said he had picked it up - it is a considerable thoroughfare there - the handkerchief had not hung out of my pocket, for I had lost one or two before, and I every now and then put my hand to my pocket when I am in crowded places; I don't take my coat-flaps up without I am in very great danger; I can't say when I had used my handkerchief - it is marked A.

I was going to Fish-street-hill to get some hair-pins for my mother at Hall and English's - I saw the handkerchief on the ground - I picked it up - I crossed and walked one hundred yards; the prosecutor then came and said, "I have a suspicion of your picking my pocket;" I said I had picked up the handkerchief, I had not picked his pocket.</p>

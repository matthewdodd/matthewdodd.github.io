               <p>Sharpe. At a cook's shop, in Great Wild-street. She asked my mistress to spare me that night, or the next night, and I should not stay long.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear her?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. Yes; I did. My mistress gave leave for me to go with her; this was in the evening, between six and seven. As I was going along, she said I should know what she wanted with me when I got home. When I got to her lodgings, she first gave me a glass of rum, afterwards she asked me to play at cards, and then Dowling came in.</p>
               <p>Q. What time had you been there, when he came in?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. About a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen Dowling before that time?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. Never. When he came in he kissed Cove, and gave her some money to go out for some beer: she went out, and then he took me into a back room.</p>
               <p>Q. What room was you in when you played at cards?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. One pair of stairs forward.</p>

               <p>Sharpe. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do when he took you into the back room?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. He threw me across the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. In the fore room, before the woman went out, did he kiss you, or do any thing?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. He pulled my stomacher out of my stays, and began feeling my breasts, before she went out.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might he keep handling your breasts before the woman went out?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. But a little while. I cried out.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. I said, Pray let me alone. He took me into the back room directly as she was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to you before he took you into the back room?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. He said, Come here; and dragged me.</p>
               <p>Q. What answer did you give him, when he said, Come here.</p>
               <p>Sharpe. None. He dragged me by my two hands, and laid me across the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cry out all this while?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. Yes; but I did not cry out so bad as when he hurt me with his private parts.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not married?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. No. Then the woman came in, as soon as he had got me on the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he put his private parts to you before the woman came in.</p>
               <p>Sharpe. No; not till after she held down my hands on each side.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. He clapped his hand upon my mouth: I could hardly fetch my breath.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do to you after they held you down so?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. He forced his private parts to me.</p>
               <p>Q. And what did he do then?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. I felt something hot and wet.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in your body?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. Yes; and I screamed out. I felt something hot and warm come from him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might he be about this?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. About half an hour.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177104100034"></xptr>Q. From the time that you swear the woman came in, and held down your hands, before he had completed this act?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. It was above half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay at this house?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. All night. They locked me up.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you go home to your mistress?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. In the morning; Mrs. Cove went home with me. I refused to have any supper. Mrs. Cove told my mistress, when she went home with me, that she was very sorry to keep me out all night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing of what had happened, to your mistress, before Mrs. Cove?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did she stay?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. She went away immediately; she did not stay.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened after she went away?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. My mistress said I had not been in bed all night. I told her every thing the same as I have said now. She searched me; I was black and blue between my thighs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that yourself?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you bloody?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. Yes; my shift was all greasy and bloody.</p>
               <p>Q. When were these people taken up? how long after?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. A warrant was applied for to Justice Fielding, on Tuesday night, the second of March.</p>
               <p>Q. That was Saturday. What day of the week was it upon?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. I can't justly say.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the warrant was applied for on Wednesday?</p>

               <p>Sharpe. I do not justly know; it is from Conduit-Court, in Long-Acre, to Wilde-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he had took your stomacher off before she went out; why did you let him do it?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. He took out my stomacher.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177104100035"></xptr>Q. Why did you let him?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. The woman helped him; she held me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you after that attempt to go out of the room with this woman?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. I wanted to go out; they said, Stay, stay.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that all the force used on you?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. No; the bed was most force.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you quiet after your stomacher was pulled out in that manner?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cry out?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. He put his hand on my mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before the woman went out for the beer?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. Both before and after.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the woman went out, and after he clapped his hand on your mouth?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. Yes, both before and after; my stomacher came out very easy.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was no need of the woman's holding you?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. They would not let me cry out.</p>
               <p>Q. You was at liberty to call out when she went out for the beer?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. She went out directly.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not cry out much till he hurt you on the bed?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. Not till his private parts hurt me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cry out or not before you was on the bed?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. Yes, a little; but not so much.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his hand on your mouth or breast before he went into the bed-room.</p>
               <p>Sharpe. On my breast.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you think he would hurt you before he went into the bed-room?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. He said he would stab me; he bade me not cry out. On the bed he throttled me; he pinched me on my throat that I could hardly swallow a bit of meat.</p>
               <p>Q. So you have not been able to swallow since the second of March? what was the price you and your mother insisted on to make you satisfaction?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. I do not know any thing about it; I never asked any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you sat in the outward room in your shift?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not put on your cloaths?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. They were in the next room on the bed; I was afraid to go for my cloaths; I was afraid to go near the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Does nobody live in the house?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. I did not see any body.</p>
               <p>Q. You was in the other room, why did you not call out for assistance?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. I was afraid of my life; he had the key of the door; he locked the fore room door.</p>

               <p>Q. During the whole of this time did you eat no supper?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. I eat nothing; I sat down in a chair.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to undress yourself?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. They pulled off my cloaths.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not undress yourself?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What, did the man take off your stays?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. He broke the lace from my boddice; he pulled off all my cloaths.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, what conversation had you with Mrs. Cove, going to your mistress's?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. She said, she would make me a present of a silk gown and silk handkerchief, if I would not tell my mistress.</p>
               <p>Q. You was not sick in the night, and came to bed again?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you said, in the night he got out of bed again to you?</p>
               <p>Sharpe. Yes, but I would not go to bed.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. Had you seen her at your house before she fetched the girl at this time?</p>
               <p>Leonard. Once before she came with a bundle from her mother.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177104100036"></xptr>Q. What evening did she take her out?</p>
               <p>Leonard. On Monday night, the third or fourth of March, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say when she came to your house?</p>
               <p>Leonard. Sally went to the door to her; they spoke together in the passage; then both of them came in together; Cove asked me if I could spare her out a little to-night, or tomorrow night; I let her go that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you understand she was to come home that night?</p>
               <p>Leonard. Yes; she put up the shutters, and said, she would stay but a little while; that was all that passed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Cove say what she wanted the girl to go for?</p>
               <p>Leonard. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When did she come back?</p>
               <p>Leonard. Not till seven the next morning; then they returned together.</p>

             say?</p>
               <p>Leonard. She begged my pardon for keeping her all night; she said, they had been talking till it was too late to bring her home. She went away directly.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed then, after she was gone, between you and the girl?</p>
               <p>Leonard. She said, she could not get away; that she undressed herself to go to bed, or that she was undressed, and the candle was blown out. She said, she refused going to bed, and sat without her cloaths all night. At breakfast she complained of her throat being very bad: I asked her what was the matter with her throat; she said, by a man that was there, and that she had been very badly used.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that her expression?</p>
               <p>Leonard. Yes; she said she would not go to that place again if they would give her a lapful of guineas. She pulled up her coats, and shewed me a place in her thigh like the marks of nails, scratched, and quite black about the middle of her thighs. She said, she wished her mother knew how she had been used; I told her I would let her mother know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say first, of her own accord, she wished her mother knew how she had been used?</p>
               <p>Leonard. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine her body?</p>
               <p>Leonard. Not till I fetched her mother. I went that day; she could not come then; she came the next morning between eight and nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find her?</p>
               <p>Leonard. Badly used.</p>
               <p>Q. You must lay aside ceremony on this occasion; how did she appear?</p>
               <p>Leonard. Very much inflamed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she appear as if she had been used by a man?</p>
               <p>Leonard. Yes; her mother has her shift; I saw it over night.</p>
               <p>Q. She stripped herself the night before her mother came, how did she appear?</p>
               <p>Leonard. There were marks of blood and grease upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. How had this girl behaved herself in your service?</p>
               <p>Leonard. Very sober.</p>
               <p>Q. You had work enough for her with your five children, was she busy and industrious?</p>
               <p>Leonard. Yes; a very handy girl.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she or not discover any light turn of disposition in her behaviour?</p>
               <p>Leonard. No, not at all.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. When she came home I suppose you rather rebuked her for being out all night?</p>
               <p>Leonard. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she tell you then?</p>
               <p>Leonard. She said she undressed herself to go to bed. She did not care at first to tell me, but she told me afterwards. They had promissed to give her a new gown not to tell her mother or me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say afterwards?</p>
               <p>Leonard. She said the candle was out, and she sat up all night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you why she staid out till bed time?</p>
               <p>Leonard. No; she said she set up without her cloaths all night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say why she did that?</p>
               <p>Leonard. She said she did not care to go to bed with a man and woman.</p>
               <p>Q. And she complained she was locked in?</p>
               <p>Leonard. Yes; she did afterwards. I asked her why she did not find her clothes; and if she was in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you ask her if she was in liquor<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177104100037"></xptr> if she did not use to drink? Had she sat up all night before?</p>
               <p>Leonard. She sat up late that night to attend the children.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you ask if she was sober, or drunk, that she could not find her clothes?</p>
               <p>Leonard. Because I thought it very odd not to find her clothes. She said Mr. Cove could not find her tinder box; she had got a cold?</p>
               <p>Q. How long did her cold continue?</p>
               <p>Leonard. A good while.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before she began the story of her ill usage?</p>
               <p>Leonard. Some of it at breakfast; some sometime after. She said she would not tell the whole to any body but her mother.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray when did she pull off her clothes?</p>
               <p>Leonard. At eleven o'clock at night, to go to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in the room with her?</p>
               <p>Leonard. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You told that story?</p>
               <p>Leonard. No; she told the story at twelve o'clock at noon.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you examine her?</p>
               <p>Leonard. Between ten and eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she appear quite sober at that time?</p>
               <p>Leonard. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you known much of it since?</p>
               <p>Leonard. No; she went home to her mother.</p>

She said her mistress asked where she was to go to; she said her family was gone from home, and she wanted her to keep her company: that her mistress gave her leave; and she went. She said that Dowling -</p>
               <p>Q. Did she mention his name?</p>
               <p>Molineux. She told me the story: that she brought her to her room, and bid her sit down; that she gave her a glass of rum, or brandy; rum I think; that she looked round the room, and Mrs. Cove asked what was the matter with her; she said, Mrs. Cove, this is not such a house as you used to have when my mother nursed you: she said, Never mind that; and then Dowling came in; she got up, begged his pardon, and was going away; (she did not know any thing of the gentleman ) he said, No, no; stay, my dear, you must not go away: that he pulled her stomacher out of her stays, and then afterwards abused her; and that Cove held her hands the while. Her throat was very much swelled and fore: the inside of the thick part of her thigh was scratched with nails; it was black and red.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine her private parts?</p>

               <p>Molineux. Very sore and red; her mistress and I examined them together.</p>

               <p>Molineux. Yes; her linen was in a filthy, bloody condition, and greasy with grease that he put upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. How old is your daughter?</p>

             standing by the fire along with this woman. There was a remnant of a pint of beer standing upon the table; I sent for another myself. I did not think, by the girl's behaviour, that she was sober; she begged to stay there all night: I consented to let her stay, and she did, all night, in my apartments. She said she would not stay to serve such a b - h of a mistress, for a beggarly shilling a week, to keep her up all night and day. She got up four different times in the night, and was sick. She puked all over the room, fell down, rolled in it about the room, and got into bed, four different times, of her own accord. I made many words, and would have got up to go away, the stench was so offensive, but could not tell where to go to sleep the remnant of the morning. She went away about seven o'clock in the morning. Her father came to me, in Newgate, last Monday, and told me his wife was a very honest woman, but a very covetous one: he said; he did not imagine I had got any money, because I was in gaol; but if I would get a friend to raise a little money, he would stop all the prosecution. I told him I had none; he asked me if I would give a bond: I said I would not. His answer was, if I did it would be of no utility, because I was in gaol: but, if I would send a friend to meet him that night, and lay down a trifle, he would stop all prosecution. I sent a friend to him last Monday night: he came to me again last Thursday; he claimed a bond, and five guineas down. I told Mr. Gore (the gentleman that came to me last Thursday) that I had no money, and he gave me sixpence he is here. I did not meddle with her.</p>

               <p>The girl was with me. She swore she would not go home to work for a b - ch of a mistress for a shilling a week; and she said that one of her master's lodgers had laid with her. Mr. Dowling never laid with her.</p>

            . I live in Blackman street, Clare market. I am a peruke maker. On Thursday, between twelve and one, I came here to look at the list where the prisoners names are; I could not find the name of Dowling. I came from the place about a yard or two, and stood by a man that I found afterwards to be the girl's father in law, Molineux. H e was quite a stranger to me. I asked him if he could inform me whether Mr. Dowling's trial was over; he said it was not. He asked me if I knew Mr. Dowling; I said I had been acquainted with him five or six years, and was sorry for his present situation. He replied, that if he had made any proposal that was clever and genteel it would never have come to what it is now; but that there was a man called on him, and had offered him two guineas; but that his answer was that that would not do; it would not pay the expences he had been at; and that he farther offered to be bound, in a bond with Dowling, as far as twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you, prisoner, wish to have this evidence given. This is evidence, as this man gives it, that you had sent a man to compromise this matter, and had offered to be bound with you, so far as twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>Gore. He said, I should be willing to make it up. He said he would ease it, rather than take life away. I asked upon what terms; he said, if Dowling would give five guineas, and a bond for fifteen more, payable at six shillings a week, he would make it up. I went to the prisoner, and told him; he said he had not got a farthing in the world to help himself. Molineux then said he must proceed.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen Molineux since?</p>
               <p>Gore. Once or twice.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been at his house?</p>
               <p>Gore. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177104100039"></xptr>Q. How do you know it is Molineux?</p>
               <p>Gore. Molineux is here in court.</p>
               <p>(Molineux comes forward, and is sworn.)</p>
               <p>Court. Look at Gore; have you seen him before?</p>
               <p>Molineux. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any discourse with him about making up this prosecution?</p>
               <p>Molineux. I said, I do not know: he said, if it could be done between me and my wife, it would be better. I said, I am not her father, only her father-in-law; she must do as she pleases; I had no notion of doing it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Gore come up to you and speak first?</p>
               <p>Molineux. Yes; I never saw him till he was at the lift.</p>
               <p>Court. This evidence is not material; here is the father-in-law of the girl; the jury will judge of Mrs. Leonard's evidence, and suppose this father-in-law was, upon an overture of the prisoner, inclined to take a sum of money; is that to stifle such a prosecution as this, or to contaminate the other evidence, and sought out by their own witness, appears to a demonstration.</p>

Dowling came in about a quarter before nine, to the best of my knowledge; I let him in; when he came in, he passed by me up stairs; I did not go into the room any more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any disturbance? Or, if there had been a girl screaming there for half an hour, should not you have heard it?</p>
               <p>Riley. Yes; the rooms are very small, and the wainscots thin. I was up and down the stairs several times to let my lodgers in, and see the doors were fast. I was up stairs, and came down to let them in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any intimation from any person that they had heard any noise that night?</p>

               <p>Riley. There are three rooms upon the floor Mr. Dowling lives in; they all join to the stairs.</p>

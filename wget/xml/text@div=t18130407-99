            . On the 9th of January, me, Brown, Amos, and Merritt, met at the Coach and Horses, in Carnaby-street, kept by Mrs. Parkinson. I lodged there. We met about eleven o'clock in the morning the first time. Amos, asked Brown whether he had any picklock keys to unlock Mr. Smith's door, in Green's-court; he had been there twice before to look at this apartment. Brown said, he had; he would bring them in the evening. Brown went out of the house, and went to Paddington. We appointed to meet at five o'clock in the evening, at the same public-house. We met about six o'clock. About twenty minutes after eight we all went to Green's-court, to the house of Mr. Smith. We lifted up the latch; we proceeded into the passage; Brown opened the parlour door in about two minutes with two picklock keys. We all went into the room; me and Brown went in first. Brown brought out the sheets, and I brought out the bed, and gave them to Amos. I went in again to fetch the bolsters and pillows. I brought them out, and gave them to Merritt, and he went away with them. Merritt had the blankets and all. When we had taken these things, Brown told them to go to Saunders's, in Dudley-court, Crown-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Saunders - A. He keeps a chandler's shop there. He is absconded. We went to Saunders. Saunders refused to purchase them. He told us to go to Mr. Whitfield, and he would buy them.</p>
               <p>Q. Whitfield is the gentleman that is indicted for the receiver - A. Yes, he is a farrier; he lived in Crown-street; he is gone off too. We took them into Whitefield's yard, and opened them. Brown asked two pound for them; he said he would not give two pound, he would only give twenty-three shillings; he paid with a pound note and two eighteen-penny pieces. He paid me and Brown at the door. We then went to the Cart and Horse public-house, St. Giles's, and had a pot of beer. From there we went to the Coach and Horses, in Carnaby-street. We all four went back there, and Merritt slept with me all night in the same bed. We changed the one pound note with Mrs. Parkinson, and divided the money. We sat up till one o'clock there.</p>

               <p>MRS. PARKINSON. My husband keeps the Coach and Horses, in Carnaby-market. The last witness was a lodger of mine.

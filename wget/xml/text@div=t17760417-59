               <p>I am a patrol of St. Martin's: I am one of the persons that went up stairs with the deceased; when we went into the house, I saw one of the patrols lying on one side bleeding; Grimsley took a candle and ran up stairs, Atkinson followed him, and I followed Atkinson: Grimsley said, d - n your eyes, lay the ax out of your hand; there was a blow made at him, I warded it off and then I fell down stairs; Grimsley was brought down wounded very much: we secured them all, I believe; there were some in the garret, and Sherry and another man were in bed with a woman; Nihill was sitting at a window; I went to him and told him he must go with us; Sherry and Dempsey were very bloody, and there was some blood upon Nihill's neck; the ax, and poker and tongs were found in the two pair of stairs room, I think; I was in the room when they were found; they were all bloody; I took them into my possession.</p>

               <p>I am a surgeon at St. George's hospital: the deceased was brought there under my care; I was called up on Monday morning at two o'clock; I saw a patrol lying on a table senseless; I found two large cuts on one side of his head; and a bruise; on the first cut I perceived a fracture, with the other wound the skull was made bare; I did nothing to him that night, the surgeons were not there; in the morning finding the fracture he was trepann'd; the cuts appeared to have been given by a sharp instrument; they might be naturally made by such an instrument as the ax produced: he lived about ten days and then died; I apprehend the wound which he had received was the cause of his death; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177604170043"></xptr> opened his head after his death, and it corroborated that opinion.</p>
               <p>To BAINE. When you came first into the room, which man had the ax? - Dempsey; I took it from Dempsey myself; I cannot tell who took it from me; I held it out for the watchman to take it out of my hand, but could not speak to him.</p>

               <p>As I am not provided with counsel, I beg, my lord, you will take my cause in hand; I am a surgeon: on the 10th of March I went to Mr. Milward's to attend Welch, who was not well; I asked whether he was at home; I was introduced into the back room where he and several of his shopmates were sitting; they knew me, and asked me to sit down and partake of the liquor they were drinking; I was in the room about an hour and a quarter; Welch withdrew from the room and went into the tap-room, and met with a soldier, with whom he tossed up for a shilling's worth of liquor; a quarrel ensued and the soldier had one of his eyes cut; I came into the tap-room to see what was the matter; I saw the soldier; there was nothing in the house to apply to his eye but a little brandy and water; I asked Mrs. Milward to let me have a little brandy and water in a saucer, and I went and bathed his eye; I then asked for something to bind his eye; she said she had nothing but a handkerchief, which he should have if he would leave the value of it; I bound his eye with the handkerchief; the liquor was then brought that they were tossing up for; they begged I would have a glass of that liquor; while I was drinking it the two coachmen came in and the quarrel began before I could wash my hands; if I had any blood on my stock it must come through dressing his eye; on seeing the quarrel begin, I immediately withdrew into the garret, and staid there till the quarrel was over, left I should be counted a quarrelsome man; and when the watchmen came I submitted without making any resistance.</p>
               <p>The prisoners called twelve witnesses, who gave them a good character.</p>

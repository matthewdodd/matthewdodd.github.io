             sworn. I am a shoemaker. On Tuesday morning, the 23d of September, about seven o'clock, a person knocked at the door, I was not up, my wife answered the door, Mrs. Pointer walked in with a bundle in her apron, she asked me to be so kind as to let her leave the bundle there a few minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your house. - A. No. 15, York street, Westminster, she said there was a dispute between her landlord and the landlord's landlord, her landlord owed a twelvemonths rent; I gave her leave to leave them there a few minutes, as I knew the woman; in about a couple of hours afterwards I heard that Pointer had robbed a soldier of a bundle, I employed an officer to bring Mrs. Pointer to my place, to take the bundle away; when she came I asked her what she brought that bundle there for, she said it belonged to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that bundle afterwards delivered to Renny and Gillmore. - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. I am a shoemaker, I live at No. 68, York-street. On Monday, the 22nd of September, about five o'clock in the afternon, Mrs. Pointer brought a bundle into my room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she lodge in your house. - A. Yes, and her husband lived with her, she asked me if I would take care of this bundle for her, I told her I would.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the husband afterwards. - A. No, I heard him go into his own room about three quarters of an hour before the bundle was brought into my room.</p>
               <p>Q. What regiment is the prisoner in. - A. The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180610290049"></xptr>Coldstream guards. She gave me strict charge not to let any one have it, come who would, but herself; I suspected from her own words that the bundle was not her own, I gave the bundle back again to her; the next morning I saw the bundle afterwards, I believe it was the same bundle that Mrs. Pointer left with me; when I was telling my landlord of it at the lower part of the house where the lodgers fetch their water from, I put my hand in between the ceiling and the floor, and I took out a brush, the prosecutor said it was his. The prisoner Pointer, and every lodger in the house, had the use of that kitchen.</p>

             sworn. I am the landlord of the White Horse. On the 22nd of September, the prosecutor came into my house to ask for lodgings, it was between three and four in the afternoon, I saw him bring the bundle in and lay it down on the bench in the tap room; directly after that the prisoner came in with two of his comrades, he sat close to where the bundle was, and he and his comrades drank to the amount of three pots of beer, and then they went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Before they went away, had Theodore left the room. - A. Yes, he had left it a great while, he went to the cook's shop to get his dinner, with nine recruits; I saw him leave the bundle behind him when he went to dinner, but I did not see the prisoner take the bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. What hour of the day did Pointer leave the room. - A.About five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Pointer's wife come into the tap-room while he was there. - A. No, I had not seen her all the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Theodore's bundle before he found it out the next morning. - A. No, about eight o'clock he missed the bundle; then I had a strong suspicion that it was Pointer that took the bundle. I sent for two officers from Queen square, and the prosecutor and the officers, together with myself, went to the house where the prisoner lived, and there the brush was found, as has been described while I was there.</p>

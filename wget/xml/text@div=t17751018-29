I was alarmed about six with an account of the house being broke open. I had heard something of a noise about one, but it was a rainy and windy night; I did not therefore much attend to it: I got up about six, and found the cellar window which opens into the street had been forced. A board had been wrenched off that admitted a passage for a hand to unfasten the bolt, and the chain that fastened it on the outside; so that the bolt being wrenched off, it was practicable to get the cellar window open: it was open, and the door of the cellar which opens up into the tap-room was forced likewise; the lock hung by a single nail, and there was a hole bored into the door, so that a hand could be admitted there likewise to undo the bolt which was upon the inside. In this manner, I suppose, the thieves got into the house; that room door was not locked when I went to bed. In the tap-room there were plain marks of the thieves having been there; the till lock was forced, and a quantity of halfpence taken out of the till; there were about twenty-five or thirty shillings worth of halfpence and farthings, and the linen was taken out of the bar, and the snuff-box off a shelf in the bar. The prisoner was a neighbour's son. I heard by his father such an account as occasioned my charging him with this fact. I got this information upon the Sunday following.</p>

The last witness is my sister: we went to bed about the time mentioned<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177510180028"></xptr> by my sister; I fastened the cellar door; I was alarmed soon after five o'clock. I ran down and saw some splinters and chips at the bar door; the bar was broke open, and I found the cellar window which I fastened before I went to bed was likewise broke: a board was wrenched up, and the cellar window was open: the bolt of the door which is in the taproom was unbolted, and the door open.</p>

            . I happened to be up very early upon Saturday the 16th. As I was going by a house in Wentworth-street, I heard of one Brown and the prisoner Clarke having brought some things into that house at a very late hour; I watched there, intending to apprehend them; I saw Brown come down, and let two men in, and go up stairs again; I followed them gently; I overheard Brown say to the two men, they had got some things; the two men looked at them, and said, they would not do for them; upon which, I burst into the room, and said, they will do for me, and I seized Clarke with one hand, and Brown with the other; there was a scuffle, and they threatened me very much, calling to one another to cut away, and they got me down, and were struggling with me in order to get the better of me; I disengaged myself; Brown ran away, and I secured Clarke; in the room I found two cardinals, two handkerchiefs, three chequed aprons, a muslin apron, and two shifts. In Clerk's coat pocket I found a white apron, and afterwards, when I had taken him to the Coach and Horses, I found a bag of half-pence in his pocket, among which is a remarkable farthing.</p>

               <p>Hebber worth. I can swear I put that farthing in the till over night.</p>
               <p>The prisoner's sister. My brother, the prisoner, gave me that snuff-box in New-prison after he was in custody.</p>
               <p>All the things except the half pence were produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutrix.</p>

               <p>I came into that house only to sleep there; the things must have been brought in whilst I was asleep. Whether Brown committed the robbery, or who, I don't know; Brown gave me the things that were found upon me; he desired me to take the halfpence for him: I did not know how he got them.</p>

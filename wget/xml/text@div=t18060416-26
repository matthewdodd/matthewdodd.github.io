               <p>Q. Did you see the person of the prisoner before you received the blow from him, so as to be certain that it is the same man. - A. I saw the prisoner as soon as he attempted to strike me, not before; the tall man who had been talking to me before struck me another blow on the breast, I fell to the ground, the prisoner struck me again, before I could recover to get up, he likewise kicked and stamped upon me; he said I was a bl - y fo - e, my hat came off, the prisoner gave it a kick from me; the other two men took it up hastily.</p>
               <p>Q. There were two others besides. - A. I think there was six, but five I saw; a short man came up and said you are a bl - y f - e, the prisoner had said so before; aye, aye, says the prisoner, we'll do his business for him; he then rushed his hand into my pocket, while with his other hand he had hold of my handkerchief in order to choak me, by drawing my neck handkerchief very tight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take anything from you at all. - A. No, I had nothing in my pocket:</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a watch. - A. Yes, the tall one put his hand in my breeches pocket, they attempted to get my watch; I had the chain concealed in the inside, they could not get at it; I usually carry it in that manner. The short one said, do you want anything to do his business, we will rip the bl - y f - e open; the short one put his hand to his pocket and drawed his knife, held it to my head, offering it to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he hold it for, did he demand any property. - A. In order to do some execution with it, he struck at me in order to stab me, but I struck his hand away, I struggled, I got up, and shrieked out Murder as loud as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you understand by what they did, that they wanted to stab you. - A. The expression used was, Cut him open, we will cut his t - st - s off, and make him an entire figure. When I shrieked out murder, two gentlemen came from Broker-row; the prisoner attempted to strike me again, I took hold of him by the collar, and never loosed him; he was conducted to the watchhouse by the assistance of these gentlemen; the other men all ran away when they came up.</p>
               <p>Q. Are either of these two gentlemen here. - A. No, the watchhouse was rather in a confused state, because the watchmen were coming to their evening duty.</p>
               <p>Q. That does not explain to me why you did not learn these two gentlemen's names. - A. When he was taken into the watchhouse the door was put to immediately, I could not utter a word for five minutes, when they opened the door, which was full ten minutes, the gentlemen were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the watchman here. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the hat carried away. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you saw two little ones, and they carried it off, and they then returned afterwards in order to cut your throat. - A. The short one returned, that was the time that he drawed his knife.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they want to cut your throat for, what was there to hinder them, there was six of them about you, do you apprehend that they wanted to kill you; what could they want to kill you for, you had nothing about your person. - A. I cannot say, I prevented being cut by striking his arm off.</p>
               <p>Q. What way of life are you in. - A. I am a <rs id="t18060416-26-viclabel145" type="occupation">shoemaker</rs>

               <p>Q. What chapel is this that you had been attending. - A. The chapel in Grub-street is a dissenting chapel, a Calvinist dissenter, a very fine man, attends there, which was the occasion of my-going, I either go to Grub-street chapel or

               <p>Q. How came you not to have the watchman here. - A. The officer who took him in charge attended the three examinations at Worship-street, I called upon him to know whether he should attend the trial, he said he was not bound over, and without he had been bound over he should not attend.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley.</p>

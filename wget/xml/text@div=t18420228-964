                  </hi>. I live in Bell-street, Marylebone, and have shoe<lb></lb>maker's shop there. On a Saturday evening in February, I was in the parlour behind the shop, and saw the prisoner go from the door—I followed and saw a pair of shoes under his arm, which I knew were mine—he saw me coming, and threw them down in the street—I took them up—I took him and the shoes back—I gave him in charge—these are the shoes.</p>

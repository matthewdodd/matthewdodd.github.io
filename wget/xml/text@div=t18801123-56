                  </hi>. I am a letter-carrier, of 29, Middle Street, Burton Crescent—in October, 1875, I went to Sambrook Court, in consequence of seeing an advertisement, to a place with "Beaumont and Co." on the door—I saw the prisoner and his brother—they engaged me as office-boy—I was there about a month or six weeks—no business was done—another brother dame to see them every morning—they spent the time principally in singing and dancing—I never saw any customers come—some skins were brought in a truck by a man—a Mr. Cunningham called—I did not hear what passed—I heard the skins were going to Birmingham—they were taken away—I stalled with 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week salary, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week rise—the last week they did not turn up, and I never got it.</p>

I paid was half in cash and half goods—purses and cigar cases.</p>

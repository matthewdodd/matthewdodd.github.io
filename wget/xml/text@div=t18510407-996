                  </hi>. I am the daughter of James Moore, who keeps the Railway Tavern, Blackheath. I am eleven years old—about two months ago, about half-past five or six o'clock one evening, the prisoner and another woman were drinking at my father's, and the prisoner asked me for change for a half-sovereign—I told her I had not got it—she asked how much I had got, and I said, "5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—she said, "Give me the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and my boy will go for change"—she had a boy with her—I held out the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the one hand, and the other hand for the half-sovereign—I asked her about the half-sovereign, and she said, "All right"—she called the boy, but he did not come, and they then left—I told my father when he came home, and he sent some one after her, but did not find her—I met her a few day after, asked her about it, and she turned the conversation off, and asked how my father was—I said, "How about that 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.?"—she said she could not pay it till the middle of next month—she has never paid it.</p>

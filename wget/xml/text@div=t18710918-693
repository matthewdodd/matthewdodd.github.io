                  </hi>. I am single, and live, at 92, Lancaster Street, Newington Causeway—I am barmaid at Mr. Chandler's, in Suffolk Street, Borough—on 27th June last, about 12 o'clock in the day, I was in Blackman Street, and saw the prisoner—he was about two yards from me—he met me face to face, came at me, and snatched my chain, which was doubled twice round my neck, and dragged it, and with the force of dragging it he dragged me down, so that I fell—ing neck was very much injured, and my finger put out of joint—the chain broke, and the prisoner ran up Dodson's Court with it, and a gold watch at the end of it—a locket that was attached to the chain fell off, and that was picked up afterwards—I called fur assistance, and a police-constable came up—I went to the station and gave a description of the prisoner—I am positive he is the person, I can tell by his features—I did not see him again till seven weeks afterwards, when I went to recognize him—I saw him with seven or eight more, and identified him.</p>

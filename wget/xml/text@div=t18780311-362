As this emanates from a genuine source, experience is not so essential as strict integrity. Only gentlemen with cash at immediate command need address Surveyor, Stoke Newington Road, London. "I went and saw the prisoner in the Strand, and inquired what business was carried on—he said it was not so much an agency as a public-house brokerage business—I told him I would think about it, and put it into the hands of my solicitor—I after<lb></lb>wards instructed Mr. Muzio, an accountant, to make an investigation—Mr. Muzio afterwards made a report to my solicitors, and I gave my solicitors instructions to pay a sum of money—on 24th July, 1877, a deed of partnership was entered into between me and the prisoner, and executed by both. (<hi rend="italic">This deed was dated</hi> 24<hi rend="italic">th July</hi>, 1877, <hi rend="italic">and acknowledged the receipt by the prisoner of</hi> 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">The 9th clause provided that neither party should directly or indirectly engage in any business except the business of the said partnership, and upon account there of</hi>) I found the business very poor—there were books, a cash-book, journal, ledger, call-book, and ordinary inventory books—I afterwards advanced 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more—we arranged to separate last January, and then my suspicions were first aroused by seeing this advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> by the prisoner—he bad told me he was going to advertise—(<hi rend="italic">This advertisement was similar to the other "address Surveyor, core of Alford and Arkell</hi>, 161, <hi rend="italic">Strand, London</hi>.") The date is the 28th January, 1878—I spoke to the prisoner and consulted my solicitor and applied for a warrant—I had a holiday after the deed was signed and went to business not later than September, 1877—the prisoner guaranteed 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—there were some profits, but they did not amount to that sum—I know the prisoner's writing—the endorsements on these cheques (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are his—I was induced to enter the partnership by my accountant's report on the business—this is the cash-book beginning in February, 1875—from 18th February 1875.</p>

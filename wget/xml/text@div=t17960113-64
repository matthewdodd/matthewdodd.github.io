               <p>Q. Are you sure you did not let her have them to carry home beer in? - A. I am.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am a poor woman, with four children, and their father at sea; I keep a barrow, and sell fruit, and I sometimes used to get a pennyworth of beer; sometimes I have not been there, when the boy came round for the pots, and, having my fruit in the street, I had not any body to wait with the fruit; his wife asked me, if I had any pots; I told her, I had, and that I had only forgot them in the morning, with my three little children, striving to get a breakfast for them; in the hurry of going out in a morning I forgot to take them home; I had some friends here all day, but they did not expect the trial to come on, and are gone home; I never was in gaol in my life before; but strove to get a bit of bread for my children; if I had meant to make away with them, I should not have kept them all that length of time.</p>

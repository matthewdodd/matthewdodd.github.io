                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs. Browning's, of St. John-street. On the morning of 30th Aug., I was watching in their yard for another purpose—I saw the prisoner carry a can of oil, and place it by the side of a wagon, near the centre of the yard—there was a cart which stood partly before it, and partly covered it from view—he left it there, and returned in about half an hour and took it into the turpentine warehouse—about an hour afterwards I saw the can in the turpentine warehouse—it was the only can of oil that was there—I believe it to be the same can that I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner bring into the yard—it had no business there—I spoke to Mr. Brown<lb></lb>ing about it—it turned out to be olive oil, which is never taken but by an order from Mr. William Browning—the olive oil is kept in the new warehouse—the prisoner was coming in a direction from that warehouse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of James Browning and others. My attention was called to the can of oil by Huggins, on 30th Aug., between ten and eleven o'clock—it was a can of olive oil, containing six gallons, and worth about 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the olive oil is kept in casks, in the new warehouse, and is never drawn out but by my orders—I did not give the prisoner orders to draw this—a can of oil had no right to be in the turpentine warehouse—I gave the prisoner into custody—he told the officer he wished to make a statement—the officer told him if he had any statement, he had better make it to his master—he said to me, "I have been trapped into this; there are others in it besides me"—I believe the can of oil was then in the counting-house, where this conversation took place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is the door of the turpentine warehouse kept locked? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and the key hangs by the side—to the best of my recollection, it was locked at that time—the prisoner was a porter—our warehouseman, who has the general superintendence, gave him orders—other men work under him, but they have no right to give orders—I think when I first spoke to the prisoner, I said, "Manley, we want you"—he did not say he had been told by one of the men to take the can from one place to the other—no one take olive oil without an order from me.</p>

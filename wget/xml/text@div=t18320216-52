The prisoner has been in his employ more than six vears - he worked in a shop at the back of our house; on the 18th of January he came, and asked me for a piece of gold to make six brooch borders, (I have been in the habit of supplying the workmen with gold for many years) - I gave him a box with several pieces of gold in it; he had a pair of dividers and a gauge with him - he took up several pieces of gold with his right hand, and passed them into his left; I then perceived three fingers of his left hand closed - I watched him, and saw him lay down a piece of gold on the gauge, which he said would do for his purpose; I still noticed that the fingers of his left hand were closed - he then took up the gauge with his right hand, put it into his left hand, and I heard it chink against something, which confirmed my suspicion: just as he was going out my husband came in - I said, "Run and see what he has got in his hand;" he went after him into the shop, and I heard a great many words - the prisoner took the piece of gold in his right hand, which he said would do for his purpose.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where were the dividers at the time? A. In his right hand - he was dividing the gold with them when he had laid the gauge down: there was a knock at the door while he was there - he said should he open it, and I said, "No, thank you," as I thought he would put the gold in his pocket; a lady came in - it is not the rule at the house if a person comes for the servants to go away; they often stop, and have what they want; I called my husband in to tea, after the words that passed in the work-shop; the prisoner then came in, and said he wished to have his wages settled - my husband said he could not settle them then, as he was in such a confused state, but he might call on the next day; he called the next day, and saw me - in the mean time my husband had been to his lodging; I did not see the prisoner again till he was at Hatton-garden - he was in general constantly employed, but sometimes only for four or five days in a week; he was never employed so little as three days till within about a month - he was a confidential man.</p>
               <p>THOMAS AUSENDER. On the 18th of January I went into my counting-house, between four and five o'clock; my wife told me to follow the prisoner to the shop, which I did - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183202160023"></xptr>went up to him, and said, "You have a piece of gold, have you not, Rapley?" he said Yes, and he hold up a piece of gold, which he had marked with the dividers, and said it would do for what he wanted, and in fact it was more than he wanted; I said, "You have more gold;" he said he had not - I said, "You have something in your left hand," which was doubled; he said, "Yes, the gauge;" and he held it out to me - I said, "You have a piece of gold in that hand;" he said he had not - I told him I would not stand any nonsense - I insisted upon seeing what was in his left hand; he then took the gauge out of his left hand, and from between the gauge and the palm of his hand he threw this piece of gold on the work-bench - this is it; I marked it - I called him a thieving villain, and said I suspected he had been robbing me for a long time; he said he had only one thing to blame himself for, and that was for denying that he had the gold in his hand, and he did not wonder at my suspecting he had stolen it - I desired him to leave my work-shop; I went for an officer, and went with him to the prisoner's house about two hours after he left me - he lodged in the attic; I went into the room on the left, and he was melting something in some charcoal, but I did not see the metal; I said, "I suppose you expected me?" he said, "Yes, I did, rather;" we went into the back room, and I found he had got a complete shop, a flatting-mill, and more tools than I have - there was some little talk between him and the officer, but I did not hear what the prisoner said; this is the piece of gold - there is about 2 dwts. of 18 carat gold - if I had known he had a shop of this description I would not have employed him; he surrendered at the office.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You went into the shop in consequence of what your wife told you? A. Yes; I did not see how his hands were when I followed him; the shop is about five yards from my house - I told him to go, and then he said he could not think of stopping; he came into my counting-house to ask for his wages - I said I was not in a state to talk to him about them then - he might call on me on the morrow, and I would settle; I saw an ingot of gold at his lodgings, in a box, about 8 ozs weight, and there were some cuttings, which I know came out of my work-shop, and there was some silver solder cut up in pannels: I said to the officer, "How the sight of the gold makes my heart ache, when I know that I have been robbed;" I did not desire the officer to take any thing else - we went away, and left him that night; I had decidedly expressed my opinion that some of the property was mine, but I have not had it taken - we sent for the prisoner the next day, but he was out; he came to the Police-office of his own accord - I have not sent his wages; I do not know what is due to him - his work is unfinished; he never had to ask me twice for his wages, though he has been with me nearly seven years.</p>

            . I am in the employ of the prosecutor. I was in the shop when he charged the prisoner with this; he asked what gold he had in his hand - he said,"This, Sir," but I did not see it as I was at work; Mr. Ausender then asked what he had in his other hand - he said the gauge; he then said, "Have you not got a bit of gold?" he said No - he said, "Open your hand," and I heard something fall on the board; I looked up, and saw a piece of gold in Mr. Ausender's hand - this is about the size of it; there was much altercation, and Mr. Ausender asked what excuse he could have for having it - he said he took it for a size; I suppose he meant to gauge the other by - the prosecutor said it looked very suspicious, having it in his hand, and denying it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you know what is due to the prisoner? A. No - he might earn 2l. a week, more or less; I consider him a very good workman; he had to make the borders for six brooches - I did not look up till I heard the gold fall.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he say he took the gold in part of any wages? A. No.</p>

            . I am in the prosecutors service. I was present when he came to the shop and asked the prisoner what he had in one of his hands; he held out his right hand, and said, "I have got this;" he said, "Have you got any more gold?" he said, No; he said, "What have you got in the other hand?" he said, "The gauge;" he said, "Have you no gold in that hand;" he said, No:" he said, "Open your hand and let me see;" - he opened his hand, and threw something out of it on the board - I saw a piece of gold taken up, something like this - this gauge would be quite sufficient to conceal a piece of gold of this size; I heard Mr. Ausender call him a thieving villain, and he asked him what he wanted with that piece of gold - he said at first, it was for a size and then he said if there was not enough in the large piece, to make up with that.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with Mr. Ausender to search the prisoners lodgings - the back room was like a shop - the prosecutor said, "How I have been robbed," the prisoner said - "I never robbed you before, this is the first time I took any thing."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did the prosecutor point to any particular articles which he could swear to? A. No, he said there was no one thing he could swear to, - I do not remember that Mr. Ausender made any reply when the prisoner said, "I never robbed you before" - he was looking over a box - it was not a large room - I did not take him into custody when he said that - I thought I should have done so, but Mr. Ausender did not wish me to do it - I certainly heard the word; I have been an officer thirty years - the prisoner showed us every thing about his premises - there was a piece of lighted charcoal, and he was at work, on a ring - I went to his house the next morning, but he was not at home, and he came down to the office.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was the gold and silver in the shop in shapeless masses? A. It seemed as if melted into masses, the prisoner was in his shirt sleeves - the piece of charcoal was all in a blaze, metal would have melted in it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that he had applied to the prosecutrix for gold for six brooches, but not being able to find a piece large enough for more than two, he told her so, when she replied that he had better take a piece more, and flat it - a lady then came in, and that he said to the prosecutrix,"These will do," upon which she replied, "Very well, take them;" upon the prosecutor's charging him with having two pieces of gold, he replied that he had so, but not more than sufficient to do his work, and the prosecutor being too violent to hear an explanation, he determined to leave - he positively denied having used the words attributed to him by the officer, and had voluntarily surrendered on hearing inquiries had been made for him.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183202160024"></xptr>MRS. AUSENDER. The prisoner did not state when he took the principal piece of gold, that it was the only piece of the right substance, but it would only do for two brooches; I am certain he only took one piece for his work - there were larger piece of gold there than he wanted.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

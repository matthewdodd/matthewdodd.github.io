               <p>ROBERT WILLIAMS. I live in Ironmonger-street, St. Luke. I met the prisoner on 11th of May, and went with her to a coffee-shop, and then to a public-house, in <placeName id="t18340515-143-crimeloc784">Milton-street</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. It was two o'clock in the morning when I met him, he was very tipsy - I was not much the worse for liquor - we had a good deal more to drink, and then he desired me to take care of his watch - we went to the public-house, and his witnesses came in there - one of them called on me in this prison on Friday, and told me that the prosecutor said he did not know but that he did give me his watch, and he thought he did - he said the prosecutor was at the prison door.</p>
               <p>Witness. I believe one of my witnesses did go to see her, and he came to me and said, that through having a little drink, she might have done it without knowledge - I am sensible I did not give it to her.</p>

            . I live in Elizabeth-court. I was in the Golden-boot, in Milton-street, when the prosecutor, the prisoner, and another woman, came in - I saw a pint of ale between them on the table, and I saw the prosecutor put his knee on the table, and the prisoner drew out his watch - I said to him, "That woman has taken your watch" - he made a snatch at it, and the chain broke - she then put the watch in her bosom - I was looking at her, but I cannot say that she saw me - the prosecutor was certainly intoxicated - the other woman who was with the prisoner was a motherly looking woman like herself - the prisoner said she had a claim on the prosecutor, and no man had a right to interfere between a man and his wife - she said she wanted some money of him, and he had been out all night.</p>

            . I was at the public-house that morning - I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor drinking together, seemingly in a very friendly way - the prisoner sat between me and the prosecutor - I saw her putting something into her breast, and two young men who were there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150084"></xptr>said he had lost his watch - I put my hand in her bosom, and took out the watch, and gave it to the landlord.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you come to me, and say that the prosecutor was very sorry, and he thought he might have given me the watch? A. No; I said, if I could do you any service I should be glad.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Was the prosecutor aware that you went to the prison? A. Yes, he went with me to tell her he would do all the justice to her he could - two or three of her friends in the neighbourhood have met me, and threatened to do me some injury - some women have told me if I went much further, the consequences would be very bad with me - I came to the gaol on Friday morning, and told the prisoner not to make any thing to do about me, nor to raise any false reports about me - the prisoner's associates knew me by seeing her going to the watch-house that morning and seeing me there - I did not hear the prosecutor say any thing about the prisoner keeping his watch for him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What friends of mine are they that have annoyed you? A. I do not know who they are - two or three have come to the court-door, and said, "I know you very well" - I said, "I have not come to do any harm, but public justice."</p>

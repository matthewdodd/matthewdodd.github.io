               <p>JOHN BURGE. On the 23d of July I was at the <placeName id="t18270913-193-crimeloc1091">Camel public-house, Kingsland-road</placeName>

The prisoner had been there, but was gone - he returned in about a quarter of an hour, and was told what had taken place; he came to me, and said, "I beg your pardon - I know where your handkerchief is, and if you will go with me you shall have it;" we went to a stall in Huntingdon-street, just by - he asked Archer's wife for the handkerchief which he had left there; she said her husband was gone out, and had got it with him; he then said to me,"It is all right - you shall have your handkerchief;" I said,"When I get the handkerchief I shall say it is all right - but you must go back with me;" Constantine came, and took him, and as we were going to the office we met Archer, running with the handkerchief. My jacket had been off a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes - I do not know whether it was taken while my jacket was on or not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. J. ALLEY. Were not many persons about? A. Yes, and many coats and hats were off- it might have been put into the prisoner's hat. When I first missed it I offered half-a-gallon of beer to any one who would give it me, if they had done it for a joke. The prisoner told me he knew where the handkerchief was, but the officer had then been sent for.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he know the officer had been sent for? A. Yes - I told him myself, when he returned, but at the time the officer was sent for he was not there. When Archer came, he said he had brought the handkerchief, which the prisoner had left with him, and told him he would call again presently; neither Archer nor his wife said he left it with them to find the owner - he said he did it for want - he had had no work for a long time.</p>

            . The prisoner put this handkerchief into a little basket under my stall, and said he would call for it presently. As soon I heard what had happened I went and took it down to Constantine.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that he had put his hat on the ground while he played at skittles, and after putting it on again he found a handkerchief in it, which he left with Archer, to take care of while he went to inquire who had lost one. He received an excellent character.</p>

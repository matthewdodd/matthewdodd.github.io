On Saturday, the 20th of August, about a quarter past five o'clock, I was sitting in the counting-house - there was one young man left to attend the warehouse, while the rest were at tea; he came to the counting-house to speak to me, and while he was there, I saw a man enter the warehouse, and take eight cloth jackets, which I had just laid out with forty-four others - he made off with them - they cost us 1 l. each. I saw four of them again at the Mansion-house on the Monday following.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw the prisoner on the 20th of August, about five or six o'clock in the evening, with another person, about three minutes walk from Mr. Early's shop. The prisoner had these four jackets tied up in a handkerchief - his companion got away. I asked the prisoner what he had got - he said some jackets, which were his property, and he had brought them from some vessel, which he named. I afterwards heard that Mr. Early had lost them.</p>

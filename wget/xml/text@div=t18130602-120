I kept my clothes in a box there on the landing-lane; I kept the key of it; it was locked. The two prisoners lodged there six nights; they are soldiers in the London Militia. On the 25th of May I put my things in the box. I locked my box, and put the key in my pocket, and on the 26th I went to my box; my box was broken open, and all the things in the indictment were gone, and several more articles.

               <p>PETER CLELAND. I am a constable. I searched the room the prisoners lodged in; I found a pair of lacers, and on moving the bedstead from the wall I found this bundle in this handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. That bundle is part of my things that I put in my box; that is part of my gown; the other things are trifling things. The handkerchief is mine.</p>
               <p>Elland. I applied the pincers to the box that had been forced; it talked to the marks where the box had been wrenched.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BENTLEY. I am a lodger in the house where the robbery was committed. On Wednesday evening I saw the constable search the prisoners room. I have seen the prisoners go in and come out of that room, and Mr. Aldred said he let the prisoners that room.</p>
               <p>Garrett's Defence. On Wednesday afternoon, as I came down with the bundle, the prosecutrix and the landlord stood in the bar; I had four leaves of bread in my haversack; I said it was of no use to keep them till they were mouldy. I took them to Bunhill-row, and sold them for seven pence a-piece.</p>
               <p>Hatfield's Defence. At the watchhouse the landlord said he did not think I was guilty.</p>

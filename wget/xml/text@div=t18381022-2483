                  </hi>. I live in Uxbridge-street, New Kent-road, and am an unfortunate female. On the 2nd of October, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my house—he had some porter to drink—he was in the front parlour at first—he remained there a few minutes, and then went up stairs—I went with him—we remained together up stairs for half an hour, and both came down together—he remained about an hour and a half after coming down—he asked for some bread and cheese—I placed the two knives, and bread and cheese on the table, and one pot more of porter was sent for—just as he was going away, Mary Ann Payne came in—he took his watch out of his pocket, and said, "I ought to have been home by ten o'clock"—he got up, put his coat on, and made his way to the door—I said, "Stop, you have not paid me, Sir"—he said, "I have no money"—I said, "yes, you have, I saw gold and silver when you gave me the sixpence for a pot of porter, in a leather bag"—he <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> me away from the door, and gave me several blows, but I did not notice it—he had been to my house two or three times before—after that he would insist on going out—I said, "No, you shall not go till you have paid me"—he was to have paid me half-a-crown, and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the bread and cheese, made it 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—he turned his head round, snatched a knife from the table, and made a stab at me towards my face, to save my face, I put up my hand, and it went right through my hand—the force of the knife knocked me back wards into the chair, and I bled very much, and became quite insensible—Payne</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Payne. I was at Tee's house on the 2nd of October, at ten o'clock, and saw the prisoner there—when I went into the room they were wrangling very much—I remained there half an hour—the prisoner was having bread and cheese and porter when I went in—I saw him get up to go out, and my sister, the prosecu<lb></lb>trix, said, "No, Sir, you are not going out till you give me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. "—he said he had no money—she said, "Yes, you have silver, and gold, and half-pence"—he knocked her down three times into the chair against the door—he went and sat down in his chair again for a minute or two, and then got up in a violent passion, caught a knife off the table, and stabbed at her momentarily—she put her hand up to save her face—he pointed the knife at her face—it went through her left hand—I screamed out, "Mur<lb></lb>der"—my husband burst the door open, and saw him coming at her again with the open knife—he knocked the knife out of his hand, secured him, and held him in the corner—I picked the knife up and put it on the table—I attended to my sister—she was not sensible—a policeman came in, and the prisoner was taken to the station-house—I went with my sister to the hospital and saw her into bed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. It is not true—this is the very person who struck me. Wit<lb></lb>ness. My sister sat in a chair by the door to prevent his going—she did not take hold of him at all—the table was about two yards and a half from the door—my sister did nothing to stop him but sit in her chair by the door—she was sitting there while he had his bread and cheese—she never struck him—she pushed him from the door—I did not strike him—I never got out of my chair, till I saw the knife taken from the table—my sister pushed him four or five times to keep him from the door, but not so as to hurt him—she merely kept him from the door.</p>

I am the husband of the last witness—I was in the house on the night in question, and heard a hustling in the room—I was in the back part of the house—all was then silent, and in about ten minutes I heard the cry of "Murder," from my wife, and my sister-in-law said she was stabbed—I made to the apartment, forced the door open, and saw the prisoner with the knife in his hand, apparently going to make another stab, I knocked the knife out of his hand and cut my own hand with it—I secured him until Newbury, the officer, came, and then gave him to him.</p>

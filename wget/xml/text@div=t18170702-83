            . I live in Cock-court, New-street, Golden-square. On the 1st of June, about half-past twelve o'clock at night. I was going to see a young woman in St. James's-street. When I was at the corner of Silver-street, I asked the watchman the way - He directed me into Swallow-street; the prisoner was listening to what I said on the other side of the way, with four others, it was moonlight. I went towards Swallow-street - all five followed me till I came to the <placeName id="t18170702-83-crimeloc474">corner of Vigo-lane</placeName>

The prisoner said, "hand over your money." There were four 1l. notes 10s. in silver in my pockets. They immediately left me and went down Swallow-street, towards Piccadilly. I went along Sackville-street, and as soon as I met the watchman I told him. I cried out when they first went away, but there was no person near me-the watchman went after them with me. As I was going into St. James's-street, and was telling the watchman of it, I saw the prisoner standing by a hackney-coach in Piccadilly, and gave him in charge - He did not run away; he stopped till the watchman came up and took him-nothing was found on him. I am positively certain that he is the man.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What are you - A. An unfortunate girl. I was not intoxicated. I had received the four 1l. notes that night of a gentleman.</p>

            . I am a watchman; my beat is in Sackville-street - I go to the very bottom of the street. I met the prosecutrix about one o'clock in the morning of the 1st of July. I saw about four or five men at the corner of Vigo-lane; they went down Swallow-street. She called to me, and said she had been robbed by the five men; I did not go after them. She kept walking with me till we got to the bottom of Sackville-street, I stood there, and saw four or five men following her again; they appeared to be the same men-it was about five minutes after I had got to the bottom of the street. I followed behind them, and was about ten yards off - She was about four yards before them; they came up to her again. One of them, with a blue coat, demanded some money of her for shewing her the way to St. James's-street. I got up to them; she said she had none, for they had robbed her of all she had; she accused them of taking it, and turned round to me and said</p>
               <p>"here is one of the men."</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You saw five of them - A. The four separated from her.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not seize them immediately - A. She did not give them in charge-she told me to take a man by the coaches, he stood on the pavement. I laid hold of him - He acknowledged he was one of those that had spoken to her.</p>
               <p>Q. You know there is a 40l. reward - A. Yes; I never spoke to her about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. She asked me the way to St. James's-street, and gave me in charge.</p>

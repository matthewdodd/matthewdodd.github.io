               <p>- WYBER sworn. - I am a stageman, and keep the Kentish-town stages: I had two horses in my possession which Cooper said were his, I bought them of a man of the name of Martin, who brought them to Mr. Hall's stable at the Assembly-house, at Kentish-town, my stables adjoin them; it was on the 17th of December; I had known Martin a twelvemonth, he has been in the habit of bringing horses to Kentish-town, he has sold several there; he has got a daughter that is married there; he has been there a week or a fortnight together; he is in confinement at Lewes; about two hours after I had bought the horses, Bristow and Martin both went to town on the stage with me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you pay for the horses? - A. Four guineas; and when I got them to Smithfield, I could not get two guineas for the best of them.</p>
               <p>Court. What! two horses that, not three quarters of a year before, had cost twenty-four guineas; I would advise you to take care how you buy such bargains again.</p>
               <p>- HALL sworn. - I keep the Assembly-house at Kentish-town: On the 17th of December, about half past four o'clock in the morning. I heard somebody call, holloa; I got up and opened my bed-room window, and asked who was there; a man said, I wish you would let your ostler come down and take in two horses; I knew the man's voice to be

               <p>Q. Was there anybody with him? - A. It was so dark I could not see him; when I came down, I went into the kitchen, and there sat Martin, and the prisoner at the bar with him, they asked for some warm ale; while they were drinking their ale, I said, well, Martin, what horses have you got here; he said he had got two very good ones in the stable; I asked him how he came up at that time; he said he had come up with goods; he has always before passed with us as a smuggler; that his cart was broke down in Grays-inn-lane, with eighteen tubs of Hollands in it; he asked me if I wanted to buy the horses; I told him I did not know; he said, well, come and look at them, I think they will suit you; I will sell you one, or both; upon which we took a candle and lantern, and went into the stable, the prisoner at the bar, Martin, myself, and the ostler; I took notice of the horses, but I told him they were not the kind of horses that I wanted; they were low half-bred cart horses, one four years old, and the other an aged horse, pretty near blind; then I went into the house, and so did the prisoner, and Martin; they said they must go to Grays-inn-lane,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140043"></xptr>to get a new wheel for their cart; the prisoner said if his hand had been well, he would have made one himself; his hand was tied up; they went away, and came back again, but they were not gone long enough to have gone to Gray's-inn-lane; Wyber is a tenant of mine, and, in the evening, Martin offered him the horses for sale; the prisoner was by, but I do not think Wyber saw him; I saw Martin receive the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Bristow take any part in the transatcion? - A. Nothing more that shewing me in the morning the horses that were for sale.</p>

             sworn. - I was with Cooper when he found both his horses at Smithfield, and at Kentish-town.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Lingfield from Kentish-town? - A. Thirty miles.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Hall.) Q. You say you heard Martin's voice; did you hear the voice of another person? - A. Yes; Martin came again the next day, and I took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time Martin talked about the cart breaking down, did the prisoner say any thing? - A. Yes; he said to Martin, I hope you have taken care of our tubs; the prisoner said, yes, they are all safe; in the evening, after they had sold their horses, I asked them how they would get their cart home, and they said, they had got one big enough for that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. About a quarter past eight in the evening, between Godstone and Croydon, I met with a man, whose name I found was Martin; he had got a led horse, and was riding another; he asked me if I would have a ride; I told him I was going to look for a job of work, I did not care if I did; we went to Croydon, and drank together; he said he was going through London, towards Finchley, and I might hear of a job that way; I said I did not care, and I went with him to Mr. Hall's, and the same evening we returned to London, and slept there, and the next evening I parted with him at Croydon; I went to enquire for him at Mr. Hall's, and he took me into custody.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Cooper). Q. What colour was your horse? - A. Brown. <rs id="t18010114-38-verdict215" type="verdictDescription">

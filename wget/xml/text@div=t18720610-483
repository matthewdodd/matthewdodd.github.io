                  </hi>. I live at 3, Aylesbury Villas, Hounslow—I am a commercial traveller—I had been transacting business at Surbiton, Kingston, and Richmond, a round which I have had about thirty years—I arrived at Twickenham, about 9.30—I had my money with me then, in a little leather-bag which I have carried about with me for years—there was 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. partly in gold and partly in silver—I remember going into the rail way Tavern, which is near the station—I wanted to get to Hounslow, some way or other; but unfortunately I did go in; I saw a gentleman there who I had known for years, and we had sundry glasses together; previous to that I had been into the Albany, and I had a glass of ale there; that was when I just landed—I have no recollection of going into the Albany again—I left the Railway Tavern, about 12 o'clock or more, I am sorry to say—after that time I began to get a little better for liquor; I did not search my pockets for money; I paid it out of my waistcoat pockets; I am sure my bag was quite right when I left-the men wanted to drive me in a cab, but they asked too much money—I thought the men were rather impudent and they took advantage of me, seeing that I had had an extra glass—they asked me 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as the cab fare—I repudiated it, and they offered to fetch me another cab, but I declined-eventually they all left me except one man—I was about to go to some steps that were pointed out to me, and a cab sud<lb></lb>denly drove into the station yard—I thought I should like to engage it—I went across the yard, and all of a sudden they seemed to go away—the cab And all vanished—only one man was there and he said he knew me and where I lived, and that he would see me out and home—I am not able to say whether the prisoner is the man or not—I went along with the man and he led me the wrong way—I had not gone far with him before we met two policeman—they said to me, "Aint you going home," or something like that; and they said to the man that was with me, "Aint you going off home," or "going with the old gentleman"—the man then went along with me a little further and when we got down into a dark place, which I did not know, I was knocked down and kicked on the head with some instrument—I felt my bag dragged away from me, which was in my left-hand trousers pocket—I was afterwards lead to the station-house by a policeman.</p>

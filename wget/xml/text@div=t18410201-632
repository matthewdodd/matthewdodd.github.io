Daglish about the yard—I lost the note from my pocket either at the gates or in the yard—I am certain it was in my pocket on the 13th— onthe morning of the 14th, from information, I gave the prisoners into custody—this is the note—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I know it by the writing of Mr. Hopkins on it.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a public-house in King-street, Westminster.

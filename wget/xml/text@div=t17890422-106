               <p>I am a constable, on the 9th of March last, a little after six in the morning, I observed a man loitering about Cow-cross, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178904220092"></xptr>watched him, and I observed him go into an old iron shop, with this piece of bell metal; I see him lay it down at the door, and he went to walk away, I laid hold of him, and asked him, what he had got there? it was wrapped up in a cloth; I thought it had been a piece of cast-iron; I asked him, where he got it? and he said a man gave it him to sell; I told him I should keep him in custody 'till I found out who it belonged to; he then begged I would let him go, and keep it myself; I refused, and he snatched a stick from me I had in my hand, and he struck me with it several times, and endeavoured to run away; I followed him, and took him, he was committed, I marked the metal; when he was before the magistrate, he said he found it.</p>

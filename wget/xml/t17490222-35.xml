               <p>Q. Did you know him before he came to lodge with you?</p>
               <p>Balendine. I had seen him before, but no way, acquainted; he pretended to be a physician, and desired my wife not to come into the room, pretending there was something that would affright her, saying it was an anatomy; but at last we missed the things, and found them again; the curtains were at one Mr. Bibby's , a pawnbroker, in Stanhope-street; the blanket and sheet I found at another place.</p>
               <p>Prisoner . Did not you agree to let the things lie at the pawnbroker's , if I would pay a valuable consideration to you?</p>
               <p>Balendine. I had so much humanity, I would have done any thing to have had my things again; the prisoner said, I wish you would take my note I would have agreed, had it not been to have compounded felony; indeed I was ignorant of the nature of such things, but I did not consent to such an agreement.</p>

            . I put a clean pair of sheets on the bed on Saturday, I said to the prisoner where is the key that I may make the bed? said he, there is an anatomy that will fright you; he continued in that till he was taken up for a fray in the streets for abusing the watchman ; I was told by one , that said she had seen him carry some of my things to pawn; I charged him with it in prison, and he did not deny it.

            . I am the constable: I was sent for when the prisoner was committed upon his quarrel, I broke open the door; the prosecutor found no sheets on the bed, and other things they said were missing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The prosecutor did seem very well satisfied , as I gave him encouragement to be easy, I having a law-suit depending, and might have an opportunity to pay him; he gave me a character, as I happened to be in a fray one night in the streets, and got as many to speak for me as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174902220011"></xptr> he could; now since I have failed in my law-suit, he has turned Cat in pan as the phrase is; I appeal to your Lordship, whether or no it is not a malicious prosecution , as I was indebted to him about three pounds , and not being able to raise that money.</p>
               <p>Balendine. The prisoner said, after I would not agree to make the matter up when he had pawned my things: I wish you had agreed, I'd have taught you how to make up such things as these; I'd have made you remember your compounding of felony.</p>

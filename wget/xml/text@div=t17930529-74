               <p>Q. Is that your nephew at the bar? - Yes. I was sitting in the parlour the 27th of January. (I live in <placeName id="t17930529-74-crimeloc407">Lemon-street, Goodmans-fields</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17930529-74-crimeloc407" type="placeName" value="Lemon-street, Goodmans-fields"></interp>

               <p>Q. Did you see him as soon as it was done? - I saw the side of his face but I did not see his hand or arm, I was so frightened; I was sitting down, and I got up, I turned my head and I saw my nephew; he went out into the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your nephew appear to have any thing about him? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your nephew when you saw him? - Partly behind my back in the parlour; he walked out from the parlour like a man frightened and went into the next house; he went into my yard first, after he went there I cannot say any thing more. I said, my God! my God! what is this you have done.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you last see him after this happened? - Going out of my own wash-house into my own yard.</p>
               <p>Q Is there a thoroughfare from your yard to the next house? - There is no gate but some small pallisades, which he had used to get over.</p>
               <p>Q Where did you say my God! my God! what is it you have done? - I was so frightened I hardly knew what I said.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body else in the same room besides you and him that you knew? - Not any one.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom do you impute the firing of this pistol? - I cannot pretend to say, I did not see any pistol from first to last, but I should suppose from the wound it was from some piece, pistol or gun.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what the wound was made by? - By a ball of some piece.</p>
               <p>Q The wound was by a ball you say, was that ball shewn to you when it was extracted? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any ill will at all between you and your Nephew? - I don't know that there was.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was your nephew taken after that? - He only went into the next house, he never went from there as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw the instrument by which this was done at all? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. We understand then that there was nobody else in the room besides your nephew and yourself, so that nobody else can give an account of this transaction except yourself; you say your nephew was behind you; during the whole time you had observation of him; you did not see gun or pistol or any thing else, I believe your nephew and you had been always on very good terms? - Six years almost we had lived comfortable together.</p>
               <p>Q. You stated to the recorder and court just now, that there was no ill will between you? - Not on my side, nor I hope on his.</p>
               <p>Q. The nephew went to the next house, he never went any further? - He was there I was told.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I would ask you Mr. Lloyd, what is his mind, is he completely in possession of his mind? - I don't know he was ever affected, I never observed any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290144"></xptr>thing that led me to think that he was so.</p>
               <p>Q. So what the wound was given by, you don't know, as you never saw any piece.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ever hear any report? - Yes, I heard the report.</p>
               <p>Q. How old is your nephew? - I believe he is turned of sixteen or seventeen.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did he make you any answer when you said good God! what have you done? - Not a word, he seemed frightened so.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; the prisoner has a brother and he was taken up for this offence, and the brother was discharged and I was bound over to prosecute this prisoner; I found some things in the brother's box, I found some cases of pistols, and on one of the cases there was a label; I found some powder and shot; on drawing the charge of the pistol which was produced at the office, the powder and ball which I found in the brother's box corresponded to the ball in the charge; I found the brother's box in the New-court, in the Old Bailey, nearly opposite these gates; the brother was an apprentice to a cooper in Whitechapel, but he had ran away from his master, and I don't know how he lived at that time, I understand him to be about twenty; when I apprehended the brother, I apprehended him in Cornhill, I found on him a key, and I examined him as to where he lived; he told me, and I came to No. 3, New-court, Old Bailey, and there were two children only in the house, at last I found the box in the cellar; on one of the cases was a label, I had received information where the pistols was purchased, and I went with this case with the label to the shop, the man said, that this case was purchased with the pistols, but he could not tell who purchased them, therefore I did not bring him to the office. I found likewise a canister of powder, I understand he lived in these lodgings by himself, and I found likewise some shot or small ball. I found also the key of some pistols.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did it appear to be the same sort of ball as was extracted from you? - It did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You apprehended the brother in Cornhill, and went to his lodgings, and there you found a key and some cases belonging to pistols, this was at this boy's brother's lodgings, and he had ran away from his master and there he lived by himself and it was his lodgings? - I know him to have run away.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did your nephew live with you? - Yes, he did for twelve years to the present time.</p>
               <p>Jury. That brother had not been at your house that afternoon? - Not to my Knowledge; I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. He used of course frequently to come to your house? - He did, but whether he was there that day, I do not say, nor will I take on myself to swear.</p>
               <p>Jury. You are sure the piece was discharged in the room, was the window broke? - It was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it open or shut? - I cannot be positive.</p>
               <p>Court. I think I understand you to say that when this happened you stood up and turned your head round, did you then see the prisoner in the room or in the wash house? - He was going out of the parlour into the wash-house; when he was in the room I heard him turning the books over, and I thought he was reading, as he used to read frequently.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was there any smell of powder? - I suppose there must, but I was so frightened I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there nobody came into the room soon afterwards? - The next neighbour came in directly.</p>

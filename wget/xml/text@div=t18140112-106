            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner in Golden-lane on the 23rd of December; on the day before I had received information of stolen property being at a house in Fireball-court, Houndsditch; I went there. I saw these two coats in a room of the sister to one of the witnesses; she said her brother sent the things there. When I apprehended the prisoner I told him I apprehended him for stealing coach-glasses and coats; he said, he knew nothing of it. I found a two-pound note upon him with the name of Lion Solomon upon it, the witness who had bought the coats.</p>
               <p>LION SOLOMON. I keep a clothes shop, 19, Playhouse-yard. On the 21st in the morning, about nine o'clock, I was sent for, to go to Golden-lane: I went the house in Golden-lane, and when I got to that to house I saw two men and a woman; I did not see the prisoner when I bought the clothes. They asked me three-pounds for these coats; I gave six pounds for the lot; two have been claimed by Stevenson. I had to go home to pay the money; I appointed to come to the Black Horse, Barbican, to pay the money and there I found three men; the prisoner was one of the men. I paid the money in that house; I put the money on the table, a woman took the money up. I left the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing about the coats - A. Not a word.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your name upon the back of the notes - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>

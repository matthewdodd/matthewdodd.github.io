                  </hi>. I am a clothier, and live at Chislehurst. I have a shop at Deptford—in Nov. last the prisoner was my shopman there—I gave him notice that I would discharge him, and gave him till the Saturday week to find other employ—on 16th Dec., in consequence of information, I went to a place which I found to be his residence, in Victory-street, Deptford New Town—I there found four iron rods, some brass rod, some remnants of cloth and cotton, some counterpanes, skeins of silk, buttons, lining, and some show-tickets—I know them nearly all as mine—I found two of these iron rods under his counter, and one over the counter with a lamp suspended to it, and one out<lb></lb>side with goods on it—two or three of them had been altered to fit that shop—this is a portion of a brass rod, about eight feet long, which I had suspended in my window—it has been broken to fit his shop—he had no authority to take any of the fittings of my shop away, or anything else belonging to me—the book is here, in which he made entries of anything he sold or bought, there is no entry of his having bought any cloth of me—I never sold him any—I gave him in charge—when I went to his shop, I said I had been given to understand he had property of mine-there, and I had come to see what he had got—he said he had nothing of mine there, and it was a paltry notion of, me coming to his place to search—when the officer took this cloth out of the cupboard, the prisoner said he had purchased it on Holborn-hill, that it did not belong to me, and that he had bought two of the irons from a man named Myson, who had worked for me, and the other two were put among his things by mistake—I had never parted with them to Myson, or authorised him to take them away—here is about one yard and seven-eights of this beaver cloth; I miss about three yards and a quarter off the corresponding piece, which I have here—I have missed from a piece of lining, eleven yards and three quarters; here are about eight yards and a half—it was in the shop a few days before he left—here is a trowsers' length of buckskin: I can<lb></lb>not tell how much is gone from the piece it was cut from, as the ticket is gone, but I have the remainder of it, which corresponds with the cut—these are the two pieces he said he bought on Holborn-hill—here is another piece, two yards and a half of buckskin, I am two yards and a half deficient of the same colour and texture, and I have the piece to match it—this counterpane has got the register mark on it—I have lost five of them—this bears the ticket which it bore when it was in my possession—this book, which I saw at my house, bears the name of every customer he has been serving for eight months, since he has been in my house—it is his writing—he sent me a copy of it before.</p>

               <p>prisoner came into my service in March—he loved in the house with his wife and family—he had his own furniture—I gave him notice on a Monday, in Nov.—I told him he must get out by that day fortnight—I did not tell him on the Saturday that he must go then—I did not tell him when he came for his wages on Saturday night, that if he opened a shop near me I would soon put a stop to that—he has opened a shop near me—it is not a grievance to me that he has got my customers; I should be glad to see any one do—on that Saturday night he was very abusive—he did not then tell me to come and see if any thing of mine had got away in his things: he did on the Saturday week following—I did not go then—I have brought nearly all the books connected with my business—he had to keep them all, to serve cus<lb></lb>tomers, and cut out garments, and dress the windows—when we found the counterpanes in his house, he said that they were put round his own tables to prevent their being scratched, and that the person who moved the things for him, had moved the four pieces of iron and the brass without his know<lb></lb>ledge, or something of that sort—I occasionally have taken the books to Green<lb></lb>wich, to make them up—while they were there, things could not be entered in them, but I never took the sale-book away—me nephew was in my service—he has left six or seven months—it was not then that I took the books away to make them up—I have twice sent my father-in-law, Mr. Coltman, to the prisoner for the cash, when I have been away for a week—the prisoner used to put it down on a slip of paper—he had a balance-book to enter it—I was throws out of a gig, and was away eight or nine days; I was confined to my bed for a week—I do not remember that when the prisoner came for his wages he said he would come if he was sent for—I asked him one or two questions on the Saturday, but he was very loath to tell me anything—I never au<lb></lb>thorise the persons who serve in my shops to make abatements—it was my wish for them not to do it if they could avoid it; but they have done os. I have not the least doubt—I cannot remember the exact time I took away the books—it is very likely I took the prisoner's stock when he left—he left on a Saturday, I think on the 10th Nov.—I took the books away two or three days before he left, and I sent them back I think on the follow<lb></lb>ing day.</p>

                  </hi>. I acted as clerk to the Magistrate at the prisoner's examination on this charge. On the first day, on Mr. Dowson identifying the cloth and rods, the prisoner made this statement, which I took down from his mouth—"The prisoner says, 'Mr. Dowson turned me out on the Saturday; when I was moving my goods, the man who moved me put the irons in the truck; the counterpanes were put round my tables to prevent their being scratched; the remnants of cloth I bought of him, he will find the entry in his book; the iron-work had been fixed while I was out; I certainly knew the irons were not mine; they had been sent to the smith's to be bent.'"</p>

            . On the 30th of March I was at this public-house, drinking with the prosecutor; the prosecutor and the prisoner went out before me, in a short time I heard the prosecutor cry out Morgan, and that he had been robbed of his watch. I came out, and saw the prosecutor had hold of the prisoner; a stranger asked me if I was the person that was acquainted with the person that lost his watch, I said yes, he gave me the watch in my hand to take care of; I said there is neither outside case nor glass; the prosecutor said, never mind, I have got the man. The constable of the night came up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find the outside case afterwards - A. No. I delivered up the watch to the constable of the night.</p>

            . I am a constable. About ten o'clock in the evening, on the 30th of March I went into this public-house, I saw the prisoner, the prosecutor, and his friend, drinking with a parcel of women of the town; I returned to the watch on my duty, I saw no more of this till twelve o'clock. The prosecutor brought the man in by the arm, and told me that he had been robbed of his watch; I asked him where the watch was, he said Mr. Morgan had got it. Morgan gave me the watch, and told me the case was lost, he gave me the watch in the state it is now in, without the case or glass. I asked Morgan where he got it, he said, some unknown man gave it him in the street. I searched the prisoner, and found nothing; he said he was not guilty of it. The prosecutor said his watch was pulled out of his fob by the prisoner, in the street; the prisoner denied it, and said he never did such a thing in his life.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prosecutor sober - A. No; he knew what he said and did.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am not guilty of what I am charged with; as I came out of the public-house he catched hold of me fast, there were two or three women with him, he said you have robbed me of my watch; I said I was innocent, I was willing to go to the watchhouse, I knew nothing of the watch.</p>

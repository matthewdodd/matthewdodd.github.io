I asked the landlord if there was any convenience backwards; she came there to me, and made much of me, and took away my notes, and I could not lay hold of her; she immediately ran away; and I asked the publican which way she ran, and he said down North-street; but I did not find her, and she was not taken until the following morning.</p>

            . I am a publican, and keep the Nelson's Head. The prisoner and the prosecutor came into my house, between four and five on the 31st of August The prosecutor would have some beer, but I would not let him have any, for he was tipsy. I shewed him to the convenience backwards, by his desire, and she followed him, saying, she wanted to go to her husband. Soon after, she came running out, and in a minute after, he came, and said, she had robbed him of his notes. I knew he had some notes, for he offered them to me to pay for the beer, but I did not let him have any.</p>

The prisoner at the bar came to my house three different times, he came about seven o'clock in the morning and called for half a pint of porter; first of all he asked for his partner, a stone mason that was to call there. About a month after he called again and asked for half a pint of porter, and asked if his partner was come then; I said no. I lost a candlestick each time; then on the 28th of March he called for the boy to open the door, he asked if his partner was come; the boy said no, but he dare say if he had promised him to meet him he would be there; the boy had suspicion of him as well as me. The prisoner went into the back room, the boy saw there were two brass candlesticks on the table, he ran up stairs and taps at the door and said the partner is come again; he went down stairs and stood at the door; when I came down stairs he came out of the room and asked me for half a pint of beer; while I was unlocking the machine the boy went into the back room, he saw the candlesticks were gone; the prisoner made a bolt towards the door, the boy says stop him, he has got the candlesticks. I told him now he happened to meet with the right partner; I said how dare you steal my candlesticks, he said he had not got them; I told him he had them in his pockets; he pulled one out of each pocket then.</p>

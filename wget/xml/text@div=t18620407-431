On 11th March, about half-past 2, or nearly 3 o'clock, from information I received, I went to Mr. Wade's, 23, Church-lane, Limehouae—I got over a boarded fence at the end of the house and found the back door of No. 22 unfastened, by which a person could get into the house—I looked round and saw the prisoner crouched up in a corner outside the house in the yard—he said that he came there to sleep—I found this shawl (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) wrapped round his body inside his trousers, and he had on these boots and stockings—I saw my brother constable pick up two petticoats and a cape in the yard, about ten yards from the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Wade, of 22, Church-lane, Limehouse—on 10th March, about a quarter to 11 o'clock, I fastened up the house and went to bed, I was the last person up—a window looks into the garden from the washhouse, which is part of the house, and when I was dis<lb></lb>turbed, I found that it had been broken open—that was about twenty minutes to 3 in the morning—the button of the door leading from the gar<lb></lb>den to the washhouse was pushed off, and some of the wood-work broken—when you have got into the washhouse you can get into the inner part of the house—the window frame was broken a little before, but it was broken more afterwards, large enough for any person to put their hands in, lift the window up, and so get into the kitchen—I am sure the window was fastened the night before: I fastened it with a nail, as I could not find a screw; I found the nail on the floor next morning—directly I went into the kitchen I missed a pair of boots, a petticoat, cape, shawl, and stockings, some of which I hare seen since—they are my husband's property, and were all safe when I went to bed—they are worth between 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know the prisoner.</p>

The window was a little way up when I first noticed it, a pane of glass was broken and the frame too—Ponsford, my brother officer, asked the prisoner whether those were his boots on his feet—he said, "No, those are mine which you have got in your hand"—those were the boots I produce.</p>

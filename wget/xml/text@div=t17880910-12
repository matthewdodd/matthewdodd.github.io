               <p>I was coming up St. Catharine's-lane last Saturday night, and that man was with a girl of the town, and another man or two along side of her; they were going to the house, when I passed him about twenty yards, he sung out, Do you mean to rob me? a man passed with a jacket and trowsers on, and I had my arms in this manner, and laid the watch on my arm, and I put it into my pocket; this man came and laid hold of me, and searched me, and took the watch out of my trowsers pocket; that man that passed me, and gave it me, was the man that asked him the question most probably at the top of the lane.</p>

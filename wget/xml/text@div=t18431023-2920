                  </hi>. Iam servant to a brewer, and live in Kent-street, Haggenton. The prisoner lodged in my house in 1840 and 1841—in April, 1841, he owed me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I asked him for—he said it was not in his power to pay me at present, but his brother-in-law would accept a bill, if I would take it—I inquired his brother-in-law's character, and if he was a responsible man—I found be was—the prisoner took me to the Elephant and Castle, and showed me some bouses which he said belonged to his brother-in law, Mr. King—a few days after, he said he would get his brother to accept a bill—in the evening he brought this bill for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave him 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. difference—I then lost sight of him for nearly three months—he went away, and gave no notice—I never eaw him again till the 2nd of October.</p>

               <p>Clapton. The acceptance to this bill is not in my handwriting—I have every reason to believe that I authorised the prisoner to accept it in my name—I have reflected upon it since I was before the Magistrate—I have done similar things for him before.</p>

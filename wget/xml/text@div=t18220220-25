            . I am servant to Mr. Warren. I was told the cart was robbed - I missed six bottles out of a two dozen basket. I went down Berkley-street, and saw the prisoner at the corner of Berkley-square, coming from the further end of the square; I went up and asked if he saw any body run that way, he said yes, he did; I said</p>
               <p>"I think you are the man I want," and collared him; another person was within two yards of him, and ran off. I felt the prisoner had two bottles in his pocket, he pulled one out, and fell down himself, and broke the head of the other in his pocket; they both had my master's seal on them - his pocket was quite wet with wine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. He was coming towards your master's house - A. Yes. It was about a quarter to seven o'clock - he was walking slowly, close to the rails of the square; he said he saw a person stop in the square, and put the bottles down, and he picked them up.</p>

            . I am a constable. The prisoner was given in my charge, with the neck of a bottle - I searched Berkley-square, and found more bottles on the spot he was taken, but none of them with necks, and wine spilt; the prisoner's coat was soaking with red wine - I asked what had become of the six bottles; he said he only had two; he did not say how he came by them.</p>

I would if I could, I thought I could get a boat down at my master's—he went down with me, and he ran the best part of the way—we got the boat, launched her about a dozen yards into the water, and got in—we rowed round the causeway, which is the best part of a quarter of a mile, and there found the two females and Haydon waiting for us—they got into the boat, and I rowed them over to Grays, and they landed there—when I got ashore, <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> gave me a sovereign—when we got about a dozen yards, Haydon said, "How much did you give him, <hi rend="italic">Tom?"</hi>—he said,</p>

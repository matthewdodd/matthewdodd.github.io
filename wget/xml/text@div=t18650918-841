                  </hi>. I am a porter at 18, Garlic-hill—on Saturday, 19th August, I was at the Boar's-head, in Cannon-street—I left there at about twenty minutes to eleven—I had been there about twenty minutes—I was at the bar—while there I saw the three prisoners and another man, an ac<lb></lb>complice, they were together—the one who is not in custody forced his con<lb></lb>versation upon me, he was dressed as a sailor—he said he had been over in America, and was talking about what he had done there—the others took part in it—I can't recollect what they said—they asked me to drink—I rather refused at first—they wanted me to stand a quartern of gin, which I refused three or four times; afterwards thinking a row was about to com<lb></lb>mence, I paid for one quartern for quietness—they then wanted me to pay for another—I then went out for convenience—the three prisoners followed me out—I had scarcely got a few yards from the house, when the male prisoner came and threw his arms round my neck, and the two females came and rifled my pockets of three half-crowns and a bunch of keys—Flannagan put her hands in my pocket, Carney was on my right hand side assisting the other two in robbing me—the two females then made their escape—the man also got from me—I went up Nicholas-lane and met him there, he was alone—a constable came up, and I charged him with being an accomplice in rob<lb></lb>bing me of three half-crowns—he said he had nothing at all to do with it—at the station he said, "Did I nail your three half-crowns?"—I said, "No, your accomplices did"—he then said, "All the blame comes upon my shoulders."</p>

I am a carman in the employ of the Great Western Railway company—I was at the Boar's-head public-house on Saturday, 19th August—I saw Bushel I there; I did not know him—he was drinking at the bar—I saw the male prisoner and Flannagan and another, a short woman, her back was to me and I could not swear to her—I did not see Bushell leave—I suddenly missed him and the prisoners—I had been looking at them five or six minutes—I heard an altorcation about a quartern of gin, which drew my attention to them—as soon as I missed them I went to the door, having suspicion, and saw the male prisoner with his arm round the prosecutor's neck, holding him in a backward position, and Flannagan rifling his pockets—they were some dozen paces from me—the female prisoners both made off and turned into Nicolas-lane—I followed them close up the lane—I heard a bunch of keys drop—I picked them up—when I got to the corner of the lane, I saw the male prisoner in conversation with the prose<lb></lb>cutor—I called the assistance of a policeman and pointed him out to him—they had some conversation, and he attempted to get away; he was taken into custody by the assistance of myself and the policeman—I saw Carney about three days afterwards in Thames-street, but I did not give her into custody, because I could not swear to her—I did not see Flannagan again till she was in custody At the Mansion-house—theft were three together in the cells—I picked Flannagan out—I am quite sure of her.</p>

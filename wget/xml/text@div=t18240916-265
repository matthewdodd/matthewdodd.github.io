The prisoner superintended my business at Hounslow, where I keep seventy or one hundred horses; the prisoner generally bought the hay for them by my directions: it was his duty to buy hay when I directed: he has done so for twelve or fourteen years; he told me I should soon be in want of hay; I told him to look out for some, and he wrote me a note, which I produce.</p>
               <p>This note was here read. It was dated the 2d of February, and stated that he had bought ten loads of the best meadow hay of Mr. Buckland at 4 l. 10 s. a load.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him after this - A. I cannot say whether I wrote or sent to him - (looking at a bill of parcels) - I have paid Mr. Buckland the amount of this bill; I directed the prisoner to have this hay delivered at Hounslow - I cannot say whether it was verbally or by letter; my stables were formerly known as the Old King's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160103"></xptr>Head: I had no horses any where at Hounslow but there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. What other establishment for horses have you - A. One at Staines. Buckland lives at Rainsley; ten or eleven miles from Hounslow. I expected the hay to be delivered the beginning of last February. I cannot say whether I sent him a message that it was to be delivered at Hounslow, or whether I wrote him or told him verbally. It was his duty to buy provender when he knew I was in want, but he generally informed me what he wanted before he bought.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Under your directions he was to buy hay and straw for you - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Mr. ANDREWS. Q. Did you know that he bought any for Dallimore - A. No; I accused him of buying straw for Dallimore, being informed that he had, and he said he had. I said I would suffer no servant of mine to buy hay, straw, or corn for anybody but myself, and if he did so again, I should dismiss him - this was a year and a half ago: his reply was, that he could not get paid for what he had bought, and should buy no more.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. After this hay had been bought of Buckland, did the prisoner see you, and say anything about it - A. He said it had been delivered. He bought hay occasionally for the horses at Staines. No hay of mine would be delivered at the Lion and Lamb stables. My eldest son at times goes down and gives orders, but very seldom, for he lives on the North-road, and had been extremely ill for three months about February.</p>
               <p>VIRGO BUCKLAND. I sold ten loads of hay to the prisoner for Mr. Waterhouse, at my house at Ranislury. The bill produced is what I delivered for it. The prisoner ordered it of me for Mr. Waterhouse. He told me to send it to Hounslow, two loads at a time - the two first were single loads. It was all delivered from the beginning of February to the end of March. I sent most of it by my man Rowe. Jackson is the boy who goes with him. I desired the carter to deliver it at the prosecutor's stables at Hounslow.</p>

            . I am carter to Mr. Buckland. In the early part of this year I was employed by him to deliver some hay; and one day, when I was going with some to Mr. Waterhouse's the Old King's Head, the prisoner met me by the gateway of the Lion and Lamb, and told me to leave one load there - he saw me do it, and pitched it into the loft himself at Mr. Dallimore's stables. I took the other load on to the Old King's Head. The prisoner was there, and saw me deliver it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Dallimore lives at the Lion and Lamb - A. Yes; the prisoner counted the trusses.</p>
               <p>MR. WATERHOUSE. The prisoner never accounted to me for any hay delivered at the Lion and Lamb. I had forbidden him to sell any for himself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. All your money transactions with him will appear by your books - A. He paid me for no hay. My cash-book contains no money transactions with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose your stock of hay to be suddenly exhausted, what was he to do - A. To look out for more, and inform me; but we never run our stock so close; if such a thing should happen, (but it never did) he would go to respectable farmers, and could always get hay on my account: I know of one instance in which he bought hay, and told me of it - I paid him for it; and have been told that he has some land on Hounslow-heath: I never authorized him to sell me hay.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did he ever sell hay for you - A. I never authorized him to sell any at all, and never understood that he had sold any of that bought of Mr. Buckland; nor did he ever state that he had sent Dallimore any in re-payment for any he had borrowed, in a case of emergency; it is not at all probable that we should be out of hay.</p>

            . I was horsekeeper to Mr. Dallimore, at the Lion and Lamb public-house, Hounslow. I paid the prisoner a bill of 12 l. 2 s. for two loads of hay and one of straw; it was delivered at the Lion and Lamb; I know that some of it came from Mr. Buckland's - Rowe brought it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You do not know when it was delivered - A. One load, which came from Buckland, was in February - and the other in March. I paid English for it between Christmas and Lady-day, and paid him 7 l. 2 s. before that.</p>

            . I am horse-keeper at the King's Arms public-house, Holborn-bridge. I lived with Mr. Waterhouse at Hounslow the beginning of this year; I knew the prisoner's premises at Hounslow very well; he had a hay-rick there; three loads and a half of hay were delivered at Mr. Waterhouse's yard from the premises; most of it was mixed up with the corn; we were short of hay at that time.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you present when the hay was cut - A. I saw it cut out of the rick, and I brought it from his place about three weeks after Christmas.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner for sixteen years; I know that he used to buy hay of jobbers - I cannot swear to more than one instance, which was six or seven months ago. We had bought some of a jobber for 5 l. a load: there were four or five bad trusses among it - the man changed them, and moved from my stables, and English bought them of him. He has six or seven acres of land; some of it is grass land - I give him as good a character as possible.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you come to Mr. Waterhouse with any overture - A. Yes.</p>

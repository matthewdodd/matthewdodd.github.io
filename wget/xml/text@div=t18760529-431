May, baker and corn dealer, 1, Guildford Street, Portland Street. Bakings carefully attended to," &amp;c, was on the bags—there was an oven, but I should think it had not been used for twelve months—I also found some old tins very mouldy, a mildewed trough, and some calico bags con<lb></lb>taining a kind of snuff manure—no baking was carried on—I searched the prisoner's rooms, they were in very poor condition—the backroom contained a lot of scales and weights and tins such as would be used by grocers—I found no tea, but tea is mentioned on the bag—there was not the slightest indication of any trade—I told him I should take him on a warrant for being concerned in conspiring with Day, Hall, and Ringer to defraud people in various parts of London and the country of their goods, mentioning hay, straw, corn, and other things—he said that he know nothing at all about them or about the goods—he said "I know Ringer very well, I have known him a number of years"—I mentioned things which had been obtained from Southampton by Day at 23, Snow's Fields—he said that he knew nothing at all about it—I said that he formerly rented the shop at 23, Snow's Fields—, he said "Yes, I know that, I let it to Day"—he said that he had left the company, meaning Hall, Shaw, Ringer, and a lot of long firm men, and that he had been travelling in the tea trade and selling tea—going to the station I mentioned that a carriage had been obtained from a gentleman at Brighton—he said "Yes, I had the carriage, but I have sold it"—I have known the prisoner over twenty years, generally by the name of May, but also by the names of Hall and White—he has been living in all parts of London—I had occasion once to go to 287, Kent Street, where he was trading in the names of Hall and White—that was the usual kind of long firm business.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Three Rabbits public-house, at Little Ilford. On the 7th of June I heard something—I went into the pantry, and the gin was dropping—I went to the stable-yard, and saw Arnold, my servant—I asked him where he had put the gin he had taken from the pantry—he said he did not know what I meant—he was very much intoxicated—I then went to Page, and he was in the act of filling one of these bottles from a spouted quart pot in the stable—I took it from him, and sent for an officer—these are the bottles, four of them were under the manger, and this one was in his hand—he was pouring the gin in—I have compared the gin with that in the cask, I believe it to be the same—it is thirty-seven yards from the pantry to the stable door.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's daughter. I saw Arnold in the pantry, stooping in front of the cask—I do not know whether he had any thing in his hand—I saw no one else there—I gave information to my father—I had not seen Page in the house that morning—I know this one bottle by a mark on it.</p>

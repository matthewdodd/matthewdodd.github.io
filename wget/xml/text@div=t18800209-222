                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at 7, Red Lion Court, Spital<lb></lb>fields—on Sunday night, 12th January, about half-past 12, I was in Princes Street, Spitalfields, with my wife—I met the three prisoners in the street; they were together walking in a 'row—as soon as they came up to me I eased a little bit off from the houses—they did not speak to me—Hickey made a snatch at my watch chain and broke it, and ran away with part of it—neither of the other prisoners did anything to me—Watson struck my wife and knocked her down on the pavement—they all three ran away—my wife was running after the prisoners—I saw Hickey's face—I nave never expressed any doubt about the other two men—I have not the slightest doubt about all three of them—my wife is ill and unable to leave her bed</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman H</hi> 124). I was present when the pro<lb></lb>secutor's wife was examined before the Magistrate, Mr. Hannay, at "Worship Street—the prisoners had an opportunity of cross-examining her, and they did cross-examine her—I saw her put her mark to her deposition. (<hi rend="italic">The deposition of Mary Watson was read as follows:</hi> "I was with my husband, and Watson and one of the others, I think Wilcox, went past us, and as they passed they pushed against us, and the third man loitered behind; they turned and faced us, and Watson took hold of my husband's chain; I called out, and he hit me in the eye and knocked me down—I called "Police," and they all three ran away, and the police caught them") On 12th January I was in Brick Lane, in plain clothes—I saw Wilcox and Watson in company together at half-past 12, after midnight—they were joined by Hickey—he was standing at a lodging-house door at the corner of Princes Street—they then all three followed the prosecutor and his wife—I then lost sight of them for a time—I heard cries of "Murder" and "Police "in Princes Street, and the three prisoners came rushing back—I ran up and took hold of Hickey—he put his leg between mine and tripped me up, and we both rolled on the ground together—the other two prisoners came to his assistance, and he got away—229 H came up, and I left him with the others and gave chase after Hickey—I overtook him in Flower and Dean Street—86 H came up, and with assistance I took Hickey back to Princes Street, where the prosecutor and his wife were standing, and they identified him—I took him to the station, and the prosecutor charged him—I had never seen the prisoners in company before.</p>

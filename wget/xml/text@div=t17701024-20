             came into my house on the 27th of September, about seven in the morning and asked me after my wife (my wife was at Hampstead ). I was at Hampstead in the evening when a messenger came to inform me that I had been robbed. When I came home I missed out of a chest, which I left locked when I went out, a green purse, which continued ten crown piece, half a guinea, and a 3 s. 4 d. piece of gold; also a yellow purse, containing about 5 l. in silver. I lost a silver pint mug, a pair of silver salts, a silver cream jug, a pair of tea-tong, a silver tea-strainer, and a silver coral; they were all in the chest. There was a 6 s. 9 d. in the yellow purse that I am pretty certain I have seen since. The lock of the chest had been forced open; I did not see any mark of violence upon the chamber door. Upon the information I received when I got home, I suspected the prisoners; they lived together as man and wife. I got a warrant to search their lodgings; I did not find any of my things there. We took them up, and upon

             I found some silver and a 6 s. 9 d. there is a particular shilling, and the 6 s. 9 d. I and pretty certain is mine. In Preston's pocket we found a key, which, upon trial, opened the locks of my chest of drawers, but I lost nothing out of my drawers. I did not find any thing upon Reynolds. Preston told the Justice that he would take it upon himself, if the Justice would acquit his wife.</p>

            . I am housekeeper to Mr. Elliot. Reynolds came to Mr. Elliot's, about eleven in the morning, after he was gone to Hampstead; she went away soon; and came again at one; she had some beer and some shrub then; she went out again quickly. She came again about two, and then she entered into conversation about a woman that had robbed her lodgings. We were in the back kitchen; there is a door in the street opens into the passage; that passage leads to Wild Court; as soon as you come into the passage, on one side of the passage is a door into this back room; then farther is the back kitchen, which has connection another way with the tap-room; it was in this kitchen that she was with me at this time. While we were talking together, one of the lodgers came and asked me if I had opened the chamber door; I was afraid some robbery had been committed, and I was greatly frightened; I cried out that my master was robbed and ruined. I ran up stairs; the back of the chest was broke off, and the place and purses were taken away; I talked of having a warrant, and going to Sir John Fielding's; Mr. Reynolds endeavoured to persuade me not to be alarmed, for probably I should find the things again soon; the prisoner went away soon after.</p>

I live opposite Mr. Elliot's; I saw two men standing in the street, near Mr. Elliot's; the, stood there about ten minutes, looking about, and then they went in at Mr. Elliot's do; they came out again in about seven minutes; they ran away as fast as they could; I observed something bulged out in Preston's pocket; he held his hands over both his pockets as he ran. I saw Preston go into the house about an hour before. I never saw Preston before, but I took to much notice of him as he stood in the street, that I am positive he is the man.</p>

               <p>Henry Hall. I am servant to Mr. Blundell, who keeps a wine-vault in Duke-street. On the 22d of September, between one and two o'clock. Preston and another man came into Mr. Blundell's vaults in an a great hurry; he called for a pint of wine. Preston bolted the door after him as soon as he came in; he appeared to be a great deal confused; he laid down two sixpences instead of one; he did not stay above three minutes; they went out again in a great hurry; I am certain the prisoner was one of the men; both their pockets stuck out very much.</p>

We went through Mr. Elliot's house into Wild Court; he went to enquire for a man there. We came through Mr. Elliot's passage-again, and then went to Mr. Blundell's wine-vaults, and had a pint of wine; we parted as soon as we came out.</p>

I called for a pennyworth of beer. She called down a chair-woman to dinner that was at work in Mr. Elliot's bed chamber. When we had sat about ten minutes, a lodger came down and told Mrs. Tawney that Mr. Elliot's chamber door was open, and she went up and found the things gone; I paid for my beer and came home.</p>

               <p>some tea from Stevens and Rowley's, in Cannon-street—Wellings brought it about half-past seven o'clock that evening, with a truck—he brought in one half-chest, and put that down, and on going to the door he made an alarm, and the other half-chest was not there—next morning I received in<lb></lb>formation that some tea was found—I took a sample of the tea I had to the station, and compared it with that at the station—I looked at them, and tasted them—from the best judgment that I can form, I hate no doubt What<lb></lb>ever that they were the same—here is a sample of both—there were about thirty-six or thirty-seven pounds in the half-chest that was lost, and the ten that was at the station they told me weighed about twenty-nine pounds—it was in a dirty black bag.</p>

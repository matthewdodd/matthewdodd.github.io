                  </hi> I am the wife of Charles Bachler, and live in Princes-court, Shoreditch—on Saturday morning, the 24th of April, the prisoner came to my house about ten o' clock, and asked for a comfortable lodging—I had not seen him before—I said I had a comfortable bed; he asked me what I charged, I said, "3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for part of a bed"—he said he had just come on shore from the <hi rend="italic">Sarah Belina</hi>, which was lying in the docks, and his hammock and chest were in Old Gravel-lane—he asked if I had got a room large enough to take it in—I said, "Yes," and agreed to let him have it—he asked if I had any food in the house—I said at any rate I had some bread and butter—he asked if he could lie down, as he was very tired—he went up and laid down, and told me to call him at a quarter before four o'clock, that he might get up and go to Cornhill to get his papers signed, that he might go to the Jamaica Coffee-house to get his money on Monday morning—he said he had a great deal of money to receive—I called him at a quarter before four o'clock, he got up in a great hurry and went out—he came back in three-quarters of an hour, as I was taking my tea—he then pro<lb></lb>duced this paper to me, and said he could have 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it as well as five farthings, if he were in a boarding-house, but he preferred a private lodging—he said he had been out four years, and he had a great deal of money to receive on Monday morning, at ten o'clock, at the Jamaica Coffee-house, and he told me to be sure to get myself in readiness to go with him—on Monday morning he begged he might go clean to the Jamaica Coffee-house, and I lent him a shirt and front of my husband's, to go and receive the money—he went out about eight o'clock on Monday morning, and absconded—he was perfectly sober and sensible—I got myself ready and waited from ten till twelve o'clock—I did not see him—he gave me a great deal of trouble—I saw no more of my husband's shirt and front, and did not see the prisoner again till he was in custody—he had three shillings and six-pence of me on the Saturday and the Sunday, and his food.</p>

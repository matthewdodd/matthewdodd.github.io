               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar, and tell me whether you know of her coming to your master's house. - A. Yes, on Friday the 20th of November, about five in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she come for. - A. A half pint tin pot; I believe it came to three pence, she gave me a shilling, I gave her change; then she went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing about the shilling before you put it into the till. - A. I did, there was a black kind of grease upon it, I put it into the till; in the course of that evening Mr. Masterman shewed me that shilling, and said it was a bad one; I recollected it was the shilling that I took of the prisoner; there were but three shillings that I had in the till besides.</p>
               <p>Q. They had not that black and greasy appearance, had they. - A. There were three or four shillings in the till but none of them having that appearance.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with that shilling. - A. I put it in the ink-stand in the accompting-house. This is the shilling (producing it.)</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember her coming to your house again on Monday the 23d of November. - A. Yes, then she asked for a metal spoon, that came to three pence; then she tendered me a bad shilling, (I produce it.) I detained her and told Mr. Masterman.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that she was the same person that came on the Friday before. - A. Yes, I had seen her several times before that in our shop.</p>

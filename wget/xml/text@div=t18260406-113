            . I am in the employ of Mr. Nightingale. On the 21st of March he sent me to find a piece of cloth, like a piece which he gave me; I went to Mrs. Wilson's, and bought this cloth of her for 12s. - I brought it home, and left it on the counter in the cutting-room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. CRESWELL. Q. Do you know it by any thing but the colour? A. No; but there never was but one piece made of this colour, and my master had it - I know it by the cuts on the edge.</p>
               <p>MARY WILSON. I keep a shop. I bought this piece of cloth; I believe I bought it for blue, but it is a kind of episopal purple - I did not take notice of it, and I can not tell whether it is it or not - it looks like the colour, but I cannot tell whether it is the same texture; I did not measure it, and bought it between the lights - I believe it was brought by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What day was this? A. I neither know the day, nor the property.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When was it you went before the Magistrate? A. About a week after I bought it. I suppose I bought it of the prisoner - I believe he is the man; I had seen him once or twice before. I live in Good win's-court, St. Martin's-lane, where I have lived twelve years; I had been washing at the time, and was rather tired and out of temper, when the cloth was brought.</p>

            . Q. When did you miss this? A. On the 15th of March - I did not say anything to the prisoner, but I sent Burn to make inquiries at different piece-brokers' shops - it being a very peculiar colour - this was the only piece that had been manufactured of the colour. I had the whole of my men examined, and went to Mrs. Wilson's, and requested her attendance the next morning - the prisoner did not work in my house, he had his work home - he was sent for, and Mrs. Wilson identified him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What quantity had you of it at first? A. About twenty-eight yards and a quarter. To the best of my belief, in the whole trade, there was but this one piece of cloth made of this colour - it is possible that some others might have had some of this colour - I will not swear it must have been mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Nightingale visited me in prison on Monday, and said if I would tell him all I could about it he would not do me any harm - it was a sort of compromise.</p>
               <p>COURT to JAMES NIGHTINGALE. Q. Is this true? A. No; before he was committed I went to get information from him; I told him my evidence was not of the consequence that Mrs. Wilson's was - but I wished to know what he could tell me.</p>

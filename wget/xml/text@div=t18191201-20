On the 17th of November I was the last person up, and went to bed about eleven o'clock; I had been washing a little - my things were wet, and hung on a line; I fastened every door, and shut the windows, but did not fasten them. The kitchen is under ground, and has a sash window, but the fastening is broken - I am certain that I shut it and

            . I am a watchman. Mr. Smith's house is on my beat. On the night of the 17th of November, a little before five o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner stooping down at the kitchen window - it was quite dark. He was stooping down, passing a stick inside the window, and dragging something out. I went up to him, and he went away, but I followed him, and secured him with the stick in the hand - he broke a book off it, and threw it on the ground before I took him; he still had the end of the stick, which I produce - it is two sticks tied together. I also produce the book which he threw away. I took him to the watch-house.</p>

            . I was constable of the night; the prisoner was brought to the watch-house by Harst. I searched him, and found a cap, a frill, and a towel on him, which were wet. I then went to the house, found the top sash of the window down, and another cap hanging on the sash; it appeared to have been dropped in coming out. I found a net on him.</p>

I passed the watchman, but had no stick with me; he followed me, and I picked the stick up; he came after me, but I did not know that he was going to meddle with me - he said you are one of these fishermen that go about, and took me to the watch-house. He said he saw me stooping, and after that I heard them talking. They said Mr. Smith would not prosecute, and they must do it themselves. He then said he thought that I stooped.</p>

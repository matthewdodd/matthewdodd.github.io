                  </hi>. I am engaged by the Mint to look after coiners—on Saturday, 20th June, about 1 o'clock, I went with other officers to 17, Flower and Dean-street—we went through passage, and forced open the back parlour door of the house—upon entering the room, I saw Hogan take a plate from off the table and throw the contents on the fire—we endea<lb></lb>voured to get towards the fire, and the three prisoners tried all they could to keep us back—I threw a pail of water on the fire, and Hogan said, "They won't melt, Mr. Brannan, they are brass"—Inspector Broad then went to the fire and took from it these 25 pieces of coin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which he gave to me—I said to Hogan, "I have received ins tractions from the Solicitor to the Mint to look after you"—he said, "A chap came in here to-day, and I bought them of him for 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; we were filing one side of them off, and colouring them, to look like sixpences"—I said to Mr. Broad, "Probably you will find some more there," and Hogan said, "No, you will not; we are <hi rend="italic">typing</hi> without the wire"—that means electroplating—it can be done with<lb></lb>out the wire, but not so quickly; quite as well and as smoothly—these coins would pass as sixpences—I noticed Brace, with this little tin measure in her hand, get near Hogan, and endeavour to force it into his trousers pocket—I seized her hand, took it from her, and found six medals in the box—they are what are called Prince of Wales' medals, and are similar to those which have undergone the process of filing and electroplating—some are dis<lb></lb>coloured from being thrown on the fire—the feathers are filed down—the plate was wet—I tasted the contents; it contained the materials generally used for colouring and coating counterfeit coin, white metal—I believe it was cyanide of silver.</p>

I went with the last witness—we went first to the back-yard—I looked in at the window previous to the door being broken open, and saw the two female prisoners sitting at the table with a file in one hand and a coin in the other—Hogan was stooping over the table meddling with something in a plate, and as the door was opened I saw him take the plate off the table, and throw it on to the fire—I assisted the other officers to get to the fire, and we had some trouble in doing so—all the prisoners were very violent—the coins were afterwards got from the fire—I found the two files which I had seen them using before I went in.</p>

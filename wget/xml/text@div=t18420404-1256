On the 21st of March I went to the City Kitchen with them—I found there were a number of applicants there—I stopped some moments before I could see any one—I saw a ticket-porter—he said he was so full he could not attend to me—I saw the prisoner with two or three others—he said, "Well, what is it? I will"—I said I wanted these two tickets out—I told him I lived at No. 3, Cook-square, and that the direc<lb></lb>tion was on the coal-tickets as well—he said he knew where it was and he would take them home for me—I delivered him the coal-tickets, and gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s,</hi>—1<hi rend="italic">s,</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to get the coals and potatoes, and <hi rend="italic">U.</hi> for his trouble he said, "Shall you wait?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "They will be some time, you had better go home, and I will bring them after you"—I went and waited at home till between three and four o'clock in the after<lb></lb>noon—I found he did not come, and went again to the City Kitchen after a time I found the prisoner, and asked him when he was going to bring the coals and potatoes home—he said, "Me! it is not me, I have not had a turn to-day," and he laughed at me—I never got either my money, tickets, coals, or potatoes.</p>

                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18050220-32-victim344 t18050220-32-viclabel185"></join>: In the month of August I had a house in Southampton-row, Bloomsbury.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you returning home any night about ten o'clock? - A. I believe in the month of May, on Whit-Tuesday, about a quarter before ten o'clock in the evening, I was returning home; I had been at Somers Town, where I was engaged; it was not dark; I do not know that it was moonlight at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me whether you saw any of the prisoners there at that time? - A. I saw that one, I believe his name is Hodges; I was going across into <placeName id="t18050220-32-crimeloc186">Bedford-square</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18050220-32-crimeloc186" type="placeName" value="Bedford-square"></interp>

               <p>Q. At the time that he accosted you, did you observe any other person near him? - A. I saw no one; I answered him that I was going across Bedford-square myself; we went on together, and he walked along with me; as soon as I had answered him, he began to speak of the great buildings there, and said, what excellent houses, and so on, and when we came to the corner of a street, called Bedford-street, he made a halt for a moment, and said, what a fine house this is (it is a corner house), and what a magnificent portico to this house; he stopped for a moment, and I stopped for a moment for him, out of civility, and in a moment, he made one step behind, and I felt him, as if he had fell against my side; it was a sort of thing, as though a man's foot had slipped.</p>
               <p>Q. At the moment when he hit against you, did you observe any other person? - A. As I was in the act of turning round, to see why he had so struck me in falling against me, two men rushed out, one seized me and the other him.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time did they say any thing in the hearing of the prisoner? - A. We were close together; I inquired, as soon as I could recollect myself, what this meant, and what was the reason of it, and one of the men, or both of them, answered, we are here to detect and seize such men as you; we are two of the Bow-street patrols, and stationed near this spot, for this express purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. On their saying, they were there for the purpose of taking such men into custody, what effect had it on Hodges, one of the prisoners at the bar? - A. He appeared to be in the most extreme state of agitation; he seemed to lose his legs, and to fall in this manner, and held out his arms for this man to support him; he cried out that he was ruined and undone for ever; these people abused him, and swore to him, and abused me very much, and I expostulated with them, as well as I could; they said, we will not let you go, we know what you are, we observed you both, and we will take you to the Coal-yard; I still kept pressing on them, that they had not detected me nor him, that we were perfectly innocent.</p>
               <p>Q. What effect did that produce? - A. Great abuse, with saying, that I had better be quiet, or it would be worse for me; they said they saw what passed, and they conveyed by expressions that they had detected me and this man in some unnatural proceedings.</p>
               <p>Q. When that was communicated to you, was there any promise made by any body? - A. They were leading this man and myself across the square, towards a street that goes into Bedford-square, towards Tottenham-court-road and Gower-street;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180502200028"></xptr>when we got near Tottenham-court-road, one of these pretended officers said to the other, stop a moment, do you not think something may be done without carrying it any further, these men seem both Gentlemen; what a dreadful thing it would be to themselves and families, if matters were carried to extremities; the other man answered, he knew he was determined to do his duty and nothing should persuade him to have it made up; they went on then towards Tottenham-court-road, when the man who had spoken before to the other renewed his request that it might be made up, the other man then said well, we will walk up this way and see if something can be done.</p>
               <p>Q. That was upon his renewing his request; was any thing proposed? - A. We walked up to Tottenham-court-road, and it was proposed that money should be given.</p>
               <p>Q. Who proposed that? - A. One of the two men said that if it was done it must be done by means of money, for they were running a great hazard in adopting this manner of settling it; they walked slowly up Tottenham-court-road, and there was some private conversation amongst themselves, whispering; then one of them said, unless you give twenty pounds, we cannot let you go; I answered I would give twenty pounds; we walked on farther up Tottenham-court-road, and Hodges still seemed to be in that state of agitation, overcome by distress, as it appeared to me he had almost lost his senses; they could not get any answer from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether there was a watch in his pocket? - A. I did; after they returned to Tottenham-court-road, and come along Great Russell-square, towards my house. When we came into Bloomsbury-square, I desired them to stop; I told them that I would give them my word and honour that I would bring them twenty pounds, for them not to follow me; and on one of the men appearing to treat Hodges roughly, he said, he had but little money in his pocket, he had a few Banknotes; and while the man was talking to him, he seemingly pulled it out, and said, see what a fine watch this man has got, if we cannot get the money we must have that; whether he pulled it out of his pocket I cannot tell, I saw it in one of the men's hands; I left them at the moment, I had not far to go to my house, it might be fifty or sixty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in sight of your house? - A. No, it was in Bloomsbury-square; I left them talking about the watch; I went to my own house to fetch the twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the men follow you there? - A. I went into the house, and could not make up any way twenty pounds, so I brought out a Bank-note of thirty pounds, and there was then a third person whom I just had a glimpse of, he ran off; Hodges was not there then, I saw him no more that night; the thirty pound note I gave to one of those two men.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, upon your oath solemnly, what was the motive that induced you to part with that thirty pounds? - A. It was an extreme dread of the unnatural accusation these people held out to me; I saw no more of them that night.</p>
               <p>Q. On the next morning did any body call at your house? - A. On the next day I did not see any body at my house, I was told they had been there; in consequence of what I had been informed, I went to

            , and there two persons were waiting for me.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came there, who were the two persons that you saw? - A. The prisoner Hodges was one, the other person I have never seen since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you learn from Hodges, that he or the other person had called upon you? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you for what purpose he had called at your house? - A. The man that was with Hodges had completely the manner and appearance of a gentleman altogether: as soon as I was in the coffee-room, he said, Mr. Lodge, there was a most unpleasant affair happened to you in Russel-square last night; he said, this young man, meaning Hodges, is my cousin, he is in the greatest distress imaginable, because he must not go home to his father without returning his father his watch, which he was robbed of by the people who had your money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say how that could be recovered? - A. He said, he understood by his cousin it was in the hands of these people; he turned to Hodges, and said, Cousin, where are you to go to redeem it from them; Hodges said, they had appointed to meet him at six o'clock at some place, I think, the Bear, in Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think there was Bow-street made use of? - A. Yes, I perfectly well remember that; he said, at the Brown-bear, or Black-bear, in Bow-street; the other man then said, I do not know what can be done in this case, I know you have been robbed; and he said to me, he has been robbed by the greatest villains on the earth; as to him, I can answer for him, I have known him from his infancy, and I do not doubt but you are as innocent; but it will be a dreadful thing if matters come to light, it will be our duty, with the greatest industry that is possible, to prevent it; and I must try at some means of getting his watch again; he then said to me, I am an officer in the 15th regiment of light dragoons, my name is Williams, and, said he, you know we military men do not abound with money, I have fourteen or fifteen pounds at home, and he turned round to Hodges, and said to him, what have you got; he took out some small notes; then the other man said, between your money and mine we may get your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180502200029"></xptr>watch again; Hodges said I have so much; it was understood that they said they must have as much money of him as they had of me, thirty pounds; then the other man asked me, perhaps, said he, you will give some little assistance; I need not tell you I am ashamed to ask such a thing, but you see the particulars of it; I told him that I would.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact, did you give them any thing at that time? - A. Yes, seven pounds; I went home to Bloomsbury-square, and brought seven pounds, and gave it to Hodges.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you returned, did you see any other persons that you might judge that they had been with Hodges or no? - A. As I went out of Bloomsbury-square, there was some little suspicion that excited my mind: I turned up King-street instead of going down Bloomsbury, I saw Hodges with two other persons I had not seen before, they parted, and I saw no more.</p>

               <p>Q. You went into the country after this? - A. I went on the 16th of August, and returned on the 3d week in September.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it happen, after your arrival in town, that you went to your sister's house in Hertford-street? - A. Yes, on the 17th of November; when I was at my sister's I was informed that somebody wanted me, I came away, I think, about a quarter before ten o'clock, I was going home; in turning towards Piccadilly, the prisoner Hodges came up to me, and asked me, by name, how I did; I looked at him, and did not at the moment recollect him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him from the Wednesday after the Whitsunday? - A. Never; I did not recollect him at the moment, I said so to him; he said, you remember the very unpleasant business that took place in Russell-square a few months ago; I believe I said, yes, I remember it too well; in a moment after he had said that, the prisoner Mahon came up.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the first time you recollect that you ever saw him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the other prisoner at that time? - A. The third man came up a little after; Mahon came up wringing his hands, and endeavouring to be crying.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say was the cause of that distress? - A. Before he said any thing that I could understand, the third man came up.</p>
               <p>Q. That was Rumball? - A. That was the first time I had ever seen him; he stopped at seeing us; I said, Sir, do you belong to this party; he said, yes, I do, putting on a fierce aspect, and my business in the party is, to see that justice is done to these two gentlemen, who are my particular friends; and if you want to know who I am, I am one of the Bow-street patrols, and if you do not act as you should do, my business is to carry you to Mr. Townshend, I suppose you know who I mean. Rumball said that; and if you refuse to settle this matter as you ought, I will carry you before Mr. Townshend; then Mahon, who seemed to be in distress, told me that Hodges was his brother-in-law, and that his father would not do any thing for him, he was a great profligate, and fallen upon him for support, and he was not able to support him; he said, I have a great affection and regard for him, I should like to assist him, but I cannot, I have done many things for him that I ought to be hanged for; we walked on, and Rumball was speaking extremely loud, in a threatening manner, it was a very light night, and about half past eight o'clock; I said, we will walk through the Park, and we will see what is to be done, and I will hear all you have to say; we went through the Park; in the Park the plan was opened, which was, that Hodges should be sent by his cousin to America, and that money was wanting; surely, said Mahon, you cannot grudge a little money for such a purpose; I asked him for what crime, and by what authority the money could be claimed; I was answered, that I had brought Hodges into the practise of unnatural crimes, and therefore I was bound to provide for him, that was the answer from Mahon. On Mahon saying, surely you cannot grudge a little money for such a purpose, Rumball came up, and said, you talk of a little money, not less than two hundred and fifty pounds will do it; I said, that two hundred and fifty pounds was a large sum of money, I could not get two hundred and fifty pounds immediately, it was impossible; we walked into Pall-Mall, Rumball went up to a centinel, and said, are any of our people here tonight; the centinel answered, no, that was in the Park; I having said that two hundred and fifty pounds was a great deal of money to raise, they said, it could not be done for less for the passage and the clothes; I said, in Pall-Mall, you shall have it; I was asked what I could give them then; I said, I had five pounds in my pocket, and if they would go home with me I would give them some more; I said, that five pounds is all I have at this moment.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not part with the five pounds that time? - A. No; we got into a coach at Charing-cross, they went down with me to St. Peter's-hill, where I have a lodging, and as we went along, it was agreed that they should come to me on Monday morning, I told them I would give them ten pounds more, at Doctors'-Commons, and the rest they should come for at a future time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they go into your house at Doctors'-Commons? - A. No; I told them they should have the rest of the two hundred and fifty pounds if they came to me on Monday, I would contrive means to get it, or words to that purpose.

            .</p>
               <p>Q. The consequence of which was, the officers were to be at your house the next day? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the next day, what officers came to your house? - A. Taunton and Baker.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the house did they come to you? - A. They came to an apartment in the Herald's-College; I had borrowed it for the purpose, as a convenient place to manage the matter: it was a small room, with a larger room behind, adjoining it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they bored some holes to see what was done? - A. Yes; and it was done so as to give them a command of what was done. At eleven o'clock, I saw Hodges coming across the Court-yard of the Herald's College, I went out to meet him; he came to me and said, my brother is here, do you wish to see him; I said, I understand your brother is the party most concerned in this business; he went then from me, and returned the second time, with Mahon and Rumball; they then came into this room, and the officers were in the adjoining room.</p>
               <p>Q. To observe what was done there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who addressed you first? - A. I think Rumball.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ask for any thing? - A. No, I do not recollect that he asked for any thing; they sat down at the table; I said, I hope this unpleasant affair will be settled, and there will be no more using of ill language; I hope I shall hear no more of this; one and all said, no, certainly you shall hear no more of it; I then said, I can do it in no way but this; you know you had fifteen pounds last Saturday night; (Rumball said, yes;) I will give you a draft for one hundred and eighty-five pounds, which I had ready, in a fictitious name and place; I said, I have sent to a friend in Norfolk-street, and I will go and get fifty pounds of him, which will make it two hundred and fifty pounds, with the fifteen pounds you have had.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this conversation loud enough to be heard in the adjoining room? - A. I have no doubt but it was; I gave them this fictious draft which was to be paid the next day; we went out into the street and went into St. Paul's Church-yard, and there we took a coach, and when we got to Temple-bar just as we were coming through, I said I have parted with so much money upon a groundless occasion knowing that the Bow-street men were near, I saw them at the time; I said that man, meaning Hodges, knows I am perfectly innocent, though you have threatened me in this manner, if he chooses to declare it, to which Hodges made no answer, but Rumball said, Oh, if we are to have any more conversation upon it, we have not done with you, you shall have your d - d draft again, and you shall go to Bow-street; I answered, my friend without any trouble to you, we shall be there in a few minutes, and at that moment the officers came and opened the coach doors and came in.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you solemnly whether there was any foundation for that accusation made against you? - A. No, if there had I should not have stood in this place now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. On the 17th of November, was that the first time you saw either Mahon or Rumball? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you have described Mahon coming up to you wringing his hands and saying his distress was on account of his brother-in-law Hodges? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Saying that Hodges was ruined and must go out of his country, he asked your assistance; he knew some Bristol or Liverpool captain that would take him to America? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On that day was any money asked of you upon any other account, but for the purpose of assisting Hodges in leaving the country? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the evening was it that you attended these persons in Piccadilly? - A. About a quarter before eight.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you yourself proposed to take a walk through the Park? - A. Because Rumball was so noisy.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had gone through the Park, you took a hackney-coach at Charing-cross - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go out of the coach in your way from Charing-cross to Doctors' Commons? - A. I should have mentioned that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of them get out of the coach? - A. I think twice or three time on purpose for buying a stamp, for the remainder of the 250 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you yourself get out of the coach for that purpose? - A. No, not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were at your lodgings on St. Peter's-hill you left them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You went into the house yourself, and the door was shut? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there many other persons in the house; who let you in? - A. A female servant let me in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the master of the house at home? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people live in that house? - A. I believe at the time Mr. Scott and his son were inhabitants of that house, and a female servant, but I dare say they were not at home.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact you did not see them, nor did you make any enquiry for them? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180502200031"></xptr>Q. How long did you stay in your house? - A. I believe not two minutes; as little time as I could get the note out of the bureau.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give them the precise sum of fifteen pounds? - A. I gave them the precise sum of fifteen pounds; I had a one pound or a two pound note in my pocket, and it was observed that I had more, upon which one of the prisoners, I believe Rumball, said, do not take his one or two pound note, fifteen pound is enough.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave them the fifteen pound, and the one or two pound you kept? - A. Just so.</p>
               <p>Q. The purpose for which you gave this fifteen pound was to enable Hodges to go to America; was that the purpose? - A. Certainly not; I knew from that moment that which I had never known before, and I strongly suspected that he was in collusion with those persons.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe from what we have learned from your Counsel, you had advanced a sum of money to liberate Hodges from his confinement? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before that? - A. I was attacked privately, about four or five days before that, by two persons, in company with a third, who called himself Captain of the Bow-street patrol, and who said they were twenty-two in number.</p>
               <p>Q. That was on the 12th of November? - A. The explanation is, that those two persons I first saw in Russell-square, and this third man, an elderly man, who called himself Captain, met me coming from the Heralds' Office; he said he wanted to save this man if he could, if not, I must be farther involved, for this reason, if Hodges be not sent out of the country, he will accuse these men, and he will call you as a witness against them; if he be not put out of the way, and if you do not furnish money for that purpose, we must necessarily accuse you, to prevent your coming evidence against them. - I do not know that it is necessary to go into all this.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason that was proposed to you? - A. To discharge Hodges; at the same time, these men said it must be done by Jew bail, which I desired to have an explanation of; I did not know what it meant.</p>
               <p>Q. What explanation was given to you? - A. They told me there were persons who lived by giving bail, and that they left their houses after bail was given, and were not to be found.</p>
               <p>Q. What sum of money were you to give to procure those persons? - A. One hundred pounds, and more.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did give an hundred pound, and more? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You believed the story that Hodges was really in custody at that time, and therefore you gave them one hundred pounds? - A. I did not know but he was regularly taken into custody, and the man who called himself Captain of the Bow-street patrol took a staff out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, between the 12th and the 17th go out to inquire whether the story was true? - A. I did not, and till the moment that Rumball told me in the street, by Piccadilly, and threatened me, if I did not do so and so, he would carry me to Mr. Townshend, I thought I was in the custody of these three Bow-street officers; from that moment I knew I was not, because no Bow-street patrol would talk so; I was then in more fears than one.</p>
               <p>Q. Your mind was then delivered from the fear of being in the custody of officers? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I mean no imputation to you; there is not the least imputation on your character in all this? - A. I cannot help my feelings.</p>
               <p>Q. When you gave the ten pounds and the five pounds where were you? - A. At the door of the house where I have an apartment in Doctors' Commons.</p>
               <p>Q. Your servant was close at hand, if you chose to call her; how near was the watchman? - A. I do not know; I had not been in the house forty-eight hours at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Certainly there was a watchman near; you made yourself an appointment to meet them on Monday morning; did you communicate it to Sir

            .</p>
               <p>Q. You appointed them to call on you again for the remainder of the money, for the purpose of your having persons to take them up? - A. When I gave them the fifteen pounds I acted under every appearance of extreme fear, and the utmost dread and horror.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not an idea of bringing them there on Monday, for the purpose of having them taken up? - A. I had been tossed about in my mind, and hesitating whether it was possible, that if I could prevail upon them to take the fifteen pounds, and leave the matter there, whether I could prevail upon them not to call again; I expected each application would be the last.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell them to call on you on Monday morning, on purpose to have some persons there ready to take them up? - A. No, I gave them the money to get rid of them, knowing I should have the whole of the day to consider what was to be done.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watson. Q. On Saturday, the 17th, what length of time was consumed in this conversation? - A. About an hour.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. From the time you had been at your sister's house to the time you arrived at your own lodgings, where you parted with fifteen pounds,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180502200032"></xptr>you had no communication with any friend of your own? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came to the house the only person you saw was a female servant? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The master of the house and his son you did not see, therefore there was nobody in the house to whom you might with delicacy communicate the situation you were in? - A. I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. You were asked whether at the time you parted with this fifteen pounds you parted with it for them to call again, and to have persons ready to take them; I understood you that you parted with it under the impression of fear on your mind? - A. Yes, it was to get rid of them that night.</p>
               <p>Q. You were asked what was the reason that induced you, after you met these two men, to part with the money; whether it was to get Hodges out of the country, or for the purpose of protecting your character from an accusation of this sort against you? - A. No doubt that was my grand motive, to preserve my character from a dread of this sort.</p>
               <p>Q. And that continued to act upon you till you saw Sir

               <p>Q. Rumball saying to you that he would take you to Mr. Townshend was the first time you discovered that you were not in the hands of Bow-street officers? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been with them before Rumball said this? - A. I suppose something more than three quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you gave the ten pound note and the five pound note, knowing yourself to be in the hand of impostors, and persons who represented themselves as Bow-street officers, under what impression of mind did you part with the money? - A. To be free from those things, and to have the next day to advise with my friends what was best to be done.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know what you were afraid would happen to you that night if you had not given them the money? - A. I had no alternative, either to give them the money or to take them into custody instantly, which I could not conveniently have done at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it under the apprehension that you would be carried before Townshend? - A. It was under the general apprehension which had lasted throughout, from a charge of that nature; upon that ground I engaged to give them fifteen pounds, and having the next day to consider what was best to be done.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you seen the other room before you were placed in this room where you were? - A. Yes, these folding doors opened in there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the room where Mr. Lodge and the prisoners went in afterwards? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. When you placed yourselves, you and Baker, by the direction of Mr. Lodge, did you make any experiment by which you could see what passed in the room? - A. I bored holes in each of the pannels; I looked through one and Baker through the other.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you had bored the holes did Mr. Lodge and the prisoners go into that room? - A. They came in in about a quarter of an hour after we were there.</p>
               <p>Q. Then state what you heard pass, and what you saw there? - A. Mr. Lodge and the three prisoners came in; I saw them; those are the persons at the bar; they seated themselves down in a chair, and a conversation ensued; Mr. Lodge signified that he wanted to settle this disagreeable business, and he said to one of them, do you belong to Marlborough-street; Rumball (by his voice) answered, no, I belong to Bow-street, there are near five hundred of us under the direction of Sir Rich. Ford; Mr. Lodge then said, I have given you fifteen pounds, the answer was, yes, by Rumball; Mr. Lodge then proposed to give a draft, and to go to a friend of his in Norfolk-street, to borrow some money to make up two hundred and fifty pounds; they then agreed to walk to St. Paul's, and take a coach to go to Norfolk-street; they then left the room; Baker and me walked out after them; we followed them to where they took a coach, at a distance; they took a coach in St. Paul's church-yard, and we pursued them to the corner of Norfolk-street; then we immediately opened the doors and leaped into the coach, and took them all to Bow-street; I searched Rumball; on Rumball was found a watch and a gold chain; I saw Hodges searched, he had a watch; and Mahon had a chain and a seal, but no watch; I searched Mahon's lodgings on the following day, and found a hat, a veil, and some duplicates.</p>

               <p>Q. I will begin with the last you have got in your hand; were these freely and voluntarily given? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any promise of not prosecuting Rumball before that examination was taken by you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any promise or threat, or any hopes held out to him, that he should become a witness? - A. No, no hopes; the first time that Rumball was brought before me, he declined being examined; I rather think he had been drinking; he was brought before me some days afterwards; he then begged pardon; I asked him if he would be examined; he said he would, and he would speak the whole truth; he disclosed some circumstances that were material of other persons, who are not in custody; then seeing him desirous of having some sort of favour shewn him, I thought he meant that he might be admitted an evidence, as he expressed that he might be a witness, but as he had acted as an officer I did not suffer him; I certainly do think that he was given to understand that whatever he said should not be made use of against him.</p>

At one o'clock in the morning on the 25th of August I was sitting up in bed watching the door—I saw the prisoner putting his hand through the fan-light, and dragging this shawl and scarf through the window—I went out of a side door, went round, and saw the prisoner and another man—I presented a pistol at them—they both ran—I ran after them—the other crossed the road—I followed the prisoner, and Murphy stopped him—I was behind him—I found this shawl and scarf at the foot of the door under the prisoner's feet—they are my master's.</p>

I then suspected the prisoner, and went in pursuit of him to Smithfield: the turnpike man told me my mare was taken up, and put into Mr. Baker's grounds at Paddington, and that he saw a man go by with a lamb on his head, and a saddle on his back, who had told him. his horse had thrown him: the prisoner was taken up, and he confessed the taking the things mentioned, to me and Mr. Brown, and that one Barker was concerned with him, who, after he had given him the lamb before him on horseback, got up behind him ; that they rode as far as Tyburn, when he took the lamb and saddle on his back, and did not know what was become of the mare and Barker; he own'd also he had sold the lamb to a pork butcher for 5 s. at an ale-house in the pork-market, Leaden-hall ; then he told me he carried the saddle to one Mr. Linch, a baker, in the Mint-square, Southwark. We took him after this to justice Fielding, where he confessed he had taken the mare, in order to carry the lamb away, and Barber was to bring her back again; and that he had sold the lamb, and left the saddle at Mr. Linch's; I went to Mr. Linch, there I found the saddle; I also found the man that bought the lamb, and he deliver'd the skin, which I don't swear to, but believe it to be mine.</p>

            . On Good Friday in the morning I went into the Bee-hive alehouse in Leaden-hall market for a pennyworth of purl, there was a lamb running about house, I asked whose it was, and was told it was the prisoner's, who lay sleeping with his head on the table, and I awaked him: he said he brought it out of Surry, and was going with it to Smithfield : I bought it of him for five shillings: he told me he had fed it with a tea-pot and milk. The prosecutor came to me, I told as I have here: the prisoner owned before me at the New Prison, that he stole it from Mr. Finch at Wilsdon.</p>

            . The prisoner having lived at a relation's of mine, had been often at my house, and came again on Good Friday in the morning, between nine and ten, with a saddle ; he said Mr. Underwood (with whom he lived) had lost his saddle and he was desired to get him another; and that Mr. Underwood desired him to leave it at my house; and that I was to give him 3 s. 6 d. which I did, and got him to sign a little bit of a note that he had received the money. I had no mistrust, had he asked for more I should have let him had it. The saddle produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.</p>

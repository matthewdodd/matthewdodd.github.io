                  </hi>. I am a wood hawker, of Deptford—on 26th December I saw my wheelbarrow safe in my yard, and missed it the next afternoon, between 4 and 5 o'clock—it is worth 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I saw it again at Mr. Marion's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wheelwright, of Croydon—I know the prisoner—on Friday evening, 27th December, he opened my door and said, "Harry, will you buy a barrow?"—there was another man with him whom I did not know—I said, "I don't want no barrow; I have trouble enough with what I have got; what do you want for it?"—he said "15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I said, "Perhaps it is stolen"—he said, "You have known me long enough to know I should not do that"—I have known him two years—he said, "I should not sell it, only I am hard up"—I asked the man with him if it was his—he said, "Yes," and that he had bought it at Tunbridge Wells—the prisoner said that the other man picked him up at Norwood, and asked him if he could sell the barrow—I paid 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, and I think I paid it to the prisoner, and gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for himself, because the strange man never came inside my shop—they placed the barrow in front of my shop, and I went indoors; when I came out again it was gone—I ran along the road, received informa<lb></lb>tion, and found the barrow thrown over an embankment—I took it home, and kept it for a week.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did not you state at Croydon that you paid John Roland the money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I was not asked—I did state at Deptford that I did not know which of you I paid it to, but I am since of opinion that I gave the money into your hands, because the other man was in the road.</p>

I am the wife of John White, we keep a shop, in Chi<lb></lb>chester-place, I think in the parish of St. Pancras—the shop forms part of the house—my attention was called by the policeman to a hole in a pane of glass in the shop-window—I had a piece of linen cloth lying behind that hole—the same evening the prisoner was brought into the shop in custody—I then missed the piece of linen-cloth.</p>

On Saturday afternoon, the 2nd of March, I noticed a hole in the prosecutor's window—I told Mrs. White of it and remained at a distance, <hi rend="italic">to</hi> watch—in about half an hour I saw the prisoner and two others walk slowly by the window, down Derby-street, and up Liverpool-street—they then came back again to the window, and made a stop—I was on the other side of road—I immediately crossed, but before I got up to them, they walked away twenty or thirty yards—I passed them, and saw they had nothing—I was in plain clothes—I walked in a contrary direction, and saw them coming back, towards the window—they got to it before I did—the prisoner stood outside the other two and put both his hands together inside the pane <hi rend="italic">of glass</hi>, and at the same moment some<lb></lb>thing came into his hand, but I could not see what it was—I ran up—he had something about a foot and a half long, and about the size</p>

               <p>of my arm—they separated, and the prisoner and another ran up Maiden-lane—I ran after them—they turned back, and ran up Pancras-road, where I stopped the prisoner, in consequence of his suddenly turning, upon finding I was close to him—he said, "What do you want me for?"—I said, "For taking that piece of cloth "—he said "I never was near the window"—I had said nothing about a window—I said, "I will let you know about that"—he said, "Well, if you speak the truth, you can't say you saw anything in my hand "—I took him to the station, but found nothing on him—the cloth was not found.</p>

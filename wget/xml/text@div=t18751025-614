                  </hi>. I am second clerk at the Southwark police-court—on 28th September George Frederick Holt was charged before Mr. Partridge with attempting to pick the pocket of Ann Dawsou of a purse and 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in bronze—I produce the charge-sheet—Ann Dawson appeared and was sworn—I took her deposition—this is it. (<hi rend="italic">The deposition stated that she found the prisoner's hand in her pocket on two occasions, once at the Elephant and Castle, and once afterwards. The part on which perjury was alleged was that she did not ask Holt to treat her, that they did not go to a public-house and have bread and cheese, that he did not pay for a pot of ale, and that she did not say "Let us have some eels</hi>") She was asked to sign her deposition and refused; she said she would rather not—the Magistrate heard Julia Martin and two other witnesses, one for the prisoner, William Varden, and ultimately discharged Holt; Dawson and Martin were taken into cuestudy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner gave no reason that I heard for not sign—ing her deposition; she was asked whether she would sign and she drew back and said she would rather not—that was after the other witnesses had been examined and after the Magistrate had put the case back for the police to go to the public-house and make inquiries.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gilder, and live at 23, Lancaster Street, Borough—about 5.50 on the evening of 22nd September, I went into the Elephant and Castle public-house with Varden, who I met with that day—I called for 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of gin-and-bitters—the prisoner and Martin were there together drinking a pint of half-and-half—the prisoner touched me under the chin and said "Are you going to treat me, <hi rend="italic">duckey</hi>"—I said "You may have a drop of beer if you like," and I paid for a pint—I did not put my hand in her pocket whilst at, the bar—she did not seize my hand, nothing was said about it—the four of us went out and stopped just outside the door and she said "I am very sorry I can't treat you, I am going by the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>, and 1 have only just enough"—I said "You can have a drop more if you like,"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187510250068"></xptr>
               <p>so we four went over to the Little Elephant beer-house and I called for a pot of 6 ale and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of bread and cheese, which I paid for—we were all <hi rend="italic">larking</hi> there; the prisoner was pulling me about and I touched her on the breast, and she put her hand on my thigh and said she could not take me home, but if 1 liked to go anywhere else I could—I said no, I did not wish it, I had just come out about some things for my wife—we came out and I said to my companion "Come down and have some eels"—the pri<lb></lb>sone said "Aint you going to take me with you"—I said "No, I have not got the money"—she said "Oh, you are a shabby devil"—I said "Good night, I am off," and I went off pretty quickly—after I had been in the eel shop about three minutes a policeman came in, caught hold of me, and said I was charged with attempting to pick a woman's pocket—the prisoner was just outside the door—I was taken to the station, and next day before the Magistrate, who discharged me—I knew nothing of the prisoner.</p>

            . On Saturday morning, the 17th of November, West went down to Ealing with me, and claimed the mare which was in the coach. On Tuesday, the 16th about three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner brought two mares to my back yard, at Ealing. He said he had two useful mares which he thought of service to me; I I said I had plenty, and I did not want any. We at last agreed to swap one, I exchanged one of mine for one he brought, and gave him a 5 l. note, and eight half-crowns to boot; he said he had rode her a great many miles, and could recommend her. I was to give him another 1 l. if is turned out well - he said he had had the mare some time. I do not recollect whether he said how long he had this one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not a young man come down with the prisoner - A. Yes; I have not seen him since, the prisoner said he went to London, and had come from there; Studbury was present when we agreed for it - its legs were swollen, as if it had come some distance; he said he had put a boot on in travelling, and had tied it rather tight, which caused it.</p>

            . I live at Acton, and was present when the prisoner brought two mares into Ives's yard; he offered them to him, Ives said "I do not want horses, I have more than I want." I advised him to make a chap - Ives's horse was brought, and 6 l. given to boot, and the other mare, but it was not the mare in question, he never said how long he had had that mare, this was the other. After dealing for that mare, he requested Ives to drive the other in his coach to London, and when Ives was returned with the coach from London to Ealing, I was there; West claimed the mare in the coach, and had her away afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. I have known him twenty-five or twenty-six years, he invariably bore a good character, he has brought from a hundred to a hundred and fifty colts that road, and was well known in the place.</p>

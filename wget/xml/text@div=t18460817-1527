                  </hi>. I am the wife of the prisoner; we live in Cla<lb></lb>rence-road, Haggerstone—on Wednesday afternoon, about two o'clock, the prisoner came home to dinner—I had heard from Mrs. Gray that he had been with some women, and began to abuse him—he denied it, but I persisted in doing so—he begged me to leave the room, but I would not—he said he would leave it himself—he was eating his dinner at the time, and had a knife in his hand—I was still abusing him—he struck the knife violently upon the table out of his hand, and it struck me in the ear—he did not throw it at me, it was an accident—it cut my ear, and I cut my hand in pulling it out—he never did anything of the sort before—we never had words till these people came to the bouse.</p>

                  </hi>. I was present when the prisoner came in on the 8th of July—he and his wife quarrelled about money, I believe, and about maintaining her children—she had been out the whole day, and came home to suckle her baby—he sat down to dinner—they began to quarrel, and in his passion he threw the knife at her—it stuck in her ear—she got up and said, "For God's sake, Mrs. Gray, take care of my child, I am a dead woman"—I am sure he threw the knife at her—it did not go upon the table—it went out of his hand into her ear—she cut both her fingers in trying to get it out—he got up directly and took it out of her ear himself—this is the knife—(<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

On the 8th of July the prosecutrix waa brought to my house by her husband and another man, bleeding profusely from a wound in the lower lobe of the left ear, penetrating to the bone—she was very faint, and remained so some time; and after resting in my house several hours, she was taken home—she was not in any great danger—she had no bad symptoms—she was well in about a fortnight.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical student, and reside in Camden Road—about half-past six on the evening of 29th January I went into a public-house in Mercer Street, Long Acre—just before I got to the door the prisoner, with three others, asked me something about the way to the Strand—I did not give them any direct answer, but passed on—a few minutes afterwards I returned, and was crossing over Mercer Street to Long Acre when the prisoner and three others hustled me, and the prisoner put his hands over my mouth—I tried to get away, and struck him—he threw me on my side, and cut my knee in two places—he ran down Mercer Street, and I pursued him for about forty yards, when he was stopped by a policeman—I do not know where the other three ran to—I gave him in charge—I was about seven or ten minutes in the public-house.</p>

About half-past six on the evening of 29th January I was on duty in Mercer Streetz—I heard a cry of "Stop thief!" coming from the direction of Long Acre, and presently I saw the prisoner running very fast in the centre of the road—I stopped him—the prosecutor was a few yards behind—he said, "I give this man in custody for assaulting me, and stealing my umbrella, with three others"—the prisoner said, "That is a mistake, sergeant; it is not me, it is the others"—I took him to the station—the prosecutor was perfectly sober.</p>

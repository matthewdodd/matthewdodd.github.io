I am one of the surgeon's to St. Bartholomew's hospital, and attended Mr. Cox there—he had a punctured wound over his left shoulder, another a little below his left collar bone, and an incised wound four or five inches long on the left side of the neck, which had divided several vessels, and laying bare the main artery of the neck, but not dividing it—there was considerable hmorrhage from all the wounds—I could put almost the whole of my forefinger into the punctured wounds—they were two inches and a half deep—they were dangerous; the incised wound was especially dangerous—this knife is exactly such an instrument as would inflict them—one wound was punctured, and then the knife had slipped along and made the incised wound—a considerable amount of violence would be required to make the punctured wounds, because they went through his coat—this incised wound did not require so much violence as the others, because his neck was bare—he was in the hospital three weeks, and is still under my care—he became so ill at home that he was obliged to be taken in again—he is likely to get over it.</p>

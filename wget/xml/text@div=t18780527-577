                  </hi>. I am a seaman, of Raleigh Terrace, St. John's Wood—on 12th May I was in Devonshire Place, and saw the prisoner kicking up a noise with some person—I told him he would get into trouble, and advised him to go home, and he came up and pushed me about—I asked him what he meant by it—he went away, and I went towards home—I met him about five minutes after with his mother—she said he was her son, and I said, "If it is your son I will speak to you;" with that the prisoner struck me three blows in the chest—I did not see what with—about a second after I felt blood run down my leg into my boot—he immediately ran indoors—I was taken to the dispensary, and a policeman took the prisoner—I felt rather queer the Sunday and Monday after, but not ill—I did not strike the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am resident medical officer at the Western General Dispensary—Lucas was brought there on 12th May, suffering from a short vertical incised wound over the inner end of the left collar bone, which bled a great deal—I should say it struck the collar-bone—it might have been inflicted by a sharp instrument—it was not actually dangerous, though in a dangerous part—he appeared very excited—he is quite well now.</p>

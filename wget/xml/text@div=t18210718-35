I ran after her, and lost her in George-court. I was not quite sober - I had drank a pot of ale. I saw her next day at her lodging, as I had detained the other, who told us where she lived. I have not recovered it. I am certain of her person - the streets were lit with gas. I positively swear to her. Before she took the watch, she laid hold of the chain, and said</p>

I am a plumber, of 12, Western Terrace, Green Lanes, Stoke Newington—I identify this coat and trousers—on 19th May, about 10.10 or 10.15, I closed my house and parlour door—about ten minutes afterwards my wife called my attention to something—I went up stairs and found the parlour door and the inner door of the front door open—I did not miss the property till the constable came, about 12 o'clock—it had been in the parlour behind the shop—when he came I searched and missed a pair of boots, the coat, with some letters in the pocket which were of more value to me than the coat, and a pair of trousers—I have never seen the letters since—I went to the station and found the clothes there, and a memorandum from Mr. Perry, in the trousers pocket.</p>

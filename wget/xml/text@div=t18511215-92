                  </hi>. I live in Hemlock-court; my husband is a printer.</p>
               <p>I keep a chandler's-shop. On 10th Dec. the prisoner came for 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of tobacco—I served him—he gave me a half-crown, I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—I then went to serve a person at another counter, and the prisoner said he had halfpence enough to pay for the tobacco, and asked what the price was, I told him—he pushed back the change to me on the counter, and I gave him the half-crown—I saw one of the shillings was bad, it was not one that I gave him—I am quite confident that I had no bad shilling—I did not mix the shilling he gave me with any other—he went out of the shop directly—I went after him and asked him to give me a good shilling for the bad one—he wanted the shilling back from me, which I refused—a policeman was standing by, and I gave him in charge with the shilling—I am certain that the two shillings I gave the prisoner were good, I tried them when I took them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Does any other person serve in that shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not to take money—I did not make any mark on the money when I gave it you—I do not know what date the shillings were—you moved the money on the counter—I put no mark on the shilling till I got to the station—I had put it in the till with three half-crowns and three sixpences, but I am certain I had no other shilling—I afterwards gave it to the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and live in Duke-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields. Last Friday the prisoner came to my shop, about 9 o'clock in the evening—he asked for an ounce of coffee, and a quarter of a pound of sugar, they came to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he laid down 11/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said I required another halfpenny—he then threw down a half-crown, and said, "Take it out of that"—I put the half-crown in a detector, and found the edge bent—I stepped on one side, and said, "I think this is a bad half-crown"—I took a packing-needle out of my desk and crossed the head of the half-crown—the prisoner used very bad language, and asked if I thought he was a b——y smasher, and he called me a b y fool—I said I would try and find that out—I called the policeman, and gave him the half-crown.</p>

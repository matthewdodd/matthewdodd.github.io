I rented the house - on the 15th of April, I was on duty at the watch-house; I went home about half-past four o'clock in the morning, I secured the door after me, and went to bed; the house was safe; about a quarter before six o'clock an alarm was given that my ground floor window was open, it was down, and the shutters closed; when I went to bed I am certain, the shutters were not barred; my son was the first person up, he is not here - I went down, and found the articles mentioned in the indictment, gone - my son had put the window down. There was a large box close to the window, it was not locked; a bag of linen was in this box, containing thirty-one caps, and thirty-one tippets, belonging to a Charity school; it was gone - my son Thomas's hat was on the same box - I also missed two waistcoats and a gown off the box; the bonnets were in it, the prisoner was quite a stranger - I received information, and about nine o'clock at night, and went with Thompson to Pentonville, and found the bag, and some of the things in it - I apprehended the prisoner at the Blue-posts, Shoe-lane, about a week after the robbery, and took him to the watch-house.</p>

            . I live in Lamb-court, Clerkenwell, about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's. I am a drover; I was going from Smithfield, on Sunday morning, the 15th of April, between four and five o'clock, and saw the prisoner putting some things into a bundle, about a dozen yards from Norris's house; there was a blue gown, a bonnet, and other things which looked white; I walked on, he followed me, and asked if I knew where he could get something to drink, I said, there was a house higher up, he said,</p>
               <p>"Do you know any body who will buy these things;" this made me suspect, and I told the watchman - I described him, and saw him in custody afterwards, I know him to be the man.</p>

            . I am the wife of W. Norris. When I went to bed at twelve o'clock, the window was down, and the shutter closed - not barred. I awoke about five o'clock, and was told of the robbery - my son got down first. I found the window closed, the box stood close under the window, the bag was in it; the caps and tippets were in it when I went to bed - they were worth 31 s. altogether; the gowns and one waistcoat were on the top of the box, and an old hat of my son Thomas's.</p>

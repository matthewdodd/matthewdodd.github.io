            . On the 12th of January, I was in Kingsland-road, between seven and eight o'clock at night, coming from Kingsland to town; I had been to Kingsland - I had not dined there; I was sober - I had five 10l. notes rolled up together in my fob, and one 10l. note, six sovereigns, five half-sovereings, and one King William and Queen Mary guinea, in a purse separate from the other money; as I went along the road I met the two prisoners - they said they were in great distress, and asked me to relieve them; I passed on endeavouring to get from them - they followed me, and held me by the arm, one on each side, not holding me forcibly; they were very meanly attired - I told them I was not accustomed to stand and talk to people in the street; they pressed on me to go and see their situation, for they were certain I would take it into consideration, and recommend them to some society - I objected to go to their place of abode, and was about to give them some money, when they refused it, and still pressed me to go and see their situation - I then went to Hoxton-town, which is where they said they lived, and when I came to the corner of Davis-place I objected going further; I had not gone<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150028"></xptr>into a public-house, but about one hundred yards before, I got to that place (as it was very cold) I stood at the door, and gave them some English gin, which I paid for, and drank with them - I did not go into the house; I am sure it did not intoxicate me - when we came to Davis-place I objected to go down; the prisoner Ann caught me by the arm and pressed me down the passage, down Davis-place, and I went into the house; I had not the slightest reason to believe them women of the town - they told me they were tradesmen's daughters, out of work, and in the greatest distress; I went down with them to their house - they opened the door with a key; it was a very mean hovel, with no fire in it, nor any light; I then turned round to go away, and Frances held me while the other got a light - when the light was got they were about to light the fire, but could not scrape up coal to light it with; there were a few sticks and ashes - they said it being very cold they would light a fire, and if I would sit down they would relate their case to me; they began to state that they were hair feeders - I asked what that was; they said they supplied the stuffers of sofa covers, as they could not go on with their work without a feeder - I saw a little bag hanging over the fire-place; they said it was full of duplicates of goods they had pawned for support - I did not look at it; I gave them money to fetch victuals and drink - Ann went for it, and brought some boiled pork, bread, and a pint of beer; they brought some gin - that was not drank for a considerable time; I think they called it a quartern and a half - I partook of what they brought, and might be there nearly two hours, but after the first hour I stopped because I could not get away, for they had locked me in; when I left some of the gin was left; (the bottle was on the table the following morning) immediately that I came out of the house Frances came out after me - I left Ann in the house.</p>

               <p>Q. While you were in the house, had you observed any thing done to your pockets? A. I found Ann several times making an attempt at my pockets - first on one side, and then the other; in consequence of that I stated to them that I had property about me, and I immediately put my hand to my fob, lifted the notes out, and saw that they were all right - before I left the house I had put them safely back again, and buttoned my coat over my pockets; Frances followed me out of the house - she said she would go a little way down Hoxton with me; I told her there was no need for that, for I wished to get from them, finding what they were - she still persisted in going with me, and about two hundred yards from the house the sister came up, tapped me on the shoulder, and said,"Is he going to give us any thing to drink before he leaves us?" I consented to give them something to drink to get rid of them - I know my property was all safe at that time; I crossed the way into the Red Lion, in Hoxton - they went in, and called for a quartern of gin; they poured out a glass of gin for me to drink, but I objected to have any - I asked the landlord's son for a little water, and put about half a glass of gin into it, which I drank; they drank the rest - I paid for it, and immediately came out; they came out immediately, and at the corner of the house is Red Lion-passage, which is a thoronghfare into the Kingsland-road - they endeavoured to force me down there, but I objected; they said it was my nearest way, as I was going Hackney way - I had not got more than twenty paces down the passage before Frances took hold of me, and struck my head violently against the wall; Ann tore open my coat, and forced her hand into my fob- I said, "Don't attempt to rob me;" she got hold of the notes - I held my watch in one hand, and my hand on my purse, which I thought would keep all the money in, but I was affected with the blow; in less than a minute she said, "Come along, Fan, I have got it all"- she put a few words at the end of that, and said, "All is right."</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stand or fall from the blow? A. I fell on the ground; I laid there scarcely five minutes before I heard the voice of a female, but I had not power to articulate - I heard her saying, "Get up," and immediately some watchmen came and helped me up; they took me to Hoxton watch-house - I staid there all night, and next morning, a little after seven o'clock, went to the place I had seen them at the night before, in Davis-place; I found the house open, but nobody there - the window was thrown up, and the shutters put too; I called out - nobody answered - I went in at the window, and went up stairs; nobody was there: every thing appeared in the place as I had left it, except the little bag over the mantle-piece, and that was gone - I gave notice to stop the Bank notes next morning: as I had the numbers of them - they were all paid into the Bank three weeks after; they have not been stopped.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you at all in liquor, or unable to take care of yourself? A. I was not; I had not the slightest improper intention in going with them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. You say you were not in liquor at all? A. Not at all; I dined at home, at No. 21, Dean-street, Commercial-road - I went to Kingsland to tea; I drank nothing at dinner but a little porter - there was a pot among four of us; I drank about half a pint - I am certain I did not drink a pint; I set off to Kingsland about two o'clock - I drank nothing in the way; I went to a friend's there, not to a public-house - I am not addicted to go to public-houses: I never get tipsy- I do not know when I was in a state of intoxication; it being cold weather I took a glass or two of gin that night, as I stated - I might be at Kingsland an hour and a half; I took nothing but tea, and about half a wine-glass of gin- I called no where on the road; I was stopped by them on Kingsland-bridge - I stopped at so house on the road; I do not know the sign of the first house I went to with them; I had one glass of gin there, but did not go into the house - Ann went in and fetched it out to the door; I did not remain there three minutes - when I was at their house they fetched two pints of beer; I drank very little of the first pint, but more of the last, and that stupified me - they drank very little of the last pint; there was some stuff in it, for I observed it - I had only part of one glass of gin there; nearly all the last gin was left - I drank none of that; what I drank was before I had the beer - I smoked a pipe there; I sent for a bushel of coals for them, and paid for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not all on perfectly good terms at their house? A. Not all the time I was there - when I found them hustling about my pockets I was afraid of my mo<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150029"></xptr>ney; I felt for them from the state of the weather, and was interested to hear their tale - I did go up stairs with one of them, but I was not there two minutes; I came down immediately.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you go up stairs for any improper purpose? A. I did not.</p>
               <p>MR. HEATON. Q. Will you swear you were not up stairs half an hour? A. I was not up stairs five minutes, I am certain; the stupefaction did not remain on me long- it was only when I drank the beer: I am a married man - I do not think I could be up stairs more than three minutes; I went up, because one of them asked me to go up and see their habitation up stairs, to see their furniture - the bed lay down on a low bedstead; one of them said it was a very mean one - I do not recollect making any reply.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did you not reply, "It is good enough for you and me?" A. No, on my oath, I did not; only one of them went up stairs with me; after I came down some gin was fetched, which I paid for - they fetched a quartern and a half twice, and two pints of beer; I think I gave them 3s. - that is 1s. 6d. each time for the liquor, 2s. to fetch meat and bread, and 1s. 6d. for coals; 1s. 6d. will buy a pint of gin, but they did not buy that quantity - it was in a small bottle.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, will you swear you were perfectly sober when you left that house? A. Yes, I was so far sober; I do not think what I had drank had hurt me, not to make me incapable of knowing what I was about, and taking care of myself - I afterwards drank about half a glass of gin in water; I am positive I drank nothing more.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you did not fall from drunkenness, instead of being struck? A. No - the cause of my falling was Frances striking my head against the wall; the watchman carried me to the watch-house; I was incapable from the stun I had received, of walking - they robbed me in Red Lion-passage; it is a public thoroughfare - I was not well after I got to the watch-house, from the blow I had received, and the stuff they put into the beer; I did not see them put any thing into the beer, but from the taste it had I thought so - I remained at the watch-house a considerable time, for the blow I had received, and what little I had drunk, not being used to drink, it took an effect on me, and having laboured long under paralytic, as I do on one side, it made me feel unwell and unpleasant for nearly two hours; I have not said the liquor alone made me insensible.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came to yourself in the watch-house was it then you first discovered you had lost your money? A. I knew I was at the watch-house - they let me be by the fire, and they rummaged my pockets; I was well aware I was robbed when they knocked me down, for I felt her put her hand into my pocket; I did not charge any other person.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you did not charge any other person at the watch-house? A. I did not - they said I did, but they misunderstood my statement; they said I had charged them, but I will state how it was - at four o'clock in the morning they brought a handkerchief to me, and said, "There is your property - you are capable now of finding your way home;" I said, "Never mind the property, let it lay till morning, but when I undid the handkerchief I found all the property I had had about me, except the five 10l. notes and a silk handkerchief; they said"Is that all your property?" I said, "No, there are five 10l. notes I have not got;" the night officer then said,"Then you charge us with felony," but I had not charged them with it - I said No, I did not, but I would not leave till morning, when I would go before a Magistrate, and have it settled - I went to Worship-street.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not state at the watch-house that these women had robbed you? A. I did not tell them there that the women had robbed me - I said I had been robbed; I told the night officer I had been robbed, and went with him next morning to the place where I had been, and showed it to him.</p>

               <p>Q. At what time in the morning was it that you said you had been robbed? A. Past seven o'clock; I became sensible about half-past two - I left the prisoners' house about a quarter or half-past ten o'clock, I think; I have had notice from the Bank of the notes having come in - I showed the officer the place I was robbed at- it is about twenty paces down the passage leading from Hoxton to Kingsland.</p>

            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street. On the 26th of February, about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, I was passing down Thames-street with Prendergass (I had received information of this robbery about three weeks before from the Hue and Cry) - I saw Ann Matthews there; I knew her person before, and in consequence of my suspicion, I did not take her, but left Prendergass to watch her, and went to the Anchor, at St. Mary-at-hill - I saw Frances there, and told her I apprehended her on suspicion of robbing a gentleman of five 10l. notes at Hoxton; she said, "Oh, if it is for that I don't care - I thought it had been for something else."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. She denied it, did she not? A. She did.</p>

            . I was serving at the Red Lion, when the prosecutor came in with two young women; I cannot swear that the prisoners are the women - I cannot recollect sufficiently to say whether they are or are not; they had a glass of gin, and a small glass to drink it with - a quartern is a quarter of a pint; Williams had water, and put a small portion of gin into it - they were in the house about three minutes; he drank nothing but the gin and water - in about five minutes after they left, a young woman came and told me a gentleman had fallen down in Red Lion-passage; it was not either of the women who had been in the house with the prosecutor - I was alone in the bar, and did not go out; I told the young woman if there was no watch<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150030"></xptr>man there to get one, but she had been for one before who was with him at the time - I heard nothing more of him that night; he would not pass our door to go to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. They all three came into the house to drink the gin? A. Yes, they appeared on friendly terms; they all drank together and laughed; the passage is by the side of our house - if there had been a disturbance there I should not have heard it; the tap-room is next to the passage; there was company there- we have no door opening into the passage; the wall of the house separates it from the tap-room - our bar and door are in front of the house in the road; the doors are always kept shut - our shutters were up; I was not out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell whether any person left the house after these persons before the young woman came? A. No, I do not think there was; I cannot recollect - I do not know whether any body was in the tap-room; my father was in the tap-room, with the door closed - the passage is about twenty-five feet from where I was.</p>

            . I was a watchman. I remember finding Mr. Williams in Red Lion-passage on the night in question; he might be a dozen yards from the Red Lion door - he was laying on his face in the snow, and his head right up against the wall; we carried him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he intoxicated or not? A. He was quite, entirely senseless.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. When a man is senseless are you able to discover whether it arises from drunkenness or disorder? A. No; I found him at half-past eleven o'clock - he was searched in the watch-house, and a silver watch with a chain and seals, a 10l. note, a guinea, three half-sovereigns, and I cannot exactly tell what else, were found on him.</p>

            . I was the watch-house-keeper. The Police have now taken possession; I was at the watch-house when the prosecutor was brought there - he was brought in about a quarter before twelve, in a state of insensibility, by three watchmen and two inhabitants; they were carrying him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say what was the cause of his insensibility? A. I presume it was drinking a quantity of liquor - a state of intoxication; I sat him up against a chair, undid his neckcloth, and gave him air - in about an hour afterwards he was sick, and emptied his stomach; he had a bruise on his forehead - it appeared as if he had fallen against the wall, and grazed his skin; at two o'clock I got him on a chair - he was not then sensible, but about four o'clock I thought he was sensible, and asked him some questions; when I returned him the money I had taken from him, he said he missed five 10l. notes - I had entered in a book what I found on him(reads); "A pair of spectacles and case, a pin, a watch-key, two silk handkerchiefs, one ditto, a knife, a watch and chain, another pair of spectacles in a morocco case, a bunch of keys, a half-crown, 2s. 6d., one gold ring, four sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, one King William and Queen Mary guinea, which I took for a foreign coin, one 10l. note, an umbrella, and a snuff-box" - his watch was hanging out when he came in, and his money in his pockets; when I gave him this money, he said, "I shall not take them, for I miss five 10l. notes, and I must have lost them in the watch-house - I must have been robbed here."</p>

            . I was the night officer. The prosecutor was brought to the watch-house by three watchmen and three others; he was drunk, very drunk, not capable of knowing what he did; he remained there till seven o'clock in the morning - he became sensible partly about two, and about four he got sufficiently so to answer questions; when his money was returned to him, he said,"Whoever took one must have taken the other, and I am determined to take the thing before the Magistrate" - he said he had lost five 10l. Bank notes; I asked if he had been in company with any body - he said No, only with his father at Newington; I said, "Did you leave them with your father?" he said, No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time was this? A. About six o'clock in the morning; he said he had been to pay some bills.</p>
               <p>MR. HEATON. Q. Did he say any thing more? A. I asked if he was positively sure he had not been in company with any body; he said he had not, only he lost the money - I said, "Why do you accuse me or my brother officer of taking these things?" he said, whoever would take one had taken the other - I went to Worship-street to clear myself from having taken his property; he made no charge against the officers at Worship-street.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you go with him to Davis'-court? A. I did about half-past seven o'clock; he had not told me he had been there with some women - he took me to the house, and when he got there he said, "I suppose this is the place where the girls live who have robbed me;" I said, "Why you accused us of it."</p>

               <p>Q. He appeared to you quite drunk - have you ever seen a man under the influence of a blow on the head by being knocked against a wall, and having a paralytic affection as well? A. No.</p>

The prisoner was employed on board that vessel - on the 22nd of April I had seventy-nine sovereigns and seven shillings in my locker, in the cabin where I sleep, and the key was in my pocket; I went on shore that day with my crew, leaving the prisoner on board - I returned at ten o'clock at night; the prisoner was then gone - I missed all my money but one shilling, which was left; some boards under my bed were so removed so as to enable a person to reach the money in the locker, by extending his arm - the prisoner did not return to the vessel; I have seen the bag in which the money was deposited, at the Police-office, in the hands of the officer.</p>
               <p>JAMES CRAIGIE. I am a Police-officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the 27th of April, in Mason-street, Lambeth - I received this canvas bag, and seventy-three sovereigns, from Mrs. Ginnett, in the prisoner's presence.</p>

            . My husband is a Frenchman - we live at No. 10, Mason-street, Lambeth; the prisoner came home to tea with my husband on a Saturday, but I do not know the day of the month - he had tea with us; he had seventy-three sovereigns in a canvas bag, and he shot them out for me to take care of them for him; I gave the bag and sovereigns to the officer - the prisoner left this shirt in the room he slept in, and I gave it to the officer.</p>
               <p>JAMES GINNETT. I went on a Saturday to the house of a tailor, next to Astley's theatre; I do not know the day of the month - I met with the prisoner there; he went to my house to lodge, and there produced some money, which he said was prize-money.</p>
               <p>CHARLES MICHAUD. I know this bag by this little knot - I can swear to it by that mark.</p>
               <p>The prisoner handed in a petition for a lenient sentence, expressing his contrition for the offence, which he had unconsciously committed in a state of intoxication.</p>
               <p>CHARLES MICHAUD. He has served me four months, and I will freely take him home to his family - I believe if he had not been drunk he would not have done this; he has had the care of my money, and was honest till this time; I do not recollect whether it was on a Saturday or not, but it was the 22nd - I had received eighty-three sovereigns, and taken four of them; I had seventy-nine taken from the locker - this shirt is mine; I have the fellow to it on.</p>

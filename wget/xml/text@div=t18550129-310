On 24th Jan. the witness Lucas came to our house—I saw him go into the counting-house—we have customers named Dale and Son—shortly after Lucas came I received this paper from one of my employers, Mr. John Moser—this paper has the name of Dale and Son on it—in consequence of receiving this, I delivered to Lucas all I could of the order; one dozen of flat files, 14 inch and 15 inch; and two dozen of hand files, 12 inch; and some others—the value of the goods was above 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I delivered this invoice with the goods.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dock labourer. The prisoner was also a dock labourer—we did not work together—I was with him some days ago, I believe it was on Wednesday last, at St. Katharine's Dock—he asked me if I would take an order for him; I said I would—that was not the first time he spoke about it—he had asked me on Tuesday morning, and I told him "No"—he asked me again, and I said, what was it for?—he would not tell me what it was for, but he asked me to wait till 12 o'clock, and he would get the order—I told him, "No"—on Wednesday, before our wharfinger came out, the prisoner said to me, "If you don't get on, will you take that order for me? for I have brought the things with me to do it"—I said, "Come along"—we went over London-bridge, and he went into a stationer's shop—he told me to wait outside a moment, And I did wait—from there we went to a public house; I believe it was the Black Bull—when we got there, he called for a pint of beer, and asked the landlady if she would lend him some ink—he did not want a pen, he had got one—they gave him some ink—he had some paper, and he wrote three or four orders—he tore this order off, gave it to me, and told me to take it to Moser and Sons, and if they should ask me any questions, to tell them that Mr. Dale's son, who had just come out of the Blue-coat School, wrote it—he said it would be a very good thing, it would be about 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each, and there was no fear of their finding us out, for they always gave Mr. Dale six months' credit, and we could go there and get some more things afterwards—I consented to take it, and after I had done so, I made a communication at the Southwark station—I then went to Mr. Moser's, and his shopman sent me into the counting house—I saw Mr. Moser, and gave the order to him—he gave it to the shopman, who gave me the goods and the invoice—I told the shopman about my having been to the police, and he gave me the goods under these circumstances—the prisoner had told me, when I got the goods to come back to the Black Bull, and tap at the window, and he would come and receive them of me—when I came out with the goods, the prisoner was standing in the street,</p>

               <p>looking in a coffee shop window—I gave him the invoice, and asked him to take the goods—he would not take them; he said he had to go across the road, to speak to Mr. Sharp—the policeman came up, and took him into custody—before we got to the Black Bull, the prisoner took off his apron, and said to me, "Take my apron, and put it on you."</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my father; we are coppersmiths, and live in Thames-street. The prisoner was in our service as a labourer for about eight months—that is about two months ago—he was not in our service on 24th Jan.—this paper is not the writing of my father or myself, or of any person in our employ—I never gave authority to the prisoner, or to any person, to write this—we are customers of Messrs. Moser—we have not sent for anything of this sort lately—I have a brother who was in the Blue-coat School—the prisoner had the means of knowing that—my brother used to come about our premises in the guise of the Blue-coat School, but not at the time the prisoner was there, I believe—this is not my brother's writing.</p>

On Wednesday, 24th Jan., Lucas came to me at the station, between 9 and 10 o'clock—the inspector was there—some communication passed between us, and I went up the Borough in my uniform—I saw Lucas; he went into Mr. Moser's, and staid there some time—he came out, and walked towards London Bridge—he had two paper parcels—he saw the prisoner looking in a coffee shop—Lucas passed a bill to the prisoner, they crossed the road, and I went and took the prisoner into custody—I told him he must go to the station with me—there was another policeman behind me, and I told him to bring Lucas to the station—on the way the prisoner asked what he was charged with, as he said he knew nothing about it—he was told at the station what he was charged with, and he said he must do something for a living—I took from Lucas these five brown paper parcels (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prisoner gave me this invoice—the paper that I saw Lucas hand to him looked like this.</p>

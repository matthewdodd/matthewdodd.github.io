            , I asked her if her name was not Frances Patterson, she said, yes; I asked her where she had been; she told me down to the northward, and had travelled back by land, I asked her the reason of her taking my money out of my box.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you miss on the 26th of March. - A. A five pound bank note, and nine one's, they were wrapped up inside of a letter and put into a box in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the box locked - A. No, the key was left in it. About half past nine, I went out from my breakfast and left my wife in the house, then I saw the notes safe, before I went out, I put the notes in the letter myself that morning, and eleven pound more, but my wife took the eleven pound to pay away.</p>
               <p>Q. The question that you asked her on the 22d of May was, the reason of her taking your money out of the box - A.She said, on Mr. Smith, I took your money, but it is out of my power to give it you at present, she begged that I would not take her before a magistrate, I told her I must walk back along with her, I took her into the potatoe warehouse near where I live, and the man that keeps the house he went up along with me to Shadwell office, with her; there she was searched, we found nothing about her but an old penknife belonging to me wrapped in a bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the penknife - A. Yes, I gave it over to Mr. Drummond.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 26th of March, where was that knife - A. I cannot say, it generally used to lay in the table drawer along with the other knives in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot say how long before the 26th you had seen it - A. No, I am quite clear it was my own knife, when this knife was taken out of her pocket she said, it was mine, the children were playing with it, she took it away from the children.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Smith, did I say I took your money, I never saw it; he has sworn falsely.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am sure she said so, I have a witness that heard it; she said so first to me, and then afterwards before Mr. Drummond.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That is all false. And the wife had one child with her, and the others were with me, the child did not go out to school at all.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I cannot say that, I am sure they went to school that day, I expected and believe they were, because they went regular every day.</p>

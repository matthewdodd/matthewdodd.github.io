               <p>"You have got my watch," he ran towards Tash-court, I followed, and caught him, but was knocked down by two of the party, and he got away - I cannot say the prisoner is the man.</p>

            . I was with my father; we stood at the door to be let in; four young lads passed us, and in a few moments, one of them returned, and asked my father if that was No. 26 - my father said,</p>
               <p>"He has taken my watch;" he ran across the road, and my father caught him at the end of Tash-court - two of his companions knocked my father down, and all three ran up the court, I pursued, calling</p>
               <p>"Stop thief!" and at the top of the court, I saw the prisoner, he asked which way the three ran; I told him all three ran down Tash-court, and he was the fourth, for he was one of the party - he said, "Do you say, Miss, that I took your father's watch?" I said, "You are one of the party." He said, he would go any where with me; he came down to the bottom of the court with me, and I gave him in charge - I am sure he is one of them, he is not the one who took it, but he is one of the four, I am certain.</p>

            . On Sunday night, about half-past nine o'clock, I heard a cry of "Stop thief!" I went to the door, and the last witness gave the prisoner in my charge for robbing her father - I held him some minutes, she said, he was one of the party but not the man who did it. I let him go. and he ran away; I am sure he is the man I stopped.</p>

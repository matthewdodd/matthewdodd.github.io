B. Lambe, for John Jones"—it is impossible for me to produce a single receipt, in which he has signed his name, Lambe for Jones; I have no such paper—I did not subpoena Mr. Stevenson; he is too much of a gentleman—I remember the settlement of November 18th between myself and the prisoner—he told me himself that he had sold some wines to a Rev. Mr. Edgil; I have no doubt that was deducted from his allowance—the prisoner was also debited in that settlement which he had received from a Mr. Grosvenor, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; which he had received from Mr. Chittenden, 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; from a Mr. Black, for a bottle of sherry, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; for another bottle of sherry, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., making altogether 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have no entry of these in a book, merely on a slip of paper; it was by his statement 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. about them that this debiting took place—he admitted them afterwards; he never denied them—I remember the name of Mr. Edmunds, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I remember Mr. Lambe and I having a dispute as to whether I had received that 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I remember that that; settlement was subsequently disposed of; that I should supply the deficiency, and I should pay half, and he pay half—Mr. Lambe complained of the want of the rough daily cash-book, and said if that had been kept according to his advice, that these mistakes would not occur; we have frequently had discussions about mistakes discovered, and rectified by me as well as by him—on 14th January, 1859, there was 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which had not been drawn; on that occasion he desired me to debit him with a sovereign that had been handed to him on account of the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not deducted, it was left open; it was not settled then—I gave him a check for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not know at that time that these sums had been received by Lambe—I did not hear it from Robinson before the 14th, or before the bills came in; he did not call my attention to it before the 20th January—Robin<lb></lb>son finished making out the accounts about 15th January—it was de<lb></lb>cidedly after the 25th December—I was looking over the accounts while Robinson was making them out—I posted every one of them; my attention was called to all these, Hamper, Smith, and Yarrow; it was not at that time that Selwood made a communication to me—I do not remember when it was that Robinson told me that Mr. Lambe had made him acquainted with the facts—I will swear I do not remember—he did not say, when he made this communication, "Mr. Lambe told me of this weeks ago"—he said that Mr. Lambe had told him he had received the money, and told him to put his initials to it—I do not remember when this was—I have seen this memorandum since; it was in the book-keeper's possession—I cannot say when this was shewn to me—it was late in January or early in February—we commenced taking stock on 20th December; the stock was left unpaid for the express purpose of allowing Robinson to make out the accounts—he first showed me this document at the end of January, when all the accounts</p>

               <p>send the account"—the same thing was done to Hamper's and Yarrow's account—I never showed it to Mr. Jones; it was open so that he could have seen it. I had no conversation with Mr. Jones about these items—I asked him if I was to send the accounts, and he said, "Make them all up, and bring them to me."—I do not think I called his attention to these five—I made them all out, gave them to him, and he posted them—Mr. Lambe did receive money occasionally—it was the duty of every one who received cash to pass printed receipts—I did not know of his making that entry about the amount received from Mr. Sydney Smith—I know nothing at all about it—Mr. Selwood was in the office the same as myself—they all had access to the office—I was never present when Mr. Lambe and Mr. Jones had a settlement of the accounts.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Rotherhithe. On 30th Aug., about 6 o'clock in the afternoon, I was at Trinity-wharf, and saw Murphy cutting the lead off a cistern, which was sunk in the ground—he tied the lead up in a blue handkerchief, and went away with it till he came to Cow-lane—he went down there—there is a marine store shop there—Alexander Smith was with me, but he only saw him tie the lead up—he went and brought a policeman, and we went with him to Hulkin's shop in Cow-lane, and saw Murphy there in the shop, between the front door and the passage, which leads into the back room—he had a match in his band, and his pipe—I am sure he is the man—he worked on the next wharf, about three days before—I saw Hulkins in the shop close to Murphy, and then they shut the door.</p>

I was with Calnon, and saw Murphy, who I knew by sight, cutting the lead; he tied it in a blue handkerchief, and went down the wharf to Cow-lane—I got a constable, and we all went to Cow-lane, and saw Murphy in Hulkin's passage; the constable went up to him, but I did not hear what he said.</p>

Smith came to me, and I went with him to Hulkin's marine store shop in Cow-lane—I saw Murphy close by the door of the front room, and asked him what he had done with the lead; Hulkins was about a yard from him—Murphy said he knew nothing about the lead, and he took no lead—Hulkins said he saw nothing of the lead, he bought no lead; and said, "If he brought lead here, I know nothing about it; he came in to light his pipe"—I went into another room, and found these three pieces of lead (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) under the counter—they were not in any handkerchief, but I found a blue handkerchief in Murphy's pocket—I know that the lead belongs to the cistern, because I live on the premises to take charge of them, and had put these marks on the lead three days before (<hi rend="italic">pointing them out</hi>)—it is the property of Mr. Charles Churchill.</p>

I am a bootmaker at Leytonstone, Essex—in March last, held the position of postmaster, which I have since resigned—the prisoner was employed by me at a salary of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per week, and he had board, lodging, and boots—it was his duty to make up the day's accounts for the General Post Office, and render a copy of the return to the Post Office—he had been accustomed to that three or four years—if we had a balance of cash we had to return daily to the Post Office—the daily cash account of 13th March is in prisoner's handwriting—the casting-up is 339<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that represents the amount carried over from the 12th to the 13th, and the amount for orders issued, the commission, and the Government Annuities, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., all the receipts of the office for that day, with the balance of the previous day—the right total is 349<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have had the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay—the error was discovered on the 14th or 15th of April at the General Post Office, when I sent the books to be audited—the prisoner left my service on the 22nd March—I did not know he was going to leave—he has usually left on Sunday morning, but on this occasion he asked permission to go on Saturday night, and should have come back on Sunday night—he did not return till the end of the next week—he did not give any ex<lb></lb>planation for his absence—I would not let him resume work—I did not come to any settlement with him—I did not mention this affair—he had had his 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the previous Saturday—I did not see him again after the discovery of the deficiency until he was in custody on the 13th of October—he had to make a copy of the return to send to the General Post Office—on the 13th of March he returns to the Post Office as the day's receipts 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—in my book it is 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the Post Office return is correct, but in my book there is an error of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife, and live at 42, High-street, Spitalfields—on 13th April, my daughter came home about half-past 9 o'clock, and before she came in the prisoner told her that she should go out of doors—I said, "Where is the little girl to go to with no father to pro<lb></lb>tect her?"—he said that she should go in the street, he would be d—d if she should not," and ran to kick her—she was in the room then, but she ran out into the passage—he then locked the room door that she should <hi rend="italic">bide</hi> out—he took the key out and then knocked me down, and after I recovered myself I got up and made her come in—the door was not looked, I took the key out before he locked it—he then gave me more blows with his fists and knocked me along the room—he then twisted the leg off his arm-chair and beat me about the head, and shoulders, and arms, with it, and I cried for mercy—he beat me with it a number of times, till he split it in two, and it went in half—my daughter was in the passage up to this time, and the door was wide open, she was half in and half out, she was afraid to come in—I implored for mercy, and he said, "Yes, I will give you mercy you b—r," beating me all the while with the leg of the chair (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I was almost exhausted with screaming, and he took me up and threw me across the room like a cat, he then jumped on my stomach till the blood gushed out of my mouth—I said, "Oh, I shall die"—he said, "You, never die," and he took this flat-iron (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and gave me several blows with it on the back of my head—as soon as my daughter saw the iron used, she ran for a policeman—I then became insensible; I felt him take me up, but my eyes were so blinded that I could not see, and he flung me over the stairs—I was taken by the police to Spital-square, where Dr. Edwards examined my head, after which I did not know where I was for some days, till I found myself in the hospital—I am still an out-patient, but am too ill to go there as I cannot see.</p>

                  </hi>. I am seventeen years old, the prisoner is my father-in-law—on 14th April, about half-past 9, I came home, he was at home and said that I should go out to the street, for I should not have anything there to eat unless I did—I would not go out, and he got up to kick me out, my mother tried to prevent my being put out, but I ran out into the passage that he should not hit me—my father-in-law and mother then took to quarreling with each other—the door was half open and half shut—I was just inside the door peeping in—my mother went to take the key out of the door and the prisoner struck her twice with his fist, and she fell on the floor, he also struck her with this chair leg, which he twisted off, he then took her up off the floor and threw her across the room like a cat, to the fire-place—she cried for mercy, and he said, "Yes, you b—r, I will give you mercy"—she said that she should die, and he said, "No, you won't die," and took up this iron from the fire-place, where she was lying, and hit her on the head with it—I then went out to get a policeman, leaving her lying there, and when I came back I found her lying at the front-door—we live up two pain of stairs, and she had been thrown down two pairs of stairs—she was wounded and was bleeding very much from the back of her head, and from her nose and mouth: she was insensible, and remained so for two days; I got a policeman, and she was taken to the hospital, she remained there speechless for, I think, three days—she was there upwards of a fortnight, and was an out-door patient after that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital—on 15th April, the prosecutrix was brought there in a state of great prostration, and unable to speak—I found extensive bruises all over her chest and abdomen, and a large bruise on the back of her head, a lacerated wound—her face was much swollen and contused, the left side especially, which was caused, most likely, by the fist—an iron like this, used edgeways, would be likely to cause the cut on the head, but the flat part would only bruise—the injuries to the chest and abdomen were very serious, it seemed as if some heavy body had fallen upon her—a jump or a persons knee would be just the sort of thing to do it—for the first two days I was afraid she would die from the shock—she remained in the hospital till the 3d May, nearly three weeks, when she was made an out-patient—the sight of her left eye is permanently injured owing to a blow.</p>

               <p>her mother complained to me about her, and called me a b—y Irish bastard, though I am not Irish, and flung a cup of hot tea at me; if I buy anything she breaks it all to pieces. On this evening we went out and had a glass of ale apiece, and both got very nearly drunk; we took three quarts home with us. The girl wanted to be in the street, and I said, "Let her <hi rend="italic">bide,</hi> we have always had this bother about her, let her go and get her living the best way she can. Her mother kept calling me names, and pulled my whiskers and nose, and shook me; I said, "If you do not let me alone I shall knock you down;" she said I am a b—y soldier's daughter, and so long as I have got blood in me, I will fight She struck me and I hit her, she got a poker 18 or 22 inches long, but I took it out of her hand and put it under the grate. I said, "I will go out;" she took me by the collar and threw me back, and said, "You b—r, you shall not go out till I have revenge. She fell against the box, and I on top of her, but as to striking her on the head, I did not know it was done till I got to the station house. I had not seen the flat for two months or ten weeks, since she hammered the table to pieces with it.</p>

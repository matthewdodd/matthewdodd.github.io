            . I am a stay-maker in St. Clement's church-yard. On the 20th of January, Mr. Gibbons offered me some stays. After I had got them home my foreman informed me they were Mr. Marsden's property. I sent to Mr. Marsden; he owned the whole of the property. I bought sixty-eight pair of stays of Mr. Gibbons; I gave him five shillings a pair for them. Mr. Gibbons is an actioneer. I saw the goods before I bought them.</p>
               <p>MR. GIBBONS. I am an auctioneer. I bought some stays of the female prisoner, and some I redeemed. She told me she manufactured them. She told me to go to Mr. Grover, the pawnbroker, for the stays. I enquired her character of Mr. Grover; he told me she was a good character. I gave my porter the money to redeem the stays.</p>
               <p>Q. All that you know, certain stays were brought to you by your porter, you gave him the money to redeem them - A. Yes, and I sent a sample of them stays to Mr. Mills. Mr. Mills gave me five shillings a pair for them. I went to the prisoner's apartment; they were then working at a late hour in the night. I told them there was a charge against them that these stays had been improperly obtained; that it was necessary they should accompany me to Mr. Marsden. I told them Mr. Marsden said they were his patterns. The prisoners said they had the same patterns in paper as Mr. Marsden, and the same scoreing-boards. The female said, I have bought stays of Mr. Marsden for the purpose of taking the patterns off. I did not deliver the stays to Mr. Mills in the first instance; they were left at a private-house in Windmill-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know of your own knowledge these stays ever reached Mr. Mills - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you send them by to Windmill-street - A. A porter; he is not here.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gibbons. There were two pair marked G for my daughter to fit them on; here is one pair marked G; I cannot find the other pair. I received them of my porter.</p>

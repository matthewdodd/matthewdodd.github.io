             sworn.</p>

               <p>I am a constable, I produce nine shawls, six in one piece, and three in the other piece. I was going along St. Paul's Church-yard, Monday, the 11th of August, between nine and ten, it might be about ten, and I saw the prisoner, she seemed to have something that she wanted to conceal, I followed her and she turned up a court in St. Paul's Church-yard, by Mr. Wllkie's, she stock broker, I just turned up the court, and I found her taking these shawls out of her apron, and just delivering them to a little boy, she ran past seeing me, as I was going up the court before I was aware of her, so I see her going past me, the boy had just got hold of them, I said, what have you got here? Says he, I don't know. The boy said the girl asked, him to hold them while she tied up her stockings; I took the things from the boy, he had them hardly in his hands when I went up the court; I have kept them ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you get the woman? - I went out and I asked the people that were passing if they saw any thing of a girl run that way? and some boys went after her, and I first saw her by the boys that went in search for her, just at the Compter; the prisoner is the girl.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. A little boy was charged with this offence, was not he? - He was taken before the magistrate and committed.</p>
               <p>Q. You stated to the court that this was between nine and ten, and afterwards ten? - I cannot exactly say, I did not look particularly to the clock.</p>
               <p>Court. If you see these things in possession of this woman, how came the boy committed? - The grand jury threw out the bill against the boy.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I can swear these to be my shawls, I know this piece by my own marking, it is in a character, I know that we had that pattern, and we had not sold it, I can say that for certainty; the other piece has the same mark and character.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170122"></xptr>- Yes, I did examine, and they were missing; but we did not miss them before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. How many journeymen may you have? - Two.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since you last took stock? - About twelve months.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you sold any shawls of that character and pattern since that time? - Not that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that you have not? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. The other journeyman he is not here, but he was in the shop at the time this girl was there? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted if you was to buy shawls to-morrow, you would put the same character on them as on these? - Not the same exactly, pretty nearly.</p>
               <p>Q. The boy was committed for this affair, but the grand jury threw out the bill? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then all that I understand from you, is, that you speak to the character, that is to the pieces of common shawls and the pattern; and the pattern, you told me just now, is as common as is to be seen in any shop in London? - It may to be sure.</p>
               <p>Court. What may be the lowest value? - They cost us about eighteen shillings.</p>
               <p>jeaves. I can swear that they are Lawrence and Jolland's shawls, from the patterns and marks.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether they were missing when Mr. Ruggles brought them? - They were not before, but after he had brought them we found them missing from the quantity of shawls which we have.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You had not taken stock of these goods for above a twelve month before, so whether any body else might have sold these goods, in the course of these twelve months, you cannot tell? - Yes, I can swear that I did not sell them.</p>

On Thursday, the 19th November, between 10 and 11 o'clock in the morning, I was in Chatsworth Road, Priory Fields, Hackney—I saw Rogers there—there was a grey horse and a roan mare there—the mare was hobbled—Rogers stooped down in front of her legs and did something to her—he then walked away—between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon Rogers and Roberts came to the same place and looked at the mare; they went away again, and I hid in a shed—between 8 and 9 o'clock that night the prisoners and two other men came there—at that time there was a cart behind the shed and some harness—the cart was the same which was afterwards identified by Mr. Shackleton—Roberts brought the roan mare up to the cart, which was close to the shed where we were—the other men harnessed it; Rogers had hold of the bridle and put it on, and they led it away—as they led it away, I went out with Chapman and Howsden, the constables, who were with me—we commenced to on after the cart, and the prisoners and the others ran away—I stopped the horse and cart—I afterwards saw Roberts brought back by Chapman—next day I went to Smithfield, where I saw Rogers, and took him into custody, and told him it was for being concerned with others in the unlaw<lb></lb>ful possession of a horse and cart, he said "All right, let me walk in front, I don't want to be shown up to my <hi rend="italic">pals</hi>"—the night of the 19th November was a bright moonlight night.</p>

I am; I received this note from the prisoner at the bar on the 24th of June at the office; the boy did not offer me the note in payment; it was in consequence of some conversation between me and Mr. Lavender; I asked the boy if he had not been in Cheapside and offered it in a sadler's shop; he said yes, he had been there; I then asked for the note; he said there was the note that he had offered at the sadler's shop; I wrote my own name upon the note; I am sure it is the same note that I received from him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. To every question you asked he very readily answered - A. Yes; he said he was very sorry, he hoped he should not lose his situation in doing what he had done, in taking it without his master's knowledge, nor did he know the value of it; he said he should return it that night if he went home.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you from memory recollect that they were the notes that you paid - A. I cannot; it is impossible, from the number of notes that we pay away in a day.</p>

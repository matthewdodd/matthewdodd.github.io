            . I live at Tottenham. On Friday, the 31st of August, I lost two cows from the marsh at Tottenham - I had milked them in the marsh that morning; I saw them again at Colchester, on the next Sunday, in possession of the prisoner, who was driving them down at Colchester - I did not know him before - I was on horseback; I collared him, and told him they were my property, and he said I knew all about it - I gave him in charge - he was committed to prison by the Mayor of Colchester, and I got my cows back; I am sure they are mine - I have had them two years; they are worth 10l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is there any body but yourself who saw them in his possession? A. Yes, the officer. I traced him down the road to Colchester, from Ilford - they had noticed him at some gates, and some they had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not want you to go with him to a house, where he said he was directed to drive them? A. No; he said nothing of the kind to me; he told me nothing about Dyer - I had no conversation with him, but what I have stated - he said something about Dyer before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How did you trace him to Ilford? A. I inquired at Chingford-gate, and from what I heard there, I went on.</p>

            . I am a labouring man, and live at Edmonton. On the 31st of August, between one and two o'clock in the day, I was in Tottenham-marsh, and saw the prisoner driving the two cows out of the marsh - they were two pole cows - one red and one white, with a bald face - the other was a blue spotted one - I have known the prisoner these nineteen years - he has been a farmer, and lives at Tottenham - I am sure he is the person - he drove them along the bank of the river, towards Chingford - I did not know whose they were; I said,"How are you, Mr. Southgate;" he made no answer that I could hear; I saw the cows again on this day week, in the marsh - I went and picked them out myself, by order of the Magistrate, from among ten or twenty others, and drove them up to Mr. Mallett; they were the same as I had seen the prisoner drive away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This was broad daylight? A. Yes; there was nobody else there. I did not suspect him - the river bank is a public path for foot passengers.</p>
               <p>MR. MALLETT. I saw the cows which Bodger picked out of the marsh on this day week - they are what I lost, and what I found the prisoner with at Colchester.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I told Mr. Bright the publican where I was going with them - he acknowledged that at Colchester, and the prosecutor knows it.</p>
               <p>MR. MALLETT. I never heard him say where he was going to drive them. Bright said he said he was going seven miles below Colchester with them.</p>
               <p>One witness gave the prisoner a good character, and stated him to have been in distressed circumstances.</p>

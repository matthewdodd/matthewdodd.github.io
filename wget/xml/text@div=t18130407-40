            . Q. Where were you on the 20th of March last - A. I lodged in Dog and Bear-yard, Tooley-street. I met the prisoner on the 20th of March. I asked him to shew me Whitechapel. He said, yes. We went into a public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you anybody in company with you - A. Yes, a young lad; his name is

               <p>Q. How long had you been in London before this happened - A. Only two days.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the lad go with you - A. Yes; he came with me from Wales.</p>
               <p>Q. Could the lad speak any English - A. No; we came from Cardiganshire.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner give you any advice - A. Yes. He gave me advice to leave the things with the lad in the public-house while the prisoner went with me. The prisoner and me went out of the house. I left the lad and the clothes in the house. The prisoner and me went to enquire for a person of the name of Bellam.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at all acquainted with the prisoner before - A. No, he was quite a stranger. I asked him if he knew such a place where Bellam lived. He said, yes, he would shew me the place. We could not find it. I went into a public-house, and there he left me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him again - A. No, not until he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet with the lad that night - A. No, not that night. I met with the lad on Sunday, at my house in the Borough.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen the things since - A. No, only the handkerchief, and that was found round the prisoner's neck. When I saw the handkerchief at the magistrate's I claimed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had the handkerchief been before - A. It was in my coat pocket in my bundle.</p>

            . Q. Did you come to town with the prosecutor - A. Yes, and I was in his company on the 20th of March.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you meet with the prisoner - A. In the street. I do not know the name of the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you left in charge any thing at a public-house by Jones - A. Yes, I was left in charge of two bundles: they contained wearing apparel, shirts, breeches, stockings, and a coat of the prosecutor's. After I was left in the public-house the prisoner came to me and said, that I must come to the prosecutor; that the had found the place out. The prisoner took up the prosecutor's bundle, and told me to come on with him. We went on. I could not walk fast enough for the prisoner. He took my bundle likewise, and told me to come along. We called for a pot of beer, and I paid for it. The prisoner gave the bundles to the landlady of the house, and then he took me to another public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How many public-houses did you go into - A. Three. The last public-house he called for a pint of beer, and left me there. I never saw him after until I saw him before the magistrate. I went to the second public-house, where the prisoner deposited the bundles. I have never seen the bundles again.</p>

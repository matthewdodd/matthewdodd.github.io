On a Wednesday in August, between eight and nine o'clock at night, I found a pane of glass in my window was cut, there was a hole made, by a piece being cut away - the hole was large enough to put both hands through; I had seen the window quite safe a little after eight o'clock - I was busy in the shop with customers the whole time after that; the street-door was open all the time; I had not heard the glass broken at all - I looked to see if anything was gone, but missed nothing at the time, I told the first policeman who went by to report it at the station-house, and next morning Hobbs, a policeman brought me one piece of silk handkerchiefs; it has my mark on it all the way through - we had not sold a piece of handkerchiefs that day; I have two young men and myself in the shop; the piece of handkerchiefs was kept in the next pane of glass to the one which was cut; there was a pile of twenty or thirty pieces - I had seen them all safe at eight o'clock that evening - I did not miss it that evening, because in the quantity I have it was impossible to miss it - I had seen the window all safe, and the pile there at eight o'clock - I did not count them; they did not appear to be disturbed when I examined them afterwards - anybody could very easily, by putting their hand through the hole, reach the pile - they were piled up in a row, one on the top of the other; theymight have taken twenty pieces, if they had had time.</p>

            . I am a policeman. On the 14th of August, I saw the prisoners in company with another person, in Lower Regent-street, a little before nine o'clock, in the Quadrant - I followed them into Coventry-street, and laid hold of Pickard; the other two walked away; they were all three together - when I laid hold of Pickard, I asked him what he had got there; he said, "a suit of clothes;" seeing some silk handkerchiefs, I took him to the station-house, and untied the bundle and found a piece of seven handkerchiefs, and a child's dress, tied in a black apron - I have had them ever since; I called Stone to lay hold of the other two, but one ran away.</p>

             re-examined. This is my piece of handkerchiefs; it is marked i.a. all the way through; I marked it myself - I might have thirty or forty pieces in the window that day; I cannot say the exact number, our stock is too large - I merely take an account of what money I take, not of every piece of goods sold - we never sell goods without putting them in paper, and this was found without any paper on it - we do not take off the marks when we sell; we had not sold a piece of handkerchief that day, because we enter in a book what is sold; we take an account of what money we take - we do not enter every article we sell; we should put down, "goods Â£5." if it was a lot; but if it was merely one thing, we put down what it is, but such a thing as this we should have recollected - if that piece of handkerchief had been sold with other articles to one customer, I should have entered them as goods; but we should have recollected it, if I had sold one whole piece - when a large parcel is sold, I generally require the young men to mention what they consisted of, and we had not sold one piece that day - when we sell a parcel the bill is made out, the money brought to me, and I always read over what is sold, and take the money, and give change, and such a thing as that did not occur that day - I do not recollect any piece of handkerchiefs being sold, but if it was sold with other goods, it would not have been entered in the book.</p>
               <p>Pickard's Defence. At the top of Coventry-street, by the stages, a man asked me to carry the parcel to Turnstile, and he would give me 6d.; the policeman took me, and dragged me along; I told him the man who gave it me had gone, and he would not look after him, and then the man ran directly.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. HEBDEN. Q. Would it not require an instrument to cut the window? A. It seemed to be starred, as if forced with a blunt instrument in three or four places, and the glass was either cut or broken in the direction of those stars - the corner of the square was taken out.</p>

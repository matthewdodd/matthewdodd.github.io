I took a hackney-coach at seven in the morning of the 1st of February. I secreted myself therein to observe who went into this house. Between the hours of seven and eight I saw the prisoner Corn go into that house. I staid there till near nine o'clock. I did not see Corn come out again, nor no one go in after that time. Then I went to the office. I returned there again about the hour of eleven, with a city constable and some more of Sir

We saw none but a woman sitting there; we ran up stairs immediately, but saw no one there. There were no goods nor furniture. We left somebody below to take care of the woman.</p>
               <p>Do you mean there was no furniture or goods in any part of the house? - Yes; there was, but not up stairs. We then went down into the cellar; there we found a large press fixed with two dies in it, and a cutting out press near it.</p>
               <p>What was the large press for? - Making half-pence. There was one half-penny between the dies. The other was for cutting out of blanks. I then came up stairs and asked the young woman below who the house belonged to; she said she was nothing but a servant and did not know. We found a vast quantity of blanks; and I think there are fourteen pair of dies besides the pair out of the fly. We also found a vast quantity of copper which is here. I was searching round the place, upon the shelf lay a letter, which I believe Mr. Vernon has got; it was directed to

I shewed it to Mr. Prothero; he desired I would go immediately with the city constable to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230076"></xptr>Crown in Lad-lane. I went there, and found Pickering and Corn both sitting together. We took them to the house where the tools were found. I asked Corn if that was his lodging; he said it was not.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to Pickering? - I did not; Mr. Phillips was with him. I searched Corn, but found nothing upon him. I did not search the other.</p>

            's officers? - I am. I went with Jealous to Holford-court. When I got in at the window, I saw a woman sitting in the room; I opened the passage door to let the rest of the officers in; then I ran up stairs. The information was, that they coined silver as well as half-pence, and generally coined the silver up stairs, that caused me to run up stairs first. I found all the rooms up stairs empty; there was not any furniture in them. Then I ran down stairs again and went into the cellar, there I found a great press with a large fly.</p>
               <p>Is thathere? - It is in a cart in the yard, it is too heavy to be brought into court. There were two dies in it. These cuttings lay near the press.</p>
               <p>These are what they call secil? - They are. Here are a vast quantity of blanks which lay by the press; there are a great many more in the box. These were put in a sieve. There is a hole made in the ground to sit down to feed the die with them. There was a cutting out press. These two dies (producing them) I took out of the press; and I have some half-pence, which I believe were struck with these (producing a large box full) there are some for farthings and some for half-pence.</p>
               <p>All the implements were there that are necessary to complete this process of coining? - Yes, sawdust and oily sacks. They put them into sacks with dust, and oil them, and then they shake them backwards and forwards to clean them.</p>
               <p>The other press is bigger than this, is it not? - It is ten times as big as this. Jealous told me he had found a letter which was addressed to Pickering and Corn at an alehouse in Lad-lane. I bid him take Phillips, a city constable, and go there, and secure them, and bring them to the house. They went and found them there. They found two half-pence amongst some others upon Pickering, which half-pence tally with these dies.</p>

               <p>The house wherein the press was found, belonged to me. I let it to Pickering at Christmas last. While it was empty there was a bill stuck up at the end of the court signifying that there was a house to let; he offered himself to me as a tenant. I asked him his trade; he said he was a fancy weaver. I asked him who he was known to; he said to a neighbour of mine, Mr. Spratlin, a haberdasher. I went to Mr. Spratlin, who said he had purchased goods of Pickering in his business. In consequence of that I received him as a tenant. He continued my tenant till the time he was taken up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Captain Stockley, of Wool<lb></lb>wich. He deals with Mr. Jobbings for bread—the prisoner was servant to Mr. Jobbings—I recollect sending for change for a half sovereign to pay the prisoner—to the best of my recollection, it was on the 13th or 14th of Oct., the bill was due on the 10th—it was sent in on the Monday—I asked the prisoner, and he said he had no change—I sent Notley for change, and paid the prisoner 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., he signed the receipt on the bill—I left the bill on the dresser in the kitchen, and desired them to file it—I saw the prisoner after<lb></lb>wards—the next bill did not come in till about three weeks afterwards—the bills usually came in weekly—when the bill came in, I said to the prisoner, "I wish Mr. Jobbings would send in the bill correctly"—I told him there was an error, and I should call on his master—I said the bill which I had paid was entered in that bill—he told me he would take the bill, and mention it—he said he did not know—I went down and called on Mrs. Jobbings, and paid her the correct bill, that was the remaining balance; she struck out the week that I had paid—I am quite clear that I paid the prisoner the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that bill was filed—I have not got it here.</p>

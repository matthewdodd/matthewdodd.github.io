               <p>Q. Did he pay for what he had drank before he went out? - A. Yes; and about a quarter after eleven o'clock, the maid gave the alarm; I was going to bed, and she had gone up before me; and had come down, and met me as I was going up; in consequence of what she said, we both came down stairs, and my master went up, and me and the maid went up stairs, and we found the bottom fath of the garret window taken out, and put on the staircase, that is, a window that lights the staircase; half of it goes into the maid's room, and lights that; there are three panes in the top-sash, and three in the bottom.</p>
               <p>Q. What size panes are they? - A. Small ones; when we went up, the door was locked; my master unlocked the door, and we saw a man's feet under the bed; my master came out of the room, and locked the door again; he sent me down to get the watchman, and the watchman went up and pulled the prisoner from under the bed; he did not say any thing till he came down stairs, and then he said he was in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he so? - A. No, or he could not have got into the room.</p>

             sworn. - I live at Mr. Rayner's in Monmouth-street; I never saw the prisoner till two nights before this happened; he was warming a black pudding before the fire; on the 4th of December, I saw him again in the tap-room, between ten and eleven o'clock; he went out; I never had any conversation with him in my life; some time after, I went up stairs to bed; I sleep in the three pair of stairs back-room; the room-door was double locked; I had the key; when I went up, I saw the sash out upon the landing-place, and heard a noise in the room; I came down stairs again, and met the boy; the fath is half in my room, and half on the staircase; it was a push-up fath; the bed was pulled down, and the line cut, and laid by the side of the window; I had left all safe, when I made the beds, at twelve o'clock; I was very much alarmed, and came down stairs, and met the boy; then my master and the boy, and I, all went up stairs; my master put the sash in first, and then he took the key and the candle out of my hand, and unlocked the door; the upper part of the fath was left in, but the lower part was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What size was this window; was there room enough for a man to get in? - A. I should think he could not get in that way, because he might have fell over into the yard, and dashed himself to pieces; he must have got half his body in first, and so hung by his hands; my master unlocked the door, and I saw his feet; my master then said, it is all nonsense, there is nobody here, and then he locked the door again, and gave the boy a hint to fetch the watchman, and he did; the watchman came up, and pulled him from under the bed, and brought him down stairs; he said, he thought it was his quarters; he was very much in liquor; when I went to go to bed, my box was turned topsey-survey, and another box displaced that belonged to my master; there was nothing gone from the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he excessively in liquor? - A. He was not in liquor at all, though he pretended to be so.</p>
               <p>Q. He had had a good deal of liquor? - A. I drew him two pints of ale, and he drank one of them, and part of the other, but I am sure he was not in liquor.</p>

             sworn. - I keep the King's-head; I saw nothing of the prisoner in the house till after the alarm was given; I went up stairs with the maid and the boy; I immediately said, if there is any body, be still; I went up, and found the window out, which looks into two rooms, the maid's room, and the staircase; the lower fath was taken out; there is a partition divides the staircase from the room; the partition does not go quite close; there is room to put two hands between; I secured the window first, and then I unlocked the door, and saw the prisoner; the girl said there is somebody under the bed; I said, do not talk such nonsense, there is nobody, for I was afraid, having nothing in my hand; I locked the door again, and made a motion to the boy to fetch the watchman; the watchman came up; I opened the door, and he took him from under the bed; his shoes were off, and laid under the bed where his head laid; we tied his hands, and put his shoes on, and took him down into the tap-room; he was searched at the watch-house, but he had nothing found about him.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way could he have got into that room, the door being locked? - A. The only method he could have got in, was by getting out of the sash when it was open, and so hanging by his hands, and crawling to the other window, for there was no hole, either for his feet or knees.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140045"></xptr>Q. Was there space enough for him to get out? - A. Not without contracting himself, there is a pane and a half in each, about ten inches by eight.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state did he appear? - A. He was as sober as I am this moment, as sober as can be; he pretended to be drunk at first, but afterwards he went to the watch-house as well as any person could do; he said, he thought he was at his quarters, and I told him it must be strange quarters to get in at the window in that manner.</p>
               <p>Floyd. I saw the window in at nine o'clock, I went to fetch a pint pot that the lodger had had, which stood in that staircase window.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was quite in liquor, I thought I had been at home at my quarters; I went up stairs and found the window open, I went in, and was so full of liquor, that I tumbled off the bed.</p>

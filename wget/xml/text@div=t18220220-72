            . I am a patrol. On Monday morning a little after five o'clock I saw the prisoner just by Clapton pond, driving this cow, another man was with him; I laid hold of the prisoner, and then the other went away. I asked where he came from, and was going with it; he said he came from Mr. Smith of Epping, and he had been sent down to Smith's, by the captain of a ship for it - I think he said the captain's name was Low. The cow was not warm, but unwilling to be driven. Mr. Parish claimed it the same day. He said he was first going to Smithfield, and then to the captain with the cow.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Two people drove it - A. Yes. I did not ask where he came from, but where he brought the cow from. He appeared like a sailor.</p>

On Sunday morning I went to Walthamstow with this man; he told me he was steward of a ship, and asked me to go on board, and said he would get me a situation, as a carpenter; he took me to Epping as he called it, and left me in a public house, about three o'clock; returned about five o'clock, and took me to the Cock, public house, four miles further; and at eight o'clock he brought me back to the first public house, and about twelve o'clock, took me to his sister's at Walthamstow - I left him there; he overtook me on the road, with the cow and in a quarter of an hour I was stopped - I was fifty yards a head of the cow.</p>

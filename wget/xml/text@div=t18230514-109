On the 12th of May, in the afternoon, the prisoner came to the shop, and soon after I was told a rug was stolen; she came in again soon after - I went and found my rug at the Three Compasses, public-house, Drury-lane. I got a constable, and took her at my shop - she fell on her knees, and begged forgiveness, saying she only took it in fun. I have known her for years; she was rather intoxicated, but knew what she was about.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Her family are respectable I believe - A. Yes. One of my men knew where she lived.</p>

            . I live at the Three Compasses. The prisoner came in, and asked if she might leave the rug in our bar - I said we never took in anything; she went out leaving it on the counter, put down 2 d., and said</p>
               <p>"I will have a glass when I come back." The prosecutor came in soon after. She was so much in liquor that I think she did not know what she was about.</p>

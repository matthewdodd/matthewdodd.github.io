               <p>The prisoner came into my shop on Wednesday the 21th of January, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I was alone; I went out of the shop into the back room, and I turned my head, the shop door was on the jar, and I looked forward, and I saw this young youth with his breast on the counter, the till was drawn out, and he had his hand in the till; I went to the door to stop him, but he got out and slamm'd the door after him, I called out immediately, stop thief, and he ran away, but he was stopt afterwards; I am sensible the prisoner is the person, I had seen him before, I had counted the money when I left it; there was 6 s. or 6 s. 6 d. I am sure.</p>

               <p>I was at work when the prisoner came into the shop, I came down stairs after he was brought back; the prisoner was not searched, but he delivered this money and said there, Sir, is any of this money yours; my mother generally tries her money with aqua fortis, and here is a 6 d (which was in the money delivered to me) that I took the same day and marked with the aqua fortis; I recollected it immediately, and he went down on his knees and begged to get off; but my mother having been robbed so often, I told him I would make an example of him.</p>

               <p>I was walking down Barbican, and I heard the cry of stop thief; I was taken by the collar, and the last witness came up; I had 5 s. 5 d. in my pocket, and I pulled it out, and he said there was a 6 d. which he knew, that he took that day and marked with aqua fortis.</p>

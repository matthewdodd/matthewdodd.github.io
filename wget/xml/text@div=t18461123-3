On a Thursday evening in Oct. the prisoner came about seven o'clock, to where I was at work at Mr. Turner's barn in a field at Holloway—about half an hour afterwards the prisoner, and I, and my master, went out together—when I got pretty near home the prisoner asked if I would come out—I said I should not—he then came to my lodging, and I went with him down the road by the church—he then left me, went into a field, and said he should catch me again—I went on along the road, and in about a quarter of an hour he came up, riding on a horse which I knew be<lb></lb>longed to some person in St. John-street, Upper Holloway, but I did not know the person's name—there was a halter on the horse, but no harness—the prisoner said to me, "Come on"—Long was with me—we kept on walk<lb></lb>ing, and the prisoner kept riding along the road—we got to a public-house, where the prisoner paid for two pints of beer—we then went on to Cow-cross, and there some man came and asked the prisoner whether the hone was for sale, and he said, "Yes"—I left them and went straight home.</p>

A short time after this a summons was taken out for the prisoners to appear at Guildhall Police-court—Little appeared, but not Eustace; Mr. Beard came into Court as solicitor for Little, and said in his presence, oh, it was simply a mistake in the I delivery, and the goods were to be had if we chose to send for them—upon I that the Alderman said I had better go to Philip Lane, and I went with Little—I found the place shut up; it was between eleven and twelve o'clock, I we were not able to get in—Little said, "Oh, it is shut up and I have not I got the key now, Mr. Eustace has got it"—I then went with him to his I lodging to see if Mr. Eustace had left it there—we could not get the key—I went to the place again a few days afterwards, and it was still shut up—I never saw anything of Eustace till he was in custody in October.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">contended that the railway company, having only authority to deliver to Easten and Co., had no power to part with the property in the goods to any other parties; that the mistake of the carman in leaving them at the wrong premises did not deprive the company of their property in them; and that the subsequent conversion of them by Eustace to his own purposes was in fact a larceny of the goods of the company, just as much as if he had taken them out of the cart himself.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi> (<hi rend="italic">on same side</hi>) urged that as soon as the goods came into the possession of Little he, by accepting possession of them, might be deemed a bailee for the owner, and that directly Eustace became acquainted with the circumstances and co-operated with him, he was accessory with him as bailee, and then if, contrary to that bailment, they jointly converted the goods to their own purposes, a case of larceny would be established.

                  <hi rend="italic">decided upon leaving the case to the Jury, not on the ground of the prisoners being bailees, but that the property in the goods had not been parted with; the carman had the limited authority to part with them to Easten and Co. only, and by leaving them in mistake the property was not really parted with.</hi>

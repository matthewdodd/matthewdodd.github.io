On the 9th of July, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was sitting in my parlour, and saw the prisoner standing against my counter, and putting something under her shawl - I went to her and asked what she wanted: she said a child's cap - I called my wife to serve her; I missed a cap which I had seen just before I went; I looked under her shawl, and asked what she had there - I took hold of her and found this cap.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did she not deal with your wife for something? A. Yes - and she had paid for it; I understood afterwards that her sister was standing outside with her child; she did not say she intended to buy this cap - she said she took it off the ground; the street-keeper took her.</p>

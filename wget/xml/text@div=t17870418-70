               <p>Mr. Schoen. What are you? - A journeyman carpenter.</p>
               <p>This was on Sunday night, I believe? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Your mother goes to church of a Sunday night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You go to drink crank instead of going to church with your mother? - Not constantly.</p>
               <p>How much had you drank that night? - Part of two or three penny-worth.</p>
               <p>Was you sober upon your oath? - I was, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Who advised you to prosecute this poor boy for an highway robbery? - Nobody.</p>
               <p>You know there is a reward in this case of forty pounds? - I do not know any thing at all of these things, but I have heard of such things; as to my part I had rather be without the reward; I do not want it; it has been very disagreeable to me; I have not contrived to indict him for a highway robbery.</p>
               <p>When they came up to you, you say, you did not suspect their intention to rob you, till the watch was gone? - No.</p>
               <p>So that I take it for granted there was no violence used to you? - No, not in the least, it was gone as quick as lightning; I did not know I was robbed till the watch was out of my pocket; I did not understand what the other man said; I lost sight of him entirely, while I fell down; it was about half after eight; the robbery was about two minutes; my watch was snatched as upright as a dart; I was rather frightened.</p>
               <p>This was a momentary transaction? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The night was very dark? - It was duskish.</p>
               <p>Taking all these circumstances together, that the night was dark, that you was frightened, and that the transaction was sudden; I take it for granted, you could not swear to the person who took your watch? - When he stepped up to me, I was underneath a lamp.</p>

               <p>(The watch produced without any outside case.)</p>
               <p>Is that the watch that you picked up? - It looks like the same according to the maker's name and number 1265, the name Hayley, to the best of my remembrance; I only looked at it once.</p>
               <p>How came you to recollect the number and the maker's name? - Because I was told it afterwards; it appeared to be something towards that number; that is the watch that was delivered to me by the constable.</p>

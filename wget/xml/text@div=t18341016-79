            . I live at Hutton, in Essex. I was in Spitalfields on the night of the 4th of September - Sims came up to me in <placeName id="t18341016-79-crimeloc443">Brick-lane</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18341016-79-crimeloc443" type="placeName" value="Brick-lane"></interp>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Where had you been? A. I had been collecting rents - this was a little after two o'clock in the morning - I suppose the last money I received might be at nine or ten o'clock - I then stayed with a friend - I was sober - I had not been at Bartholomew fair, nor above one hundred yards from where I was robbed, which was in Brick-lane - I had come from Booth-street, where my property is - I knew as well what I was about, as I do now, or I should not have got my money again - when Sims took hold of my arm, she drew me down Hanover-court, and said she had something to say - she did not draw me far down - we were not there two minutes - I told her I had nothing to say to her - I was going to my lodgings, at Aldgate - I turned up the court by compulsion, not voluntarily - Sims took hold of my arm, and, almost by compulsion, pulled me down the court - I felt her hand rustling about my person, and saw my purse go, and she gave it to the other woman - she took me by the arm, and said she wanted to speak to me; I had scarcely come to my senses when it was gone - I did not know who the prisoners were - I had no thought of being robbed - I had drank a small glass of spirits and water, at a public-house, with a tenant - there was a little brandy and water, and some ale - there might be some gin and water - I do not know what public-house it was - it was opposite one of my own houses, where I had been to collect rents - I believe it is the White Hart - I went in there about nine o'clock - I went into the parlour, and we sat there talking about business, and one thing or another, and stopped till two o'clock - there might have been several glasses - it was a respectable party - we proposed playing at whist - there was very little drank - I was perfectly sober - I do not know exactly what money I had, nor what I lost - I suspect some dropped down - my trowsers were large, and she put her hand into my pocket, and took out my purse.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to the station-house, did you say you had got your money; that you might have dropped it, as your pockets were large, and you wanted the girls to be let go? A. I might say to the policeman, in going along, that I did not wish to prosecute - he told me I could not get my money without - I did not say, "then I must prosecute" - on the second examination the prisoner said I was under the influence of liquor - the magistrate asked me, and I said I was perfectly sober.</p>

             (police-constable H 82). I was passing the end of Hanover-court - I saw the two prisoners - Brown ran out, and in a minute the prosecutor said, "Stop that girl!" meaning Sims - he then said, "There was another run out" - I said, "Yes, I saw her" - I pursued Brown, and took her as she was stooping down to an area railing, and trying to put this purse down - I took it from her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the prosecutor before this took place? A. No. He appeared quite sensible - if I were going from Brick-lane to Aldgate, I should not go down that court - I should go past the end of it - I was stationed in Brick-lane - I might not have heard the prosecutor if he had called out - I was five or six hundred yards off - I had not seen him, but I had seen the prisoners just before - they knew I was in the neighbourhood - the prosecutor said, in going to the station, that he did not wish to prosecute.</p>

            . I am a police-serjeant - I was on duty - I saw the prosecutor go past - Sims came up to him - he did not appear to want to say any thing to her - I saw them go on towards the court - Cooper then came up, and I sent him after them - I saw Brown run from the court.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far was Sims and the prosecutor from Hanover-court when you first saw them? A. Fifty or sixty yards - she had not hold of his arm then - she was walking by his side and talking to him - I did not see them turn into the court - they went close past me - I watched them about forty yards, and then Brown went after them - if the prosecutor had called for assistance, I should have heard him.</p>

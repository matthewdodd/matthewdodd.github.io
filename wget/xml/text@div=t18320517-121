            . I live at Langley, in Bucks. On the 4th of February I drove from Langley a load of straw for my son Robert, and when I got to Oxford-street I met the prisoner, who asked me if that load was to be sold - I said Yes; he said he thought he could<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170079"></xptr>help me to a customer for it - he took me down <placeName id="t18320517-121-crimeloc711">Portland-mews</placeName>

               <p>"I will give you the money presently;" he got behind the cart, and went away - I sold it to the prisoner, and he sold it to Mr. Collins, in my presence, for 3s. more; I did not intend to let him have it without the money - I expected he would pay me when he got the money; we always have the money on corn as it is unloaded - he was to pay me 33s., and he sold it for 36s.; I told him I did not intend to part with it without the money - the straw was weighed; he slipped away unknown to me.</p>
               <p>ROBERT SPICER, JUN. The straw was mine; I sent my father with it - on the 28th of April I found the prisoner in the New-road, and took him into custody - I told him he was the man I wanted to see about the load of straw; he said he would make it up to me, but he had no money then - he went away; I followed him, and said he had better make it up - he then ran off; I called and ran after him - a man stopped him; the officer came and took him - he said he would pay me 3s. or 4s. at a time, as he got it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had three loads of straw of the old man; I took the last load to the same person as the first - I asked the old man the price in Oxford-street; he said a guinea and a half - Mr. Collins asked the price, and I said 10 1/2d. a truss; there were 180lbs. short of weight - Mr. Collins said he would not pay, and he had a good mind to lay the fine on him; I said I knew nothing about it, and perhaps the man did not know it; he paid me, stopping 6s. for the short weight.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Messrs. Marshall and Snelgrove, drapers, in Vere-street—on 3d March, between 4 and 5 in the afternoon, the two prisoners came there—they addressed a person in the shop, and were shown to the silk counter in Vere-street—I was on the opposite side of the shop—</p>

               <p>I saw Griffiths take a piece of silk that was lying alongside of him, place it underneath the silks they were looking at, and after a short time put it into what appeared to be the pocket of Hall—I immediately sent for a policeman—I saw two pieces of silk taken from Hall's pocket—there was about 178 yards, worth about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Hall had bought a piece of silk which she carried in her hand.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, D</hi> 16). On 4th March, about 4 o'clock, I was called into the silk department of Messrs. Marshall and Snelgrove—I saw the two prisoners there—I waited about half an hour before I spoke to them—from something I heard in the shop, I looked toward the prisoners, and saw the male prisoner with both his hands in front, his chin on the counter, and poking something in the pocket in front of the female prisoner—it appeared like paper—I only saw a <hi rend="italic">lump</hi> of paper—about twenty minutes after that, as they were going out at the door, I put my foot on Hall's dress, the male prisoner having her by the arm looking it some ribbons—I felt the bulk in her pocket, and said, "What have you got here?"—she turned round to me and said, "What has that to do with you; who are you, that I am to tell what I have?"—Griffiths then said, "What is it; what is it?"—I said I was a police-sergeant, and before they left the premises I should see what she had in that pocket, or bag—I walked them both back into the silk department—Griffiths said to Hall, "What is it you have been doing?"—she said, "Why, stealing"—I told her to pull out that which she had got in her dress—she was endeavouring to do so, and she turned round and said she could not do it, I had better do it myself"—Griffiths said, "She asked me to come out to buy her a silk dress; she wanted me to buy it here, and I came here and bought it for her; this is it," producing the parcel which he had under his arm—these two pieces I took from Hall's pocket in front of her dress—it was a kind of double skirt, although it was apparently a single skirted dress, with a pocket in front—the silk was doubled up roughly—while they were at the station Hall said to Griffiths, "Don't be down-hearted, Joe; I have put you into a good shop of work; one that will last you for some time"—I asked Griffiths where he lived—he refused to give his address.</p>

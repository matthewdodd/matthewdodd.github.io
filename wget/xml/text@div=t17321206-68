               <p>The Prisoner had bought 17 large Glass Bottles of an old Man that cries old Rags and broken Glass ; and afterwards coming to Williamson's House, (in the Neighbourhood) and seeing some such Bottles there, he ask'd Williamson's Brother, for Williamson himself was blind, if he had not lost some such Bottles; for, says he, I have bought several of the like sort of an old Bottleman, and if you'll come to my Shop you shall see them, and if they belong to your Brother, I'll stop the old Fellow next time I see him. Williamson upon this (having lost several Goods) got a Search Warrant, and his Brother, with a Constable, went to the Prisoner's House, where they found some of those Bottles; and thereupon apprehended the Prisoner for Felony and Burglary. A great Number of Witnesses were sworn in the Prisoner's Behalf, by whose Evidence it appeared that he was a Person of good Credit and a fair Character.

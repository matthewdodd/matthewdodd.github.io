I have heard Penny's evidence; it is correct—I saw the prisoner at King's Cross, and followed her to Seven Dials, where she was met by a man standing close to the Grapes public-house—they had about five minutes' conversation, and the man left—ho returned in a quarter of an hour, and appeared to pass something to the prisoner, who left him, and went in the direction of Walker's Court—I followed her, and just before she went into the Court she placed some<lb></lb>thing behind the stone of the gateway—when she left, I wont to the spot, but could not see anything, as it was very foggy and dark—I followed her to Mr. Penny's shop, who gave me this florin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—next morning I returned to the spot before daylight, and behind the stone I found this bad florin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), wrapped in paper inside a kid glove.</p>

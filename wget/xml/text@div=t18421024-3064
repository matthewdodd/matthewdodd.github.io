On the 30th of September I delivered the keys to a porter of Mr. Clark's the goods were sold on the premises that day—there was a still and other things—there was a metal tap in one of the casks—I saw the prisoner about—I had information, and spoke to Appleby, the auctioneer's porter—I had seen the prisoner in the room adjoining the room where the oval cask was—I saw a brass tap taken from him—Appleby left him in my charge—I heard something fall—I looked down and found a metal plug close to his heels—Appleby picked it up.</p>

On the 30th of September he had a sale at Battersea—Francis delivered the keys to Page, and the whole of the things after that were in my charge—I inspected the property at twelve o'clock—it was all right at that time—after the sale, from information, I looked at</p>

               <p>the vat, and found this tap had been pulled out—I went up to the prisoner, who was standing on the grussplot—seeing his pocket hanging down with something heavy, I asked what he had got in his pocket—he replied, "A pair of pincers"—I asked to look at them—he pulled them out—I was satisfied he had something else in it—I asked what it was—he hesitated, and then nodded away from the premises, and said it was a piece of metal he had got over yonder—when he did let me look at it I saw it was a piece of metal belonging to the steam-engine, or something of that kind—I took from his other pocket this metal cock—I left him in custody of Francis, and went to my master—on my return I saw something fall from the prisoner, close to his heels—I picked it up, and it was this plug—I saw the policeman find on him this other plug—when I looked again on the premises, the plugs which had been in the vats, and these other things were missing—the number of things found exactly corresponded with those missing, and they fitted in every respect—the officer missed a piece of metal which had been broken or cutoff—when the prisoner was committed, he said he had done it through distress—he said he had a family at home, but be would not say where.</p>

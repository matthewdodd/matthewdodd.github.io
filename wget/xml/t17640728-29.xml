            . The prisoner was out with goods, late in the evening, to sell, as he told me, last Saturday was se'ennight: he brought a wheelbarrow full of goods, after ten at night; he desired me to give them to the waterman, for him to carry them down the next day. I never looked into the goods: the waterman was then in bed: the waterman carried them away in the morning; I saw him carry them out of the house. The prisoner desired he would not let Richardson, another brazier, see them.</p>
               <p>Thomas Green. When I got up in the morning, Mrs. Godman told me there were some things come for me to carry down to Brentford: they were in a wheel-barrow; I put them, wheel-barrow and all, into my boat: there were divers goods; I did not in particular see any copper; I did not open them; he left word where he would wait for them, to receive them: he was there; I delivered them to him; he helped me out of the boat with them; but I cannot swear I had a copper in my boat.</p>

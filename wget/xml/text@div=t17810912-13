               <p>On Wednesday the 22d of August I paid some money at King James's stairs, Wapping. The prisoner saw me pull my purse out. I went to Old Gravel-lane, and then to New Gravel-lane. I supped there, and staid till nine o'clock. I went to <placeName id="t17810912-13-crimeloc65">St. James's-street</placeName>

               <p>I went up stairs into the prisoner's room to lock her door, and I saw the purse. She took two guineas and a half, some odd halfpence, and some silver, how much I cannot say, out of it, and took it up. She rented a garret in my house, at 3 s. 6 d. per week. The purse was dropped in the room when I went up stairs.</p>

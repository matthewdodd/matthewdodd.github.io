               <p>Was you robbed by a single person? - By a single person; I was sitting with my face to the horses, and I saw a man riding up in front of the coach, with a pistol in his hand, I was in the Reading post-coach, the man that robbed me was on horse back.</p>

               <p>Was he any ways disguised? - Not at all, but having a flapped hat on, and a large great coat; some conversation passed between him and the coachman, which I did not hear, and the coach drove by him, he turned his horses heads about, and the prisoner then came up to the coach, and the coachman stopped, and the prisoner said, speaking to the coachman, if you do not stop, I will fire into the coach; there is always a degree of confusion in those cases, and I cannot say exactly what he said, I think he said, your purses and your watches, or I will fire into the coach.</p>

               <p>Are you sure he said your purses? - No, I will not be sure of it.</p>

               <p>You do not know then that he asked for any thing? - I think he said your purses or I will fire into the coach; upon that I gave him my purse, but I will not swear to any words; I saw his pistol, there were two guineas in my purse and some shillings, more than twelve, I did not give him my watch.</p>

               <p>How long was it before you saw the prisoner afterwards at Bow-street? - I went on to Basseldon that evening, and the coachman came over to me on the Friday, I think it was, and I returned to town with him on the Monday following, and went directly to Bow-street with him.</p>

               <p>From your recollection of the man, are you positive that is the man that robbed you? - No, my Lord, I am not.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Councel. You have no recollection at all of the person that robbed you? - I do not swear to the person.</p>

             a clergyman, who lives at Chelsea, was in the coach, and jumped out, and ran back to Hounslow; when the highwayman saw him, he rode after him, Mr. Luard was in the coach at the same time, and Mr. Eyre jumped over a bank, and said, you villain I will not give you a halfpenny; then he said, Williams, take off your horses, and let us pursue the rascal, that frightened him, and he rode off; I run my coach after him three hundred yards, I thought of running the poll into him, I was within a few yards of him, I saw the lady give the purse out of the coach.</p>

               <p>What did he do to Mr. Luard? - I did not see him give him his purse.</p>

               <p>Do you know who that highwayman was that committed this robbery? - This is the gentleman.</p>

               <p>Are you sure he is the man? - I am very sure, because I took one of my horses from the coach and caught him, and brought him back again in less than half an hour, I took his pistol out of his right hand, and hit him over the head first, and took his pistol from him, then I gave him two more knocks of his head, and hit him off his horse, then I searched him and found another pistol in his pocket, I am sure he is the man.</p>

               <p>How far off did you take him? - I dare say it was four miles and a half, I do not know the place, I did not keep him in sight, I suppose I rode two miles and a half before I saw him, after I took the horse off, I could ride a mile in three minutes at furthest on that little horse, there was one Jones, he said, he hit him.</p>

               <p>I had been at my fields, and coming along the road to dinner, I saw a man come full gallop past me, I turned round to look at him, he said nothing to me nor I to him, about five or six hundred yards further off, the corner of Mr. Child's park, I saw a young servant and his master, and he called out a highwayman! I turned after him, and when I came to the cross roads, I could just perceive the top of his head, which way he went, I pursued him as hard as I could, and when I came within five or six yards, he pulled out a pistol, I had only this switch in my hand, and I did not like it, I stopped my horse and turned back, I suppose twenty yards, and I met the gentleman's servant there again, and I said, give me your stick, so he did and I pursued him again; I had some men at work in t he fields, I called to them, and they did not come; then I rode after him, he had a pistol in his hand, he said something, I bid him shoot, I told him if he did not shoot me, I would knock him off his horse, with that he turned round, and I hit him on the side of the temple, which I look upon it stunned him, I hit him then, and he dropped his hands though he did not drop the pistol, and instantly came up the young man, and the coachman and several more, six or seven after he had turned round and come back a little way, the coachman says to him, give that purse you robbed the lady of, says he, it is a red purse, with half a guinea in it; this is the purse, this is a green purse, the coachman gave it to me, and it has been in my possession ever since, there was half a guinea, and five shillings in silver, and three halfpence; the coachman said, to the best of my remembrance, give me the red purse.</p>

What did you say to the prisoner about the purse? - I told Wilkinson, first; says I, stop your horse, I saw the highwayman take a green purse from the lady, I said nothing to Jones at all, I said to the prisoner, give me the green purse which you took from the lady.</p>

I asked him if he should know the man again; he said, yes, he should; the prisoner was near the gate of Goldsmith's Hall, with about ten or a dozen people round him; the boy pointed out the prisoner, I asked him if he was quite sure he was the man, he said, yes, indeed it was; the prisoner said, how can you say it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181104030032"></xptr>was me; the child said, you are the very man that took my bundle, and you know you are, and them you asked me what was the matter; then I put the child out out of my arms, and took the prisoner by the collar, and said I would hold him; he told me to touch him if I dare, he lived in the city, and had a respectable character; I told him I did not care what he said in that respect, because there were as many thieves in the city as out of it, I would hold him untill he was in better hands; I kept him untill the officer came, and then I gave him up; he was taken into the White Hart, I took the child in there, and then the child pointed him out.</p>

I am a marshalman; I was in Mr. Adams's house at the time the last witness came in with Mr. Adams's sister, she told me there was a piece of work in the street; I went out immediately, I got into the middle of the bustle, there were twenty or thirty people there; the woman did not know me, she was loth to give up the man; the neighbours said they knew me, and then she delivered him up. The prisoner wished me to be delicate, said he would not run away, he had a deal to say for himself, he pitied the boys loss; he seemed to say that he was not such a character as to do such a thing. I told the boy not to be frightened, and told the prisoner to come a little higher up, I knew there was a public-house, and I should not loose him. I should hold him. The neighbours came with me, the woman and the boy; the child was alarmed. I set him on the taproom table, told him nobody should hurt him; he told me the same as he has told your lordship now, and as correct; the prisoner was full of talk, I searched him, in one of his pockets I found this clasp knife open I told him when I had clasp knives I generally had them shut; he said he did not know how it came open; I asked him what trade he was; he said he was learning one with his uncle, his uncle was a bag maker. He said before the Alderman that he had been to taken at party to the Liverpool coach; I asked the bookkeeper, every thing that he said was false; he said his employment lived in the City gardens.</p>

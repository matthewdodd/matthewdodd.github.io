                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 5). On the morning of 11th May, I was on duty at Old Ford, Bethnal-green, and met the prisoner carrying this basket on his shoulder—I asked what he had got in it—he said, "My tools"—I asked what they consisted of—he said, "Plumber's tools"—I said, "It looks very bulky; have you any objection for me to open the basket"—he said, "I have a bottle"—I said, "What does it contain "—he said, "A gallon of brandy"—I asked where he brought it from—he said, "From Stratford"—I asked where he was going to take it to—he said, "Shoreditch"—I was going to take the bottle out of the basket, and he smashed it on the pave-ment intentionally—I took him into custody, and found in his basket a screw-driver, a gimlet, hammer, two knives, and a paint-brush—I took him to the station and searched him, and found an old ink bottle full of paraffin, and a piece of paper with "Mitford Castle" in pencil on it—I went there, and saw the landlord—it is three quarters of a mile from where I stopped the prisoner—I examined it, and found four iron bars taken from the cellar window—an entry had been made, and this lock forced off—the marks on it correspond with this screw-driver.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Mitford Castle—I shut up the house myself on the night of 10th May—I did not close the door where the iron bars were, but left it open for ventilation—the bars were all right when I went to bed at 12—I was called up by the policeman—I found that the lock of the bar parlour-door had been taken off—I went into the cellar—I missed a two-gallon bottle, containing spruce, which was on the floor—it was safe the night before—I missed two gallons of brandy out of a quarter cask standing in the cellar—there was a tap to draw it out in the cellar—the bars of the window had been forced off—I saw the prisoner the day before in my back premises, at half-past 5 or 6 in the evening, and this basket was in my bar when he was at the back.</p>

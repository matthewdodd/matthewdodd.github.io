               <p>"That man used to lie in bed till ten or eleven o'clock:" we went, and found him with a pipe in his mouth, drinking some purl; he called him out, and said "This man has lost his money, you must know what has become of it:" he said he had not got it - the landlord said, "I shall not be contented - I shall send for an officer," and told me to stand by him; the prisoner kept walking from me - I followed him; he walked faster, and I laid hold of the flap of his coat; my landlord's wife then came up - the prisoner turned, and took my hold from his flap, and then he bolted; she followed him, crying "A thief, stop him!" and I followed him; he was stopped, and brought back - he handed the money over to the landlady- there was a sovereign, two half-crowns, and some small money, making 1l. 10s. 6 1/2d.; he is a labourer, and used to work up at York-house.</p>
               <p>JOHN LLOYD. I am the officer. I have 1l. 10s. 6 1/2d., and four duplicates.</p>

He came home at half-past ten o'clock, and was quite intoxicated; he put his trousers under the head of the bed, and went out in the morning; I was feeling for my stockings, and found the money; when he came to me, he asked if I had the money; I said, in a josular way, that I had not, and walked off.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PALHER re-examined. I did not come home in liquor the night before - I put my trousers under my pillow, and in the morning they were at the top, but I did not consider I had lost the money.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable F</hi> 142.) On the 18th of December I was on duty in Charles-street, Drury-lane, and saw a cart standing near some buildings which were being pulled down—the name of John Donovan was on the cart—I saw the prisoners putting old flooring-boards into the cart, and some square pieces—they were parts of the buildings which were being pulled down—I stood in an alley opposite and watched them—they brought the wood out of a dark doorway in an alley, and then it was thrown into the cart by the three prisoners—I then went and asked who authorized them to take the wood away—Liddiard and Pink said Mr. Smith, their mas<lb></lb>ter—I asked what they were going to do with it—they said they were going to sell it for some beer—I told them I should take them into cus<lb></lb>tody—Pink and Liddiard said "Do not, for we shall get discharged"—I asked Donovan whether the cart belonged to him—he said it did—I got the assistance of another constable, and took them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder, and live in Tottenham-court-road. I was pulling down these houses—the materials belong to the parish, and were to be sold to-morrow by auction—I assisted Mr. Bullock, the auc<lb></lb>tioneer, in lotting the materials out—I had no more to do with them—they were inside a hoard, of which I had the key—there was a tenant on the premises who had a key of the lock as well—I had the key to keep the materials—I employed Pink and Liddiard, but they were not to take the wood away—I saw Donovan's cart at the station-house with a quan<lb></lb>tity of wood in it, which appeared <hi rend="italic">to</hi> be part of the materials of the houses—it was worth about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had not authorized either of the prisoners to take it—I had no right to take it myself.</p>

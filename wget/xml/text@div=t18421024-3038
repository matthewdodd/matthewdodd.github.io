                  </hi>. I keep a carpet and general drapery shop in Rat<lb></lb>cliffe-highway. I know the prisoner—Mr. William Blair has been a cus<lb></lb>tomer of mine for eight years—he lives in Red Lion-street, Wapping—the prisoner came to my shop on the 10th of October, about three o'clock in the afternoon—she said, "Mr. Padden, I want seven yards of striped cotton shirting for my master, Mr. Blair"—she said, "My master told me you was to send a bill by me, and he will call in the evening and pay for it: he it gone into the City to get some money"—I let her have it, considering, from what she said, that she came from Mr. Blair—Mr. Blair had some shirts a day or two before—she returned in about half an hour, and said, "Mr. Padden, you have charged my master 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard too much for the shirt<lb></lb>ing; and have taken 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard more than you charged him before; but he has sent me for seven yards more, and also for three yards of fine brown holland for my mistress's aprons;" and opening out the bill which I had at first given her, she said, "Master says you must put it all on this same bill; and he will call up and pay you this evening, or at least on Sa<lb></lb>turday morning"—I cut off the shirting and the holland, and she took it a way.</p>

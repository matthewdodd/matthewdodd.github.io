               <p>Are you an apprentice? - No.</p>
               <p>Whose shop do you take care of? - Mr. Davison's. I was coming home on Tuesday or Wednesday night, I think it was; it was between nine and ten, in July, I think the 27th, facing St. Clement's church; the prisoner crossed upon me in the <placeName id="t17910914-26-crimeloc159">Strand</placeName>

The prisoner turned round, and fronted me, and held me in his arms, while the other man put his arms round my waist, and got hold of my watch-string; the other man that pulled at my watch-string ran away; the chain broke; I lost a steel watch-chain, all the chain went, and a stone seal set in metal gilt, and a watch-key and hook. I held the prisoner till Mr. Hutchinson took him from me; I had not seen them converse together before, nor had I seen the prisoner before. I was particularly careful that evening in keeping my coat over my fob. The prisoner held me down quite fast with his two arms round my body; he endeavoured to put them over my arms as much as he could. I held him by the leg till Mr. Hutchinson came up. People were passing but no tried<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179109140038"></xptr>Nobody interfered; the place was remarkably clear.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. Did not you say at Bow-street, that it was in the Strand, opposite St. Clement's church? - It was opposite the church-yard.</p>
               <p>What you said at Bow-street was read over to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you signed it? - Yes. I might say St. Clement's church, being so very near the church; it was in the very narrowest part of the Strand.</p>
               <p>He could not well get out of your way when he turned round? - He might have got out of my way.</p>
               <p>He caught hold of you round the body? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That he might do to save himself from falling? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He was near falling, I believe? - Yes, he stooped a little; he did not fall; he was very near falling.</p>
               <p>At this instant, you say somebody made a pluck at your watch? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The person that snatched at your watch offered you no violence at all? - None at all.</p>
               <p>This person was very near falling? - Yes, and he made me fall.</p>
               <p>You have seen persons fall in like manner? - I have seen them fasten upon one another.</p>
               <p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an oilman. I know the prosecutor. On Wednesday, the 27th of July, about nine in the evening, I was returning from Chelsea, and opposite St. Clement's church the prisoner was a little before this young man, and another behind him; this young man was in the middle, and another behind him; the prisoner turned round, and said, Bob, this is not our way home, we will go the other way; the prisoner turned round, and took hold of this young lad, and the other made a snatch at his watch. This young lad called out, my watch, my watch, murder, my watch. I tried to catch hold of the other, but he got away; then I took hold of the prisoner, while the prosecutor held him by the leg. While I was trying to catch the other, the prisoner begged hard to get away, and said, it was not him who robbed the lad. I at that time held him, and asked the churchwarden to go for a constable; he staid about half an hour, I held him all the time. The constable's name was Talboys. I went with them, and put the prisoner in the watch-house, and next morning he was taken before a magistrate.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Were there a great many persons passing at the time? - A great many.</p>
               <p>The lad was moving towards him? - He was two yards from him.</p>
               <p>The lad could hardly avoid running against him? - He could very easy avoid it.</p>
               <p>Have you not seen that accident frequently happen? - Never.</p>
               <p>Did not the prisoner at the bar almost fall? - No.</p>
               <p>Indeed? - Indeed, not to my knowledge. When the lad laid hold of his leg, he jostled him.</p>
               <p>Did you make any offer of this kind, the lad saying that he belonged to reputable connections, that you would discharge him if he could bring any reputable connections? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Should you know the other man again? - Why, I could not swear to him; he was a short man, with a round hat.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner, at the time this happened, give any account of the other man? - He called him by his name, which is in the indictment.</p>

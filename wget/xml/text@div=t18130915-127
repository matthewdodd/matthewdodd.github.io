They never parted, nor left the room until they came out with me, and when I came to the top of Duck-lane they wished me good morning, and I the same; it was then about three o'clock. I turned the corner of the Broad-way, I put my hand in my pocket, I discovered that the parcel I had in my possession was gone; I turned back to go in pursuit of these two women that I had been with; I met two watchman; I asked them to go along with me; at that time I did not know what the parcel contained. I went back to the house that I came from, along with two watchman; I rapped at the door; I had no answer.

            . I am an officer. On Saturday, the 14th of August, about five o'clock in the morning, I was called up by the watchman; who said, that two women were charged with robbery; I immediately went to the room in New-court, Duck-lane. The prosecutor charged the prisoners with robbing him; I searched them, and also the room; I found nothing. I took the prisoners to Tothill-fields; I returned and made enquiry; I discovered that Gohan lived in a room nearly opposite; I went to that room, and upon the table I found this handkerchief, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181309150064"></xptr>on searching the bed I discovered a hole big enough to put my hand in; I did not at that moment search the bed diligently; I pulled my coat off, and put my arm in; but the bed was so dirty I was afraid of getting something; I must confess I did not search the bed so much as I ought. On Friday, the 10th of the present month, I received information that a publican had stopped a note of a great amount, and suspected that was one of the notes that were lost; I traced the fifteen-pound note. This was a month after the robbery all but one day.</p>

On Saturday I was charing there; that was the room that Goban lived in, my landlady told me so. On Thursday night, I was shaking the bed, it rattled; I got a knife and ripped the bed; put my hand in; I pulled out three three-shilling pieces, an eighteen-penny piece, and an halfpenny; then I felt again, and pulled out two notes. I cannot read. I kept them in my pocket until the next morning, and then I gave the landlord of the White Horse one of the notes; he said it was a fifteen-pound note; he gave it me again; I put it in my pocket. I went again to that house; the landlord said, here has been a woman here that has had a lucky find; I said, I had. He said, have you got them; I said, yes; I took one out; I gave it him. He said, it was not the note that I gave him before; he said he would keep that; I said are you going to keep that, and to give me nothing for it; he said there would be something given for it, he would give it me; he would not wrong me of a halfpenny.

She said, this is the note. I took it. I said, this is not the note you shewed me in the morning. I stopped it; it was a two hundred-pound note. I went to Gosling's house, in Fleet-street; I shewed Mr. Sharp the note, and told him the circumstance; he searched his books, and found the note came from Mr. Bosanquet's house in Lombard-street.

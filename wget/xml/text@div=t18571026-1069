                  </hi>. I live at No. 20, Lawrence Lane, and am an importer of foreign goods I have one partner—in consequence of a com<lb></lb>munication made to me, I went, on 24th Sept., to No. 17, Vincent Terrace, Islington; I saw the prisoner in company with my cousin—I sent the prisoner out, and had some communication with my cousin—the prisoner came in, and I asked him for the parcel he had received from Charles Demuth just before, upon which he asked Charles Demuth whether he ought to give it up or not; Charles Demuth answered, "Yes," and the prisoner handed me a parcel out of his pocket—there were in it sixteen collars—I asked Charles Demuth for what purpose he had handed that parcel to the prisoner; he told me that the prisoner had asked him to steal that parcel, and others before that, which he had handed to the prisoner—the prisoner did not say anything to that—I sent for a policeman, and gave him in</p>

               <p>charge—these are my collars; I have a mark on them, the number and price—I am able to say positively they are my property, and have never been sold—I received them with certain marks on them, which are on the collars—they are not entered in my books as sold—I had often seen the prisoner at my warehouse, and he had an opportunity of seeing these collars there—the value of this parcel might be 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—after the prisoner was given into custody, I went with the officer to his lodgings, at No. 15, Blomfield Street, London Wall; I there found this book, an old cancelled cheque, and several letters from my cousin, addressed to the prisoner—in consequence of finding a card with the residence of Mr. Bradley, we went there, and found these other collars, which are mine; they have my private mark on them—the value of these might be from 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a shop in Cranbourne Street, Leicester Square.

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Through an interpreter</hi>). I am cousin of the prosecu<lb></lb>tor. I recollect the day when he came to my lodging, at Islington—I saw the parcel of collars given up to him on that occasion—I gave them to the prisoner—he came to my cousin's warehouse, where he saw me very often; he asked me to give him my address, which I did, No. 17, Vincent Terrace—he came there to me, and asked me whether I was inclined to go with him to the Eagle—he had two girls with him, and one of the girls had a collar similar to these; and that girl who had the collar round her neck asked what was the price of such a collar in this country—I said I did not know—the girl went away, and the prisoner asked me if I was not able to supply him with similar collars to that one which the girl had, for some girls—I gave him some—the first time was three samples; and after some few days he came to me, and asked me if I could not supply him with more collars of a similar sort, because he saw an opportunity of dealing advantageously with them—as far as I can recollect, I gave him some five or six times—I know I have stolen them on account of the instigation of the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bootmaker; I do some work for Mr. Demuth, at his warehouse in Lawrence Lane. I was there on some day in Sept., about 4 o'clock in the afternoon; I saw the last witness there—he went to the back part of the warehouse where there were some parcels lying—there were boxes with lace collars in them—I saw him open two boxes, and take some collars, but how many I could not say—there were as many as he could hold in his hand—he brought them to the front of the warehouse, he tore a piece of loose paper from under the table, he rolled the collars up in it, put them in his right hand coat pocket with his left hand, and went away—I made a communication of it the same evening to Mr. Demuth.</p>

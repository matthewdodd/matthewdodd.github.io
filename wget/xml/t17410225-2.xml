            . I am a Watchman, and was going Home a little after 4 o'Clock, and saw the Prisoner standing at Newsome's Cellar Door; I cry'd Halloo! he said Halloo again, and I went to my own House, which is about 8 or 10 Yards from Newsome's Door. I look'd out of my Window, and the Prisoner went into the middle of the Street, and look'd all round him; he then went back to the Cellar, and I saw him open the Door and go down. After this, I called up

I had no sooner turned my Back to call up Mr. Newsome, but Blake called me to his Assistance, and I seized the Prisoner coming out of the Cellar, and just as he came on the last Stair he gave Blake a Knock with something, which made him reel, and this Lathing Hammer was afterwards found in the Place where we had the Scuffle.</p>

We went to the Cellar Door, and it seemed to be fast, I niled, and said he was mistaken, he was certa he was not, and turn'd about to call Mr. Newsome I laid hold of the Prisoner at the Top of the Stairs; he swore he would stick me if I did not let him go, and gave me this Cut on the Head with something he had in his Hand.</p>

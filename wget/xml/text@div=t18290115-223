I had this money in a bag, in my right-hand waistcoat pocket on the 6th of December; the prisoner and I went into a public-house, and had a drop of beer - I happened to fall asleep; I do not know that I had been drinking too much - I went in there between one and two o'clock, and awoke between five and six; the prisoner and my money were then gone - I knew him before; he is a <rs id="t18290115-223-deflabel1199" type="occupation">labourer</rs>

I was having a pint of beer, between nine and ten o'clock; the prisoner came, and asked me if I would take 1l. 11s. to his daughter - I received from him a sovereign, a half-sovereign, and 1s.; he said he was going on a tramp - he has a son, who has lost the use of his limbs, and I was to give this to his daughter, while she was in trouble; on the Monday she came and had the sovereign, and said her father was in trouble.</p>

            . I am an officer. I found the prisoner in a room in Johnson's-place, sitting on the floor, in a state of intoxication - I asked what he had done with Bonner's money; he said, "I have got it;" I said,"Produce it" - he pulled out three sovereigns, a half-sovereign, and 7s. in other money; the next morning, his daughter came - I got this sovereign from her.</p>

When he came to my house, he asked for me; he slept with me that night - we went and had something to drink, and he never came near me till the Sunday afternoon; I ran from place to place to find him; he gave me this money, with his own hand, as he was intoxicated.</p>

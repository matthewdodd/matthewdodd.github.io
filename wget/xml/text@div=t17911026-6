I then got into bed and fell asleep; I was on the chair when they went away. The things were in a bag on the chair, he took the things, bag and all. I saw the prisoner on board his majesty's ship Monarch; I belonged to her five years, he was on board five or six months. I went to St. Catherine's the day after I lost my things, I catched the prisoner by the arm, it was between seven and eight o'clock at night; he had nothing of mine about him; he made his escape. This gentleman found a knife on him, I did not examine his pockets myself; I have found nothing but my knife.</p>

               <p>On Saturday morning the 8th, the prosecutor applied to me and described the prisoner; he told me he had hold of him, but he escaped; I found him about eleven o'clock at the Sun, St. Catherine's; this was on the 11th, Tuesday; I searched him, and found this knife and fork. (Prosecutor deposes to the knife and fork produced by Dawson.) I have had this knife eleven or twelve months, it was in the bag.</p>

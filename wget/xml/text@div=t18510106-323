I received this letter, not from the prisoner; but I have frequently seen him since, on the subject of this transaction, and have heard from him since that it was his writing—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Sir, I have been recommended to you by Mr. Ellis and Mr. Ramsay, respecting the sale of some reversionary property, both freehold and funded, payable at the death of a lady now in her eighty-seventh year. If convenient, I will call on you this day, between two and three o'clock, and give you the full particulars. It is my father and grandfather's property. Captain William Poulton.")—on the day I received it, the prisoner called; he stated that he was entitled to considerable property, on the death of his mother; and he proceeded to state the instruments by which he became entitled to the property—he gave a description of the property, and the names of the executors under the will of William Poulton—he said he was entitled to 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the death of his mother, who was eighty-seven, and had a policy in the Albion of 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on her life, that her</p>

               <p>supposition that his mother was dead, and that he would come into posses<lb></lb>sion of this property—if I had known his mother was alive, I should not have let him had it—he made a further representation that the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not sufficient to pay for the mourning, and he received 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more of my son, and gave him orders to pay the balance of the tailor's bill, 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; in the whole he received about 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the last was on lst Oct.—in a month or five weeks afterwards I heard he was in custody.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">At the prisoner's request, a long letter was read, addressed by him to the prosecutor, dated from Lawrence Pountney-lane, on 25th Oct., in which he stated he was truly ashamed of his ungenteel conduct towards him; and had he not been drinking, he should not have misconducted himself by sending a parcel of cabmen to his office; that he was desirous he should get the money he had advanced him, and he was willing to give him any security on the state for his trouble and expenses.</hi>)</p>

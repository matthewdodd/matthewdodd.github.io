                  </hi>. I am a confectioner, and live three doors from the prosecutor. On Sunday morning, the 30th of June, about five o'clock, I got up, and looked out of my back window, and saw a man lying on the tiles of a bakehouse, looking over the wall into Edward-street—it was the prisoner, I am certain—I gave a full description of his dress and features to the policeman—when I opened the door he was three or four yards from me—I saw his face—I got a side view of him—I hallooed out, "What do you want there?"—he turned round and looked me full in the face, then got up, ran across the tiles, jumped into a neighbour's yard, and I lost sight of him—I got out on the tiles, and took a bundle which be had left there—it was lying by the side of him when he was lying down—he was dressed in a light moleskin dress, double-breasted waistcoat buttoned close up, a dark hat with a very narrow brim, and a sort of red handker<lb></lb>chief, but you could see very little of that, the waistcoat being buttoned up close—it was the same dress as he has on now, and that is the descrip<lb></lb>tion I gave to the policeman—I called Alderman, and gave him the bundle—I let him in, told him the way the prisoner had gone, and he got out of window, and went in that direction.</p>

On the 26th of January, at a little after six o'clock in the evening, I was in the parlour - it was quite dark, the window was shut, and the outer shutter put to, but not fastened. I am sure that the sash was down. As the bell was going eight o'clock, my daughter went into the parlour, and called me; I found the window sash open, and thrown up to the top. I went through into the bed-room, which is on the same floor, to see if any one was concealed. My daughter called me, and I missed three Bibles, a knife-case, and a watch-case stand, off the mantle-piece; a work-box, three yards of lace; two pin-cushions, two umbrellas, which hung on the parlour door, and a pinafore, marked A.

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the 26th of January, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner passed me in the Curtain-road, with a bundle under his arm, about half a mile from the prosecutor's. I asked what he was carrying, he said some books, which he had brought from his father - it was three Bibles. I asked where his father lived, he said in Edward-street, Commercial-road. I took him into custody, and then he said he had brought them from nowhere - the watch-stand fell from his person. He afterwards said two men met him at the top of the Curtain-road, and gave him the bundle to carry, and that each of them were carrying an umbrella. I said I should take him to the public-house and search him, which I did, and found some duplicates on him, and a pinafore in his hat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He said each of the men were carrying umbrellas - A. Yes; and that they were on the other side of the way.</p>

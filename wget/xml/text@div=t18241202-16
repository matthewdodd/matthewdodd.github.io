I was somewhere about the shed at the time, but did not see it taken. I met the prisoner about twelve months ago, under the Piazza, with the coat on. I said "You have got my coat still on;" he said, "Yes." I said, "I will thank you for it." He got away, and I could not pursue him. I did not see him again till he was taken up a few days ago. He was in the habit of waiting for little jobs in the market.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not give it to me to keep me warm and dry, more than once, twice, or thrice? A. No; I never gave you leave to put it on; I have often told you to put it off.</p>

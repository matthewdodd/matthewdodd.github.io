               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were you drunk or sober - A. I had been drinking a little, but knew what I was doing; I was not the worse for liquor. A person offered to lend me two sovereigns - I pulled out my purse, and said,</p>
               <p>"I will let you see that I do not want it." I have always said that the prisoner took it away. I said I suspected nobody but him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say so at the time that you saw him take it - Not at that time, but I said so in the course of the evening. Cuffley, one of his party, went for him and brought him back. The constable was called for, and went to fetch another to assist him, and at that time he came back.</p>

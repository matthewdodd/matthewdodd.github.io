               <p>Were these things in the house when you went out? - Yes; I know they are Mrs. Tucker's property. I know some of them. I do not know any thing about the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Upon the 11th of May, at about a quarter before eight o'clock in the evening, I was going to a stationer's at the corner of Water-street, I saw the prisoner in the street. I went in and delivered my message, and when I came out, having a suspicion of the prisoner I secured him, and took him into the stationer's shop. I found this bundle of picklock keys (producing them) in his pocket.</p>
               <p>What was your reason for seising him? - I knew him before. I took him to the Rotation-office; I shewed the keys to the gentlemen, and told them I had a suspicion that if I went immediately I could find out his lodging. The magistrate ordered me to go and find his lodging; I went and found it in a court near Orchard street, I believe it is Brown's-court. I searched the lodging and found a great quantity of linen, and in the drawers I found this bunch of pick-lock keys (producing them) some have been strained and some broke. I likewise found this chissel and some powder and shot and a ball, in his great coat. Upon his second examination at the office he asked me for his coat,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280014"></xptr> and I gave it him again, and he immediately put it on; the magistrates ordered me not to deliver any thing else to him.</p>

               <p>Was you in the house? - No, I had been out, as near as I can guess, half an hour; there was only a woman left in the house with her husband, who was ill in bed.</p>
               <p>Who was that woman? -

            . They lodge in the two-pair-of-stairs room. When I returned I asked her if she had been down stairs or had heard any body; she said no. I missed the things mentioned in the indictment. I made enquiry at the pawnbrokers round about, but could get no intelligence of them. Some of the linen belonged to a gentleman's coachman and footman.</p>
               <p>What was the value of the things? - I do not know, there was new cloth for four shirts, which cost nineteen shillings and three pence. The coachman valued his linen at thirty shillings, and the footman at five shillings, at Justice Welch's. I do not know the value of the rest of the things.</p>
               <p>Where did you hear of the things afterwards? - I heard the prisoner was taken up; I went to the justice's and saw my things.</p>

               <p>I met the prisoner in Tyburn-road. I went into a stationer's shop with a letter from the Rotation-office. I kept my eye upon him. When I came out I secured him and brought him into the shop.</p>
               <p>Had you reason to suspect him? - Yes. I put him in a coach and took him to the Rotation-office. I informed the gentlemen whom I had got, and shewed them the picklock keys, which I had taken out of his pocket when I took him into the shop. I told them that some women had spoke to him, and I believed if I went immediately I could find his lodgings. They ordered me to go; I went and enquired and was informed where he lodged.</p>
               <p>Did you know his name? - Yes, very well. I knew him a good while before. Another person and I went to his landlord and told him, and insisted upon going into the room. The landlord assisted us to break open the door, and in the room we found a parcel of pick-lock keys and all these things (producing the goods mentioned in the indictment) The prisoner admitted the lodgings to be his before the justice, and wanted the things to be delivered to him particularly his great coat. I delivered the great coat to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280015"></xptr> him; I believe it is the same which he has on now.</p>
               <p>(The goods were deposed to by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutrix. How did you leave the house when you went out? - I locked the parlour door. The things were in the parlour. The outer door was not locked; whether it was shut or not I cannot say. The new cloth that was cut out for shirts has not been found.</p>

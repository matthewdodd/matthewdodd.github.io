I am a cab washser—on Friday morning, 15th August, I was near the back premises of 14, York Street, and saw two men on a wall—I called "Police!"and a policeman came—I went with him on to the roofs of the houses, but did not see the men—I found Lang in a stable under the manager—I said, "Get up, there are two burglars about here; if they see you lying here, they will say you are one of them"—he said, "Where are the b——coppers?"—I said, "Do you mean to say you are one of them?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Come along to the Globe, and we will have half a pint of six ale apiece," and he came with me till we met the constable, when he took to his heels, and the constable run after him—I am sure he is the man—I cannot identify the other.</p>

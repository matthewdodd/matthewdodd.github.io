               <p>JOHN VAUGHAN. I am an officer. On the 21st of August, near three in the morning, I was in <placeName id="t18140914-91-crimeloc504">St. Giles's</placeName>

I went to the gentleman, and asked him, if he had lost any thing; he said, he had. I lost sight of the gentleman. When I went to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181409140055"></xptr>the prisoners, I saw Jones draw a fine handkerchief out of a persons pockets, in the same way that he had before; the moment he

             the handkerchief he saw me, and they separated, and went round the coaches; there were four coaches in a triangle he went to the third coach; Sermon throwed the handkerchiefs into the coachman's hand, and then they separated. I pursued him and went back to take the coachman I saw him again, sitting on the coach-box, with a man of the name of Daniel was sitting with him, Daniel is a desperate character. I was going to take the coachman down, several of the people began to swear what they would do. I was alone; I could not take him.</p>

            . On the night mentioned in the indictment, we spent the evening in company together after our work: at half past twelve, we saw the appearance of the fire. The officer took us under the idea of getting money from our friends; our friends went to the constable of the night; he said, we might make it up for five shillings each.</p>

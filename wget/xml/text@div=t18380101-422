                  </hi>. I am a wine-merchant. The prisoner is my cellar<lb></lb>man, and has been so above seven years—about three weeks ago I missed three gallons of wine—I do not know how it went—the prisoner always had a jacket when he came to work, and very frequently left it on the premises—I had the curiosity to look into the jacket in consequence of suspicion—I lifted up his jacket one day by chance, in the warehouse, and saw a tin bottle in it, with the top out—it was empty—it would hold nearly a bottle—I smelt it, and it had decidedly contained wine—I watched occasionally every day, and on the 1st of January I looked at the jacket as usual, when he went to dinner, and found the tin in his pocket full of wine, drawn from a particular cask in my stock—I took my brother to see it, and then called in an officer, and showed it to him—when the prisoner returned from dinner, I had him called into the counting-house, and told him I suspected he had been robbing me—he said he never had—I said, "You have something in your pocket which belongs to me"—he said he had not, and turned out all his pockets, and said it was all he had got—the officer searched him, and found this tin flask of wine, put into a secret pocket, below the one I had found it in—he then said it was wine given to him—I asked him from whom—he said, "A person not far off"—I said, "Who?"—he said, "At St. Helen's"—I asked the name—he refused to tell, and said nothing should induce him to give up the name—I gave him in charge, and in his pocket we found an account of wine sold, amounting to between four and five dozen, and some spirits—I am convinced the wine was mine—it was very fine sherry.</p>

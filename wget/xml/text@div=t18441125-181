                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the Thames police—the de<lb></lb>ceased wan my father—he was a waterman, and had been so many years—he was sixty-six years of age. I was on the Surrey shore on the 25th of Oct., about ten minutes before ten o'clock in the morning, and saw him leave the Surrey shore about thirteen or fourteen minutes before ten, with four persons in a skiff with him—it was a boat of such a size as he could manage properly—I was standing on the causeway at Church-stairs, Ro<lb></lb>therhithe—the tide was nearly half flood—this was in the Pool—after he had left I noticed the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi> steamer, No. 6—it was coming up with the tide, and going at the rate of eight or nine miles an hour, in my opinion—the proper rate for steamers navigating the Pool is about five miles an hour—the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi> is a Woolwich boat—at the time I first saw the <hi rend="italic">Water<lb></lb>man</hi> coming up, my father was, I should say, better thun two-thirds across the water, and about 150 yards from the steamer—I lost sight of my father's boat on my attention being called to the steamer—there was a tier of ves<lb></lb>sels between my father's boat and the steamer—there were about six</p>

               <p>vessels in the tier at that time—there were no vessels whatever obstructing the channel of the river—the steamer seemed to be making a straight course for the Upper Tunnel-pier—that is not a slanting course from one pier to another—they take their course from below the Lower Tunnel-pier, in general—supposing she was coming from there, she would have to cross the river—she was going straight towards the Upper Tunnel-pier from where I saw her first, which was off King Edward's-stairs—that is, at the lower side of the Lower Tunnel-pier—the Tunnel stairs are on the Middle<lb></lb>sex side—when I first saw the steamer, her bows were slanting towards the Tunnel-pier—King Edward's-stairs are lower down the river than the Tunnel-pier, and on the Middlesex side—I observed the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi> No. 6 making a very heavy <hi rend="italic">careen</hi> on one side, leaning on one side, and I ob<lb></lb>served a skiff come under her stern momentarily afterwards, and saw three or four persons struggling in the water from the skiff—that was just above the Lower Tunnel-pier—they were going towards the Upper Tunnel-pier—there are two Tunnel piers, which are near about 100 yards apart—there was a schooner moored just above the Lower Tunnel-pier—I did not ob<lb></lb>serve the position of that schooner either then or afterwards—I went off in my own boat, came up to the skiff, and found it was my father's.</p>

On Friday, the 25th of Oct., I got into a boat on the Thames—there were five in the boat altogether with the person who was rowing—I did not know him—we were going over to Wapping Dock-stairs—as we were going along we met with a barge going up along the tide—I <hi rend="italic">sang</hi> out, "Waterman, here is a barge coming," and he rowed astern of it—after that we met a schooner, and we went ahead of the schooner—after we had passed the schooner we saw a steamer coming up—we were sufficiently near to see the number—it was <hi rend="italic">No</hi>. 6, <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi>—we were between 100 and 150 feet from the steamer, as near as I could judge—she was coming up along the tide—when I saw her, I stood up and waved my hand for them to keep more out into the middle of the river, which they did not—she did not make the least alteration in her course after I made that sign—I saw a person on the paddle-box—I do not know who it was—he saw me wave my hand—he had an opportunity of altering his course so as to keep more into the middle of the river—when the waterman saw the steamer coming he rowed as hard as he could—the steamer's <hi rend="italic">stem</hi> nearly caught the boat, and knocked the scull out of the waterman's hand—he rowed round with his right hand, so that the steamer should not strike the boat right in the middle, so as to slant the boat along the steamer, and the fore part of the paddle-box struck</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waterman. On Friday, the 25th of Oct., I was on the Lower Tunnel-pier, and saw the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi>, No. 6, coming up the river—she was going at the rate of eight or nine miles an hour—I do not know whether that is her full speed or not—there was a schooner moored to the Lower Tunnel-pier—I had moored her there some time before—I saw a skiff and a man rowing—the steam-boat struck it—she was not above her own length from the skiff when I first saw her—she was just on the point of striking—I did not see whether it had at all altered its direc<lb></lb>tion before it struck the boat—the skiff was twenty-one feet long—the speed of the steamer was not diminished to my sight—I had seen the steamer before—at the time I saw the skiff the steamer was going in the same direction as she had been before—she had not altered her course from the time I first saw her—when I first saw her she was about 150 feet from where I stood—it was not half a minute between my first seeing her and her striking the skiff—I have been acquainted with the river for some time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waterman, employed by the Tunnel-pier Com<lb></lb>pany at the Lower Tunnel-pier. On the 25th of Oct. I saw the <hi rend="italic">Waterman, No</hi>. 6, coming up before ten o'clock in the morning—I saw a skiff with persons in it—it was about forty or fifty yards from the steamer when I first saw it—I saw some man in the boat, get up and wave his hand to the steamer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From the position of the steamer and the skiff at that time, could the steamer, in your opinion, have avoided it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, if he had altered his helm, by starboarding the helm, or stopping the engine, might have saved it—there was nothing to prevent them taking a left-hand course—I saw a man on the paddle-box—if he had been looking out he must have seen the boat—he sung out to them, "Hoy, hoy"—he did not stop the steamer at all—he kept on his course—I saw an eddy from the schooner that was lying aground—that eddy could not have affected the skiff at all—she was away from it—she was in the tide's way—if she had been in the eddy, the steamer could not have got at her at all.</p>

On Friday, the 25th of Oct., I was navigating a barge on the river—I was going to stop it at the Upper Tunnel-pier—I was going up with the tide—I saw a schooner aground against the Lower Tunnel-pier, which I belong to—that schooner caused an eddy, about twice the vessel's length, round her—it was up and down the river too—it caused a circular eddy—it ran right round, astern of the vessel in particular—she laid athwart the river—the eddy extended a good way out, about two barges' length from her into the river—my barge got into the eddy, and it stopped me from going to the place where I intended, the Upper Tunnel-pier—it turned her round twice—when I found she was in the eddy I let her go her own road, and put my oar in, finding it was no use—I began to feel the eddy soon after I came to the schooner, almost directly I came opposite her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a leather-dresser. I was a passenger on board the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi> steamer on this day. I was on the cabin stairs at the time the accident happened—I did not see the blow struck, but I heard and felt it—before I felt the blow the engines were positively stopped—there were several passengers on deck—it was rather a wet morning, and many were down in the cabin.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waterman. I was a passenger on board the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi> steamer on the 25th of Oct.—I saw the schooner aground by the Lower Tunnel-pier—I was standing on the starboard side of the pad<lb></lb>dle-box, just before it—I saw the skiff, I should suppose, about half a minute before we rounded the schooner's stern—as soon as I saw the skiff, I heard the orders, "Ease her," "Stop her," and "Turn her astern," given by the master—those orders were given in succession; I suppose, in half a second, as soon as he could repeat them—the skiff was in the eddy when I saw her—the eddy had a great effect on her—nobody has the power of pulling in a boat when it gets into an eddy—she was quite un<lb></lb>manageable—she was turned round towards the steamer, not exactly round—in my judgment, the eddy, and nothing else, caused the collision—I can give no other account—had no schooner been there, and nothing to cause the eddy, the boat would have gone into the stairs before the steamer found her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waterman's apprentice. On the morning of the 25th of Oct. I was on the Upper Tunnel-pier, and saw the accident—I did not see anything done by the steamer in order to avoid it—the accident would not have occurred if the schooner had not been where she was—she created an eddy—in my judgment the skiff could not have been seen by the steamer before she rounded the schooner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am mate on board the Waterman steamer, No. 6. I was on board on the 25th of Oct.—I saw the skiff when I was abreast of the schooner's stern—the first thing I did was to hail the skiff.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Whereabouts were you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was on the fore starboard deck—the prisoner was on the paddle-box—it was his business to look out—he was the person who was directing the motions of the vessel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR J. BAYLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you hail the skiff to do? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To keep clear of us—she would have done so had it not been for the eddy—I can<lb></lb>not say how near she was to us then—I should say within something less than fifty or sixty yards when I first saw her, thereabouts—I cannot say exactly—it might be about two of our vessel's length—I cannot say exactly—I dare say our vessel is ninety feet long—I did not hear any orders given by the captain when I first hailed her—I believe I hailed her first—when I saw her in the eddy coming towards us, I heard the captain say, "Ease</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184411250208"></xptr>
               <p>her, stop her"—I believe those orders were obeyed—I ran to pick up a boat-hook for the purpose of defending the boat off if she came nigh us, which she did—I saw the boat fly out into the eddy, and then ran, and picked up the boat-hook—I could not keep her off—I was there in time to do so, but the boat rowing towards us, and coming out in the eddy rapidly, and our boat keeping way at the time, I had no power to keep her off.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you hear any orders given about altering your course? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The word "Starboard" was given—I believe that was before the words "Ease I her, stop her"—I believe the man at the helm put the helm a starboard by the course I saw her come—I was not looking out, I was looking at the boat at the time, but judging from the head of the boat, and the way she went, I judged the helm must have been starboarded, otherwise her head would not have come out from the shore as it did—the boat would have gone under the wheel before, had it not been for the man pulling with one hand and stopping the other—that was a proper direction to give in order to avoid a collision.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you been on board the <hi rend="italic">Water<lb></lb>man</hi>? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About a year and nine months.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing you were fifty yards from an object perfectly stationary, and you going at full speed, should you be able to stop your vessel before coming up to that object? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You may easily stop the engine, but the vessel would not stop in the time—the engine might be stopped—if we were fifty yards from an object, and going with the tide, we could not prevent our steamer from going over that object—if we backed our engines, and starboarded our helm, that would not avoid it with the tide in our favour—we had a man at the helm—if the object, instead of lying still, were making to the right, we should be able to avoid it by starboarding our helm, which would throw our head away—that would, take very little time—the boat came to us faster than our helm would act.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say he called out, "Starboard" just before "Ease her, stop her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, we were then so close to the boat that by the time I got up the boat-hook she was striking against us, at the time the helm was starboarded the boat was about her own length from us, about twenty-three feet—the object of starboarding the helm was to clear the boat if possible—if that had been done when we were fifty yards off, we might have got further out of her way, her head could have been thrown more off.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, if at the time when you hailed the boat, when she was unman<lb></lb>ageable, your helm had been starboarded, your vessel would have cleared her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The boat was not unmanageable at the time I first saw her—she was rowing down fair in the tide—she was not in the eddy when I first saw her—I do not think we should have got clear of her if our helm had been starboarded at the time I hailed her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you tried to do that at twenty feet which would be impossible in fifty yards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If it had not been so we should have struck the boat in the other bow, by backing we threw her head rather more in shore, whereas we should have struck her on the other bow had it not been so—I believe I was the first person that called out—I did not notice that the prisoner called out or took any notice of her—the first I heard him say was, "Starboard the helm"—that was too late, because the eddy had then taken the boat's head—if there had been nothing but the true tide she would have cleared us, had we been going as fast as we could pos<lb></lb>sibly</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you receive any orders what to do with the helm previous to that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> After the weigh of the boat was off, I had orders from the captain, and I put the helm according to which was the right way for it to be put, in order to put her into the Tunnel-pier—after this wherry was stopped I shifted the helm—I did not feel the knock against the wherry—I did not see the collision, and did not feel it exactly—I heard it mentioned that we had run a boat down—no order was given me just before that, further than to put the helm hard a-starboard—that was an order given to get out of the way of the boat, and, as usual, to get into the pier.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then it so happened that at the time you wanted to get out of the way of the boat, you wanted to get in to the pier? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, that is the usual course when we are going to the Upper Tunnel-pier—we go in towards the Lower Tunnel-pier, and put the helm hard a-starboard, and shoot in alongside the Upper Tunnel-pier—after the order was given, I blocked the helm hard a-starboard, and ran to the starboard quarter—I threw a stern rope to the assistance of the persons that were overboard, and I lent a gentleman a hand to get a stool to <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> overboard, to restore the people's lives.</p>

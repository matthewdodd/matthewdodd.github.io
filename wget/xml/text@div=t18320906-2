I was alarmed about one o'clock by the Policeman's rattle springing - I went down, and found the prisoner in the hands of the Policeman, with five pairs of shoes and boots, which were my property: the shop door was open - the lock was not broken at all; I saw three pairs of shoes and two pairs of boots in the Policeman's hands - they are nine; I am certain I left them in the shop that night - I examined, and missed a considerable deal more boots and shoes.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the morning of the 2nd of August I was nearly opposite the shop, when Edwards called Police! I immediately ran across, and found the prisoner struggling with him - he gave him into my charge; I saw a man running up the street, and on looking on the pavement I saw the property laying there at the time I took him into custody; I took the shoes and boots off the pavement, which I produce - I searched the prisoner immediately, and found nothing on him but a bit of sealing-wax; I saw nobody come out of the shop - the struggle was the first I saw.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live at Pimlico, I keep a private house. The 20th of April, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I lost a gold watch chain and trinkets, taken from my side, coming out of <placeName id="t17940604-5-crimeloc20">Kensington Gardens</placeName>

               <p>Q. How soon did you discover the loss? - I put my hand behind me to take up part of my dress, and in bringing my hand round again, my arm entangled her's. I turned my head round and see<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179406040010"></xptr>that she had got my watch in her hand, and I took hold of it out of her hand immediately. I told my friend that was with me, and he immediately laid hold of her and charged a constable with her. I have got the watch now, I am certain it is my watch and my trinkets.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming out of Kensington Garden Gate, and a hole in the lining of my cloak caught the watch. I never was in Kensington Gardens before.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Had you seen her in the Gardens at all? - I had not.</p>
               <p>

            Was you outside or inside when the watch was taken from you? - Inside.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a great crowd? - There was a crowd.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw it first was it fastened to her cloak, or was it in her hand? - I conceive it impossible it could catch any how at all; there could be no force or I must have felt it; there was a pin very near it, and it was a very clear muslin, and it must have torn it if there had been any force.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe a little how she conducted herself when you saw the watch in her hand? - I turned my head about and saw the watch in her hand; and she said, I beg your pardon; that she said before I said any thing to her.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know whether she was endeavouring to put her hands away? - She had the watch in her hand, the watch hanging up as near as I can tell.</p>
               <p>- CRANNAGE sworn.</p>
               <p>In attempting to get through Kensington Garden Gate, on Sunday, the 20th of April, there was a very great crowd, and this lady had hold of my arm, and she told me that the women had taken her watch. I asked her which woman? She pointed to the prisoner at the bar; I said are you sure that is the woman? she said, I am, in consequence of that I took hold of her, and put the prisoner in the Park Keeper's possession. I did not see anything of the transaction of the watch being taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the watch when you took the prisoner? - In possession of the prosecutrix; she had got the watch again then.</p>
               <p>JONES sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the constable of Hyde Park, I attend the door every Sunday; a person cried out that a person had robbed a lady of a watch, and this here gentleman here delivered the woman to me, and I brought her to Mount-street, to the watch-house, and from there to Bond-street, the next day, this was Sunday afternoon, about three or four o'clock.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave her a good character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I keep a green-grocer's shop, I never was in Kensington-gardens before that day in my life; I have always lived with honesty and industry for this six and thirty years; the watch catched hold of my cloak.</p>
               <p>Court to Crannage. Did the prisoner when you took hold of her, say that it had catched hold of her cloak? - When I laid hold of her she said, do I look like a pickpocket? says I, is there any body here that knows you? she said no.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. Did the prisoner at that time say that the watch had catched hold of her cloak? - No.</p>

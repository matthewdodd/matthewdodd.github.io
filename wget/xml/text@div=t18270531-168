            . I am the wife of John Samuel Carrew, (who is at sea,) and live at Mrs. Chamberlain's. I knew the prisoner on board a ship - my property was at <placeName id="t18270531-168-crimeloc884">Ratcliff-square, Stepney</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18270531-168-crimeloc884" type="placeName" value="Ratcliff-square, Stepney"></interp>

When the ship was going to sea, she asked if I had any commands to London. I gave her some letters, money, and my ticket. I came home with Mrs. Chamberlain, from Rio Janeiro, in September, and missed the property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When did your husband go to sea? A. Two years ago. I have not seen or heard of him since. I did not tell her to take charge of my furniture to prevent expence. I saw her in September, selling oysters in the street, and went home with her; but did not see my things there; she said they had been taken away by a neighbour. I have received a box and 25s.; I did not drink tea with her afterwards - I did not go before the Justice till April - I tried several times before that to get money from her. I have not said if she could raise 5l. I would not appear.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know your property was gone when you got 25s.? A. Yes.</p>

            . I was left in care of this property - the prisoner came with a letter about the 4th of July, saying she was authorized to take the goods away and pay the rent - she paid the landlord part of the money, and in consequence of the letter I gave her the key.</p>
               <p>MRS. CARREW. I cannot write - I employed a person on board the ship to write for me.</p>

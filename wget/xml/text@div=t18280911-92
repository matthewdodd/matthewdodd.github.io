On the 13th of September, between twelve and one o'clock, I was coming out of the kitchen: the drawing-room and parlour are on the ground floor, and the hall between them - the kitchen is also on that floor; I saw the prisoner within two feet of the drawing-room door, with the cruet-stand and a wicker-basket of plate in his hand - I could see the cruet-stand: I said nothing to him, but screamed out three times, and cried Stop thief! my fellow-servant ran to my assistance, and saw him go out of the drawing-room window, (where he must have entered, for there was a chair moved;) the instant he saw me, he sat the stand and basket down, held his fist up at me, and said "Hush" I kept screaming; he jumped out, leaving the property in the drawing-room: I had seen the cruet-stand safe two minutes before, in the dining-room, on the sideboard: the basket contained six table, nineteen dessert, nine tea, and two salt spoons - I had put them on the sideboard, in the dining-room, a quarter of an hour before, with the intention to clean them - I never lost sight of him till he was caught; Reed and the servant of a gentleman, who was on a visit at the house, assisted me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. You had never seen him before? A. No; he came in disguise, with a basket of walnuts; I had been in the dining-room two minutes before, and left that window open - when I saw him in the hall, I was a good deal agitated - he ran away when I screamed; he turned a corner after he got out at the gate - I was after him, close behind him.</p>

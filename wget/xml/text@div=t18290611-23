            . I am a harness-maker, and live at No. 15, Willow-walk. Kerman came on the 3d of May, and asked me to buy some second-hand harness; I had never seen him before - he took me with him to Sandy's-row, Widegate-alley; as we went along, he said "This harness is on the cross;" I suppose he meant that it was stolen; I said, "Never mind that, as I travel the country, it won't matter;" I saw some harness, part of which belonged to the prosecutor - he wanted 5l. for it; I agreed to give him 3l.; he asked me when it would suit me to fetch it; I said in the course of a couple of hours, as I was going to Smithfield - he said, "As I have nothing to do, I will go with you," and that I had better bring some bags for it; I said No, I would bring my horse and cart - he went to Smithfield with me; I could not get rid of him; at last I said the person I expected to see was not there; he then left me, and came to me again two or three times, and said if I had not got all the money, I could leave part of it - Mr. Wall afterwards came and asked me if I had a harness to sell; I said I knew of one; I at length got this harness from Goodear's house, in Dorset-street - the person down stairs said he lodged there; Kerman had shown it me twice; I am sure this is the harness which he offered to sell me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Did not you go to the prisoner's house, and ask him if he had any harness to sell? A. No; I was never charged with any thing - I deal in all sorts of harness, and sometimes in horses - I do not keep a marine store shop; I am a general dealer - when Kerman said it was on the cross, I said, "Never mind," in order to find the property: I do not know a person named Godwin nor Watson - I did not go with Kerman to Godwin or Watson; the first lot of harness was at Sandy's-row, where Kerman lived; the other was at Dorset-street, where they said Dick Goodear lived, but I did not see him there.</p>

            . I am a constable. I received the harness at the watch-house; I took the prisoners at No. 19, Montague-street; I said it was on suspicion of stealing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110015"></xptr>some harness; Kerman sat on the foot of the bed for some minutes without speaking; at last he said he supposed he must go with me - I found nothing on him.</p>
               <p>NATHAN NEGUS. This is my harness. The key of the stable had been left at the next house, because I was not up soon enough - the person who had the care of it is gone into the country; at twenty minutes past six o'clock he came running home to me, and said the stable was robbed- I have seen him since; I accused him of stealing the harness, because the officer examined the stable, and found nothing disturbed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Have you made inquiries about Goodear? A. Yes; he hears a good character.</p>

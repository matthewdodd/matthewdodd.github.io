                  </hi> I am a shoemaker. On the 22nd of Sept., between two and three in the afternoon, I went to the Three Crowns public-house, in</p>

               <p>the Hackney-road—I saw five men there standing at the bar drinking, the prisoner was one of them—I had had two pints of fourpenny ale, but was not tipsy, or I should not have been capable of going to the hospital by myself—the prisoner was in the public-house, when I went in, with a box of tools standing against a little barrow, where he sits to sharpen saws—I pro<lb></lb>miscuously happened to kick it over—the prisoner asked me to pick the tools up—I refused—he began to pick them up himself—he had picked up some of them, and he had one in his hand, with which he turned round and <hi rend="italic">jobbed</hi> it into the corner of my eye—I put up my hand, and the tool was drawn through my fingers—he hit me on the top of the nose, and I fell directly on the stones with my hand to my eye—he called me an old b—at the time, and said, "Take that, and that will stick by you; you will never have to come again"—I felt it go into my eye—I feel it now, and get no rest at night—I am in the hospital now—there was a great deal of blood flowed—my eye is totally destroyed, it is in complete darkness; I shall be a ruined man the rest of my life—he went away, and I went to wash my eye.</p>

                  </hi> I live with my father, who keeps the Three Crowns, in the Hackney-road—the prisoner and prosecutor were there on the 22nd of Sept.—the prosecutor was quite drunk—he was there first, drinking beer—the prisoner came in—they were quarrelling for a short time—Jennings was going to throw the beer in the prisoner's face, and was prevented by a man that stood by; on that there was a quarrel, and Jennings knocked the prisoner's tools over; he did it on purpose—they were files and different things in a box—I saw the prisoner immediately after just raise his arm—I did not see him stoop at all, or alter his position—the blow was struck im<lb></lb>mediately on the box being turned over—Jennings fell, and when he got up his eye was all smashed in—he went into the yard and washed his face—there was blood on the counter—blood and water came out of his eye.</p>

                  </hi> I am a surgeon at the London Hospital—the prose<lb></lb>cutor was brought there on the 22nd of Sept., bleeding from a wound in the left eye-ball—it was a punctured wound, nearly three-quarters of an inch in length, about one-quarter of an inch in depth, and penetrated to the inner cham<lb></lb>ber</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> Nearly every one of the tools were picked up after the <hi rend="italic">scrimmage</hi> was over, and all laid in the box on the floor at the time; I have witnesses to prove that I neither stooped or touched anything, but the pro<lb></lb>secutor fell on the iron edge of a cask, and that caused the wound.</p>

            ?</p>
               <p>Bailey. Yes, but not 'till the smugglers called him by his name; there were several smugglers there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at Horsey on the 10th, 11th , or 12th of March?</p>
               <p>Bailey. I went into the town on the 10th of March, and saw

             on the 10th of March, and I had been at my friend's house; but a little before the house was broke open and I fled to the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. What had Holt in his hand?</p>
               <p>Bailey. He had fire-arms in his hand; I am unacquainted with the names of fire-arms, but he had a piece in his hand about the length of this stick, and I did expect he would shoot me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they come for besides?</p>
               <p>Bailey . They came to run goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this on the 10th of March, or the day after ?</p>
               <p>Bailey. The day after; I was got into the bar, and they could not find me at first, for they thought I was come as a spy, and cut my face in a terrible manner, and beat me with a leather belt; I went to bed, and after I was in bed they came to the door and knock'd for me, and the landlord said he is in bed, and he will be quiet if you will let him be quiet: the only man that I can swear assaulted me was Holt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they take you away?</p>
               <p>Bailey. Yes, and I said to the farmer as Shakespear said, I am going I don't know where I am going, or how I am going; I said I believed they had a design to take away my life, and I said don't put me to this terror; if you intend to do it, do it at once; and one of them asked me if I had a handkerchief, and I said I had . About one o'clock on the 11th of March in the afternoon there was a cutter came in, and they had spyingglasses . Said I, you are a parcel of blind Sons of whores, for there is your cutter; and Holt said, where are my arms?</p>
               <p>Q. How many had arms?</p>
               <p>Bailey. There were 45, and I saw Holt and the rest of the company armed.</p>
               <p>Q. How many had arms?</p>
               <p>Bailey . I am sure most of them had arms.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any boat come on shore?</p>
               <p>Bailey. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What goods were in it?</p>
               <p>Bailey . Tea and Brandy, as I took it to be.</p>

               <p>Bailey. Sometimes they called him Holt, and sometimes James Holt, here's to you.</p>
               <p>Q. I desire to know why his name may not be John Brown?</p>
               <p>Bailey. You know best, because you are a Counsellor at law. I know that Holt was parish-clerk at Benacre in the county of Suffolk.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to follow them down to the beach?</p>
               <p>Bailey. Because they had used me very ill, and I was willing to make the most of them; for they took me along with them in order to hold their horses.</p>
               <p>Court . You say they call'd him James Holt; did he answer to that name?</p>
               <p>Bailey. Yes .</p>

               <p>Bailey. Nine miles .</p>

               <p>Bailey. He was walking in the market, and some-body said, there is the parish-clerk of Benacre .</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Holt say they were going for tea and brandy?</p>

               <p>Brandson. I did not see any; and he said, if I took Holt, I should keep his family; and I said, those that brought him to destruction, should keep them: and there was a man came there with firearms , who was a rider to Fox.</p>
               <p>Q. What, a smuggler's rider?</p>
               <p>Brandson . 'Tis a title they give themselves to ride for to sell goods.

               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Brandson . About 11 at night; and the smugglers came up to the house about 11 o'clock at night .</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there of them?</p>
               <p>Brandson. About twelve; they spoke to Holt, but I did not hear him speak to them.</p>

               <p>Brandson. I intended to go to the back-side of the house to get fire-arms, that I might be a match for them, for I would have parted with my life rather than have parted with Holt. They fired into the house afterwards, and they killed two horses.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the man that keeps the house?</p>
               <p>Brandson. He is a carpenter. They got a crowiron, and knock'd the horses on the head. One died directly, and the other died the next day.</p>

               <p>Leader . I never saw him in my life before?</p>
               <p>Pris. Co. to Carr. How long have you known Leader.</p>
               <p>Carr. About twelve days last Tuesday evening I had occasion to go to the other end of the town, and went to the White Hart in Rosemery-lane , and I had eighteen-penny worth of punch: Leader came in and sat at the other end of the table; and I said, My lad will you drink a glass of punch; and I ask'd his partner that was with him; I was going away, and went to pay for the punch, and he said I should not go 'till he had his in.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Carr. I belong to a private ship of war: I was a lieutenant of marines; and another man came in and they began to be very merry; and he said he hoped he should have a good dinner on Thursday or Friday; I ask'd him whether he belonged to the Sea, he said no; and he said he had got four men in Newgate, and he was to swear their lives away: I ask'd him whether he knew them, he said he knew some of them, and some he did not know , he said he had been shown them twice, and he should be shown them twice more; and I said, if you know the men you do well to do this, for the service of your king and country; and he said afterwards in farther conversation, that he did not do it for the good of his king and country, but only for the sake of a reward.</p>
               <p>Q. What regiment did you belong to?</p>
               <p>Carr. I was an adjutant in General

               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Carr . I live next door to the Blackmoor's Head in Clare-market.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you the names of those persons that he was to swear against?</p>
               <p>Carr. He said there was one Fox, one Jefferys, and one Salmon.</p>
               <p>Co. for the Crown. Do you know Mr. Kelly?</p>
               <p>Carr. Yes, I have known him these two years.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see Leader last?</p>
               <p>Carr. The day before yesterday.</p>
               <p>Q. When was you last in company with Mr. Carr. I believe I have neither eat nor drank with him within a week or a month, and I don't know that I have been in company with him these three months.</p>
               <p>[There was a person said he knew him a great while in the Guards.]</p>
               <p>Q. Are you an Englishman!</p>
               <p>Carr. No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you, an Irishman ?</p>
               <p>Carr. Yes.</p>
               <p>Co. for the Cro. Was not you surpriz'd at a man giving you such an account as this, and at the first time of his acquaintance too?</p>
               <p>Carr. Yes I was, and he said he was to have 800 l. and he said he would give some of the money to his father, and buy an estate with the rest; and he said he had 50 l. owing to him now by the government; he said he had seen Fox, and he was a little man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Noake . Last Thursday night I happened to be at the White Hart in Rosemary-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you born?</p>
               <p>Noake. I was born in London.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were there?</p>
               <p>Noake. One Fox, one Griffith and one Solomon, and I think Mr. Carr was there, and Leader said he was to have six or eight hundred pounds, but I cannot tell which, and he said he was to swear against some people; that he had been shown them twice, and that he should be shown them twice more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see Leader before?</p>
               <p>Noake . I have seen him before there, for I used to pass away a little time with a shipmate of mine in playing at skittles, and he forced his discourse to me and ask'd me what I was; and I said I was a barber and perriwigmaker, but I had belonged to the sea; and he ask'd me whether I would undertake a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it that he wanted you to undertake?</p>
               <p>Noake. He said it was to swear against some persons; I said I would not do it; and he said you fool 'tis no harm at all; I have some people in Newgate only swear for me, and I will give you five guineas in hand, and a promissory bond for 20 l. more.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he to give you the 20 l. for?</p>
               <p>Noake. For swearing against these people if they were convicted, and he would have sent me to Newgate to see them in order to convict them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Carr before this?</p>
               <p>Noake. I never saw him in my life before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Mr. Carr of it?</p>
               <p>Noake. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Mr. Carr say?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174809070037"></xptr>Noake. He said, this ought not to be concealed for the world; for it was a piece of justice to discover it.</p>
               <p>Co. for. Cro. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Noake. In Litchfield-street Soho; I am a journeyman barber.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your master's name?</p>
               <p>Noake. Rogers.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you think this was a bad thing, to persuade you to take a false oath?</p>
               <p>Noake. Yes, to be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you take him up?</p>
               <p>Noake. Because I did not know so much then.</p>

               <p>Ranwick . We put it into writing. He said he would confess who were there, and hop'd he should be an evidence for the king.

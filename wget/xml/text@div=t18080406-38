            . At the close of the evening, on the 32nd of February, I left my house on business. I returned home after the clock had struck seven.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray how was it as to light when you went out. - A. I had lit up two or three candles in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there light enough of the day to see without them candles. - A. There was. I returned after seven, I discovered my window broken, and property stole out; I left my wife in the shop at the time I went out; on my return I understood that she had left the shop about ten minutes; then I missed all the articles mentioned in the indictment; they were all in the same place, I had seen them all before I went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Where the window was broken, was there access so as to put an arm in so as that they might be got away. - A. Yes, perfectly so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this a house in which you and your family sleep. - A. Yes, I occupy it and sleep there.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw these things afterwards. - A. Yes, part of them - a pearl broach and two paste broaches were brought to me, and were produced at the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you recognise them as part of the property that was taken away. - A. Yes, they were, and there were two or three cornelian broaches, which were produced by the pawnbrokers at the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Andrews. What parish is your house in. -

               <p>It is laid in the indictment in the parish of St. Giles in the Fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any of these things afterwards besides what was produced at the office. - 
               <persName id="t18080406-38-person389">A. </persName>
            Not any one.</p>
               <p>MRS. POWELL. When my husband was out my little boy was coughing, I returned into the back room about a quarter of an hour; after I went out of the shop my husband returned in and said the window was cut and the property was stolen; I went out of doors, and perceived twelve chains hanging half out of the window; I went into the shop, took a candle, and went down into the cellar; I looked into the area and found two cornelian broaches. About ten o'clock the same night Mr. Powell found some things in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the goods afterwards when they were brought by the pawnbroker's man. - A. Yes; some part of them. I recognised them to be part of the goods that were taken away from the shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Andrews. What were the goods that your husband found in the street. - A. paste star, a pearl earring, fellow to the one that has been since found at the pawnbrokers.</p>

            . I am one of the officers at Bow street. I apprehended the two prisoners at their house in Puckeridge street, St. Giles's; when I went into the house they were sitting in the front parlour, with several other people; I told Mrs. Lawrence that I wished to speak to her; Mrs. Dolphin got up, and said will you go into the next room; Bland the pawnbroker was with me; I went into the room with the two prisoners. Bland remained in the parlour; I told Mrs. 
               <persName id="t18080406-38-person394">Lawrence</persName>
             that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180804060029"></xptr>I must search her; she said very well; I was going to put my hands into her pockets, she said I will take out what I have got in my pockets; she took several things out, and one broach, among the rest. I produce the broach.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Powell. Is that your broach. - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Adkins. I then asked the prisoner Lawrence what she had done with the duplicate of a pearl sprig she had pawned, she said she had destroyed it. I asked her how she came by the pearl sprig, she was going to answer, but Mrs. Dolphin stopped her and said I will tell you how she came by it. I said I have nothing to do with you; I only asked Mrs. Lawrence. Mrs. Dolphin would not let Mrs. Lawrence speak but would answer herself; then I said I will hear what you have got to say; she said she and her daughter were walking in Oxford street on Monday evening the 22d of February, between six and seven o'clock, and her daughter picked up the sprig. I asked her if she had picked up any thing else with it, she said she did not, that was the sprig she had pawned with Bland; he has not shewn it. I took notice of the broach at that time, she laid it on the drawers near to where she was standing, after that I said Mrs. Lawrence, I shall wish you to give an account how you came by the sprig; she said what her mother had told me was true; that she had picked it up in Oxford street; I then desired her to recollect herself, because what she told me then I should tell in another place. I then called in the pawnbroker Bland, that he should hear what they had to say; he came in, when they repeated what they had said again; they both said they found the sprig, and that only in Oxford street; when the pawnbroker came in, she said I beg your pardon there was the earring that I sold to you this morning, I found that with it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Bland. Was any earring sold to you. - A. Yes, that was on the 24th when the sprig was pledged.</p>
               <p>Adkins. I took up the broach that she took out of her pocket from the drawer; I asked her if that belonged to her, she said it did. I said I should put it in my pocket and take it for the present; she then said I forgot to mention that I found that with the sprig; I then asked them both many times if they found any thing else besides the earring, the sprig, and the broach that I had; they both said they did not; I knew Lawrence had pledged other articles. I searched the place and took them to the office.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Dolphin left her defence to her counsel.</p>
               <p>Lawrence's Defence. These things which I pledged I received from my mother.</p>
               <p>The prisoners called seven witnesses, who gave them a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cook to Mr. Davis—on 17th February, about 2.30, I saw the prisoner in the area, trying to lift the pantry window with both hands—the area gate was locked—I called the butler, who came and took hold of him—I asked him what he wanted, and he asked if we had any old bottles—while the butler was fighting with him I fetched a police<lb></lb>man, and he was given in charge—when I came back, the butler was in great confusion—his whiskers were pulled out, and he seemed in much pain.</p>

I was called, and saw the prisoner struggling with the butler—I seized him by the collar—he was charged with being in the area for an unlawful purpose, and attempting to open the window—I held him while the butler fetched the key to open the area gate, which was locked—the prisoner said "Allow me to speak to the lady of the house"—I said "I shall not allow you to do anything of the kind"—I asked him what brought him there—he said "It is nothing; I am only on a little business"—he made a desperate struggle going to the station, and exclaimed "You b—, you shall not take mo"—he struck me in the mouth, threw me, and kicked me—another policeman came to my assistance—I found this hooked wire in his pocket, which is very useful to reach any<lb></lb>thing further off than his arm would reach—he said "All right old <hi rend="italic">pal,</hi> it</p>

Baring Brothers for 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., dated 12th May and numbered 2,973—he first asked me if there was any one spoke English and I said I did—he first asked for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon the letter of credit, and I gave it to him through a cashier—the letter of credit was in the name of Matthews—there was a previous payment on it on the 19th May of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by Brugmann</p>

               <p>and Son, of Brussels—these four bills were prepared by a clerk in the office before the money was paid—I asked the prisoner to sign them, which he did in my presence—after he had signed them I sent him to the cashier and he paid him the money over—the payment of the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was endorsed on the letter of credit and it was given back to him—this is one of the four bills. (<hi rend="italic">Bead</hi>: "Stutgard, June 19, 1874, for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. sterling at three days' sight, pay this first of exchange to the order of the Royal Bank of Wurtemburg, the amount of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. sterling value received, and pass advice of as per letter of credit of 12th May, No. 2,973, Messrs. Baring Brothers and Co., 'R. F. Matthews'"—the bills are endorsed by myself or some gentleman who has the right to sign them—two of the bills were forwarded to one of our correspondents and two were kept back—they would have been circulated, but we were advised by the police that a forgery had been committed—I came to this country three weeks ago, and on the following Monday, two days after I arrived, I went to the prison here—I was shown into some place were there were about a dozen people walking—I looked at them and after a time I said to the gentleman who was there "I know now that man"—I recognised the prisoner—he was changed in his appearance—he was shaved and his face was not so red as it was in Stutgard—he had a little moustache when he came to the Bank—that was shaved off—I have no doubt about his being the man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The interview of 19th June took place in the principal office of the Bank—there were two other managers there besides myself and three or four clerks—one gentleman passed through while the man was there—he was a person living at Stutgard—some clerk filled up the bills—they are regular printed forms in French—another clerk paid him the money—I gave the pen to the man to sign the bills and I saw him write the name of "Matthews" four times—I am accustomed to see signatures—I watched him closely during, the time he was writing and he wrote easily—he received back the letter of credit as soon as he had signed the bills—I can't tell you who endorsed them, sometimes that is done by the principal and sometimes by the clerks—there were three or four of us engaged in the matter—when I went to Newgate I saw the criminals in the yard walking one behind the other—I think there were about a dozen; I did not count them—I think they went round more than four of five times—the Governor said to me "Have you done?"—they had been round more than four times before he spoke to me—they walked round several times more and I said "Now I have done, this is the man"—the man who had written in my presence had a beard and a moustache—the signature was written with a steel pen if I remember, but I really don't know exactly; we very seldom use quill pens.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an expert in handwriting—I saw the prisoner write yesterday in the presence of the Governor of Newgate, and from having seen him write, and from my experience, I am convinced that these papers are in his writing—I went yesterday to Mr. Mullen's office and saw these five bills of exchange, and my attention was drawn to the signatures "R. F. Matthews"—all the five bills are undoubtly written by the same hand—there is no apparent disguise in the signature—it certainly would not be possible in these papers of instructions to Mr. Chapman, for a person to continue writing a disguised hand in that quantity of writing—I am quite sure it is a natural handwriting throughout—the signatures "R. F. Matthews" are certainly not written by the prisoner in my belief—I have looked at these signatures with the greatest caution, anticipating that the prisoner might invent for himself a signature for the purpose of committing a fraud—I knew that he was charged with the forgery, and I looked very zealously indeed to see whether it was possible for him to create a signature different from his natural handwriting—I have seen him write to-day with a steel pen, the signature "R. F. Matthews," and as a matter of caution I requested him to write it several times—I think when he wrote in the presence of the governor he wrote with a quill pen—I will state why I believe the man never wrote "R. F. Matthews" on the bill—in the first place the formation of the letters are unlike the formation of the letters in the bills; the capital letters I am speaking of—I will take the letter "R" in all the bills—the first down stroke of the "R" is considerably above the top of it—the prisoner makes the "R" after the same model, but he never does that—he makes the "R" in two ways, but when he makes it like the "R" in the bills the down stroke is not beyond the body of the letter in any instance—the "R" in "Respectable" is an instance of what I am saying; perhaps there the down stroke is a little above the level of the bow, but as a rule it is below—in the signatures he has made in the dock to-day he has made a different kind of "R," but he makes that "R" in these papers; but when he makes the "R" after the same model as that in the bills there is the difference which I have pointed out—the next is</p>

               <p>the letter "F"—the general character of that letter is totally at variance with the prisoner's "F"—there are two instances in his papers in the words "Friday," and "Foolscap"—I will take the one which is most like the "F" in the bills; in the word "Turner" The "T" and "F" are made in the same way—the "T" in Turner is not looped at the top—all the" F's" in these bills are well looped at the top, all in one way—there is no capital "F" in the prisoner's writing which resembles that in the signatures—he crosses the letter "F" merely with a straight dash and there is a peculiar cross to the "F" in the bills—now the letter "M"—the prisoner habitually makes an enlargement of a small "M" for his capital "M"so that the ordinary capital "M "is a stranger in his writing, and it is a letter that he might select for the purpose of forgery, but it does not at all correspond, it has not the emphasis—if you look at the letters "M" in the bills there is a pressure on the pen in the last down stroke—there is a letter "M" made after the same model as the forgery in sheet B line 16 in the word "Mansion," but it is different from the "M" in the bills—one is the "M "of a superior writer; there is emphasis in one case and none in the other—if you look at all the "M's"There is the same characteristic, a different feeling and touch to my mind altogether—in all the signatures to the bills you will find the letter "h" is considerably taller than the letter "t," besides which it is looped—the loop might be for the purpose of disguise, because it would be easy if a man makes a straight letter "h"To make a loop, so I don't pay much attention to the loop, but I go to the fact that it is much taller—the prisoner habitually makes the letter "t" quite as tall if not taller than the letter "h"—further than that he has got a peculiar way of crossing the "t" such an instance in the bills would have been fatal to me, but the "t" in "Matthews" is not crossed at all, and he could hardly have failed to have put a cross in one instance out of five—now in four out of the five bills in the letter "w"The shoulder of the "w" is written with" such emphasis that it makes it really a letter "m," it looks like a third down stroke—there is no "w" like that in the prisoner's writing—I have not found one that" will bear the slightest comparison with these—the final letter "s" in Matthews is very distinct, in all the bills except one, it comes below the line—in one signature it is a small "s"—you can't find such a letter in the prisoner's writing—it is the characteristic of the writer of the signature to make the "s" below the line—independently of all these matters of detail the general character of the signatures is far superior to the prisoner's handwriting, and it is my opinion that he could not write it with any degree of practice, and it is to be considered that they were written before some other person, not in his own house in secret—I think in the presence of twenty witnesses, I should Bay he did not write it—the signatures I have seen him write are not like his ordinary handwriting.</p>

               <p>written for the attorney—if I had not had something satisfactory I would not have given evidence—in nineteen passes out of twenty it would have been more satisfactory, and if I had been limited to quantity, but certainly not with such a quantity as this—I generally ask to see handwriting written before the charge or prior to an action—in this case I know all the writing is since the charge—the prisoner makes three different kinds of" R's"—there is one kind in "Royal Bank "and you find another kind directly afterwards—the "R" in ". Respectable "is different from the one in "Royal"—he varies his "R's"—the "R" in "Royal "is the same kind of "R as that on the bills—the only difference is the down stroke is taller, that is the distinguishing point, it is the same character of letter, but a different touch—there is the same kind of "R" in the words "Robbery" and "Remainder" and "Reward"—he makes the letter "M" in two different ways—he generally makes an enlargement of the small "m" for the capital, but when he departs from that he makes it like the "M" in "Matthews"—a skilled forger might disguise his hand in different ways, but in certain ways he could not disguise it—he could not write in a better style than he was capable of doing—a man might practice a signature for the purposes of disguise in order that it should not be like his writing and go abroad and write it time after time; he might be able to, but I don't believe it—hundreds of writers could not do it to save their lives—I doubt that a man could acquire that skill—I first saw the signatures to the bills yesterday at 12.30—I had studied the prisoner's writing before that, and I have studied it to-day in Court with the greatest attention and care, and with a complete determination not to give evidence unless I felt very sure—I find that one part of the prisoner's writing is a great deal better than another, as it would be; that is the advantage of it—the style varies.</p>

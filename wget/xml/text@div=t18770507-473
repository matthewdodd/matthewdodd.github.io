                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Thames Policeman</hi>, 9). On Saturday evening April 7th I was on duty in a galley at Lower Horaley Down Pier—from information I received I went on board the barge Thorn, between 8 and 9 o'clock, to search the craft—it was about 400 or 500 yards from Butler's Wharf and was laden with bricks—I saw a case on the gunwalle, it was damaged—I sent No. 52 on shore to make enquiries while I remained to watch and got back into my boat—I then heard a noise like the shaking of straw had I saw two men, of whom the prisoner was one,. on the barge—one man got in a boat and went away—I went on board and apprehended the pri<lb></lb>soners who was throwing the case over—I saw him do it—he asked me what I apprehended him for—I told him for stealing a case of cinnamon—I searched and found the cinnamon in two sacks; I also found these fragments of the case (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which I took into our galley with the prisoner—he threw the fragments into the water on the way to the station—I subsequently recovered them—the cinnamon weighs about 10 lbs.</p>

               <p>went on the barge Thorn, about 8 o'clock—I have heard Read's evidence; it is correct—I went on shore to make inquiries—the marks on the cinnamon cases were "N/8, Best Tawoo, Cassia line a, Season 1876—1877, Ketchong"—I took that down the following morning—it corresponds with the marks on the case found on the barge Thorn.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to William Horner and James Perkins, lighterman, of 13, Water Lane and Butler's Wharf, near Horsley Down—on Saturday, 7th April, I had a barge called Cambridge, laden with cinnamon—the pieces of wood produced, are parts of one of the cases—I examined and compared them with the cases on Sunday morning, the 8th, about 8.30—one case was missing—the value would be 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

I live at 15, Hanley Terrace, and am a watchman—I loaded this barge on 7th April, partly from a vessel and partly from the quay at the West Indian Import Dock—there were 689 cases—the loading was finished about 4 o'clock in the afternoon—that was the last I saw of the barge.</p>

               <p>I was the last up on the night of the 18th; I am servant to Captain Hindman, I went to bed about ten, I left the house fast and secure, I am very particular every night in fastening every one of the doors; I fastened every one of the doors, and all the windows; I am very certain sure that they were every one of them fast, the doors and windows, for I fastened them myself; and a little before four I was alarmed on Saturday last; we were alarmed by the cry of murder and thieves; I alarmed my master, and after seeing him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230016"></xptr>come out of his chamber (for I did not know but he was murdered); I then understood by him that the house was broke open; after I had called him, and given him to understand what was the matter, we then with all possible haste went down stairs; we went down together, and going into the back kitchen, we found every thing in very great confusion; we found the store-room broke open, and likewise the outer door of this back kitchen; the outer door led into the garden; I am positively sure that door was both barred and double bolted the night before; we did not stop there, but went immediately into the coach-yard, and the first thing I saw there was this lock, all shattered to pieces; then coming into the coach-yard, I fixed my eyes on Gould, a coachman in the neighbourhood, having fast hold of Ellicott the prisoner by the collar; he was struggling with all his might to get away; by this time other assistance came, and he was secured; we found there were five doors broke open; I fastened four of these doors, and the store-room door I did not fasten, because that is kept fast, unless any body has occasion to go there; my master kept they key of that, I found every thing in great confusion, there was the great washing copper brought into the coach-yard, and lay in the middle of the yard.</p>
               <p>Was that washing copper set? - Yes, it was taken down, and all the bricks taken off, as if there had been a bricklayer at work; it was fast in the bricks the night before.</p>
               <p>Court. Must that not have taken up a considerable while doing? - I should imagine it must; and all the lead belonging to this great washing copper was laying by the side of the copper in the coach-yard; two baskets of china plates were in the coach-yard; a pail full of bottles of wine, and a little copper saucepan, and several other things laying in the yard.</p>
               <p>Had you seen these within the house before you went to bed that night? - The copper coal-skuttle I left myself in the back kitchen over night, and it was found in the coach-yard; the china was in the store-room over night, I only at that time saw Gould have fast hold of Ellicott by the collar, I know nothing of Toomes.</p>
               <p>Captain Hindman. I was alarmed a little after three by a prodigious noise and confusion; I immediately flew to my pistols, I laid one on the table, the other I held in my hand; I expected from the noise the door would be broke open, but it not being so, I then opened my chamber-door, my man was near the door and speaking, I do not recollect what he said; I ventured across the passage with the pistol in my hand, I threw up the passage window that looks into the coach-yard, and there I saw this witness Green, with the prisoner Ellicott by the collar; my man called out, my house was broke open and robbed; I returned to my chamber, put on my breeches, and ran down stairs, as I was; took my great coat out of the hall, went below through the servant's hall into the back kitchen; and there I saw a compleat heap of ruins; it was nothing else, I did not stop a moment there; I went through into the coach-yard, and I went immediately to Green; another man or two came in from the alarm; I saw Ellicott very well safe and secured, he told me the other man had made his escape by biting the hand of Gould the coachman; but there were people in pursuit of him, and he would be speedily taken; and while he was talking, he said, there he is Sir, he is taken, they have got him on the side of the green; I then became sensible that I was without stockings or a waistcoat, or any thing round my neck, and was very cold; I went and dressed me, and came down; the first thing I saw on the kitchen table, nearly where the copper had been fixed, was this iron crow; there were great marks of violence on the door where they had broke it open; they had forced all the staples by which the bolts were secured; from thence I went into the coach-yard, and there I saw the copper that had been set with brick-work, and the lead that covered the copper by it, and two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230017"></xptr>baskets of china plates, one containing thirty plates, and the other twenty-nine, and several other things that I did not particularize, which I do not recollect immediately; on the whole, had any indifferent person been passing by, he would have said, Sir, I suppose you are moving; we suppose we lost six or seven dozen of plates, taken away entirely.</p>
               <p>Were those ever recovered again? - No.</p>
               <p>What quantity of wine did you lose? - I really cannot say, there was a great deal in my binn, and there is hardly any thing of wine left in the binn, the binn was open; I should not have thought of the wine, had I not seen the pail in the yard with some bottles in it; from the work they had done, and what they must have carried away, I am almost sure they could not have been in the house less than two or three hours; it is incredible, and exceeds all belief, such a rapacity there had been used.</p>
               <p>What hour was it in the morning when you first got up? - I suppose when I was first alarmed it wanted twenty minutes to four; I went immediately to the watch-house, to see that they were properly secured, that the people might not leave them; Toomes was also taken to the watch-house; there we searched them, and on the prisoner Ellicott was found a tinder-box with tinder in it, and a flint and steel, and a bundle of matches; and on the prisoner Toomes was a pocket full of grocer's currants; they had been in the store-room: I then went to the magistrate and attended their examination; before I went into the yard I was walking through, and I picked up the neck of a shirt, and handkerchief; I put them in my pocket; and on their examination I produced the neck of this shirt, and begged the magistrate to examine the two prisoners, to see if either of them had lost the neck of their shirt; a man now in court, one of Mr. Wilmot's men, examined Toomes immediately, and discovered the neck of his shirt off; and on comparing it, it exactly fitted; I saw it fitted; the prisoner Toomes evidently wanted the neck of his shirt, the handkerchief was not claimed; I saw several other things that were found in a ditch, which I swore to, and are my property. (The coat skuttle produced) I know it, it has no particular mark, but from seeing it for years; that kettle, and saucepan and two large pieces of soap, I cannot swear to soap; but the bag the soap was carried away in, I swear positively to.</p>
               <p>(The prisoners here desired the witnesses might be examined separate.)</p>

               <p>I am a weaver; I live within a few yards of Mr. Hindman; I was going past between three and four on Saturday morning the 19th; I was walking on that side of the green, when I came even with Sugar-loaf-alley, I saw two men at about forty yards before me.</p>
               <p>Court. What had brought you out at that early hour? - Why Sir, I am a very early riser, and I commonly go to the pump and wash myself before I go to labour, I have made it a practice for years past; the two men that I saw, were coming towards Captain Hindman's house, one of these two men had a bag under his arm, and by their appearance they were very dirty, and I thought they looked like very suspicious persons, and I thought it was not proper for me to meet them, and I turned off to go right across the green, there is a causeway opposite Sugar-loaf-alley that goes right across the green; I was fully determined to watch them, and before I got half over the green, I lost one of them; and as there was no turning for them to turn up, I concluded, they must go into some of the coach-houses and gateways, for there are three or four coach-houses; I watched the other, and my eye was never off of Ellicott, till I saw him go into Captain Hindman's yard; when I saw him go into Captain Hindman's yard, he shut the door after him, then I walked a little further across the green towards the Peacock, and I thought it was not proper to attack him myself; then I got across<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230018"></xptr>the green by the road side, and in about five minutes after, I saw Mr. Gould locking up his coach-house gates, which are about forty yards from Captain Hindman's; after he had locked the gates, he came up the same path I had come up; he came up to me, and I told him what I had seen; we went to Captain Hindman's door, but the door was fast; then the coachman got upon the wall and got into Captain Hindman's coach-yard; by that time I got across the green (for he out-run me) he came out at the same door I had seen Ellicott go in at, with Toomes in one hand, and Ellicott in the other; I ran up to his assistance, and they struggled in a very furious manner, when I saw him, I ran up to Mr. Gould's assistance, and when Toomes broke loose from Mr. Gould, I was within two yards of him; I pursued Toomes to the corner of Sugar-loaf-alley, which is about twenty yards; then I perceived Toomes get ground of me in running, I thought I should not be able to take him, I thought it was the best way to raise an alarm, which I did, by crying out, murder, thieves, stop thieves for God's sake; by that alarm Toomes was taken in less than five minutes, by French and Crisp; then I went and assisted Gould in taking Ellicott; then we came into the coach yard, and there we gave a very loud alarm to the family; in the coach-yard I saw a great copper and lead, and a pail full of quart bottles of wine, and two baskets of china, and variety of articles of kitchen furniture; it appeared like a broker's shop in short. Upon my oath, the prisoners are both the same men; Mr. Toomes was the man that ran before me, and Ellicott never was out of Gould's possession; I am positive to Toomes.</p>

               <p>What way of life is Ellicott in? - He is a <rs id="t17870523-11-deflabel62" type="occupation">shoe-maker</rs>

               <p>I was going out to look for a little work about four, and coming home past this door, I met this man; he asked me where I was going to, I said I was going to look for some hay-making; we saw some things standing there, and we both went in, and soon after Mr. Gould came in and laid hold of us both, and fell a kicking of us both about.</p>

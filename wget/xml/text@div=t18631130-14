My brother keeps a pie-shop in Wardour-street, and I manage it—on 6th November, about half-past 9, the prisoner came for two penny pies—I served him—he tendered a shilling—I gave him tenpence change, and put it on the marble slab of the window—there was a sixpence there, and some half-pence, but no other shilling—shortly afterwards he came and asked for two twopenny pies, and tendered a shilling—I saw that it was bad, and</p>

               <p>told him so—he took it out of my hand, and said, "I know where I took it; I will be back in half a minute," and ran out, leaving the pies—I then looked at the first shilling, found it was bad, and went out, but could not find the prisoner—about eleven o'clock, in consequence of something I heard, I went out, and saw the prisoner wishing a friend good-night—I asked him if he recollected bringing a shilling to the shop, and said, "The first one you brought was bad"—he said, "That was half an hour ago"—I gave him in charge with the shilling.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at 59, Gillingham Street, Pimlico—I occupy the house and sleep in the back parlour down stairs—about 5.30 on Sunday morning, 12th April, I heard a noise at my bed room door—I called out "Who's there"—I received no answer—I saw the door open, and jumped out of bed and caught sight of two men, they ran away, the prisoner was one of them—I followed and met a policeman, and the prisoner turned back and I followed—the policeman missed the other man and followed the prisoner—I went home and put on my clothes—I lost nothing—my house was safe when I went to bed—I was last up at night, and I am quite sure I shut the door, and none of my lodgers went out afterwards—the door must have been opened by a false key.</p>

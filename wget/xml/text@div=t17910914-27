               <p>I am a horse-slaughterer. Tristram came to me the 24th of last month, Wednesday, and told me, that he had got a relation had got a horse at the Angel, at Islington; and after that, he told me, it was a prig'd horse, meaning a stolen one, and he did not know how to get rid of him. He said, dead or alive, it would come to about 15 s. I went to acquaint our inspector of it; he was going out, he said, for a little way. Tristram and Berry came afterwards to me, at Sharp's-alley, between eight and nine in the evening, and they both asked 24 s. for it, and said they would come in about ten minutes after; Berry rode on the horse, the other walked. I detained them both, and the horse, at my stable, in Sharp's-alley. The prosecutor had the horse away with him before the magistrate; they were taken before magistrate that morning by ten o'clock. He said, it was his property. They desired the horse might be killed, and Tristram represented the prisoner as his cousin, and that the horse must be slaughtered. Then the men were fully committed.</p>

               <p>I searched one of the prisoners before the magistrate, and found a chisel on him; and he said, he brought the horse the other side of the water; he was committed for a further examination. I found the owner on Clerkenwell-green; I shewed him the horse, and he owned it. The prisoners were committed, and the prosecutor had his horse again.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman. On the 26th of August we heard a large spanking horse coming down Cow-cross towards Sharp's-alley; we saw the horse coming down. He said to me, this is the horse I suspect to be stolen. Berry was on the horse; the other man beckoned to Tristram to come under the gate-way; he took the horse, and tied it up against the door. They would not tell to whom the horse belonged. They were taken into custody.</p>

A man came, and said, he wanted something to drink; says Smith, if you will stick to me, and say, these two lads stole this horse, we will have plenty of drink. His character is very well known in the neighbourhood, but we are poor men.</p>

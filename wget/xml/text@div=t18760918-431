                  </hi>. I keep a farm at Whetstone about a mile from Barnet—on Monday, 4th September, I saw Reed in Barnet Fair-we had a conversation about a horse, on the Tuesday, he came to the fair with a brown horse which he wanted to Bell—I offered him first 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he asked 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and eventually he agreed to 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., with an old light chestnut horse of mine in exchange—he examined my horse and looked at its mouth and legs, it had a short tail coming down to about its hock; it was' a short-necked horse, its legs had ringbone, which is an enlargement round the fetlock—he complained that it had ringbone—I gave him a cheque for 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and told him to take the brown horse to the farm and fetch away the one he bought—I also said I would recommend the light chestnut horse to anybody in the fair, and waited about" for that purpose—about 3.30 I had a. communication from a man and went to look for the, prisoner—I met him with my man, who said "This man has got the wrong horse, "he has taken away Tommy"—the prisoner said that he had sold the horse for 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said "Well, I cannot help it, you must get him back, or you will hear something more of the matter"—then he said "I am sorry if I have made a mistake, we will go through the fair and see if we can find the horse"—he and I and the bailiff went through the fair together; he could not find the horse or the man he sold it to—we went round the fair and eventually stoped at the entrance to a booth—I was on horseback and did not go in—my bailiff was close to the prisoner; he went in—several people came around talking about it, and suddenly the prisoner disappeared</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187609180078"></xptr>
               <p>—I sent the bailiff to High Barnet Station and I went to the police-station and told the inspector about it—I went to the other station and arrived two or three minutes before a train started—I saw the prisoner on a seat at the far end of the station—atthe fair and at the farm he had a black mackintosh on; it had rained heavily all day—at the station he had the mackintosh white side out and the black side in—I said "Well, have you got my horse "—he said "No, I have not found him"—I said "I must have you," and I sent for a policeman—it was the light chestnut I sold him, the dark chestnut was the taller of the two by 2 or 3 inches—I know a good deal of horses; they are both aged horses—in my judgment, nobody knowing anything about horses could have mistaken the one for the other—the prisoner, in my interview with him, did not. look at the dark chestnut or examine it at all—we had no conversation about it—both horses were in the same field—he told me he came from Hickenham, near Uxbridge—at the police-station he gave his address, St. George's, Bristol—before then I know some papers had been found upon him by the policeman.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GRAIN</hi>. One chestnut was very light and the other very dark; they were carthorses—one was a much heavier horse than the other—one had a short tail down to the hocks, and the other one almost down to the ground—when the prisoner first came to inspect them they were running loose in the field—there were several other horses and a pony there—I rode first and drove the horses towards the prisoner, got them into a corner, and there was the light one and another one in one part, and the dark chestnut and others went away together—I had the light chestnut about three or four months—I valued her at about 20 guineas—the brown horse left by the prisoner I value at 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I trusted the prisoner to take the horse back and get the horse he had agreed to take—I said "Go up and bring that one back again"—he said he should bring him back and asked me to recommend him—the mackintosh is, I suppose, a reversible one—when I saw him at the old station at Barnet it was not raining—it had been raining during the greater portion of the day—the horse he left with me is worth 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—.</p>

I am a labourer, working. for Mr. Blythe—on 5th September, the second Barnet Fairday, the prisoner came to Mr. Blythe's farm first, between 1 and 2 o'clock—he brought the horse we have now—he said "I have made a deal now; I have made a <hi rend="italic">chock</hi> with the little, chestnut horse"—he asked me if I would go down the field and help to, catch the horse—as we were going we passed by the little chestnut horse—I asked him if that was the horse he was going to have—he said "No, the other one on the right"—I asked him if he was sure, and he told me "Yes" every time—the dark chestnut horse was under the hedge across the field—he went down and let the horse" loose which he bought, and then tried to catch the other horse, and asked me to catch it—I did so, and put the halter on it—I asked him again if he was sure it was the right horse—I brought it up and put it into the stable—he fetched it out and took it away with him—the light chestnut was left behind, and the dark one taken away—I thought the matter over and sent a man down to the fair to tell my master—I don't know much about horses—I was there when they were trying to manage the deal, but I did not see which horse it was the prisoner examined.</p>

I work for Mr. Blythe—on 5th September, the prisoner came with his dark horse and took the light chestnut horse away—there were two chestnut horses in the field, one dark and the other light—the dark chestnut was taken away—Smith went to catch it—I was sent down by Smith afterwards to the fair—the prisoner was outside the fair—I saw the dark chestnut in the turnpike road tied up by the rails—I recognised him at once—I think it was a little after 2 o'clock—I did not see the prisoner do anything to the horse—the horse remained tied up from an hour, to an hour and a half—the prisoner went up the hill leading the horse from the fair, about 3.30 or nearly 4 o'clock—he did not take the horse into the fair.</p>

Tuesday I was with Mr. Blythe and the prisoner in the yard, when they were trying to deal for the horses—I was not in the fair—on the day after a communication was made to me about the horse—in consequence of that. I looked about for. the prisoner—Mr. Blythe went one way and I went the other to look for him, and I found him—I told him he had taken the wrong horse—he said that he had not—I said "You have; the horse you have taken away was not for sale"—he said that he was sorry if he had made a mistake'; he would try and find the horse; he had sold it for 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-that was about 4 or 4.30—we went up Barnet Hill towards the town together and met Mr. Blythe—I told Mr. Blythe what had occurred, and he said "We will go and look for the horse through the fair," and we all three went back to. the. field where the horses were put up for sale, but did not find the horse—I and the prisoner were together, and a lot of his friends came up round me, and one. spoke to me on one side, and one spoke to him on the other, and the prisoner ran out and I lost sight of him—I did not see him again until he was in custody.</p>

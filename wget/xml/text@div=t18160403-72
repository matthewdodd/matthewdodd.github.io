               <p>CHARLES WOODWARD. Having suspected the prisoner, who was in my service, I was determined to try his honesty, and accordingly I got a friend whom he did not know, to go to my shop in Piccadilly, on the 7th of March, and purchase two locks, with two three-shilling pieces, which were marked, desiring him to get a bill and receipt. My friend gave me the bill and receipt into my hands. I immediately went into the shop, to see if the amount of the bill was entered in the cash book, and I found only two shillings entered for the six. I then desired him suspecting that there was something wrong, to shew me the money in the till, and there was only one of the three-shilling pieces that were marked, in the till. Being certain that he had taken the other three-shilling piece, I asked him to lend me five shillings; upon which he lent me the other three shilling piece, taken from his pocket.</p>

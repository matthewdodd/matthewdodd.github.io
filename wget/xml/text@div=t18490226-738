                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JAMES FRY</hi> I was brough up as a surgeon. On Tuesday evening, 20th Feb., I came from the West-end, and went into a public-house in Aldersgate-street, just after one o'clock—I do not know the sign of the house—the landlord's name is Watkins—after I bad been there a few minutes, the prisoner came in with three or four men—I was taking a glass of half-and-half—she and the others came round me, and pressed me very much to treat them to some gin—I said, "I don't see why I should, you are strangers to me, but if you want a drop of gin so badly have it, and I will pay for it"—they called for the gin, and I paid for it—I had no purse, my money was loose in my pocket—I reside in Bull-yard, at the bottom of Fann-street, about 500 yards from the public-house—I went away directly, and as soon as I had left about twenty yards they came round me again, and pressed me to go to another public-house—the prisoner was among them—I refused—when I went to turn in to go down the yard, to my own house, they caught hold of me, and pushed me up the passage seven or ten yards—I believe the prisoner was right on my side, behind me—I cried," Murder! "as loud as I could halloo—I then received a severe blow from a weapon which clung very close to my head—I had a very thick hat on—I was knocked down insensible, and in a few minutes, when I came to my senses, I found I was almost stifled—a handkerchief was held over my mouth—I heard one say," Turn him over, it is in the other pocket," and in turning me over they tore my pocket almost down to my knee, and I found a hand in my pocket twice—I had about 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and silver in my pockets which was taken away—I had left my watch at home—I am positive the prisoner is one of the persons who pushed me up the Court.</p>

               <p>with some parties I had been doing business with—I might have had a glass of ale at my dinner, but no wine or spirits—I was about twenty or thirty vards from my house when they interfered with me—I have a wife, son, and daughter at home—I had taken more than I was in the habit of taking, but I was not tipsy—I perfectly understood what I was about—I believe these people called for half-a-pint of gin which I paid for—I "cannot say whether the prisoner left the house before the others—I might have remained in the house after she was gone—I know she was with them when they came round me at the top of Fann-street—I know she was there a minute or two pre<lb></lb>vious to my going out—a man was taken into custody, and I swore to him before Mr. Coombes, the Magistrate—it was sworn that he was elsewhere, and he was discharged, but I still believe that he was one of the persons—I think I saw the prisoner again about five o'clock the same morning—I gave a description of her to the policeman, and he took me down to where she was lodging—I waited there—she was not at home—he then kept me on the look out and went to a public-house where she resorted—he brought her from there, and I knew her again.</p>

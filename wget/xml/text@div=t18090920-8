               <p>Q. He had an apartment that he himself hired. - A. Yes. I searched that apartment, I found the copper artificial leg and the other things there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you missed them. - A. Yes, I asked him about some braces that had been in the drawer, he said he had missed them, they were taken out of the drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the prisoner lived with you. - A. About a year and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. He did your smith's business did he. - A. Yes, he left me after he had behaved in a bad way.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. And you settled with him. - A. It was time to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. He set up a smith's shop did not he in Great St. Andrew's-street, did he work for you there. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say that he never did any job for you there. - A. I think I did employ him once.</p>
               <p>Q. He was carrying on that business there. - A. He was very welcome.</p>
               <p>Q. They say that when two people are parted they do not agree very well, you never once published any account of it. - A. I drew up a hand-bill of the case how he served me.</p>
               <p>Q. You never published it. - A. No, I printed it for the purpose of a memorandum, I never circulated it.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know if you were to see it. - A. Yes, certainly I know all about it, it was my business; he carried on this business, took the money, and charged me for the time, I never had any of the monies when he was with me.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no agreement or partnership with him at all had you. - A. No, none at all; no, never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any note of hand given in the name of the partnership between you and Taylor in your own hand writing. Should you know it if you were to see it. - A. You may shew me what you please, I know the writing, but I had never nothing to do with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now these things that you found, I should like<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180909200007"></xptr>to know whereabouts they were found in his shop. - A. The copper leg he had painted it, and put it in the window for a sign, and then afterwards it was put down.</p>
               <p>Q. For any body to see it, you saw it when you went into the shop. - A. Yes, there we found it, I told him it was mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Just look at the bill of exchange, and tell me whether you know that - A. I do not know how he come by this, this was never executed, it was a matter once we were going upon.</p>

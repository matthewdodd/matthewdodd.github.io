               <p>Q. Could you at all see the size of the man that went out? - A. No; I immediately rang the bell, I saw him cross the road, and my brother and sister came down; I told him the till was gone, and my brother went after him; I did not know what was in the till, I know these to be my brother's spoons.</p>

I am a sailor, and board at 136, St. George's-street—yesterday morning, between one and two o'clock, I was near the London Hospital, and the prisoner hit me on the side of my face but did not hurt me—he then tried to seize the handkerchief off my neck, but I resisted him—he walked away up the street, and I walked down the street—a few minutes afterwards he came again with this large stone (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—next he threw it at me and hit me on the knee, which felled me—he then came up, took my handkerchief off my neck, and put his hand into my pocket—I missed a shilling—a constable came up, and I gave him in charge—my handkerchief was worth four shillings—I did not see it taken from him.</p>

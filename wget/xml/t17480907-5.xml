               <p>William Austin. On the 30th of August last, between 1 and 2 in the morning, I heard a noise, and it being moon-light, I went to sleep again, and slept about an hour and an half, and then I got up, and found my house was broke open, and the chamber-window up one pair of stairs open, and this knife lying by it, and a pane of glass was taken out.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there shutters to this window?</p>
               <p>Austin. No; and the next day there was 19 yards of velvet missing; there was more than 19 yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Who does it belong to?</p>
               <p>Austin. To my master

               <p>Austin . I know no-body, but him, could do it: it was done on the 30th of August in the morning, and I took him up the same day.</p>

The prisoner came on the 29th, and treated me with a pot of beer, and asked to see my work, and I shewed it him, and I put the velvet into my box when I came away, and the next morning he cut it off.</p>

            . Last Monday was sevennight, about 1 o'clock in the morning, the prisoner called me up, and asked me if I would take a walk along with him; and we went to Mr. Austin's house in Vine-court Spittle Fields. He said he had given a man a pot of beer, but he could pay himself for it; so I agreed to go along with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you what he was to do?</p>
               <p>Lewis. Yes; and he said he could not do without a ladder; but I lent him a hand, and helped him up, and he took a knife out of his pocket, and took out a pane of glass, and went in at the window. This is the knife.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he stay there?</p>
               <p>Lewis. About 10 minutes, and brought a bundle to the window, and threw it into my hands.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it?</p>
               <p>Lewis. It was rolled up; I felt of it, and found it to be velvet, and then he jumped down, and we both went away to a young woman's house in Golden-lane and about 9 o'clock we carried it to the house of one Life Chitty, a Jew.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave it there?</p>
               <p>Lewis. Yes; he laid it upon the bed, and asked him 7 s. a yard for it; and the Jew told him he asked too much money for it; and a person came and took the velvet before the money was brought.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does this Jew live?</p>
               <p>Lewis. He lives in Gravel-lane in Houndsditch. A person came into a house there, and asked whether

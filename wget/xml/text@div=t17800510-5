On Monday the 17th of April, between six and seven in the evening, the two prisoners came into our shop, and asked to see some silk cloaks. I desired them to go to a part of the shop where we generally shew those things; they wanted to see them in a dark part of the shop; their behaviour was such as caused me to suspect them as soon as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178005100007"></xptr>they came in; I therefore counted the cloaks. I laid down six black silk cloaks before them. They found a deal of fault with them; they said the lace was not good enough, that they wanted them with broader trimmings and larger. I said, in order to see how large they were, they had better try one on, upon which Thompson pulled her cloak off, and tried one of them on. Kent had on a long scarlet cloak. Thompson dropped a cloak on the ground, upon which Kent sat down on a stool, and then the cloak which she had on reached almost to the ground, and then she

                  drew

             the cloak that had been dropped, up under her own cloak, as I suppose by the circumstances which turned out afterwards. I desired my servant to bring some cloaks with broader trimmings; she brought three. I returned three of the others, in order to keep the same number before them. They thought these cloaks not large enough. I desired my servant to bring another. They seemed to like that and asked the price of it; I said twenty-six shillings. Thompson said she would give me twelve shillings for it, and if I would not take that she wished me a good night, and said she was sorry she had given me the trouble. As they were going out of the shop, Thompson laid hold of the door.</p>

               <p>You refused the twelve shillings? - It cost me twenty-two shillings. As they were going out I laid hold of Thompson with one hand, and the other with the other hand. I said they had a cloak of mine, and they must not take my property away. I sent for a constable, who lived at the next door. He came in. When I charged them with having a cloak, Kent dropped the cloak from under her arm; as my servant will prove. I did not see it myself; it was found where Kent stood. I knew she had the cloak before I shewed her the last cloak, and I fancy she must know I knew it by my countenance, for she said I fancy the gentleman is hard of hearing, and does not choose to shew us any more cloaks.</p>
               <p>Did you see Kent draw it up under her petticoats? - I saw Thompson drop it and look at Kent as much as to say pick it up, and she sat down immediately.</p>
               <p>You did not see her pick it up? - I cannot say that I did; when I charged them with it, they said they knew nothing about it. I gave the constable charge of them and sent them to the Compter.</p>
               <p>ANN MOUNTAIN sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant to the prosecutor. On the 17th of April, between six and seven in the evening while he was attending the two prisoners, I placed myself at the end of the counter, as he was shewing them the cloaks. They seemed to think the cloaks too small. He said, Mountain, is there not a larger one, a 6th, I said, I believed there was, and fetched the cloak; I was going to try it on; she said, Did I think she never put a cloak on; what business had I there? I had more need go about my business. I begged her pardon, and went to the end of the compter. They bid my master twelve shillings for a cloak which cost him twenty-two shillings and six-pence. They were going out; my master lifted up the counter and followed them and clapped his hand upon each of their shoulders, and then Kent dropped the cloak from under her cloak; I saw her drop it just within the sash; it lay on the ground till the constable came, and he took it up.</p>

               <p>I went in to buy a cloak; I had half a guinea and half a crown. The cloak I tried on I put on the counter again.</p>

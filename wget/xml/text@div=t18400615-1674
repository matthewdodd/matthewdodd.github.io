                  </hi>I am a constable in the service of the London Dock Company. In consequence of instructions I had received, I was watching on the 9th of June with two other officers in the docks, near a privy at the back of the south warehouses—I could see who came in and out of the privy, without being seen myself—about twelve o'clock in the day I saw the prisoner Jones come to the privy door, and go in—he came out again immediately, went to a dust heap close by, picked up a piece of printed paper, and seemed reading it—in about five minutes a man, having the appearance of a butcher's man, came out of the privy—Jones did not return to the privy then, but remained at the heap about five minutes longer—he appeared to be looking at the paper, and frequently looking towards the brandy vault, and also towards the South-quay—I then saw him look towards the brandy-vault, and make a motion with his hands to his head, and go into the privy—in about half a minute Dale followed him—he is a labourer in the company's employ, and was em<lb></lb>ployed in the brandy-vault at that time—when Jones first came to the privy, he came from the direction of the brandy-vault—Dale remained in the privy about a minute—he was not there long enough to have per<lb></lb>formed any office of nature—when he came out, Rudkins the constable</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184006150148"></xptr>
               <p>seized him—I went into the privy, and saw Jones standing with his back to one of the seats, buttoning up his trowsers—there are five seats in that privy—I laid hold of him, and said, "You are my prisoner"—I searched him, and found concealed in the seat of his trowsers, and fas<lb></lb>tened round his body with a string, this India-rubber bag, containing seven pints of French brandy—I asked him where he got it from—he said he had found it in the privy, lying under a piece of old sack—I observed that there was not a piece of old sack there—the prisoners were both takes to the station-house—I asked Dale what he was doing in the privy—he said he went there to ease himself—I said, "Then were you <hi rend="italic">taken short? "</hi>—he said, "Yes"—I said, "And yet you passed two privies to go there, and there is one alongside the vault at which you work, and you know that" he made no answer—he had passed two privies before he came to this out—I then went to the brandy-vault, to the gang where Dale was working—I found a bottle of brandy near where I understand Dale had been working—I had not seen him there myself—I also found a valinch or syphon wet with brandy.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. There are a great many of those things in the docks, are there not? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. There are—I believe there were eight labourers in the brandy-vault that day, but more than that have admission—the privy Dale went to is about three hundred yards from the brandy-vault—it is between the south quay and the brandy-vault—Jones looked first one way, and then the other—I cannot tell why he looked towards the south quay.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner Jones. Q</hi>. Is there not plenty of shipping lying in the docks with brandy on board? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. There are two or three discharging brandy at present—there are not two or three dozen that I am aware of—the strength of the brandy I took from you has been tried with that taken from the cask—I believe it is not the same proof—I believe it is part of the brandy in the Company's custody, having found it on you.</p>

                  </hi>I was on duty with Clements on the 9th of Jane, and a little after twelve o'clock saw Dale on the brandy-quay, which joins the brandy-vault—I saw him come towards the bridge which leads to the south-quay—he walked to the back of the south warehouses, and I fol<lb></lb>lowed him, and saw him go into the privy—he had passed two privies be<lb></lb>fore he got there—he remained there about a minute—I stopped him when he came out, and asked where he worked—he said, "In the brandy<lb></lb>vault"—I asked what business he had at that privy—he gave no answer—I searched him, but found nothing on him—he was in a working dress—this bag might very well have been concealed about his dress.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q</hi>. What clothes were they? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Clothes they pot on to prevent their dirtying their other things, as the vaults are very dirty—other workmen wear the same kind of dress—this happened at lun<lb></lb>cheon time.</p>

                  </hi>I am a cooper of the brandy-vault. I examined two puncheons of brandy on Wednesday morning, the 10th of June, to see if they were of the same description at that found in the bag—I found the bungs had been forced out and stuck in again—one appears to be the same colour and the same quality of spirit, but not the same strength; but every time spirit is turned from one thing into another, the strength enapo<lb></lb>rates—going into this bag would alter it materially—Clements told me what was done with the brandy—I think what he says has been done with it would account for the deficiency in strength—in other respects the brandy is precisely similar—two gallons Were missing from one cask.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q</hi>. One puncheon wit of the same colour at this? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Yes—the other was not—they Were alongside each other—about the same quantity was gone from each—there were three or four other casks with the bungs out, but no lost—we find some bungs out every day—I have used the syphon hundreds of times—I am a cooper.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner Jones. Q</hi>. You saw the brandy tested? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Yes—there was eight per cent. difference—I have samples here—brandy would lose strength in going from a cask into a bag—I cannot say bow mock strength it would lose—it depends on whether the bag is wet or dry.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Can you take upon yourself to say, there is a piece of lawn lost from them? A. Yes; we have lost a good many - I know that by the books which are not here - about twelve persons are employed in our business - they would all have access to these goods - our house does not manufacture these - they are transmitted to London - other persons might purchase pieces of the same manufacturer - my employers told me they had never sent the prisoner out with a piece of lawn - I do not know whether persons in the country have different marks for the goods they send to different houses.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Would they have a parcel with Lewellin's name on it? A. Certainly not; we have lost many pieces of lawn similar to these - I receive the lawns and enter them in a stock book, and having refreshed my memory by reference to the book, I can say we have lost articles of this description - it is my duty to keep the books - when I am there I sell the lawns, but when I am not others sell them.</p>

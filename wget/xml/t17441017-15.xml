The next day I missed a large silver spoon and a tea spoon, I asked her where they were? She said Mr. Delany had locked them up in his bureau. When Mr. Delany came in, I said did you take a large silver spoon and a tea spoon? He said he had not seen them since he left them in my care, and expected them at my hand. I missed three spoons out of the tea chest, I asked the Prisoner what was become of the great spoon, I believe I said a rash word, I said I will know before you go out of this room by the living G - d, then she said she had pawned it in Houghton-street by Clare-Market; as to the little spoons she said they were sold, and I never could have them more; said I, Who dare buy stolen goods? You have given them to Mrs. Steer, that is a woman I did not like. I called to the man who is my servant and bid him go for a warrant, and threatened her that I would have one: then she said they were pawned in Purpool-Lane , and they were found there; she had pawned the great spoon in the name of

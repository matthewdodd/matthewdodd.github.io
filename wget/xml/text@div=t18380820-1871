                  </hi>. I live at Mrs. Brown's, in Prospect-place, Bromley. On the 28th of July I met the prisoner at the White Hart public-house—I never saw her before—she asked me to go home with her, and I did—I asked her where the landlady was—she said she was the land-lady, and asked me what I wanted with her—I said, to take care of my trowsers till the morning—we went up stairs—I asked her her demand—she said 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said I would give her no such money as that—I gave her two half-crowns, and went to bed, and went to sleep—I gave her the trowsers to take care of—the next morning I missed my trowsers, and</p>

               <p>asked the prisoner for them—she said, "Go along, you fool, I know no<lb></lb>thing of you, or your trowsers either."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. You know you gave me them to pawn-you had no money at all. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. No; I gave her two half-crowns, on my oath—they were a new pair of trowsers that I was carrying-when I asked her she said, "Feel for them," and I felt in these trowsers pocket, which I had on, and found the duplicate of them.</p>

             came to my house; from his information I was determined to take warrants against all the people that worked for us. I called Hanssen, and asked him how he came to run up a bill at tradesmen in the neighbourhood for porter and for leather; I told him I knew how the rest of the things were gone. After this, he said if the old rogue was gone he would confess.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you speak of confession, did you tell your apprentice that you had an instrument in your hand that would take him to Marlborough-street in a minute. - A. I was not present, he confessed before my partner.</p>

               <p>Q. Was not that confession made under an idea that you had an instrument in your house. - A. By no means.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not that confession made under an idea that he should be admitted an evidence. - A. There was a misconception; we were all along determined to prosecute. Mr. Alley knows that I said the law must take its course.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there was a misconception, do you mean that the prisoner misconceived, and made that confession under the idea that he should be admitted an evidence. - A. I cannot tell you.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not every reason to believe that it was under that idea. - A. No. He said I am a guilty wretch, I know nothing can be done for me; he wished to make a recompence to his master.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland to Meyer. He said when the old rogue was gone he would make a confession. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he make a confession before the magistrate. A. He did; the magistrate sent a body warrant, and a search warrant to Smith; we went to his house with Mr.

We set down all the things in a book that were given out of the cutting room; when I returned from Yorkshire I missed this calico.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Smith say he knew Hanssen. - A. He said he merely knew him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. There was an examination in Marlborough-street, was it not the intention of the magistrate till the last examination, to commit Smith for a misdemeanor, as receiver, and to make Hanssen a witness, did he not, with that impression on his mind, receive the confession of Smith. - A. I cannot tell, it was not my intention.</p>

Hamilton produced his warrant; we found this holland and cotton; my partner after followed; we brought the goods away. Mr. Smith acknowledged having a knowledge of the boy, and having dealings with him. He did not say he bought stolen goods of him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I ask you, sir, whether Mr. Brodie the magistrate, did not mean to commit Smith for the misdemeanor, did not he express his surprize after the proceedings, that he was called upon to make both parties felons - give me your answer, did you not yourself then say that you called upon the magistrate to commit both for the felony, as you thought you had evidence against both for the felony. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Bolland. At the time that Hanssen first went to Mr. Meyer, you and Hanssen went down in the room together, when Smith went away, what did Hanssen state in that room. - A. He stated of various articles he had taken, silk serges, brown holland, fine cotton, cassimere, balls of twist, pounds of thread, and various quantities of sewing silks, black and coloured, which he sold to the prisoner Smith, receiving for these articles three shillings a yard for silk serge, from ten pence to a shilling a yard for brown holland, upon an average fine cottons from ten pence a yard to one shilling, thread at three shillings per pound, twist from one shilling and ten pence to two shillings per ounce.</p>

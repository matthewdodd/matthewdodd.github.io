                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Bottrill, a butcher, in Orchard-street, Westminster. The prisoner had been in his em<lb></lb>ploy between four and five years—he had to carry out meat, and receive money from the customers—it was his duty to account to me for what he received in the evening, or if not then, when I was disengaged—he never accounted for any money to my husband, only to me—at Christmas last my attention was called to an account of Mr. Parfrey's—he appeared considerably in debt for meat, and I told the prisoner to ask Mrs. Parfrey to let me have some money, and he brought me word Mrs. Parfrey would pay ready money for her meat till she could pay her bill—if he received from her 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., he did not pay it to me—I found out that he had been paid the money one Wednesday, and he said to me, "I understand you have been to the bank (meaning Thames bank), and ascertained that I have been receiving those bills"—he said he had lost 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of his pocket at Christmas, and God Almighty only knew how he had lost it—I told him he had received upwards of 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and had not accounted for it—he said, "I don't think it is so much that"—his cousin asked what he had done with it—he said he did not know—he was asked if he had any of it—he said he had got a few halfpence—his box was searched, and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was found—the articles which are down on these bills (<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>) were supplied to Mr. Parfrey, and these receipts to them are the prisoner's writing.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 114). On June 23rd, about 11 in the morning, I was on duty at New Cross, Deptford, and saw the three prisoners, with another lad not in custody—I watched them to the Broadway, Dept<lb></lb>ford, about half a mile, and watched them opposite the prosecutor's shop, three quarters of a mile; sometimes one was opposite, sometimes another—I saw Welch about five yards from the shop, coming out—he crossed the road to High Street, and had this bundle in front of him, partly covered with his handkerchief—I had seen him five or six minutes before, and he had nothing with him—the other two were on the opposite side of the road, playing about the posts, but looking across to the shop—Welch went across High-street, and the other two on each side of him; he had his arms on their shoulders, and when he had gone a few steps, the print was passed from Welch to Caldon, and they went to the first turning and went off—I had a sergeant of artillery with me, and I fancy they saw us, for they com<lb></lb>menced running—they went up a blank turning—the sergeant went one way, and I the other, and when they could not get out, they got on to some waste ground, by some empty houses, and we met them running with their coats off, and took the three of them, after some scuffling, and found the print a few yards off, behind some palings, in the direction in which they had come, wrapped up in this handkerchief—Caldon said "Give me that hand<lb></lb>kerchief; it belongs to me," and tried to snatch it from me, but the sergeant would not let him have it—they were so riotous on the way to the station that I had to get a boy to carry the print—I said "Bring it along my man," and Davis said, "Chuck it away, don't bring it."</p>

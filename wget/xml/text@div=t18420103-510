On the 20th of December, between twelve and one o'clock at night, I was in the New-road—I was sober—I had been to a club—I met the prisoner by King's-cross—she accosted me, and asked me if J would treat her—I told her the shops were closed, I could not—she immediately laid hold of my arm, and I missed 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of my pocket—she went away after that—I followed and accused her of it—she went among a lot of cabmen, by King's-cross, for protection—I stop<lb></lb>ped a minute or two till I saw a policeman come up, and then gave her in charge.</p>

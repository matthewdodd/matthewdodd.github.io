               <p>I am a baker; I live in the neighbourhood. I am the person who first raised the suspicion of the prisoner; I met him with a bundle under his arm, about six in the evening; I laid hold of him, and asked him what he had there; he said it was nothing to me; I asked where he was going to carry it; he said what business was that of mine. Hearing something had been lost in this way, I informed Levi of it, and that led to a suspicion of the prisoner, and occasioned his being secured.</p>

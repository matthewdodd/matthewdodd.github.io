                  </hi>. I am in the employment of Messrs. Herbert, jewellers, of Newman-street, Oxford-street—on the afternoon of 12th February I took some gold to the flatting mills at Clerkenwell—I was bringing it back in the evening at twenty minutes or half-past 7—when I was nearly at the top of Newman-street, I saw three men, the prisoner, and another man were standing near Newman's yard, and a tall man with a light coat on was standing in Newman's yard—when I got near the man who was standing down the Mews he said, "Here, George, is this St. Ann's Court"—I did not answer him, and he made a rush at me, and caught me by the coat—I tried to cry out "Murder!" but could not; he then caught me tighter—I had a strap over my shoulder, with a bag under my left arm, containing thirty<lb></lb>seven ounces of gold, four crucibles, an account-book, and a tin case—the prisoner and the other man then shut one of the gates at the end of the Mews, and then they ran down to me, and the prisoner cut the strap which</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186504100066"></xptr>
               <p>was across ray shoulder, but I do not know who got the bag; he also cut my coat and my shirt—the other man then threw me down with great violence on the stones; he lifted me off the ground—I was stunned; and when I got up they had gone—I went to my master's shop and told the foreman—I can speak positively to the prisoner—I did not see him again till 31st January, when I picked him out from eight other people at Old-street station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employment of Messrs. Jackson and Graham—on evening of 12th January, I was passing Newman-yard, and saw three men as I thought larking with the boy down the yard—I watched them and saw them push him down—they ran to the top of the yard towards me—I looked round and by the light of the lamp from the opposite public-house, I saw three men—one of them was the prisoner—I afterwards described him to the inspector on 31st January—I was taken to the police-station George-street; the prisoner was placed with about seven other men, and I picked him out—I am certain he is one of the three I saw run through the gate way.</p>

                  </hi>. In the early part of January I was being brought up in the police-van from the House of Detention for stealing a tea-pot—when the van stopped the door was opened and the little trap as well, and I asked some one who was there if we had got to Marlborough station—the man said, "No, it is Marylebone, are you the old lady for the tea-pot"—I said, "Yes, I am, and if they swear a falsehood against me as they did when I was taken, I am sure I shall get either two or three months"—he said, "Well I would rather be you than me, for I expect fourteen years"—I said that is a bad job, and asked him what it was for—he said, "For the gold robbery in Newman-street, Oxford-street, have not you heard of it"—I said, "Yes, I have heard of it, but surely you are not one of them"—he did not say yes or no, but he said, "I had a share of the bulk"—he called me "Nelly," and said he knew me by serving fourteen months with his wife at Tothill-fields—I said, "You are mistaken altogether in the person, I have never done so"—he said there were three of them in the robbery, but one had got away—I said, I supposed he lived near Marlborough-street as he was taken there—he said no, he was taken at Whitechapel, he lived at White<lb></lb>chapel—I then asked him if anything was found upon him when he was taken—he said no, he took good care of that, for when he found it was the Bobby at the door, he wetted his fingers, slipped his rings off, and put them under his old woman's pillow, and what else he could in the time be had—when we got out of the van I said, "Now am I the party you took me for"—he said, "No, I am mistaken, you will see my wife presently, and you will know her by serving eighteen months with her;"but it is false—I was discharged for the tea-pot.</p>

No—I am in custody now—there is a passage between the cells of the police-van, just wide enough for one person to pass through—when you are put into the cells the door is locked upon you, and there are doors on both sides of the passage—you do not have to speak through the two doors—there is a little trap about the size of that book, which opens in the door—that was opened for our convenience, I suppose—the policeman left it open—it was a trap-door even with our faces—the trap-door in the prisoner's cell was open, and he set right facing me—I told Inspector Bryant when we went to the police-court—I did not see the prisoner charged, but I was brought; away from the police-court in the same van—there are generally a great many in the cell together waiting to be taken to the police-court, but there were not then—there was only one female besides me—they do not put the males and females together.</p>

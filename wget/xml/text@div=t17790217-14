               <p>Do you know the prisoner? - Yes; I took him in my house, and gave him a fortnight's lodging out of compassion. I do not know that he took it. I took up his boy first; the boy said he had found it. The day I missed it, the boy came to bring an apron to a girl in the house; I asked him if he had heard of my misfortune, and told him I had lost the watch; he said no. His mother came afterwards and abused me, and said, she would trounce me for saying they had stolen my husband's watch; that because I had heard that their boy had found a watch, that therefore I pretended I had lost one.</p>

               <p>What was the watchmaker's name where it was? - Plastrerer. I took the watch into my possession till he could bring the money; two or three days afterwards they came to me and said the watch was stolen, and the man was taken up. I went to Justice Sherwood with the watch.</p>

A man came and wanted to see the watch; the man that had it was not at my house, the prisoner was; he desired me not to say any thing to the prisoner till he had seen it.</p>

I waited an hour, he did not come; the prisoner was there; I bid the publican say nothing to the prisoner about it till we were certain of the the watch, as the prosecutrix only wanted her property again. Instead of bringing the prosecutrix the watch, they came and abused her; on which I advised her to go to Justice Sherwood. and get a warrant against the man, his son, and daughter. I advised that the watchmaker that repaired it should be summoned, but it was over-ruled.</p>

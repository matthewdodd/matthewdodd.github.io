                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Lomax, clothes-salesman, of Dudley-street, St. Giles; we occupy the shop and parlour; other lodgers rent the rest of the house; the landlord does not live in it; our part is sepa<lb></lb>ratefrom the rest. We went out on the evening of the 9th of Jan., about half-past eight o'clock—I fastened the shop and parlour doors, and window—we returned a few minutes to nine, and, on unlocking the parlour door, I found a resistance inside—when I pushed it open I saw a man in the room—he pushed the door back, and locked me out—I screamed, and my husband came to my assistance—I afterwards saw the prisoner in charge—I found twenty-two coats, worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., taken off the shelves in the shop, and put into a bag.</p>

                  </hi>. In consequence of the alarm my wife gave, I ran into the yard, and saw two persons getting over the wall, and a man getting out of the parlour window—I believe it was the prisoner—I got over the wall, and followed him into the next yard, and found the prisoner on the kitchen stairs of the adjoining house, which I entered at the back door—I took him into my shop, and found these coats packed up in a bag on the floor—they had been taken off the shelves.</p>

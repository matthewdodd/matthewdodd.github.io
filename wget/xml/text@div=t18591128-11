                  </hi>. I am a West India merchant, and carry on business at Lime-street, city—on 11th September I went out of town and remained out until 27th October—the prisoner was in my employment as a clerk—I had no other clerk or any other person at the office—when I left London I merely left him in charge to forward me the letters he received, and to let me know who called, and what was going on in the business—he wrote to me from time to time—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), dated 21st October, is in the prisoner's handwriting—I received this on the following day, the 22nd—this postscript is also his writing—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "P.S. The 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque received from Mrs. Logan I duly received and paid into the bank")—I received that by post—before I left London there was a bill for 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. coming due on 23d Sep<lb></lb>tember, drawn by Messrs. Blogg and Martin and accepted by me; this is it—it was payable at 1, Lime-street; my place of business—before I left London I had arranged with Mr. Martin that they should pay the bill; I paid the half of it, 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to Mr. Stevenson of Blogg and Martin's, and I gave my acceptance for the other 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was to be renewed for six months—it was arranged that when the 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill became due, Blogg and Martin were to send the money to my office—I think that was arranged about 10th September, the day previous to my leaving London—I told the prisoner that Blogg and Martin would send 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the following day, the 23d, to retire the bill—he knew that it was to be presented at my office, and I told him he would receive the amount of Blogg and Martin on the 23d to pay it—on the after<lb></lb>noon of 26th October I received this letter from the prisoner—I was then at Boulogne—<hi rend="italic">Part of this letter was read as follows:</hi> "I have now to call your attention to a matter of the greatest importance to myself, which causes me</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185911280014"></xptr>
               <p>great anxiety. You will no doubt remember that when you left London you told me that the said gentlemen (Blogg and Martin) would furnish me with the means to retire their bill for 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which fell due on 23rd September, on which day they handed me 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. without any explanation whatever; and upon observing your entry in my diary, viz. "65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. renewed for three months from date," I naturally concluded that some error had occurred, and that they had retained for some purpose 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and retained the bill themselves, as it was not presented here to my knowledge. I paid the amount, less a small deduction which I made on my own account, in to the Bank of England to your credit, for safety—on the following day a person (Mr. Stevenson) called here and told me that the bill had been returned to them unpaid, and that they had given their cheque for the amount, and requested me to return them the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. they paid me on the previous day. I gave him a cheque, signed as I sign the letters; I wrote "per pro Logan brothers, H. Leach." Some time afterwards he called and told me the cheque had been refused payment; I then paid him 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash, of my own money, and he gave me a receipt for it, which receipt is of course in my possession; but to my utter astonishment I received a note the latter end of last week, addressed to you, from Blogg and Martin, and which, as usual, I opened and found that from the purport of its contents that their clerk had misrepresented the circumstances of the transaction to them, and totally ignored the fact of my returning the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to him; I shall therefore leave you to judge the effect this produced upon me. I immediately took the advice of a friend, who advised me to consult a solicitor upon the matter. I did so, and he wished me to send a copy of said letter to you and retain the original which I have now to hand you. I called this morning, in company with my solicitor, and saw Mr. Martin, and Stevenson positively denies having received the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from me, except by cheque. At Mr. Martin's request I gave him your address, and he will doubtless communicate with you concerning the matter."—I left Boulogne the morning after receiving that letter and came to London—I did not go to my office but went direct to Blogg and Martin—I went to my office next morning, the 28th, and saw the prisoner—I told him that I had come over to inquire about this trans<lb></lb>action with Blogg and Martin, the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he told me that he held a receipt for the amount, that he had paid them 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on my account, and he held a receipt for the amount—he did not show me the receipt—nothing else occurred for a day or two, when I went again to Blogg and Martin to converse with them on the matter, and make myself perfectly acquainted with the transaction—I told the prisoner that I had spoken to Mr. Stevenson on the matter and that he had denied altogether having received the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner still persisted that he held the receipt—a day or two afterwards I had a conver<lb></lb>sation with him about the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque; that was at my office—I asked him if he had paid it into the Bank of England—he said no, but he would make it all right with me; that he would take care to repay me the amount—I said "Very well, I shall see about that"—I had not at that time ascertained that the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had not been paid in to my account—I did not send for my pass<lb></lb>book fur a day or two afterwards, when I did, I found that no such sum had been paid in; I have the pass-book here to prove it; no credit is given to me for that amount—I did not say anything to him then, because I wished to let it stand over for a day or two until I had examined into the account, to see if it had been allowed in any other way—I had some conversation with him about the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a day or two, afterwards; he said that he was very desirous to repay the amount, and he would see Mr. Williams, a friend of his,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185911280015"></xptr>
               <p>and would get the money from him to repay it—nothing further took place until I gave him in charge to a policeman—before I gave him in charge he had said that he kept the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. back, as he had made an advance of 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on my account—I think he said that a few days after I came over from Boulogne—he repeatedly said that—I had not learnt from the prisoner before I came over on the 27th October that this money had not been paid in to my bankers—I continually received letters from him, generally every two or three days—his wages were 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week.</p>

London, October 20th, 1859 Sir, on the 23d of last month we handed your clerk 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. towards your acceptance of 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due on that day, for which we should have sent the whole amount as arranged with you but through the amount having been entered by our cashier to the smaller amount in his diary. The bill was returned on the 24th unpaid. When we gave our cheque for the full amount, and made application to your clerk for the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to be returned to us, his reply was that the bill had not been presented at the office. This was in reply to our telling him that he should have brought it to us and made some inquiry about it, as he acknowledged he knew he had to receive the whole amount from us; and he gave us a cheque for it on the Bank of England; upon presenting which it was refused payment, the bank not having his signature. We then requested him to send a cheque to you for your signature, which he said he did at once, and has been daily expecting to hear from you or to see you back. We cannot think that you are treating this matter in the manner you ought to have done, in as much as it was done for your accommodation, and you should have at once returned the cheque signed, to reimburse us for our cash; we therefore beg you will immediately on receipt of the present send us the amount. We are, sir, yours obediently, Blogg and Martin.")—the prisoner told me he would repay me the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before he told me he was retaining it for the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said that, either on the 28th or 29th, I am not certain which—there was no one present at the conversation—I had not seen the pass-book at that time; I don't remember Mr. Wil<lb></lb>liams being present; he was present on one occasion, I think about the 28th, 29th, or 30th—it was a day or two after I had seen the prisoner—I can't say the exact day, perhaps it was the 29th—I first saw the prisoner alone—I am sure that I spoke to him about the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before I saw the pass-book—I think I spoke to him before I saw Mr. Williams—I did not know that the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been advanced until I received Blogg and Martin's letter at Boulogne, dated the 20th, and which the prisoner sent to me in his own letter—the first time I saw the prisoner he told me he had paid 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Mr. Stevenson and he held his receipt—I asked him where he got the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he told me that he had borrowed 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Mr. Williams—Mr. Williams was present when that was stated and he confirmed it—I asked if he had any objection to show me the receipt for it—he said he would, but he never did—Mr. Williams is now bail for him in 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said at first that I should let Blogg and Martin bring the action for the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and I would defend it—I afterwards said I should not defend it unless the prisoner's friends would guarantee the costs in any event, win or lose—I do not remember Mr. Williams saying that that was unreasonable, and he should not do it—he said he would see about it; he would inquire about it.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185911280016"></xptr>
               <p>—I did not see Mr. Baugham, an attorney—Mr. Williams did not say that if I did not like to defend the honour of my office, he, on the part of the prisoner, would not have anything to do with it, that he did not see why the prisoner should fight my battles—they did refuse to guarantee the costs—I think I gave the prisoner into custody a day or two after that, on Saturday, the 5th—if my costs had been guaranteed I could not say that I should have fought the action; that depended upon circumstances—if Blogg and Martin brought an action against me for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I expected the costs to be paid—I went over to the Continent to reside with my family—I was not at all pressed—the friends who had bills upon me, in consequence of a revolu<lb></lb>tion in South America, very kindly offered to renew them until the end of the revolution—I had bills to pay, but they were always taken up—the prisoner in his letters to me called my attention to bills to be met and so on—it was an object to gain time—when I went away I left the prisoner just sufficient money to pay postage, perhaps 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or something of that kind; I really can't remember—it was a small sum—it may have been 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he was to let me know how the business was going on, and what persons called—I left him to attend to the business—he was to manage and attend to it and let me know what was going forward from time to time—the business is foreign business—it did not consist of renewing bills; but goods sent out to foreign countries—they were to be obtained from a variety of persons, correspondents—he had nothing to do with that—there was no business going on at that time, merely receiving letters, answering them, and writing over to me according to my directions—he was not to open all the letters, only a certain portion, not any foreign letters, merely those he thought of no consequence—he was to open English letters now and then—he had no authority from me to open the letter sent by Blogg and Martin; he ought not to have opened it—he was not to open foreign letters, but certain English letters, according to his own judgment—I left it entirely to himself, either to open them or send them on to me—I do not complain of his opening that letter—I did not say anything to him about that—before I went to Boulogne I was living at Eastburnham Grove—I did not return there; I gave it up when I went to Boulogne—I took my family with me—when my wife returned she did not go back to our house; she went into lodgings—the house was let—the prisoner's salary was 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he commenced at 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and it was increased to 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the salary was paid regularly up to a certain period—on 16th October I remitted to him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for two weeks' salary—I have a memorandum of it in my cheque-book—I re<lb></lb>mitted it from Boulogne—there was nothing due to him at that time—I had my cheque book with me—I sent him a cheque out of which he was to retain 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there was not as much as 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due to him for money advanced and for wages—I had been away for ten weeks—I had sent him over various cheques—I do not remember sending him any other cheque for salary except the one for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but I think I did—I considered that on 16th October his salary was paid up to that date—the other eight weeks' salary had been paid previously to that—when he wanted money he had nothing to do but to write to me and say so—he did not write to me—I wrote over and asked him if he wished me to send him any money for his salary—he said it was of no consequence, and I sent him this cheque of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I don't think I had sent him any previous to 16th October—I left England on 11th September—up to 16th October I remitted him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I wrote to ask him to let me know if I owed him any money—I sent him over 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay into the bank; he did pay it in—he paid in 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of the</p>

Blogg and Martin, diamond merchants, in Bucklersbury—I have been in their employment nearly 17 years—I remember the transaction with reference to this 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—I first saw the prisoner upon the matter on 24th September, at the office of his employer, Mr. Logan, 1, Lime-street square—I presented the bill to him; it had been returned to us as the drawers, and we paid it—I gave a cheque for it myself—I asked the prisoner how it was that he allowed the bill to be returned; he said the bill had never been presented there—I told him it must have been presented through the bankers whose names were upon it, and likewise by the notary in the evening, as the ticket was attached to it—he still persisted that it had not been presented—I had the bill with me at the time with the notarial ticket attached, and presented it to him—I asked him if Mr. Logan had not, previous to his leaving, given him instruc<lb></lb>tions that the bill would be presented on the 23d September; and, likewise, whether Mr. Logan had not told him that he had received the whole amount, 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., from Blogg and Martin—his answer was that Mr. Logan had told him so previous to leaving—I then asked him how it was when he had only received 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that had been sent in error, that he did not come on at once to Blogg and Martin's to see how it was—he still said that the bill had not been presented; he gave no further reason—the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been sent to him on 23d September, the day before the bill was due—I then told the prisoner that, for Mr. Logan's honour, as there had been a mistake about the bill he had better go to the bankers and explain why it was that the bill had been returned, and that it was then taken up by us—I don't recollect his saying whether he would do so or not—I then said, as he had received the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. all he had to do was to hand me back that 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as I had now taken up the bill; in fact I had given 195<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 23d and 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 24th—the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I had sent him by a messenger the previous day—he replied that he could not do that, for he had paid the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into the Bank of England,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185911280018"></xptr>
               <p>but he would give me a cheque for it on the bank—he then took a cheque-book which was either lying before him or at the side of him, and he immediately wrote me a cheque signed, "Logan Brothers, per procuration, Henry Leach"—this is the cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he took the cheque book to do it, as if he was regularly authorised to sign it, and handed it to me—it is for 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., dated 24th September—immediately that he gave me that cheque I gave him the 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, which, of course, he was entitled to, handing him back at the same time the receipt which he had given on 23d to our messenger, Richard Watts, for the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I wrote at that moment under the receipt, "Returned the above 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., per procuration of Blogg and Martin. Thomas Stevenson"—this is a copy of it, which was afterwards taken in our office—this is the original—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "1, Lime-street Square, 23d September, 1859. Received of Messrs. Blogg and Martin 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of Logan, Brothers, per procuration. Henry Leach. Returned the above 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., per procuration of Blogg and Martin. Thomas Stevenson, 24th September, 1859")—that I wrote at the moment of receiving the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque—nothing further took place at that interview—I took the cheque to the Bank of England to present it for payment on my road to Bucklersbury—it was not paid; the cashier attached a ticket to it stating that it was incorrectly signed—as near as I can recollect it must have been about 12, or a little after 12, when I called at the bank—I immediately returned to Mr. Logan's office, but did not find the prisoner there—the door was closed, and there was a ticket on the door, "Return at 1 o'clock"—I returned again but did not find him; the same ticket was on the door; that was between 12 and 1 o'clock—I was waiting about half or three-quarters of an hour—I went again just before 1 o'clock and stayed until perhaps a quarter past 1, and the prisoner did not come there—when I went the last time I found him there; he had come in—no, I beg your pardon, he was not there then—I did not see him there again on the Saturday—the ticket was still there, "Return at 1 o'clock"—I did not see him again till the following Monday the 26th—he then came to our office; but I should mention that on the Saturday afternoon after I had been there the last time, which was about a quarter past 1, I came back to Mr. Martin and reported to him what I had done; and later in the afternoon I sent on a messenger twice to Mr. Logan's office, but I did not see the prisoner again at all on that Saturday—he came to our office about the middle of the day on Monday and I saw him—Richard Watts and Charles Cooke were present—Cooke is a clerk in the office—Watts brought the prisoner round to my desk and I said to him—"I suppose you come about the cheque" he said that he had been to the Bank of England and he found that his signature was not authorised at the bank—I then, conformably to instructions I had received from Mr. Martin, told him to send a crossed cheque over to Mr. Logan by that night's post, with a request that he should return it against the cheque which had been dishonoured at the bank; that he promised to do and then left—I retained the cheque in my possession, not having a value for it—it was a verbal message that I sent by Watts on the Saturday—I have seen the letter dated 25th October, written by the prisoner to Mr. Logan—I positively swear that I never had the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the prisoner, and he knows it as well as I do—the only 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I received was by the dishonoured cheque on the Bank of England—I never received it in gold, or money, or in other way, I most positively swear.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> After the cheque was dishonoured at the Bank as you say, you went back first and then went again, and waited till a few minutes past 1? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did; I did not go there again during that day—I said at first that I did, and saw Mr. Leach; that was a slip—I positively swear that I did not see the prisoner—I made that slip because the case is so complicated; this is the first time I have been in a witness-box, and the questions rather confuse me—I positively swear that I never saw the prisoner on the Saturday alter a quarter past I—on 25th October, the prisoner came to our office with Mr. Williams and an attorney of the name of Baugham—they asked to see Mr. Martin; I presume it was on the subject of the cheque—Mr. Martin was occupied at the time—I might have said, "You had better see me"—they asked to see Mr. Martin—I said he was engaged—I brought him out to them; at least I did not, one of our gentlemen did; I was occupied—Leach accused me in Mr. Martin's presence with having received the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—to the best of my belief his words were, "I paid Mr. Stevenson the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and I hold his receipt for it"—I have no recollection of his saying, "When I gave him the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I produced the receipt, and Stevenson wrote this on it at the time"—I said at that time that I had not seen him on the Saturday afternoon after the cheque was dishonoured—the message sent to him on the Saturday was a slip of paper put into the letter box to come on to Blogg and Martin, that there was something wrong about the cheque—he came on Monday by himself—when he came with Mr. Williams and the attorney, and the receipt was produced, I might perhaps in the excitement of the moment have said, "I will keep that"—but the words as far as my knowledge and belief goes, were, "We must have a copy of that"—to the best of my knowledge and belief I did not say, "I will keep that"—I will not swear I did not; I might have done so—I was excited by such a dastardly accusation made upon my character; if I did say so, that must be my excuse—Mr. Martin said, "I believe we had better have a copy," and a copy was given—I did not go to the prosecutor's office between 24th September and 20th October in quest of the prisoner—the first time I heard that the prisoner had said that he had paid me the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was on 25th October, when he came with Mr. Williams and the solicitor to accuse me before Mr. Martin—I had entered 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to be sent on instead of 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in our books originally.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you explain why it was, if this receipt was written at the time the cheque was given, that you put instead of "returned the cheque" or anything respecting the cheque, "returned the above 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was the mistake that has caused this accusation against me—had I said, "by cheque" upon the receipt, it never could have happened—I considered I was dealing with an honourable man—that refers to the cheque and to that alone, because I attached it simultaneously with receiving the cheque—it is very common not to put "by cheque" when you receive a cheque; a very common practice indeed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a messenger in the employment of Blogg and Martin—on 23d September, I went to Mr. Logan's office—I saw the prisoner and gave him 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it was in notes—I told him I had brought the money on for the bill, and he gave me a receipt; this is it—I brought it back to the office, and gave it to our Mr. Stevenson—on the following day, Saturday, Mr. Stevenson spoke to me somewhere about 1 o'clock, in the middle of the day—in consequence of what he said I went to Mr. Logan's office with a message—I did not see the prisoner—there was a ticket on the door, "Re<lb></lb>turn at 1 o'clock"—I went again that afternoon, but did not find him—I wrote on a slip of paper that he was to come on to our office, as there was some irregularity in the signing of the cheque, and I put that slip of paper into the letter-box—it was merely on a piece of envelope which I tore off—I think that was between 2 and 3 o'clock—I did not see the prisoner at all that Saturday—on the following Monday, the 26th, he came to Messrs. Blogg and Martin's—I took him round to Mr. Stevenson—I believe he merely said "Good morning" when he first came, and I took him round to Mr. Stevenson at once—that was in the counting-house—Mr. Cooke was sitting opposite—Mr. Stevenson requested the prisoner to send a cheque over to Mr. Logan for his signature, and to return it to us, as Mr. Leach had been to the Bank of England about the cheque, and his signature was not authorised—he said he would do so—nothing more took place—between that time and the latter end of October I was sent several times to Mr. Logan's office—I saw the prisoner on one occasion, and requested him to send the cheque over to Mr. Logan, and to return it to us, as we wished the affair settled, and he promised to do so—I think that was two or three days after the 26th—sometimes when I went he was there, and sometimes he was not—I went on afterwards to see if the cheque had been returned to him—I saw him several times—I asked him if he had received the cheque from Mr. Logan—he said, "No;" he had not heard from him; he was expecting to do so every day.</p>

               <p>gave the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Watts to take to the prisoner—the cheque for it was put for my signature—Stevenson frequently talked to me about this matter, from time to time, after 26th September—on 20th October he wrote a letter by my direction—I do not remember whether I signed it—we were told that Mr. Logan was to return to London a day later, and that letter was sent to meet him on his return to London, feeling that he had neglected to repay the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he ought to have done.</p>

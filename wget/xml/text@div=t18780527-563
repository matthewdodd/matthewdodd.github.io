I am the receiving nurse at the Westminster Union—I recollect the child Sarah Marsden being brought there—I afterwards recognised it as having been there in October, 1876, when it was five weeks old—it was then sent into the sick ward under Dr. Rogers's care, and was only under my care for a day or two—it has been in the work<lb></lb>house several times since that—I cannot give you the dates, but it had been there five times since November—it looked worse every time—it was there twice with its mother, and twice when the mother was locked up for being drunk—it seemed to be getting smaller and thinner every time—it was not clean the last time, there were vermin in its clothes and it was very wet—I remember giving it clothes on one occasion, and on the last occasion its clothes were washed, but it had no clothes given to it—I did not receive it when it was sent in the night, it was given to Mrs. Gunn—it was then remarkably thin and its backbone was almost protruding through the skin—its clothes were very wet and there were vermin in them—it was not raining at the time—I kept it till Monday and then Mrs. Gunn had the care of it—it took its food very ravenously at first, and then it fell away and seemed to be exhausted.</p>

I am medical officer to the Westminster Union—on the 22nd April I attended Sarah Marsden—I cannot recollect whether I had seen her before that—she was extremely emaciated, and I came to the conclusion that it was due to neglect—I weighed her on 30th April, and she only weighed 10 lb.—she had then been in the Union more than a week—I weighed her again on 6th May, and she weighed 12 lb. 15 oz.—the average weight of a child of that age is about 20 lb.—my attention was not drawn to her back—she improved for some weeks, and in a week afterwards increased another half a pound, but she contracted measles and sunk, and is now in a dying state—she had not power enough to throw off the poison—all the other children recovered; very few children die of measles—I have seen her this morning—the child's health was unquestionably in danger through the exposure in the street when the mother was lying about drunk—I gave directions that food was to be given very frequently, but in extremely small quantities, in conse<lb></lb>quence of the ravenous way in which it took its food.</p>

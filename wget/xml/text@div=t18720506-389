                  </hi>. I am barmaid at the King's Arms, Great College Street, Westminster—on 5th April, the prisoner and four or five other men and women came in for some half-and-half, they all drank out of the same pot,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187205060004"></xptr>
               <p>and then two of them had a pint of <hi rend="italic">cooper</hi> in another pot—the half-and-half came to 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the prisoner gave me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he then called for two of gin cold and put down a half-crown—he was in conversa<lb></lb>tion with me and I did not notice it, but put it into the till and gave him a florin and fourpence—I then went to my tea and left him in the bar—there was no other half-crown in the till—when I returned he was in another compartment, which is a dark passage—I served him there with a glass of ale and he put down a half-crown, I tried it, found it was bad and gave it to him back—he picked it up, put it in his pocket and gave me two penny pieces—I then went to the till and found that the other half-crown was bad; there was nothing else there but shillings and sixpences—I then asked him for the half-crown he had put in his pocket—he said he did not know what I meant—he had not taken anything up at all—I said that if he did not give it up I would send for a policeman—he then threw down a florin—I asked him for another sixpence and he rushed to the door—the potman stopped him and I gave him in charge—the barmaid said in his hearing "He gave me a half-crown while you were at tea" giving it to me—I saw him searched at the station, two bad half-crowns were found on him and he had the one in his hand which I had given him—I knew it by where I bit it.</p>

                  </hi>.

                  </hi>.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Are you positive she gave me change out of the till? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; you gave her the shilling after the prosecutor came—you did not make much attempt to escape, for I had you pretty tight—I did not see you in the other bar.</p>

I am potman at the King's Arms—I helped to detain the prisoner, and found these two half-crowns on the floor where he had been standing five or six minutes after he had gone—I ran after the police<lb></lb>man and handed them to him—I afterwards marked a "P" on each, by which I recognise them—one is whole and one broken.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I put down a Victoria half-crown, and the barmaid said "This is another bad half-crown, take it and be off about your busi<lb></lb>ness". I put it in my pocket and gave her the change. As to the other bar<lb></lb>maid, I never had anything of her at all; she said first that it was a Victoria half-crown, and now she says that it was not. A man that passes bad money would not be so foolish as to go in with a lot of bad half-crowns. Being vexed at finding she had another bad one in the till she says that I gave it to her, not wishing her master and mistress to know it. There were plenty of people in the house, and it is very hard to put it upon me.</p>

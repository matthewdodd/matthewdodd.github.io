                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 412). On 28th July I was on duty on Dowgate-hill, and heard a noise at some new buildings—I looked over, and saw the prisoner putting on his shoes—I watched him, and saw him tying up some brushes and other things in a bundle—he then came over the hoarding, and I asked him where he brought them from—he said that he had come from Ireland, and had gone there to sleep, and the things were there loose—I took him to the station—the bundle contained four knives, three forks, one towel, one pair of slippers, one coat, one waistcoat, and three brooches—I afterwards examined, and found the window of Dyers' Hall broken open, a pane of glass taken out, and the sergeant got in—there were some footmarks.</p>

                  </hi>. I am beadle to the Wardens and Commonalty of the Mystery of Dyers, at Dyers' Hall. I and my family sleep on the premises—on the night this happened, I fastened up the premises myself, and went to bed at 10 o'clock—the window in question was fastened—I was rung up shortly after 4 o'clock, and found the sash thrown halfway up—the person had got through a very large square of glass, which had been taken out—I could have got through myself—part of these articles belong to the Company, and part to their clerk—they were all safe, in eight or ten different rooms, which he must have been into.</p>

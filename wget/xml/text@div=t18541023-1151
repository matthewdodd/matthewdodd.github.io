                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Griffiths, of Charles-street. On 12th Sept., I was at the end of Holborn—I had a pocket in my dress—I found my dress being held up with one hand, and the prisoner's hand in my pocket—I turned, and he drew his hand out—I said, "You little thief, you had your hand in my pocket"—I tapped him, and he ran away—I put my hand in my pocket, and missed my purse, which had contained a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.-<hi rend="italic">bit</hi> and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I told a policeman—I am sure the prisoner is the boy—I watched him across the road.</p>

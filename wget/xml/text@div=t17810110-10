               <p>Had you any care of these bottles? - No. He told me a man had been taken up with a hamper on his back that was supposed to be taken out of our hall and was in a stable yard behind the house. I went to the place and saw the prisoner with a number of people about him who had stopped him; the hamper had been taken from him; it contained twenty four empty bottles. I knew the hamper to belong to us by a parchment direction on it to John Beach, Esq. Hackney, who is one of the partners of the house. I went to Mr. Plummer, and one of the clerks went with the prisoner to the compting-house while I went to Mr. Plummer who was out.</p>

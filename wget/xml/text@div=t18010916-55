            , but could not find any such person; I put up at the Bell, and while I was standing at the bar, I saw the prisoner go past with a gentleman; I called to him, and he did not answer me; I tapped him on the shoulder, and said, how do you do; he said, I don't know you, sir; says I, don't you recollect selling me a horse last Friday, in Smithfield; oh, yes, he said, I do, but I did not recollect you at first; says he, I am busy now, if you will step into the Bell for half an hour, and call for what you like, I will come to you; I went to the Bell, and staid there three hours and a half, but he never came, and then I went away; I saw no more of him till he was apprehended; I sold the horse to Mr. Gregson the Monday week after I had bought it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You had the good luck to sell this horse, which you bought at 7l. for 22l. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You expressed a doubt, at the time you bought the horse, whether the horse was found? - A. Yes; and so did Mr. Gregson, when he bought it.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore I take it, it was for that reason you desired him to write his name in the book, in case it should turn out unfound, if any thing was the matter with it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your house, I believe, is in Smithfield Market? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not toll it? - A. No, it was not bought in the Market.</p>
               <p>Q. This was on the Market-day? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The man at first did not agree with you, and he went out into the open Market with the horse?- A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.So that any body might have observed him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And was absent some little time, before he returned and agreed with you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In the place where you saw him on the 2d of August, he was very well known? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you mentioned to him that he was the person you bought a horse of, he did not attempt to deny it, but mentioned it in the presence of the gentleman he was with? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. (To Elphick). Q. Where does the prisoner live? - A.Just in Hampton, not above two hundred yards from my lodge.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am assistant to a Sheriff's officer; I was at Smithfield on a Friday, and I think it was the 26th of June, with a person of the name of Randall; I saw the prisoner, and another man, with a lame man, come into St. Bartholomew Coffee-house; the other man sold the prisoner a horse for six guineas and a half; I saw the money paid in Bank notes and money; they had agreed for the horse before they came in; I saw the horse afterwards; it was a dark brown gelding.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom was the money paid? - A.It was not paid to the lame man, but the other man; after the man had paid for it, several people said it was lame, and the prisoner said, let him be lame or blind, I have paid for him, and I suppose I must have him.</p>

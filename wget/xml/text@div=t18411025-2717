                  </hi>. The prisoner was working for me at the houses in the Circus—I missed some goods—I spoke to the prisoner about it—he said he knew nothing whatever about it—Leatherdale was my fore-man—I went to the prisoner's house, and found two boxes which had been manufactured in the building, and blackened over with lampblack, to disfigure them, and earned to his place, and some wood besides—the boxes were buried in his room, and so covered that we had a hard matter to find them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer. I was at work on the prosecutor's premises about the 12th of October—I saw the prisoner make these two boxes in Mr. Franks's buildings—he used for them the wood used in the building—I saw him afterwards black them with lampblack.</p>

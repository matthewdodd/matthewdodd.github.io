               <p>I know the prisoner Noah: on the 31st of December my son came to me at Tom's coffee-house, Cornhill, and said Noah wanted to speak with me at 'Change; I did not go directly, as it was post-day; in about half an hour after Noah came to me at 'Change and said, I was looking for you, that I might give you a commission; here is a foreigner who has got a prize in the lottery of 2000 l. you may sell it as well as another, and get the commission; I asked him if he knew the man; he said it was a man who lodged with his brother, and had come from the Hague; that he was a reputable man, of reputable parents; and he had received money lately from Messrs. Norden; I said, it is post-day, I will apply to Mr. Keyser, and divide the commission with him; Noah said, he had no objection; I went to Mr. Keyser and told him the story; Mr. Keyser desired I would bring the man to the office, that he might have the ticket checked; I then went back to the 'Change to Noah, and told him to call at my house to go with me to Keyser at 4 o'clock; Noah came alone; I asked Noah where the foreigner was; he told me he was gone to the play; for a man who had got a prize of 2000 l. might enjoy himself for once, and go to the play: the business was agreed to be deferred till the next morning; the same evening between 6 and 7 o'clock I was called by my son, who said that Noah was at my house with another gentleman, and had left word he was gone to the Nag's-head; I found both the prisoners there; Noah said, there is the man who has the ticket; Arones took the ticket out of his pocket and shewed it to me: I thought it a good ticket; I desired them to go with me to Mr. Keyser's office to sell it; I gave him the ticket back again, as Arones would not trust me with it; then all three went to Keyser's office, and from thence we all four went to the York coffee-house; Keyser in a little room asked after the ticket; Arones shewed it to him; Keyser took down the number, and he and I went to his office and examined it, and found that it was drawn a prize of 2000 l. on the third day of the drawing of the lottery; Mr. Keyser likewise examined it at other offices; I went back to the New York coffee-house and told the prisoner it was a good ticket, but it must first be checked at the exchequer; Mr. Keyser looked at his watch and said, it was too late to have it checked that evening; Mr. Keyser desired, that for safety he would lodge it in a banker's hand for fear of fire or thieves, which Arones refused, saying, he would not trust it with his own father without the money; upon which Mr. Keyser told him he would give him 400 l. that evening, that then he might lodge it in a banker's hand, and they might put their seals upon it till it was examined or sold, and he should have the remainder of the money; to which he gave<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177702190043"></xptr> no direct answer; I told Keyser he had better let it alone till it was examined; they then went home, and I appointed them to come to my house the next day, in order to go to Whitehall and have it checked, and so we parted; he did not come at the time the next morning; I left word where I should be; I went to Mr. Keyser's office; but he had not been there, then I went to Tom's coffee-house and met at the corner of Sweeting's alley the prisoners coming to the office; I asked Arones why he did not come at the appointed time; Arones said he had some business to do; Noah took me aside, and said, Arones had been at Whitehall and had had the ticket checked; I told Mr. Keyser that the man had already had the ticket checked, and that it would save time; I asked Arones for the ticket to sell it; I observed on the ticket no mark of its having been checked; Arones said he had only had it examined, as he had not two guineas in his pocket to pay for checking it; I told Arones he had no occasion to have paid 6 d. as it might have been examined for a penny in the city; Mr. Keyser said, he was informed he could sell it as it was, and desired the man to give him the ticket, and he would get the money for it at the stock exchange; Arones refused to give the ticket without having the money for it; upon which Mr. Keyser ran out of the coffee-house, and in the mean time I asked Arones for the ticket, but he refused to give it me; then Noah took Arones aside, and, I surmise, told him I was to be trusted; upon which Arones called me and gave me the ticket; I threw it down and would not accept of it, being angry that he distrusted me; I said, let Noah go with me and see that I don't run away; I gave the ticket to Mr. Keyser, and he went with it to the stock exchange; Mr. Keyser came out of the stock exchange whilst I was standing with Noah and said, he thought there was a forgery in the ticket, and so he should go to Guildhall and have it examined; then Mr. Keyser and I went to Guildhall, and there it was found out to be a forgery; I then returned with a constable to have the two people apprehended; I found Noah where I left him; I asked where Arones was, to give him the money for the ticket? Noah said, he could not tell where he was, but he would go and look for him; but he did not find him; and so I delivered Noah up to the constable; Noah never had the possession of the ticket; Noah always said it belonged to Arones; Mr. Keyser said in the presence of Noah that he thought it was a forgery; he spoke in Dutch.</p>

             called at my office and asked me whether I could dispose of a 2000 l. prize; I told him I made a distinction between a 2000 l. prize, and one of less value; that I must know who the proprietor of the ticket was; in consequence of that I afterwards saw the two prisoners in the evening at my office; the office being small and very full at that time, I desired them to walk with me into the New York coffee-house; we went into a little room, there Mr. Levy told the prisoner Arones to deliver the ticket into my hands, that I was the person who was to dispose of it; Arones delivered the ticket into my hands; I took down the number and examined it at my own, and other offices, and found that number had been drawn a prize of 2000 l. the third day of drawing; I told him as he was a stranger he should have the ticket checked before I sold it, and advised him to lock up the ticket for fear of fire or any other accident; he said he would not trust the ticket out of his hands; I told him if he was afraid of that I would let him have 3 or 400 l. if he would lock it up at my banker's till the next morning, and I would then go with him to have it checked, and would dispose of it; Arones made no answer; but Levy gave me a hint not to give the money; the next morning Levy came alone and told me, he had waited some time and the persons were not come; I went into the stock exchange as usual, and told one of the dealers in prizes that I expected a 2000 l. prize to sell, and offered to sell it to him; he told me he had purchased as many as he chose; I told him I would have it checked; he said there is no occasion to check it, if you indorse your name to it, and we see it in the commissioner's list, that is sufficient: Mr. Levy had me called out of the coffee-house and told me they were come with the ticket; I went into the New York coffee-house; I understood Arones had been at the exchequer to examine the ticket, but not to have it checked, for he had not two guineas in his pocket to pay for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177702190044"></xptr> the expence of checking it; that I learned from Arones; when a ticket is checked the commissioners write upon the back,</p>
               <p>"this ticket</p>
               <p>"has been checked with the counter-part, and</p>
               <p>"is a 2000 l. prize;" the price paid for checking is generally a guinea a thousand; I then told them that I could sell the ticket without being checked, but he would not deliver the ticket into my hands; upon which I left them all at the coffee-house and went about my business to the stock exchange; I was soon after called out of the stock exchange by Levy, who delivered me the ticket; I told them it was very odd that they would not trust me with the ticket; I told Levy to tell the persons to stand at the stock exchange door till I came out with the money for it; this is the ticket (inspecting it) there was my indorsement upon it, which I erased; I went with the ticket to the stock exchange and offered it to sale; a person to whom I had promised the preference of it, came into the coffee-house, several persons bid for it; at last I sold it to the person who first offered for it at 79 5/8 per cent. I then mentioned that I would have had it checked; but they told me there was no occasion for it; the person said, No, only put your name to it, and call for the prize list; we found it a prize of 2000 l. in the seventh column of the list of the third day's drawing; I indorsed the ticket as is usual when we sell a ticket, if it is even a 20 l. prize, that the person that purchases it may know from whom it came; I make myself liable by that indorsement, as I imagine that is the purpose f or which it is required; it is always understood so between us the same as if I sell a ticket during the drawing as un-drawn, I endorse it, and am answerable in case it should have been drawn; and so in this case I apprehend I should have been called upon to pay the money when I had signed my name; Mr. Shewell came into the box and said, Mr. Keyser, what have you sold this ticket for and to whom? I told him I had sold it to Mr. Bower at 79 5/8; he desired me to shew him the ticket, for he recollected something of the number; I shewed him the ticket; he said 25590, I believe I have purchased a prize of the same number which was indorsed, and says he, I think I know the person who has got it now, for I sold it again; he desired me to go to my office and examine whether 25590 was not the first 2000 l. prize drawn in that lottery; I held the ticket in my hand at the stock exchange door; one of the brokers overlooked me and said, don't be frightened, Keyser, your ticket is a very good one; they advised me to go to Guildhall to have it checked; I came to the door and saw Mr. Levy, and laid hold of his arm; Sir, said I, I am afraid there is something wrong in this ticket, and desired him to go with me to Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Was Noah by at that time? - I cannot recollect; I went to Guildhall, but stopt at the musick shop under the Piazzas at the Royal Exchange, and erased my indorsement; I indorsed it, 'sold for a 2000 l. prize, E. J. Keyser.' I went with Mr. Levy into the Irish Chamber at Guildhall, where I knew some of the commissioners, or somebody belonging to the lottery, where I desired Mr. Johnson to check the ticket; Mr. Johnson accordingly fetched up the file with the counter-parts of the tickets, but found it would not check; while we were there, Mr. Bower, who was to have purchased it, came into the Irish Chamber and said, that there certainly were two tickets of one number, for he had seen another ticket of that number in the hands of Mr. Shewell; upon which Mr. Johnson and one of the commissioners, Mr. Levy, and myself, with one of the marshal's men, went in search of the prisoners; we went to Sweeting's-alley, I left the prisoners there, and bid them wait till I brought the money; I desired Mr. Johnson and the commissioners to stand at a distance, and I would see whether I could find the prisoners; I saw Noah, I asked him where the foreigner was, for I had got the money for him; he said he was somewhere about, he could not tell where, but he would look into the New York Coffee-house for him; upon that I beckoned Mr. Johnson and the commissioner, with the marshal's man, to follow me into the coffee-house, and there we apprehended Noah.</p>

               <p>I am secretary to the commissioners of the lottery: this forged ticket was brought to me at Guildhall by Levy and Keyser on the first of January, just in the same state as it is now; Mr. Keyser desired me to check it; I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177702190045"></xptr> down upon the Hustings to get the file of prizes; on referring to the counter-part, I found it would not check, it appeared to me to be an upper ticket, that is, a ticket higher in the check, and the last figure must have been a one or a six; I could not then find the check it belonged to, but afterwards I found out a check it fitted; it must have originally been No 25536, which was drawn a blank; I am sure it is not No 25590, which it purports to be (Mr. - produces the genuine ticket of 25590).</p>
               <p>Mr. JOHNSON. This ticket matches the check exactly, the other does not; I went to the New York coffee-house; we apprehended Noah and brought him back; at first Noah seemed surprized; he told me that Arones told him he had found it; this was prior to his examination before the Lord Mayor: Noah gave some information by which Arones was apprehended.</p>

               <p>I am a clerk in the lottery-office; I make all the figures of the book, of tickets, and the tickets; the two last figures the nine and the cypher in this ticket are not my making, nor the two bars over and under the cypher.</p>

               <p>ARONES. I leave my defence to my counsel.</p>
               <p>NOAH's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Arones came to me with that ticket; he said he found it; when I was upon 'Change it was a full 'Change; I told Levy, the first time, that there was a foreigner who had found a ticket worth 2000 l.; upon which Levy said, that he would apply to Mr. Keyser, who was in the lottery-office way, and let me know if he would buy it, and Mr. Levy denied me to call at his house in the evening for an answer, and bid me bring the foreigner with me; Arones applied to me on the Monday evening with the ticket; I went to Levy about it on Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Court to LEVY. When Noah came to you upon 'Change upon the 31st of December did he tell you a foreigner had found a ticket? - No, he did not; if he had, I should have had nothing to do with it; he told me he had enquired Arones's character, and he was a reputable man.</p>
               <p>FOR ARONES.</p>

               <p>On the 30th of December, as I was going through Bishopsgate-street, on the left side of the way, I perceived Mr. Muller; I crossed over the way, and asked him how he did; he was in company with Arones; after we had walked a little way, I perceived Arones stoop; I turned my eye and saw him take a piece of paper off the ground; it was a smallish piece of paper, folded; he opened the paper in my presence; Mr. Muller spoke to him in a language that I did not understand; I asked Muller what the gentleman had found; he opened it, and said, it is a lottery ticket; he gave it in my hand; I looked at the number; I saw wrote Lottery, Anno 1776: Muller took out a memorandum book, and upon a slip of paper he made a memorandum of the number; after<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177702190047"></xptr> he had so done, when we got nearly opposite to Bishopsgate Church, I parted from them both; I was going to take a walk; I never saw any more of either parties, or heard of them, till the 11th of January; when I got home, I was informed that a gentleman, Mr. Muller, wanted to see me upon particular business: he left word it was concerning a foreign gentleman that was in company with him the day I met him, and that it was concerning a ticket that he found upon the pavement; I did not see Muller, not being on the twelfth of January at home: upon the Sunday following Mr. Muller called upon me, and told me the nature of the affair, and asked me if I would go along with him to see the prisoner; Mr. Muller dined with me that day, we both went to Newgate to see the prisoner; I saw him in the wine room.</p>
               <p>Was it the same man you saw pick up the ticket? - The very identical man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am housemaid to the Rev. Edward Jones, who lives at the Rectory, Lambeth—on 13th May, I saw the plate basket, containing a quantity of plate, safe at half-past 6 in the evening, in the housemaid's pantry in a closet—there were 49 pieces altogether in it, forks and spoons—I left the pantry—I might have gone into it again, but I did not miss the plate till about 9 o'clock, when I looked in the basket, and it was all gone—there is an area, but no gate to it—any one can come down to the kitchen door—I do not know that it had been open that evening; it is generally kept locked—I looked and saw that the doors appeared all fast, but other people might have gone out—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the property.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, H</hi> 194). On the night of 30th May, I was in the Whitechapel-road, two or two and a half miles from the prose<lb></lb>cutor's house, and saw the prisoner with another man who was walking in front, on the look-out—something attracted my attention—I stopped the prisoner and asked him what he had got in his pocket—he said, "I have got nothing"—I said" You have got something there, let me see what it is"—another constable came up and pulled away his hand—I then put my hand in his pocket and pulled out these spoons and forks—I asked him how he accounted for them; he said a man had given him them—I asked him who the man was; he said he did not know—I asked him where the man lived; he said he should not tell me—he then said a man gave them to him in Club-road—he afterwards stated that it was in Plummer's-road.</p>

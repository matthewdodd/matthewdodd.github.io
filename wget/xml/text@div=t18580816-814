                  </hi>. I am a labourer at Woolwich-arsenal, and live at Powis-street. Woolwich—at 10 o'clock on Saturday morning, 24th July, the prisoner Martin met me in Powis-street, and asked me if I wanted to buy a "Miltoc"—I asked him what that was; he said a dress—he took me to where he and Hathaway lodged, and I then saw Hathaway and the dress—Martin said to me," Do you want to buy the dress?" I said, "How much?"—he said, "5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." I said, "All the money I have got is 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., if you like to take that you can"—I was going away when Hathaway called me back and said, "We will not take less than 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I said all the money I had got was 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and then he said I could have it, and he gave me a little slop in—I paid the money, and took the dress home and gave it to my wife to pawn over the hill; that was at 4 o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Hathaway.</hi> He said he was out at 3 o'clock in the morning.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I was not; I was at borne—I got up at a quarter before 8—the work begins at 9 o'clock—I was going to my work when I met the prisoner—I had been down home and had had my breakfast—I was not out before breakfast; I only just went up to the top of the street: that was before I met Martin—I came up the street 2 minutes before 8, and went down at the quarter and had my breakfast—that was the very day I got to the arsenal</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-constable, R</hi> 301). I was at a pawnbroker's-shop in Woolwich at half-past 5 on the evening of the 24th July—I saw the last witness's wife there with the dress now produced—I took it from her and took her into custody—from information I received from her husband, who came up about 10 minutes after, I took the prisoners into custody—they denied all knowledge of the dress.</p>

                  </hi>. I have three partners—Thomas Longman is one—we live in Paternoster-row—I have every reason to believe this book is our property—on the 22nd of Sept., I ordered two out often of these books, which we had, to be marked—between the 22nd and 29th two of them were sold, one went to Bristol and the other to Liverpool—when this book was found in the prisoner's house, we had only seven left, therefore one was missing—I have got the one from Bristol back again—that is marked, and the one found at the prisoner's is marked.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the prosecutor's employ. On the 22nd of Sept. we had ten books of "Lalla Rookh"—I marked two of them—when the prisoner was apprehended, we had only seven of them in our stock, which were all unmarked—one of the marked ones had been sold to a person at Bris<lb></lb>tol—this is that identical copy.</p>

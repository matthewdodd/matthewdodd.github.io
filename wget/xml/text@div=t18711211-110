                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Hasleham Leake, tobacconist, of 4, Ckuroh Street, Lambeth—on Tuesday evening, 21st No<lb></lb>vember, between 5.30 and 5.45, the prisoner came for a 1/2 oz. of common shag tobacco—I served him, it came to 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. he gave me a florin, I saw it was bad, and told him so—he said he did not know where he got it, he sup<lb></lb>posed he got it at the market in the morning; that he was a respectable man, and worked at Shepherd's, the greengrocer, in the Walk, but he had not been there that week—I put the florin on the counter—my husband came in and took it up, and gave him in custody with the florin.</p>

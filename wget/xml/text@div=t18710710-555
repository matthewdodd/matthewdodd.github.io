I am clerk to Mr. Wood, of 15, King William Street, Strand, a watchmaker—on the morning of 8th May, I saw Elliott about 8.30, leaning against a post at the end of King William Street, opposite the Ophthalmic Hospital—I saw him after that, at 8.45—he had a boy with him then—I cannot swear to the boy, but I have no doubt about the man—he was standing at the door, and the boy was drawing a piece of paper from under the door of 20, King William Street—he then took it up by the four corners, put it under his coat, and they walked away together—Elliott was standing by the boy's side, watching—I picked out the man from eight or ten others—I identified the boy from five or six others at the Guildhall.</p>

I am a publisher, at 20, King William Street—the method of receiving letters was in a box, but the box would not hold them all at times, and it was very often forced open in consequence of the over-crowding of letters, and we allowed the letters to fall on the floor—we had had complaints from customers about the crowding, and we removed the box, and letters fell on the floor—we put up another box on the Monday, three days previous to this—I am sure that new box was there the day before this occurrence—on 18th May, the box had been separated from its holder by a piece of wood or strong instrument, from the outside—I received twelve letters that morning—I counted them—there is a space under my door of about half an inch—I had seen the prisoners three mornings pre<lb></lb>viously—I watched from the drawing-room for three different mornings—one morning I saw a boy trying with a stick—I can swear to the boy at different times trying to get the letters with a stick—I have seen both prisoners together—I picked the man out from several others at Guildhall.</p>

               <p>Q. You are a single woman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time lose any property? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You occupy the whole house? - Yes, we lost a tea-spoon and other things out of the house before this robbery; but we did not suspect this woman.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this committed? - On the 12th of March on the night I went to bed the money was in the beaufet, thirteen guineas in a caddy in a silk purse with gold tassels, and two bank notes of ten pounds each, and a silver thimble in a little box on the side board. I see her using it the night before though she did not ask me to use it, it was not my own, but a person lent it me, I was answerable for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner your servant? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she been your servant? - She had been my servant rather better then five months.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know by whom this property was taken? - I am confident it was taken by her and nobody else.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any of it ever found afterwards? - No; we never got any of it. There was nobody up in the house when she quitted it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in the house the night before, when you went to bed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That was on the 11th? - Yes, and on 
the 18th she robbed me.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160077"></xptr>Q. Had she taken her clothes with her? - No, she left some part of her clothes in the room where she slept, and some in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she taken any of her things away? - Yes, as near as I can guess, she had taken away a couple of gowns, and what she had on her back besides.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get up in the morning? - I did not get up very early, because I was very unwell.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see her again? - Never till the constable took her; she robbed me on the 12th, and he took her on the Tuesday following.</p>
               <p>Q. The time of her service was not expired when she went? - No, I hired her weekly, and paid her weekly, and agreed with her for a week's warning; and the Monday before her week was up, I had not silver to pay her, and when I had not silver to pay her, I used to let it go for a fortnight, that time her week's wages was not paid.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when she was taken? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when any search was made? - Not when the first search was made; afterwards I searched her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing found on that search? - Nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. What does your family consist of? - There are two lodgers, one person in the first floor, who had her own servant to sleep with her, and the witness Sarah Willis in the second floor, but neither of them were up when she left the house.</p>

               <p>Q. You lodge in Mrs. Capelen's house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you lodged there before the 12th of March? - Four months; the prisoner came into my room early on the morning of the 12th, about half after seven.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in bed? - Yes. She asked me the hour; I told her I did not know, she might come to my bed side and look at my watch; she then made answer to me, and said it was half after seven, I told her she had taken care to get up early enough.</p>
               <p>Q. What had been the usual time of getting up? - A little before eight, or eight. There was a woman coming to me in the morning, and she asked me if that woman was to come up to me? I told her, yes; and when that woman came, she came up with her, and went down stairs again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the woman that she brought up stay all the time in your room? - Yes, she then told me that she was obliged to go Mrs. Hatter's for her mistress before nine o'clock to fetch the clothes home that she had given her, I told her then she must go immediately, for it was twenty minutes after eight then, she then asked me if I please to want any thing brought in? I told her no, and I never saw the prisoner again till she was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you up that morning before Mrs. Capelen, or after? - Before.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you up before or after the other lodgers? - I was up first, the maid was up before me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go down stairs soon after you got up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In what condition did you find the doors? - I found them all shut.</p>
               <p>Q. Locked and bolted as usual? - No, I found the street door unbolted.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing more of this business? - No, only I lost my cloak.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find it again? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the prisoner at the bar was taken? - No, not when she was first taken; I was there when we stripped her, and did not find any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it took her? - The runners, in Sussex.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160078"></xptr>Q. To Prosecutrix. Had you ordered her that morning to go to Mrs. Hatter's? - No; it was two handkerchiefs that she gave Mrs. Hatter the night before to clear starch, and she could not have done them by that morning, and I had desired her never to go out, or leave the house when I was out or in bed, on no account.</p>
               <p>Mrs. HATTER sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. How far do you live from Mrs. Capelen? - Not far.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 12th of March, did the prisoner come to you in the morning? - No, sir, she did not; I see her at half past ten the night before, when I fetched the handkerchief that she said she was come to fetch; I know nothing more than that she lodged with me; and she said it would serve her mistress right to rob her; she had been with her once and went away, and went back, in the mean time she lodged with me.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the very words? - She said, that she wished some body would rob her, that she had a great deal of money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you remonstrate with her on this conduct? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Mrs. Capelen of this? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where the woman came from? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I live with Mrs. Adsley, No. 15, Steven-street; she used to receive company, and used to go to the play every night; there were two other lodgers in the house, which used to see different company all hours in the night, she came from the play the night before.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Willis. Had any strangers been in the house that evening? - There had not been a man in the house that evening, no stranger, I am certain of it.</p>

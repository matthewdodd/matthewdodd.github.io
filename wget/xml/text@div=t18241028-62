The prisoner was in my employ, and entrusted to receive money on my account. On the 2d of October, I sent him with a cask of spruce beer to Mr. Ransom, with a bill and receipt - he said Mr. Ransom had not paid him. I sent him on the 4th with another cask, he returned and said he had not paid him; each cask came to 19 s. On the Thursday he was going that way, and I told him to take Ransom's bill, but he absconded, and next day wrote me a letter, which I produce; it is in his writing; before that he had denied receiving the money; he owes me about two pounds.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Is this your letter - (producing one). - A. This is the answer I sent.</p>
               <p>The letters were here read: - that from the prisoner stated that he had been robbed of the money, and stated an account, by which he made 19 s. 11 d. due to the prosecutor. The prosecutor's letter desired the prisoner to call at half-past ten o'clock, and if he could satisfy him of his having been robbed he should not proceed, but if not he should advertise him.</p>

On my return home my master was gone to bed - a person took me to the King of Denmark public-house, in the Old-Bailey, to get a bed; there was a crowd round the door - the man told me to push through them, and when I got in, he was gone with my money, except 3 s. 6 d. I went home in the afternoon and told my master I had had my pocket picked; but did not say it was his money.</p>

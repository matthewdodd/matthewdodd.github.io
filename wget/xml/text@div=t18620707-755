                  </hi>. I am a leather seller of 30, North-Street, Chelsea—on June 30th, between 1 and 2 in the morning, I was called up by hearing my door-bell ring—I went to the door—I saw the two prisoners run down a court next to my door—the female prisoners ran into a doorway at the end of the court; the other prisoner ran into a wash-house—when I saw where they went to, I turned back, knowing there was no other entrance, and went to the top of the court—I called a policeman, and took him down to the end of the court—as I turned to look for the policeman the male prisoner shifted his place from the wash-house to the closet—they are both in one yard—we found Hooper there in the privy and these boot-tops with him (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are all my own hand making—I know my own work—they were safe on my premises the night before—I had shut up my premises safely—they were properly fastened—there was a bell to the door, but the could be opened without ringing it if it were opened carefully—Eager was at the end of the court—Hooper did not give my account of himself</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186207070062"></xptr>
               <p>when we found him—the policeman took the boot-tops out of the hole—I said, "They are my boot-tops," and gave the prisoner into custody—after<lb></lb>wards the policeman and I came from the station to look for the woman—about 6 o'clock in the morning I got the landlord to knock at the door and ask to see the landlady of the room—the door was opened by the female prisoner—she was up and dressed—I ordered the policeman to take her into custody, and charged her with being in connexion with the man is stealing my property—she said she could prove she was in bed at 12 o'clock, and said, "You did not find any leather in my room"—it was not two minutes from the time I saw the man run into the wash-house until the female prisoner was taken—nobody else had gone up the court in the meantime.</p>

Q.</hi> Where do you say Hooper was found? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the water-closet—he did not say that he her knew nothing about the boot-tope, and never put them there—the front door of my house was locked—I cannot tell how many people live in the house; I have only got the shop, parlour, and back-kitchen—I should say there are eight or ten people living there—they come in and go out through a door up the court which is close to my door—they do not go in and out of my shop; nobody does but myself and customers—they cannot go that way if they like—they might come without my knowing it, but I always fasten the back door as well as the front when I have done business—the back-door was not disturbed that night—they cannot unlock that door from the inside of the house—they might get through when I was asleep if they made no noise and took off the look—one part of the house is excluded altogether from the other—it was about half-past 10 when I closed my door—I always make it a practice, as soon as I shut up to lock the door—I have been once roused up by the policeman because the door was open—I will swear I was not roused the next night because the door was then open—I think the one occasion was about six months before this—I have never expressed any doubts whatever as to my having fastened the door.</p>

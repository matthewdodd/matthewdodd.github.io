                  </hi>. I am salesman to Mr. Wells, of 35, Seething Lane—either at the end of June or the beginning of July I met the prisoner—I knew him before, but had had no transactions with him—he said that he was a buyer of tea at a certain price—I communicated with Mr. Wells, and subsequently some samples were sent to the prisoner—he asked for a sampling order—he afterwards said "I have sampled those teas they are very fair, and I will take 20 chests"—the price was 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this invoice was sent to him—the terms were a two months' acceptance from 7th July—after I had got that I handed him these two warrants on the same day (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and also this delivery order for three chests of tea—that made twenty-one cases of tea altogether—he having bought twenty chests I required one chest to be returned, and he gave me an order for it—the delivery order for three chests was a sub-order upon this warrant for six—before the three chests could be delivered it was necessary to deposit this warrant (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) at the wharf—this is the bill he gave me:—"London, 7 July, 1875. Two months after date pay to our order 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for goods removed. <hi rend="smallCaps">FOXTON, WELLS</hi> Co. <hi rend="smallCaps">TO JOHN WESTWOOD</hi> Co., 3, Mincing Lane.

It will be provided for"—I communicated that to my princi<lb></lb>pals, and when I saw the prisoner again I asked him to hand me back the warrants—he said that they were fast at the Bank—on 10th September I presented the acceptance at Martin's Bank, and it was returned marked "N.

               <p>and be asked me for samples; but I did not offer them to him—I may have given him some—I did not press these very teas upon him—I called on him perhaps half a dozen times—that may have been to ask for orders—when I met him on September 8th I knew that his petition had been filed—I do not know that at that time he was unaware of the position of Hebden Westwood—he did not tell me so, but I saw it in the paper—I think he said something about having ascertained what his position had been with reference to Mr. Hebden—after I saw the bankruptcy published I pressed him on my own responsibility to obtain a guarrantee from some friend to pay this money, and told him that if he did not do so it would be very awkward for him.</p>

I am one of the firm of Foxton, Wells Co., tea dealers, of 35, Seething Lane—Perks is our traveller—about the end of June he communicated to us a proposition by the prisoner to purchase tea, and on 5th July the purchase was effected and we drew a bill on him at two months for the amount, which he accepted, and we authorised the delivery of the warrants to him and also the delivery order—the bill was dishonoured, and the prisoner became bankrupt in September—I applied at the Mansion House immediately, without making suggestions for a compromise—I did not instruct anyone to compromise with the prisoner.</p>

            . On the 15th of March there was a ring at his door about a quarter-past nine o'clock - I went, and and saw the prisoner there - I am certain of his person - he asked to see the cook - I left him in the passage while I went half way down the stairs to call the cook - I heard a walking in the passage, returned, and saw him just leav the street-door, which I had shut; I followed, and called Stop thief! in the course of the pursuit I saw him drop two hats; he was taken by the watchman; I took up the hats; they were the property of Sir Francis Molyneux Ommanney and Mr. Frederick Woods Ommanney - I took them back to the house - he was taken to the watch-house - I had lost sight of him while he turned the corner, but I have no doubt of his person; I believe my master's sons were both at home that evening - the usual place for putting hats is in the hall, but I cannot swear that these were there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the prisoner a stranger to you? A. Yes; he had but just got from the door when I returned from the kitchen stairs; I saw him drop the hats.</p>

            . I am a Custom-house officer. I was stationed on board the brig Allies, lying in the river; between eleven and twelve o'clock, on the night of the 31st of August, the barge Jane, which had this coffee on board, struck the Allies, and remained athwart the bows till morning; I saw the prisoner and another person in that barge, while I was walking the deck; they had some conversation about some beer - the other one said he should like some, but he was close hawled and they had better finish - the other said, "I think it is as well;" they then walked the gunwale of the barge - the other person opened the cabin door - the prisoner then got to the bottom of the barge; I am not sure whether he went through the cabin - I went to the other side of the vessel to observe their motions more particularly; there was a hole of six or eight inches square through which I could look at them; the prisoner then produced some bags from under his jacket, which he adjusted over his knee - he then went under the tarpauling, and I heard the running of something which appeared to be coffee or pepper; it was then about a quarter to twelve o'clock - at twelve o'clock I called up

            , my partner, to release me - and we continued watching together; I then saw a cask rolled from under the tarpauling without any person with it; and I then discovered the coffee running from a hole in that cask; in a short time I saw the prisoner before the cask - he took a plug from his mouth and put it into the hole of the cask, from which the coffee had been running, and drove it in with a piece of wood - during all this time, the other man was shuffling on the deck and whistling - a smack then passed by, and the coffee was stopped, while it passed, the others then said "It is all right;" and the coffee began to run again, while the man on the top kept moving the hatchway - the prisoner then drew the tarpauling, which had been spread for the coffee to run on, towards the cabin-door - I got into a boat, and went into the harge, and my partner came over the bow of the vessel; I told the prisoner I came for the coffee which he had drawn from the cask - "Lord bless you," says he, "I know nothing about it; I am the watchman;" I told him he might as well confess it, for I had been so near, I could have lent him a hand; I went into the cabin and found his companion; I moved a tar barrel, and found five bags of coffee, which weighed 22lbs. - I applied my light to the prisoner's face, and am quite positive of his person - I told them it was a fortunate job there was not a Police-boat coming by, for if it had, they would have been locked up; I left them on board the barge, and wrote to the Eonourable Board the next morning, stating what I had done; I am certain it was the prisoner, who put the plug into the cask - it was a star light night, and high water - I could see him very distinctly.</p>

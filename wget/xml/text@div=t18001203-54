               <p>Q. Did he attempt to go away? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body there besides yourself? - A. No; I untied the bundle, and found my husband's hat and my bonnet tied up in a handkerchief, that was not mine; I told him he had taken them out of the box; he said he had not; the bonnet was in the box, wrapped up in a handkerchief, and the hat was hanging in the room; he had taken the bonnet out of my handkerchief, and wrapped it up in his own; I know the bonnet to be mine.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get him secured? - A. He ran down stairs, and got away; as I was by myself, I was afraid to do any thing to him: on the Saturday after, my little boy saw him go into the Black-horse rendezvous, and by that means he was apprehended on the Sunday; I am positive the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>JOHN CHURCHILL sworn. - I know this hat to be mine by the lining.</p>
               <p>JOHN KNOX sworn. - I keep a green-grocer's shop in King-street, Tower-hill; Churchill called upon me to assist him in apprehending the prisoner; I went with him, and brought the prisoner before the Magistrate.</p>

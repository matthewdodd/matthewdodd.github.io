Yes; every letter carrier has a seat for himself, and six boxes to sort them into, to saperate them.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were employed that morning - A. All six were employed that morning, on the 8th of October.</p>
               <p>Q. In the process if any one chuses to take a letter not within his own walk, has he the opportunity and means of doing so - A.He has.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps some times it may happen by accident that a letter gets into a wrong walk - A.It does, frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. When that happens what ought that person who has possession of that letter to do - A. He ought immediately he finds the letter to give it to the person whose duty it is to take it; that is what he ought to do.</p>
               <p>Q. But if it came to him by mistake, in whose delivery is Collit-place, Stepney - A. It is the walk within the Commercial-road; William Stringer is the letter carrier to that walk. The letter carriers sign their names themselves. William Stringer was upon duty that morning, as it appears by the signing of the book.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it appear that the prisoner was on duty that morning - A. He was; he signed his name. I know his signature.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. When letters come by the General 
               <persName id="t18131201-39-person515">Post</persName>
             to the office they are sorted - A. They are.</p>
               <p>Q. Then after the letters are sorted at your office they go into that office - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore it is impossible for the prisoner to obtain possession of that letter before it came to to your office - A. In the first instance it was.</p>
               <p>Q. When the letters come to your office are they returned the same day - A. This letter it appears by the stamp could not be returned on the same day to the General Post office; we frequently return them if we notice them in time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say letters that come by accident to the Two-penny Post office, by which you discover where they are to go, are to be returned to the General Post office, are they to be sent in a mass to the General Post office - A. They are sent in a locked box to the letter carriers office at the General Post office; they are taken to the place called the Book; they are re-sorted. It appears by this letter, that this letter came to his hands. The prisoner is a Two-penny postman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Abbott. If the letters are misserted, if you are in time to send them by the General 
               <persName id="t18131201-39-person516">Post</persName>
             delivery you return them; if not in time you send them by the Two-penny Post and mark them G.

I have always four hundred pounds, so you may make yourself easy upon that head. I think they had better be paid as well as the last, both on account of our credit, if we have to pay Mr. Barber and Co. their commission. I should have gone through your accompts, but I can make nothing of it without the dates. Thank God we are free. Please to pay Mr. Dodd his bill, 10 l. 15 s. I hope your new speculation will do.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Burt said just now, that the General Post office letters very often go back; there is hardly an office but in which are missorted letters. The men that come against me knew many other letters besides in that division are sorted into my division, and as I am charge taker I have no time for sorting letters. I don't think one gentleman here ever saw me sorting letters. I receive of fifteen men, and while I am taking the money I leave it to them to take them out, I have not time until they are gone to see whether my letters are right or wrong; on Monday morning particularly, when I am gone out, I have to come back, the walk has been so heavy, we have petitioned Mr. Johnson two or three times to alter our walks, to take off the collection of that walk as it is so heavy; if we detain a letter one time we are afraid of giving them back for fear of being turned out of office; we have not time to do what we ought. Mr. Burt has said that the letters are brought in a box; they are not always brought in a box, sometimes he brings them out in his hands; all the men take them out in their hands.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burt. There is a box for the purpose, whether they use it at all times I cannot say; it is the charge takers duty to take them in a box.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called ten witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

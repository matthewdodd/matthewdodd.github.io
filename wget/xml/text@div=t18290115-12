               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Can you tell whether the man taken, was the man who ran from you? A. No - it was not very dark, but I should think too dark to swear to a man; I had just paid the coachman - I felt the reticule pulled and missed it immediately; the person did not come in front of me; it is very possible it might have dropped.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What made you say it was snatched? A. I felt some one pull, and felt a jerk at it, then missed it - a lady called out "You had better go forward, the man who has robbed you, is taken."</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that it dropped, or was taken? A. It must have been taken, I think - I felt a jerk and immediately missed it.</p>
               <p>JOHN CARTER. I live in Chancery-lane, and am a shoemaker. I was in Smithfield: about twenty yards before I got to the prosecutrix, I saw her, and a man, I believe - I thought him a middle-sized man - I walked down and got within four yards of them, and saw the man make a sort of a wrestle, then run away, and the woman screamed out directly; I ran after the man and was very near getting hold of him - he turned down Hosier-lane, through a passage; I fell over some rails instead of jumping over them - I got up and followed him again, calling Stop thief! five or six people ran after him; I pursued the same man who took the articles - I believe the man I followed was taken; he might be out of my sight in the middle of Hosier-lane, but I do not think he was - the same man was taken; I was out of breath - I cannot say whether the prisoner is the man, in the dress he has on now; I have said I could swear to him when he had the other clothes on - he had a light waistcoat on at the time; I saw the same person taken who I pursued, and that man I saw at the office - the man at the office was the man who robbed her; if the prisoner be the man who was at the office, he is the man who committed the robbery.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do not you think the wrong man was taken for this? A. I do not think it myself - I am tall; I thought he was a middling sized man - I called Stop thief! after I could run no longer; I was never out of this country; I was on the Chatham river for about three years, sometimes fishing and sometimes sailing: I was transported for theft, but it was proved I never did any thing of the sort - I am "

            . I am eleven years old. I was in Smithfield and saw the prisoner running - I am sure he is the man; I saw him snatch something from the lady - he knocked me down as he ran away; I am sure he is the person - he was taken in Hosier-lane, about fifty yards off - it was between eight and nine o'clock; the gas was lighted- I lost sight of him for about three minutes; I was about four yards from him when he took the bag, and am positive he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where were you? A. At the corner of Cloth-fair; the lady was between there and Long-lane - I did not see the prisoner taken; I was about the middle of Hosier-lane - four or five people were running; there was nobody near him when he made the snatch; Carter was about four yards from him, and the gas-lamp was about two yards off - I was asked the colour of what he took, and directly said it appeared to be black; Carter ran very hard after him - I was on the opposite side and was flurried; I followed him, after being knocked down, to see where he went - he had run about three minutes before I lost sight of him, and about fifty yards.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 21st of December I heard an alarm in King-street, opposite Hosier-lane - I saw the prisoner running down the lane, and several persons pursuing him; he was the first man, and I stopped him - I did not see Stantide till at the watch-house- he there said he was the man; nothing but a pair of scissors was found on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the boy asked the colour of what was taken? A. Yes; he said it was black, and said he had been thrown down - Carter was in the watch-house, and said he was a shoe maker.</p>
               <p>GEORGE GODFREY. I am the watch-house-keeper. The prisoner was brought in; the boy told the story he has now - the prisoner said he was a tailor, but there being no marks on his finger, I doubted it; he then said he was a ca<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150011"></xptr>binet-maker employed near Spafields, but would not tell the street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you send persons out to search in the tract? A. Yes; they found nothing - the boy said he thought it was a bag that he snatched - he could not exactly say the colour, but thought it was black; Smithfield is well lighted - the robbery was committed in the darkest part, but that is not too dark to see a person.</p>

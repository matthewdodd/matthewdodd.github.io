The prisoner came there on the 30th of November, about nine o'clock in the morning, and asked for some black-kid gloves - I showed him some, and while I turned my head, he put three gloves into his pocket - he was going away, and I accused him of taking them - he denied it, and tried to make his escape; but another young man came up, and he was taken - I found three gloves on him - I missed them from the paper - I found the fellow to one of the gloves.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not the prisoner offer you 2s. 6d. a pair for the gloves? A. Yes; he offered to pay the other young man for them, when I accused him of it - I told the Magistrate that he offered to make his escape - I went out to call my master.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Corren. - Lewis rang the bell - I ran up; and on getting into the shop, I saw the prisoner with the handle of the door in his hand; Lewis accused him of taking some gloves, which he denied; but on his persisting, the prisoner said he had a pair of gloves in his pocket, for which he was going to pay; and, on his producing the gloves, I found this pair<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182612070059"></xptr>and this odd one on him - he offered 2s. 6d. for the pair - I saw him attempt to open the door, which the witness kept shut - he took the chain down, I believe, but there was a latch - my master came into the shop, and the prisoner fell on his knees, and asked for forgiveness - I heard him say he was willing to pay for them after he had produced them - but he denied having them at first.</p>

             then said to me, damn me my hat is gone too; the prisoner then walked away down the Mews, and I went into Dr. Monro's which is about ten yards from the place, my fellow servant came to the door, he was rather affrighted seeing I had some blows about my face and he went to call a watchman; the next morning I went to the public house and told them my misfortune, and the publican and his wife desired me to make myself easy, for they knew the men very well, and in about an hour or two after they sent for me, and the prisoners were in custody.</p>

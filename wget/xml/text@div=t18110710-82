               <p>Q. When was it you lost this cotton furniture - A. On the 21st of May, about eight in the morning. The prisoner was <rs id="t18110710-82-deflabel494" type="occupation">shopman to Mr. Francis</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18110710-82-defend777 t18110710-82-deflabel494"></join>. He made up some goods in a wrapper, saying that he was going to wait on a customer, at the bottom of the hill. He had got three lengths of printed cottons, and two pieces of muslin. I requested him to wait the arrival of Mr. Simmons, who superintended the concern, as Mr. Francis was gone to Margate. The prisoner refused waiting. In the course of half an hour he returned, saying he had sold two squares of muslin, for five shillings and sixpence. On our examining the prints, we found six yards and a half deficient. Previous to the prisoner going out he borrowed six-pence of me; in the day he repaid it, having plenty of silver. In the evening he went to bed in the warehouse, in the morning I found he had left the house, twenty minutes after three. Mrs. Francis mentioned it to him in the morning, he flew in a passion and left the employ, on examining with the stock book, we missed two pieces of furniture.</p>
               <p>Q. There is only one charge here - A. On the 13th<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181107100047"></xptr>of June, a woman came to our shop and ordered some goods for an artificial flower maker, saying it was for a gentleman that was poorly and could not attend.</p>
               <p>Q. I cannot go through all the things that this man has done in his life, you must confine yourself to the printed cotton and the muslin - A. On the 13th of June this woman came, I went with her to No. 50. Dover-street, Blackfriers-road, when there the gentleman she said was so ill, she could not get out of bed; I entrusted her with the muslins to go up; Mr. Vincent came down and said he should detain the muslins for his salary; I came home without them. The next day, obtaining a search warrant the officer, and I searched his apartment in Guildford-street, we found twenty yards of furniture there, and part of another; we found nothing at the house I had left them at.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did not he claim wages that was due to him - A. Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>COURT. He is indicted for stealing furniture - A. Yes, on the 22d of May, we never found that.</p>

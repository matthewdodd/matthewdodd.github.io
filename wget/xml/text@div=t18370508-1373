On the 4th of April, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I went into the Dundee Arms, Southward, with friend—Whitby came in after my friend went away, and after that Love<lb></lb>lock came in, and I treated them with some porter and bread and cheer—Lovelock's brother lives close by me—Whitby I had no knowledge of before, but I treated him because he said he was out of work—I left the public-house about half-past seven o'clock, and walked down by the arch of the railroad—Whitby was walking by the side of me, and took my shawl from my back—he had said he was going to his, sister's, who lives about 300 yards from me, and said we would walk together-Lovelock kept on the other side of the arches, but when Whitby took my property he went on the other side of the arches' to Lovelock, and they both ran off with my property—I was quite sober, and ran back to the public-house and told the publican—the policemen took them into custody on the Friday—Whitby was taken at his sister's his mother's—I went with the policeman to both places—Whitby sad he had taken my shawl off my back and pawned it, and he gave the policeman the duplicate—this is it.</p>

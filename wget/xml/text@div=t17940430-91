On the 7th of March I searched his premises with a search warrant, he keeps a lodging in No. 32, Shoemaker-row, he was then in my service, he had been with me near two years; I found there all the articles in the indictment he was not at home, he was in my service in Newgate-street, and we applied to know what apartment belonged to him, he had a kitchen, a parlour, and a bed chamber.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you know all this of your own knowledge? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find all these articles in these rooms? - Yes, some locked up in his bed chamber in a box, two bags of sugar and nine pounds of tallow candles. In one of the bags of sugar was a printed bill of my own, wrapped up with some of that sugar.</p>
               <p>Q.Such bills as you have to carry on your business with, I conceive? - Yes, it is; in his bed chamber this bill of parcels was found on a file, signed

            , but he went by the name of William.</p>

               <p>Q. The whole of this you say is not the hand writing of the prisoner? - Yes, I verily believe it is. In his parlour there was a large glass bottle of brandy which is in court, in a cupboard in that parlour was another such bottle of rum which we forgot to bring away, in the kitchen below there was a bottle of brandy, five bottles of rum, and one hullage bottle of tent wine, all the rest of the goods were in the cellar; these things have been in the constable's care ever since. The prisoner had a hearing before the Lord Mayor on the 8th.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you identify this property? - I cannot positively swear; I have been robbed of a deal of property for more than a twelvemonth past, it is the nature of this trade that hardly any one thing can be identified, I have no doubt but the property is mine, but it is best to be cautious, I have tried the goods in regard to the strength and they are exactly of the same strength; I am sorry I do not stand upon better ground. I have been robbed seriously indeed.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for to Graham's; I found the prisoner there - Miss Graham had the tops of her ear-rings in her hand - I asked the prisoner where she lived? and she said she lived there - when the tops of the ear-rings were produced I asked the prisoner where the drops were? she said she knew nothing of the drops, but she picked up the tops in sweeping the room - I took her into the next room to search her - a knife dropped from her with the name of Graham on it, and this handkerchief slipped from behind her clothes with the initials of M. G. on it - I then went to No. 3, King's Head-court - I asked her which room she lived in? she said the second floor, and told me where the key was to be found; I found it where she described, and it opened the door; and I found keys on her which opened some drawers there; and in the drawers I found the ear-rings and the whole of the property I have here, except the bedcurtain, which was between the sacking and the bedstead- I have a table cloth, a shirt, apron, chair cover, coloured neck handkerchief, pillow cases, some children's tumblers, cruets, saucers, bed furniture, and a pickle-dish; some silk, a pair of scissors, pen-knife, and snuff-box.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Is that all the account she gave? A. Yes; she did not tell me how she became possessed of them.</p>
               <p>MARY GRAHAM re-examined. These are my earrings, but this pair are not mine; when I accused her of taking my earrings, (after seeing the tops in her ears;) she said she had broken her own the day before; these earrings are mine, and the scissors, and silk, and the handkerchief; I made the curtains - I know the shirt, table-cloth, and other things; the snuff-box and knife belong to my brother - I have examined them all, and know them to be our property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is your father's name Robert? A. It is; the prisoner has been treated confidentially in the family; some old dresses were given to her once - I have a sister married; her marriage was not known to my father for some time after it happened - the prisoner said it was not known to her.</p>

            . This shirt is mine; I have such cruets and tumblers as these - I never gave her any such articles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Some articles were given her? A. Not a single article to my knowledge - I did not hear my daughter say some old dresses were given to her; I never heard of such a thing - if anything was given her, I never heard of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Those things there, I bought and gave 8s. 6d. for, in the New Cut; there never was a stopper to them - it was two years ago last March, when I nursed a person named Jones, over the water; the pepper-castor and mustard-pot I bought myself, and gave 1s. 6d. for in Sun-street, Barbican; and that vinegar-cruet, belonged to my grandfather; the earring drops I found in the chimney place, when I swept the room; and two days after that, I found the tops under the carpet which was turned up; I took them down into the kitchen, and laid them on the dresser, thinking to give them to Miss Graham, but she never came into the kitchen at the time; previous to that, her sister came up; and before that, I put one in my ear, and Mrs. Storey, her sister, saw it in my ear, and she sent me on an errand, and when I returned, I took it out and put it in paper ready for Miss Graham - I called her up, she said, "I am coming presently;" but she never came up until I was in custody.</p>
               <p>MARY GRAHAM re-examined. I know the decanters, for we had half-a-dozen of them; two are at home now, and we have only four left - one of them is here - there is no mark on them; I know the pepper-castor, for we had three of them in an old-fashioned stand, but they were broken, and we took this for salad oil - I am sure<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170043"></xptr>it is the same; it stood in the larder on a shelf; both the handkerchiefs have names on them, and I made the shirt myself - I know my work on the shirt, the letter G is still there, but the other letter has been picked out since I marked it.</p>

               <p>I am a constable, on Monday the 10th about half past eight, we had been to Smithfield, I saw a coach stop at a certain house, near a public-house, the sign of the Sun; I saw the tallest, Osborne, jump out of the coach, I was twenty yards from it, I said there was something suspicious in his loitering about; he whispered to the other prisoner who was in the coach, they did not both come out, Osborne went right down the street; I looked in at the coach door, and saw the bundle there, Osborne made off, I am not positive he saw me or not; I continued there some time, I said I had a right to come in, and what have you got here; Peach said, what did I want there, I ordered the coachman to drive to Justice Blackborrow's, with Peach in it, he was examined, and committed for a farther examination; there are the things I found in the coach with them, afterwards Osborne was taken.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Osborne. Ask him if this man was in the coach with me when he took me? -</p>
               <p>Court. He says he saw Osborne go out of the coach, and only you and the bundle in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Can you swear Osborne went out of the coach? - I am positive sure of it.</p>
               <p>The constable produced the things, and said they had been in his custody ever since.</p>
               <p>The Prosecutor deposed, they were his property, I know the bed curtain by the tuck in particular, and the pattern, the glass I can swear to, the scutcheon is on the drawer.</p>
               <p>Is there any thing else you know to be yours? No; they found no more.</p>

               <p>Who called you? - It was one of the two gentlemen at the bar, and took me to the bottom of Newtoner's-street, and desired me turn down on the left hand side to Parker's-lane, I did so, there the two prisoners brought a bundle and a glass.</p>
               <p>Are you sure they are the same persons? Yes; they ordered me to drive into Turnmill-street, Clerkenwell, and from thence to White chapel, and back again to Turnmill-street, and when they stopped me in Turnmill-street, Mr. Blackborrow's men came to me at the coach door; I never saw them before that day, I carried them to Justice Blackborrow's.</p>

To make it a burglary, it was necessary the house should be broke open in the night time, not only when the sun was not up, but when there was not light enough to discern the lineaments of a man's countenance; it does not appear it was done in the night time, and as to the capital part of the indictment, the burglary, you will acquit them.</p>

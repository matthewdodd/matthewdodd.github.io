                  </hi>. I am an engineer, and live in Bath-place, New-road—the prisoner was my groom. On the morning of the 15th of November, in consequence of what I heard, I found a cupboard locked and nailed—it was opened in my presence, and contained six bottles, three of port, two of brandy, and one of gin—the prisoner gave up his key, and I went with the officer to his lodgings, and opened a box there which was pointed out by his landlord as his, and found in the box another bottle in a handkerchief—I called the prisoner up, and told him to tell me the whole truth.</p>

I am carman to the prosecutor—I was in the stable about seven o'clock in the evening of the 16th—the prisoner had one key, and I the other—I saw a cupboard open that the prisoner had the command of—it caused me to look in there, and I saw the neck of a bottle—I called Ferrie, and then the cupboard was nailed up—one morning the prisoner asked me if I had had any thing out of his cupboard—I said, "No"—I asked what he had lost—he said it did not signify, it was a thing of some consequence, he should have to make it good—he then said it was three bottles of wine and two of brandy.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Cheltenham-place, Westminster-road, and am a tobacconist—on Monday afternoon, 7th January, about half-past 3 or 4 o'clock, I was in the prosecutor's shop, Mr. John Moore, pawnbroker, of Church-street, Woolwich—I heard a noise as if glass was breaking—it appeared to come from the front, from Mr. Moore's window, as though his window was being broken—I ran outside, saw the broken window, and saw the prisoners Steele, Miller, and another, in front—they all three ran away when I went out—I pursued them—I identify Steele and Miller—the other I cannot swear to—I caught Steele and took him back to the shop—this watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was found on him.</p>

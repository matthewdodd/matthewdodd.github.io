On 27th May, I watched the prosecutor's premises, from six o'clock in the morning, till twenty minutes before eight—while I was watching, I saw Skelton lowering down sacks from the granary, and Ward had a cart receiving the sacks from the granary—Garforth was with me—I saw the cart loaded, and come out from the wharf about twenty minutes before eight—1 followed the cart—it stopped at a coffee-shop a short time—Ward went in, and left the cart outside—I watched it, and never lost sight of it—Ward came out, and the cart then went over Westmin<lb></lb>ster-bridge, up Parliament-street, up St. Martin's-lane, through St. Giles, and to Cheyne-mews, Bloorasbury—that is not the way to the Regent's-park Barracks—Rayment has a stable in Cheyne-mews—Ward was with the cart all the time—from the time it left the granary till it got to Rayment's, there was no sack put in it or taken out of it—when the cart got to Rayment's, it pulled up in front of the stable, and Rayment came out of the stable imme<lb></lb>diately—Ward did not knock or ring, the gates were wide open—Ward got on the load, and handed a sack from the load on to Rayment's shoulder—Rayment carried it up a ladder into the loft—I followed him up into the loft, leaving Garforth in charge of the cart and Ward—when I got into the loft, Rayment was turning round, and was about to shoot the oats into a bin—I said, "Halloo! what are you going to do with these?"—he said, "The</p>

I was ordered to deliver them here by my employer"—the sack of oats was brought down shortly by Rayment, and Romain followed him down—I eventually took care of the cart, and Ward and Rayment were taken by Romain—I and Romain went with the cart afterwards to the barracks, and Romain took a sample of the oats—I after<lb></lb>wards went to the Belvedere Wharf, and saw Skelton—the foreman asked him, in my presence, how many oats he had put on Ward's cart that morning—he said, "Twelve quarters, I think," and after hesitating a little he said, "After I had given him twelve quarters, as I thought, he said he had not enough by one sack, and I took a sack and filled it and gave it him"—I then asked him whether they used sacks with different names on them—he said, "Yes, we do use odd sacks sometimes"—I said, "Did you have a sack with the name of Anderson on it?"—he said, "We had a sack with that name"—I then took him into custody—I kept sight of the cart all the time—I did not see Rayment in St. Giles's, or anywhere else, put a sack of oats on the cart.</p>

I was on duty at Old Brentford on the morning of the 8th of July, and saw the prisoner come from a marine-store shop, with a bag on his shoulder—I went to the shop and made inquiry—I followed the prisoner, who had a donkey-cart with grains—I asked what he had got in the cart—he first said, "Nothing"—I said, "you have got something"—he said, "Yes, I have got a little piece of copper"—I asked where he got it from—he said two men, named Taylor and Jackson, brought it to him to sell for them—I took him into custody—I found four pieces of copper in a saltpetre bag, on the top of the grains.</p>

The prisoner was brought to the Brentford-station, in the 8th of July, with four pieces of copper—I asked if he chose to give any account of the copper found in his possession—he said Jackson and Taylor, who worked at the powder-mills, brought it to him at five o'clock in the morning, in a barrow, to sell—he said it was one round plate—it was cut in quarters, and one quarter was missing—I asked what became of the other quarter—he said he had it at home with some more—I searched the back shed of his premises, and found the other quarter, and three other pieces of copper covered with hay—the whole amounts to 8lbs.—when the prisoner was before the Magistrate, he said he had nothing to say.</p>

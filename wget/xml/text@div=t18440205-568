                  </hi>. I live at No. 8, Newton-street, Holborn, in the parish of St. Giles's. On the 26th of Dec, on coming down stairs, about half-past seven in the morning, I perceived that a panel of the workshop was broken out, a tool-chest in the shop broken open, and a saw taken out—a square of glass was broken in the kitchen-window, for the purpose of turning the catch to lift up the sash—it was up—a bureau in the front kitchen was forced open, the lock forced off, and twelve silver spoons and a pair of sugar-tongs, four salt spoons, and two table spoons gone—I also missed a top coat and a japanned card case, worth all together more than 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—when I retired to bed the night before, at eleven o'clock, the house was quite safe—the prisoner worked for me three or four years ago—the spoons were marked "<hi rend="largeCaps">M W</hi>"—I have not seen any of them since.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Harrison-street, Gray's-inn-road. On Christ<lb></lb>mas night I was in the Rose and Three Tuns public-house, Little Earl-street, Seven-dials, and a little after twelve o'clock the prisoner and a female entered the house—I was with a party of friends, some of whom knew the prisoner, and got into conversation with him till about one o'clock—he called me on one side, and asked if I knew where he could get a lodging—I said I did not know—he pulled out a quantity of spoons, a pair of sugar-tongs, four salt spoons, some tea spoons, and two table spoons—I saw the letter W on the spoons quite plainly—there was another letter, but I could not see what it was—they were old-fashioned letters—the W stood first—I could see that distinctly—it was like on the top of the M—the prisoner said he had got articles in his pocket which would fetch 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the morning—he said he had done a <hi rend="italic">crack</hi>, and was going to do another one—he was not sober—he spent a good bit of money in drink—he went to Mr. Rice's coffee-shop, at the corner of Compton-street and Broad-street—I went with him and a party of friends—one was a cabinet-maker named Mack, who I knew well—we parted com<lb></lb>pany about four or five o'clock—he did not entertain the whole company—I did not have a farthing at his expense, only the female that was with him, and I cannot say whether he paid for what she had.</p>

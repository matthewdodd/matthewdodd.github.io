On Sunday morning, 19th April, about half past 2 o'clock, I was in the Uxbridge Road, in the parish of Acton, and saw the prisoner with a gun on his shoulder, and a very heavy bundle attached to it, containing these four shawls, two pieces of flannel, a pair of goloshes, seventy-three screws of tobacco, a shirt, a razor, 14 lbs. of tea, some cigars, and a coat—he was running in a direction from the Orange Tree public house, and about 120 yards from it, towards London—he was sober—I asked him who the gun belonged to; he said that he got it from his brother, at Marlow, and that he was a hawker, and the bundle contained all sorts of things—after examining it, I took him to the station, searched him, and found 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, two duplicates, and some watches—I took him past a flower bed at the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Jennings. My brother is the proprietor of the Orange Tree—I looked up his house on Saturday night, 18th April—I secured the tap room window by two bolts, one at the top and one at the bottom—I was the last person up, and went to bed about 12 o'clock—I was aroused about 4 o'clock by the police—these shawls, flannel, goloshes, tea, and sugar, belong to my husband; I missed them from a little room adjoining the bar—the rest belong to my mother and my brother—I found a pane of glass broken in the tap room window, so that anybody could put their hand through and turn the button; there would then be space for a man to pass in.</p>

I was at the station when the prisoner was brought in—I saw him searched; he said that he had brought the things from Marlow, and had been drinking at a public house at Acton—he described the house and the landlord, and I went to the Orange Tree, and found the cellar flap insecurely fastened—I went through it to the foot of the bed room stairs, and awoke the inmates—the tap room window was open, and a square of glass broken—on my return to the station, I found this chisel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) lying on a flower bed in the garden; it corresponds with some marks on the putty of the broken square of glass.</p>

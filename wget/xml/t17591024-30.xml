A young man that lived at my house was sick, and he had given the prisoner a shirt to pawn. I went after the prisoner was gone away to the Pawnbroker's to take the shirt in my own name, and the Pawnbroker brought down a shirt of mine, which he said the prisoner had pawn'd there. I went home, and by searching we missed several things. We took up the prisoner, and she own'd she had pawned that shirt of mine, and where she had pawn'd one sheet, and that she had sold a blanket for 18 d. to a stranger. I went with her to the pawnbroker, and he delivered to me the sheet.</p>

            . I met the prisoner last Monday morning; there was one of our journeymen with me; we stopp'd her, and I call'd for an officer. She said, do not put me in an officer's hands, I'll go along with you. She came with me home, and upon being charg'd with taking these things, she own'd she took the blanket from my bed, and sold it in Rag-Fair. She took me to a Pawnbroker where she had pawn'd the sheet in her own name for half-a-crown, which was delivered to us, the sheet and shirt produc'd, and depos'd to.</p>

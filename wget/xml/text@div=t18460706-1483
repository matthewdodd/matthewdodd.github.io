                  </hi>. I am wife of William Coster, and live in Lambeth-walk, the prisoner is my brother-in-law. I knew Richard Hutchinson when he was alive—lived at No. 1, White's-alley, Bankside, with his father—Sunday, the 21st of June, at nine o'clock in the evening, I and my husband were at Mr. Willis's house, No. 12, Whitehorse-street, Lambeth—I had appointment to meet the deceased at the Pear Tree—husband did not know of it—deceased came to the top of Whitehorse-street, and I accom<lb></lb>anied him there—husband came into the Pear Tree about nine o'clock—went from there together to Mr. Willis's—husband did not object to something which he thought had happened between me and the deceased—lis's is a private house—deceased was intoxicated when I met him—re was a chair at Willis's, which my husband gave the deceased to sit down in, outside the door—sat down in it, and fell out of the chair from the effects of liquor—ftll on his head—had a straw hat on—fell off, and he fell upon the hat—did not fall violently—husband picked him up—asked my husband to use him kindly—n that my husband struck me—deceased said he did not like to see that; he would not have me struck—prisoner was leaning on his arm on the window-ledge of Willis's house, and challenged the deceased to fight—deceased accepted the challenge, and stripped to fight—did not see the prisoner strip—y fought—saw the prisoner give the deceased one blow—do not know where he hit him, for my husband struck me at the same time, but from the position he stood I should say it was on the head—husband was sober, and so was the prisoner—did not see that the deceased struck the prisoner—endeavored to separate them, and got another blow from my husband, and fainted—n I came to myself Willis was assisting the deceased to put his clothes on—then walked with the deceased to the Marsh-gate—went into a doctor's shop to have my bruises cured—deceased waited outside for me—I came out I found him</p>

                  </hi>. I am a French polisher, and live at White Hone-street. On Sunday night, the 21st of June, I was at my door—these people were about six doors up on the other side of the street, at Mr. Willis's, No. 12—I saw this disturbance—the last witness was among them—the deceased was very tipsy, and was taking indecent liberties with her—her husband came over and struck her—the deceased got out of the chair, and said he would fight him—he said, "What made you strike that woman?"—he said, "Because she is my wife"—deceased said, "If you strike her I will strike you"—the prisoner said, "I will fight you"—he afterwards said he would not fight him, but would fight his b——brother <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>—the prisoner at that time was com<lb></lb>ing out of the public-house—he went to his own door, stooped over, and asked the deceased what he meant—the deceased said he would fight him for last boxing-day—the prisoner said, "I do not want to fight you, but if you fish to fight, I will fight you; wait till I go in-doors and pull off my new trowsers, then I will fight you like a man"—he went in and changed his trowsers—in the meantime the deceased took off his things, and kept strik<lb></lb>ing his breast, saying he would fight any b——man in the street—when the deceased saw the prisoner come out, he ran at him—they both had a alight blow a-piece, and the deceased happened to fall under the prisoner—they never ran at one another; they never squared or anything; you could not call it a fight—the back part of the deceased's head fell against the curb<lb></lb>stone; that part rather more behind than his ear—I assisted him up, ordered "me cold water, and bathed his temples—he did not seem much worse—he would have arose again, I think, but for the liquor—I directly lifted him up, and before he got on his knees he again said he would fight any b----man in the street—I afterwards saw him go away with the woman—on Thursday I saw a man dead at the house of the deceased's mother, but I did not know him when he was alive, and cannot say that he was the same man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Great Guildford-street. On Monday morning, the 22nd of June, between nine and ten o'clock, I went to Moss-alley, Bank-side, to the house of the deceased's mother, and saw Dim lying on the bed in a collapsed state—I expected that he was labouring under compression of the brain—I observed a diffused swelling on the back pwt of his head—he had had a knock on the right side of his neck—he died about half past one o'clock the same day—on the following Thursday I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, and have no difficulty in saying that his death was caused by the rupture of one of the arteries of the <hi rend="italic">dura-mater</hi>—that diffused</p>

               <p>the blood over the brain—there was a large quantity of coagulated blood—the effect of any injury of that sort would most likely come on by degrees afterwards—he might have no difficulty in walking a short distance after he received the blow—the blood would become discharged from the artery afterwards, and spread itself upon the brain, and then he would become insensible.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Might it not result from violent excitement, in a state of intoxication and passion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should rather think not—I have never known an instance where violent excitement and intoxication has produced a rupture of that artery—I attribute the injury to a fall; from the internal ex<lb></lb>amination.</p>

            , (Police-constable H 38.) I was in Shoreditch on Sunday morning, the 26th of February; I saw the prisoner and another man, with each of them a bundle - I followed them, and they ran through Cock-lane to Nichol-street; I got close to them, and the prisoner threw his bundle away - I followed, and took him; I put him into the station, and there I found a bundle of the same appearance as that he threw away; it contains a number of squares of glass, most of which are broken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. What time was this? A. About half-past six o'clock in the morning; I did not lose sight of him - I met Burt, and passed him; it was rather dark - I did not pick up what he threw away.</p>

            . I live in Acorn-street, and am a lamplighter. I was in Nichol-street - two men ran by me, each with a bundle under his arm; the officer was pursuing them; one of them threw down a bundle, which I took up and gave to a Police-officer - there were some corners of glass through the bundle.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You cannot swear to the prisoner's person? A. No.</p>

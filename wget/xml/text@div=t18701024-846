                  </hi>. I am a gilder, and live at 13, Orwell Street, Hall Park, Paddington—between 1 and 2 on the morning of 27th September, I was passing through the Euston Road, on my way home, having misted a train—I received a violent blow under the right ear, from behind—I turned round and struggled with the prisoner—he dragged my gold watch and chain away, and tripped me up with his foot—I fell—I cried out "Murder!" and "Police!" and saw him run into the arms of a policeman—I never lost sight of him—it was in a dark spot—I came up to him as soon as he ran into the policeman's arms—my watch and chain were worth 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is part of the chain I lost—there is a seal attached to it—I saw no one else near at the time but the prisoner.</p>

Q.</hi> Did you look for your watch afterwards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I did not find it—my hat fell off, and I went back with the policeman and found that—I missed the train and had to walk from Hoxton—it was past 12 when I left Hoxton—I left home about 7 in the evening, and got to Hoxton about 8—I went to a friend's house at 10, Gloucester Street, Hox-ton—I had not been to any place of amusement—I had not had any supper—I only had an arrowroot biscuit from the time I left home, and three glasses of beer—I did not have any grog—I had one glass of beer at the railway station, going, and two after that—the blow on the head was the first thing that attracted my attention—I was walking gently—there was no one near me in the street—I did not hear the man come behind me—I struggled with him directly I received the blow.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cab driver, and live at 40, Outram Street, Cale-donian Road—I was in the Euston Road, just turning out of Ossulston Street, and my attention was drawn by cries of "Murder!"—I saw the prisoner and Mr. Sullivan struggling together—I saw the prosecutor fall; the prisoner shook himself from the prosecutor and ran away—I followed him as fast as I could—I ran as fast as he did—I kept sight of him till the policeman caught him—there were one or two persons about the street—there were five of us went down to the station—there was no one near when the prisoner and the prosecutor were struggling together—it was in a dark spot—I was by myself on the near side of the road, and they were on the off side.</p>

About 2.30, on the morning of 27th September, I was on duty in the Euston Road—I saw a woman standing under a lamp post, putting a shawl over her shoulders—I went towards her, and she walked away—I went up to the place and picked up this chain and seal at the place where she had been standing—I had seen her before with the prisoner that night, in Warren Street, leading into Fitzroy Street, Euston Road—I saw them about 12.50 together—she left the prisoner and went down Warren Street, towards the railway station, and he went into the Euston Road, towards the place where the robbery was committed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How far from the place where the robbery took place was it that you found the chain and seal? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Seventy or eighty yards—I don't know who the woman was—I saw her in the prisoner's company, and I should know her again if I was to see her—I have looked for her since and have not been able to find her—I have seen her about there with other men—I found the chain where she was standing, about eighty yards from the place of the robbery, in the opposite direction to that which the prisoner is said to have run.</p>

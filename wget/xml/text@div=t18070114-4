Last Monday evening, between five and six o'clock, I stopped the prisoner in Cornhill, he had a bag on his back, I asked him what he had there, he told me it did not concern me; I told him I was an officer, I would know; he told me he had iron, he was going to Drury lane, he was a farrier; he said he had brought it from Whitechapel, but where he would not tell me; I told him if he did not choose to give me a proper answer, I should take him to the Counter; he told me he lived in Cross street, Holborn; if I wanted to enquire about him I must go to Hackney. I took him before the lord-mayor, he sent for his master, he came and said he stole the iron.</p>

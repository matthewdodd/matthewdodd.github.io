             sworn.</p>
               <p>On Monday the 7th of July, about two or three, o'clock as I was coming up the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160056"></xptr>Second, I saw the prisoner at the bar, and I wanted a bed, and I addressed her, and asked her if she was in the same situation with myself, with that she brought me to the One Bell, behind the New Church, and I could not recollect the next day whether it was the waiter or the maid that let me in, I very well remember I desired to be called at nine o'clock the next day, and I gave the waiter a guinea, then he brought me the change, and I had the watch in my fob; the next morning I was called at nine o'clock, and when I awoke the woman was gone, and I missed the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the night did you perceive the watch to be in your fob? - Before I went there, I had it when I was in Salisbury-street, going to Somerset-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How many women had you talked to by the way? - Only one, and this woman, I am sure I had it in Salisbury-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Then your attention was not called to your watch from the time you was in Salisbury street till the next morning, when you found the woman gone and your money gone? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get your watch after? - No. As she comes of very creditable parents, I beg the court, as a very particular favour, will grant her mercy.</p>

               <p>I am cook at the Bell, I know nothing of her, only letting her in between the hours of five and six in the morning, with this gentleman.</p>

I live at 10, Howard-street, Wands worth-road, and deal in pigs—early last year, I saw the prisoner in Copenhagen Cattle-market, with a gray mare—he asked me if I would buy it—I said I could not, as I had got one, but I should not mind exchanging with him, as mine was not big enough to do the work—I came to terms with him—I gave him my horse and 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the gray mare—I kept her from three to four weeks, and then sold her to Mr. Roff—I cannot speak to the dates.</p>

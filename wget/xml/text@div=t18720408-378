                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector W</hi>). On the night of 31st January this year, about 9.30 or 9.45, I was sent for by the Fire Brigade to a small fish shop kept by James Lawrence at 133, Larkhall Lane, Clapham—I went into the front room, first floor, with Mr. Dangerfield, of the Volun<lb></lb>teer Fire Brigade, which is close to the house—I found a bedstead with the tick, apparently without sheets or blankets, and very much burnt—I did not discover the remains of any sheets or blankets—there was a wash<lb></lb>hand stand, very much burnt, close to the bedstead—the room measured about 8 feet by 7—the floor was strewn with paper of a description similar to these advertising placards (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), a great deal of which was very much burnt—I marked this one at the time in the presence of the Fire Brigade—the paper smelt as if paraffin, or some oily substance, had been on it—it has that smell even now—there was a japan wood chest of drawers on the right going into the room, some of which were open, on the top of which I noticed the remains of what appeared to be a paraffin lamp, broken—I discovered the receptacle for the fluid of that lamp—there was a large heap of paper by the drawers, which was not burnt at the bottom, and I think it had caught fire from the top—the door of a cup<lb></lb>board was very much burnt; and in the left-hand corner of the room, at the other side of the fireplace, was a table under which were the re<lb></lb>mains of similar paper, all burnt—there were marks of fire all over the place—there was a quantity of paper on the landing—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a portion of it—it is burnt—I think the door was open, but it had been opened by the firemen—there was no track of paper or of burning from</p>

               <p>one room to the other—on entering the back room I found marks of fire all over the place—the foot boards were very much burnt, and the inside of the door also—under the bed and all over the room was similar paper, very much burnt—I went down stairs to the ground floor, and in a cup<lb></lb>board under the stairs two sticks were put crossways, behind which was piled a lot of broken wood and similar paper, and at the bottom of all was a wicker-work sieve, such as potatoes or vegetables might be put into—it had not been on fire—I saw the prisoner John in the shop, and Mary in the parlour—I asked John where his father was—he said he did not know, he supposed he had gone to get some beer, and that he had not been out himself since 4 o'clock in the afternoon—the fire appeared recent, as far as my judgment goes—I found James Goddard leaving the public-house—he was taken before a Magistrate, and discharged—I asked Mary if she could account for the fire—she said that she had been airing a sheet up stairs in the front bedroom, the room I first described—I said "How can that be; there are no remains of any sheet?"—she did not say that the sheet took fire—she left the rest to inference—they were all three taken to the station, and charged on suspicion of having set fire to the house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This has been standing over so long that my memory is not accurate as to the words—I will not swear that I told the Magistrate about paper being accumulated in a heap, or being under the drawers and bed—the front room is a very short distance from the back room; it is within a foot or two—coming up stairs, there is a door into the front room, facing you—the door of the front room is not opposite the door of the back room; it is angular—the two doors are a foot or a foot and a half apart; but at the other end perhaps it would be 2 feet—the fire was out when I went there—I believe there had been a fire in the grate in the front room—I found similar paper in the shop; it is used for wrapping up fish—the old man told me he used a great deal of paper for that purpose—when I men<lb></lb>tioned the paper having an oily substance on it, he did not say that I was mistaken, and that the oil was from the fish—I do not recollect hearing that remark made by anyone—I do not think I mentioned before the Magistrate that there were two sticks carefully placed in the cupboard—I should think if a match had been set to that the house would nave been burnt down almost directly—it is a very old house—the female prisoner did not tell me that the children had been playing about there the whole day—I have not known the prisoners any time, but occasionally I have seen the male prisoner—I have been told that the female prisoner has grand<lb></lb>children—I have not been told that the children were playing about that very afternoon with paper—if you wish me to tell you what I have been told I will tell you, and that is that they were sent to the theatre—the female prisoner had been drinking.</p>

I live at 28, Clifton Street, Clapham, and am cashier and secretary to the Volunteer Fire Brigade—it is a private society—on 31st January, about 9.50, I went to this fish-shop, and found a mass of something burning on the landing, which prevented my going further—it was a great quantity of paper, like this produced—the front bedroom I could see was alight, but the back bedroom door was closed.</p>

               <p>and am superintendent of the same brigade—on 31st January, about 9.50, I went to the fish-shop—I got there before the secretary—I discovered the fire, and immediately got a hand pump—the shop was entirely open—there is no sash; it is an open front—there were a few fish there—I went half<lb></lb>way up stairs, but could not get further, as the paper was in full blaze—I extinguished it, and went to the front room, and then to the back room—the bed, bedding, and palliasse were well alight—the palliasse was stuffed with straw and shavings—the bedstead was against the wall, and I had to pull it away to get the fire out—there was paper on the bed—the room door was closed when I went in—the bedstead was behind the door; you could only open the door at an angle of 45 degrees, because it came against the bedstead; it partially blocked the door—the paint on the outside of the door, on the landing, was a little blistered by the heat inside—the doors were about an inch and a half thick.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The front room door was open; the back room door was not hasped, but it was to; I can swear it was not open—they are very old doors—I found a good deal of paper in both rooms—when I was lying by the side of the paper it lit up again, and I had to knock it out with my elbow—the bedstead in the front room was six or seven feet from the fire<lb></lb>place—the room is ten or eleven feet broad, and about thirteen feet long—the other room is smaller, because the width of the passage is taken out—paper with oil on it will not blaze rather strongly, it wants a great heat to burn paraffin—other oils will burn and blaze pretty well—paper will burn better with oil on it than without—we have been private firemen since 1866—when I was working on the landing I pushed the back room door open with my elbow a little—going into the front bedroom the fireplace is on the extreme right and the windows in front, one of which was open—the foot of the bed was in front of the fireplace—as far as my judgment goes, there were two independent fires—there was no communication between the two, the door was closed—there was no fire down stairs—the paper was all crumpled up, and put all about the place, under the bed, table, and drawers—I cannot say that there was paper under the bed in the back room, but there was under the wash-hand stand—paper was lying about the well-hole of the stairs—(there is no door to the stairs) that was on fire before I went up, I had to extinguish it before I could get by—the framework of a bed<lb></lb>stead was there, as if for stowage—the fire on the stairs could not communi<lb></lb>cate with the materials in the cupboard beneath until the flooring was burnt away—it appears that this cupboard was used for stowing away wood and paper—I can form no judgment whether the materials were put there carelessly or artificially—I had more to do with the part that was on fire.</p>

                  </hi>. I arrived at this shop at 10.15, and examined the place—I think the fire originated under the table in the right-hand corner of the front bedroom—I asked the prisoner Mary if she had any idea how the fire originated—she said that her husband would lay all the blame on her—I said "How did the fire occur?"—she said that she had been work<lb></lb>ing that day, and had been airing a sheet—I said "Did you air it before the</p>

               <p>fire?"—she said "Yes"—I said "There is no appearance of a sheet here or of what you were airing it upon; a sheet would leave a considerable quan<lb></lb>tity of tinder on the floor"—she said that she could not account for the fire unless the paraffin lamp had exploded—in the meantime her son John came up, and I asked him if he could give me any explanation about the origin of the fire—he said "No; he had not been up stairs since the afternoon"—I told Mary that it looked very bad seeing the quantity of paper there was about—she said that that was all she knew about it—I examined the back room; there had been a quantity of this kind of paper under the bed, and there was some under a wash-hand stand, which was not consumed—I have had twenty-four years' experience of fires—there was no communication be<lb></lb>tween the fire in the front room and the fire in the back room—I think there must have been some active act in either room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I presume one or two people had been in the room before me; water had been used, and the fire was entirely out—when the hose is turned on, the ashes of the paper would be driven before it—the back room is very small, and the bedstead nearly fits it—there was a chair near the front window, which was nearly burnt—the door that was burnt was 3 or 4 feet from the grate—there was no appearance of fire round the grate, but there was a small fire in the grate when I arrived—there was a chair close to the front-room window, 3 or 4 feet from the grate, which was nearly burnt—there are two windows—there was a table in the recess by the fireplace, and paper tinder under it—further on was another table and chair—the table wag between the burnt chair and the fireplace, but in the recess—the under part of the table was scorched—there was plenty of paper on the landing, and plenty in both rooms—Mary had been drinking; in fact all of them had.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It would not have taken long to burn the house down, if a light had been set to the materials in the cupboard—the cupboard was a likely place for them to keep their firewood—I examined under the doors of the front and back-rooms—I do not think the draught from the front room would have ignited the paper on the landing—if such a thing had occurred no doubt the inside of the front room would be scorched—if there had been a width under the door the strongest part of the fire would have been there, and it would have shown itself—the first room door was no doubt open, it was burnt on both sides—you may fairly assume that there was paper close to it, there was charred paper on the landing—there was plenty of paper inside the front room—I can say pretty clearly that the back room door was closed, there was a little scale of paint about the size of a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece on the outside, but I don't think it was through fire—fire would give a little colouring to it—if it was not warm enough to blister it and not discolour—it was blistered—there is a fireplace in that room, facing you as you go in—I do not know whether one of the first room windows was open.</p>

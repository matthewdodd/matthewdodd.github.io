                  </hi>. I am single, and live with my mother, at 1, Winchester-place, Hackney-road. The prisoners live nearly opposite—on Sunday, 13th July, between 12 and 1 o'clock, I was standing at my door, and the female prisoner was at her door—she used bad language to me, and I went across, and asked her why she was using that language to me—she held a poker up, and said, "If you come near me, I will cut you down with this; so help me God, I will kill you!"—she had gone in, and fetched the poker while I was crossing the road—I said, "I have not come to quarrel with you, I have merely come to ask you why you called me those names"—she then struck me on the head with the poker—she struck me a second blow, and that cut my head open, she caught hold of me by the hair, and knocked my bead against the wall—I was bleeding, and was going towards the gate, when the prisoner George met me, threw me down, and kicked me in the stomach and under the jaw—he then hit me about the head and body with his fist—he was in the house when I first went, and came out after Ann had struck me once, when my brother came to help me—I was carried away insensible, and have been under Mr. West's care since—I was in bed until the following Monday week.</p>

I heard parties talking very load, went to the house, and saw the female prisoner standing at the door with this poker in her hand—the male prisoner was a few steps in front of her, and the prosecutrix in front of him—the prosecutrix wished to speak to the husband, and the wife said if she came near she would split her head open—she came forward, and the female prisoner struck her with this piece of iron, which she used as a poker, on the head—I saw the blood flow—the prosecutrix was then crossing the yard with her hair all down, and the male prisoner seised her by the hair, knocked her down, and kicked her twice, and her jaw was coloured by the kick.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 2, King's Arms Cottages, Wandsworth, and am a labourer, working at Mr. Murray's paper mills—on 25th August the prisoner applied for work there—the deceased Schofield was employed there as a gatekeeper at what is called the traffic gate at which the carts pass out—I was working close to the gate—I saw the gate open for some carts to go out; the prisoner, with his hands in his pockets, was walking out, when Schofield shoved him, and kicked his behind—the prisoner had asked him before the gate was opened if he would open the gate to let him out, and he refused—they had two or three words together about it—Schofield said "I shall not open the gate, you will have to go out the same way as you came in"—after Schofield had kicked him the prisoner turned round and struck him in the mouth—I could not say whether it was with his open hand or his fiat; he was stepping off the premises at the time, one foot in, and one foot out, walking out quietly—Schofield kicked up against something, and fell back on some stones close inside the wall—he fell on his face on the left side—I saw him picked up; he was bleeding a little from the mouth.</p>

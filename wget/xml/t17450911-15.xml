Gentlemen, I am quite unacquainted with the proceedings of this court, and therefore I hope you will excuse me if I say any thing that is contrary to the rules of this court. Mr. Davis did come to borrow a razor of me, and while I was with Mr. Blunt I borrowed some razors of him (I think it was some time in October) I would ask Mr. Blunt whether I did not desire to borrow some razors of him? said he, there is a box of old razors, take what you will, and I took three; I was going to get some oil to set them with, and he said he had got something in his house that would do as well, and he lent me that.</p>

               <p>Mr. Cope . I never knew a man of a better character in my life than Mr. Mansell , and that was the reason of my being his bail . Blunt said it might have been made up, if it had not been Mr. Mansell's fault.</p>

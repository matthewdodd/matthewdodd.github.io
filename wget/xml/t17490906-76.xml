            . The prisoner at the bar came into our house July the 10th, between 8 and 9 o'clock, he call'd for a pint of beer, and before I got half way down stairs, he said, I might as well make it a tankard, saying, he had somebody else coming to him; I brought a tankard, and he removed to another table: then he ask'd me, if there was not a founder liv'd in the next court; he said, he was in company with a founder, at the Crown ale-house , a night or two ago; I told him there was one liv'd over the way; he said, that was not the man. Our house was pretty full, and I was busy, so I did not see him or the tankard afterwards: my mistress was not at home.</p>

             . I am a founder; I was drinking at the Crown ale-house , and the prisoner at the bar happen'd to come in, on the 5th of July: I had seen him before in the country, but I had almost forgot him; he ask'd me to drink, he told me he liv'd at Islington, and said he should be glad to spend a penny with me any other time; he said, he would call upon me the next day, but he did not: upon Mr. Handy's being robb'd, a woman came and ask'd, if my master was drinking with a person at the crown, some little time ago: the boy came and describ'd the man to me, then I said, it was myself he meant, for I had drank with him there as before mentioned.</p>

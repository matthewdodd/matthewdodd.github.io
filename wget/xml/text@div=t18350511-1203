                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live at New Brentford. On the might of the 17th of March, I went to see a friend go off for Scotland—I went with him as far as the Salutation, Old Brentford, about three o'clock—I parted with him about six o'clock, close to the Salutation door—I went in and stopped there afterwards; and about seven o'clock I was going home—I was in the street of Brentford, near the Chapel of Ease; I had my hand on my watch, and all in a moment I was accosted by three men—I am postive the prisoner was one of them, he tripped me up, and then he pretended to pick me up, and while he was doing that, he took my watch out of my pocket, and gave it to the other two men, who ran off with it—I secured him—I felt my watch gone in a minute—I had had a glass rather too much, but could conduct myself very well—I had seen the prisoner in the public-house, but whether the other two were there I do not know—it was rather dark in the street—I lost my watch exactly by the free-school, at Old Brentford—Chapel-alley is just by there—I was bruised in the scuffle, and could not lift my arm for a fortnight—that injury was done to me while I was holding the prisoner—it was after I lost the property—he tripped me up with his foot—it was a slight touch—he put his foot out, and I was down and he on me in an instant, just at the corner of the alley—the other two men-came and assisted him, and they ran away with my property—I got up, missed my watch, collared the pri<lb></lb>soner, and he knocked me down, and broke my nose—I am quite sure I did not fall, but was tripped up before I lost my watch—this must be the man that took my watch, as the other two were not close enough to me—I heard the other two say they had <hi rend="italic">"napped</hi>," and it was all right, and off they ran—the prisoner got away from me before the police came up—I held him nearly ten minutes, and then he got away, and absconded for a month nearly—I knew him from a child—I have no doubt at all of him.</p>

On the evening of the 17th of March I was coming through Old Brentford—I saw the prosecutor against the wall, leaning, and the prisoner had hold of him—I did not see him on the ground when I first came up—I saw him against the wall, half down and half up, down the Chapel-alley—I saw him on the ground afterwards—when I first came up, Cook had hold of the prisoner, and said he had robbed him of his watch and money—in the struggle they had got about two yards up the alley, a little way, and in the straggle they came back again—the prisoner knocked him down—Cook caught hold of him, and collared him for ten mi<lb></lb>nutes—no policeman came up—I went up to the prisoner and told him not to ill-use him any more, for it would be worse for him—the prisoner said he would go to the station-house; ho would not be searched by such a man as that—Cook let go of him; he went up towards New Brentford, and the prisoner went the other way—I had had three or four pints of beer that night, and was a little in liquor—the prisoner said, if an officer had collared him, he would go to the station-house and be searched, but he would not be collared by Cook—there were a good many people round, who kept hallooing to him to <hi rend="italic">mug</hi> him.</p>

I am a baker, of 81, Hammersmith Road—on the night of 7th October Harcourt came into my shop—he said "I am assistant to Dr. Walker, and am sent by him to change this cheque; a patient has called to pay an account, and he requires change, but the doctor has no change, and knowing you, he asks you to change the cheque for him"—Dr. Walker is a customer of mine.

I will go with you"—I found on him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 0¾<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in bronze, and a small bottle containing some fluid; also a railway ticket, and a ticket for a bag left at the Aldgate Railway Station—I went there with it and got the bag, in which I found this soft felt hat.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Star-court. On the 1st of June between eleven and one o'clock in the night, I was in Plumber-street, St. Giles, taking a walk after my work—the prisoner Brennan came up to me, complained of being very badly off, said she had no candles or firing, and would I give her a halfpenny to buy a candle with—I gave her one—she did not leave me—presently Thacker came up with a key in her hand—she said she was her sister—she complained of being very badly off, and asked if I would come borne with them—I said I had no objection, and we went home—we did not stop long in the house, for I said we would take a walk out, and I would treat them with something to eat and drink—we went to the public-house at the corner of Plumber-street, had three pints of porter and a quar<lb></lb>tern of gin—we returned home in a short time with a pot of porter—some<lb></lb>thing took place between us—they then demanded some money—I gave them 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I then wished to go home—they said I should not go out of the house without I gave them more money—(I had three sovereigns, half-a-crown, two shillings, and some coppers in my possession when I returned to the house)—I said I thought I had given them enough, and wanted to go home—they began ill-using me, and pulled me about—Thacker told Brennan to bold me tight—she then went into an adjoining room, and brought in a man about five feet six high—he had a cloth in one hand and a weapon in the other—Brennan got me into the corner—the candle was blown out, and the man came towards me—he put the cloth up to my mouth, and the weapon be<lb></lb>fore my face—one girl held me very tight, while the other picked my pocket of two pence and a sixpence—the cloth stopped my breath—I got the wea<lb></lb>pon away from my mouth as well as I could, and in doing so cut three fingers—I made an alarm as well as I could, and made a little escape from the corner I was in—they tore my coat in my getting away—I seized a quart pot, and perhaps hit the man—he gave way a little—I went into the adjoining room—the girls pulled my coat-skirt off—I received a kick and a blow on my shoul<lb></lb>ders, which I have not recovered, and a blow on the left side of my face—I held the door as well as I could, the girls pulling me back—I was almost exhausted—when I got to the stair-case I got hold of the landing—it was on the second pair—the girls still kept hold of me, till I saw the policeman</p>

               <p>coming up stairs—the man escaped—I said, "For God's sake, policeman, do come here, I shall be murdered!"—I could hardly stand at the time—he asked what was the matter—I was a good while before I could tell him—I only lost 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I saved my three sovereigns and a half-crown—it was in an inside pocket, which they did not get at—the policeman took the pri<lb></lb>soners.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I heard cries of "Murder," and "Police," in Buckeridge-street, St. Giles's—I went upstairs, and met the prosecutor on the stairs with a quart pot in his hand—he said, "For God's sake, police, come, or I shall be murdered"—I returned with him into the room, and, saw the two prisoners in the middle of the room—it was in a state of confusion—he said they had been ill-using and robbing him, and I took them—I saw nothing of the man—I produce the coat the prosecutor had on.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he go there on the 12th with a shoulder of mutton? - A. I do not know, I am not clerk.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you on that day happen to be in your shop when he came back from Mr. Hutchinson to your shop for some meat for him? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember what he said? - A. I do not indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver to him, or was any meat delivered to him, to take to Mr. Hutchinson? - A. I cannot say, the business I do; I cannot say I am sure.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You do not know whether you sell a pound of meat in a week or not? - A. I only know I sell a great deal.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You have a daughter that makes out your bills? - A. My daughter is the only person that makes out all my bills.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive from him, after he had been to Mr. Hutchinson's, (supposing he had been there) the sum of 17 s. 2 d.? - A. No, by no means.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You do not know that any meat at all was delivered to Mr. Hutchinson from the prisoner? - A. Oh, dear me, to be sure I do not; I should be very wrong if I said so I am sure; I declare I do not.</p>
               <p>- HUTCHINSON sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Do you live in his Majesty's house at Kew? - A. I do; Mr. Newman is my butcher.</p>

               <p>Q. You have a bill in your hand which will tell you the date? - A. Yes; on the 12th of January.</p>
               <p>Q. You see the last article in that bill is dated the 12th of January? - A. That makes me remember that a shoulder of mutton was brought to me when he first brought the bill with the meat, it amounted to 11 s. 10 d. I ordered him to take the bill back and bring a receipt to the bill, the bill having no receipt, and to bring a shoulder of mutton, and include that in the bill; he came, I think, the next day, with the shoulder of mutton, and the bill as it now stands; when he brought the shoulder of mutton, that was the day I paid him, and he brought the receipt that is now with it; I paid him 17 s. 10 d.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was it 17 s. 10 d. or 17 s. 2 d.? - A. 17 s. 10 d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. You have no recollection of this transaction except as you derive it from that bill - was this the last bill you ever paid? - A. This is the last bill I ever paid him; I recollect having some conversation with him; he brought the bill without a receipt the first time he brought it, and when I paid him, I paid him 17 s. 10 d. I told him I would not pay him without the receipt, and when he brought the receipt, I recollect paying it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. What age are you? - A. I am in my eighty-seventh year.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You assist in your father's business? - A. I do, I make out his bills.</p>
               <p>Q. Just look at that bill - is any part on that bill your hand-writing? - A. The three first articles, the 11 s. 10 d. is my hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the last article 5 s. 4 d. for the shoulder of mutton your hand-writing? - A. It is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the words at the bottom of the receipt, paid, P. Newman, your hand-writing? - A. It is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner at the bar coming back to you for a shoulder of mutton? - A. I cannot say I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he bring you back 17 s. 2 d. or any other sum of money, from Mr. Hutchinson? - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you mean to say that he brought you no part, not even the 11 s. 10 d.? - A. Not any.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you, either on that day, or on any other day, ask him any questions respecting the money from Mr. Hutchinson? - A. I asked him if Mr. Hutchinson had paid him any money, he said, no.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that after he had taken in that bill of 11 s. 10 d.? - A. I cannot say that I did ask him about that bill.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after the delivery of that bill was he taken up? - A. About a fortnight after; I do not remember having any conversation with him about it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You do not remember the shoulder of mutton being delivered to him? - A. I cannot say that I do.</p>
               <p>Q. You sent him out for orders, and when he came home you took minutes in your book of those orders? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got that book here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, in fact, you do not know of any of these things being delivered? - A. I believe them to be delivered.</p>
               <p>Q. This fact is clear, that the goods and the shoulder of mutton were delivered; whether delivered from your shop or another shop, that is another thing - Did you ever see the prisoner write? - A. I cannot swear to that writing, I have seen him write.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Prosecutor.) How soon did you discover this last bill of Mr. Hutchinson having been paid to the prisoner? - A. I should think in about two weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you question him about the subject? - A. Some trifle my son did, he never denied it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him it would be better if he would tell you? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. There is not sufficient evidence to go to a Jury upon the delivery of the articles themselves; there is no proof at all of any of the articles coming from their shop, only that they were delivered to Mr. Hutchinson by this person.</p>
               <p>Court. There is certainly a point which I do not take upon myself to decide in the Court; and though I should be clearly of your opinion, and in favour of the prisoner, yet it is a point of so much consequence to the public, perhaps the discussion of it may do a great deal of harm; I will take the opinion of the Jury upon that fact - the delivery of the goods.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. That is a fact, the delivery of the goods.</p>

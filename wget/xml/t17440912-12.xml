            . The Prisoner came into my father's shop between 7 and 8 at night and asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174409120006"></xptr> for some ribbon: I pulled out a drawer, and she not liking them, I pulled out another drawer, and she bid me cut her a yard of a brown ribbon; and as I was a stooping to take some paper from under the counter to put it up in, I saw something in her left hand, which I thought was a piece of ribbon. A young gentlewoman who has lived with us six years, saw her take it out of the drawer and put it into her left side pocket; we had a suspicion of her before, so we watched her. I let her go out of the shop and then followed her and brought her back, and told her she had got a piece of ribbon. Says she, why should you think so? I was afraid it being night that she should drop it, and I said to her, I am determined you shall not drop it upon the ground; but she found means to throw the ribbon away, and I found it upon the counter.</p>

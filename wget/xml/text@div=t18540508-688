I keep a beer shop—on 19th April, between 11 and 12 o'clock, the prisoner came and called for half a pint of porter—he threw down half a crown of the reign of William the Fourth—I put it in my pocket, where I had no other half crown, and gave him change—he left the house after he had drank the porter—in about an hour after he was gone, another man came and called for half a pint of porter, and threw down a half crown of the reign of Victoria—I put it in the same pocket where I put the first—I had no other half crown at all—I had not taken any other half crown from the time the prisoner came till the second man came—in the evening the prisoner came again, about half past 9 o'clock or a quarter before 10, he called for half a pint of porter, and threw down a sixpence, which was bad—I closed the door, and sent for a constable—I charged the prisoner with the half crown being bad that he passed in the morning—he denied passing it, and said that the sixpence was good—I gave him in charge, and gave the sixpence and the William the Fourth half crown which the prisoner had uttered, to the constable—I gave the Victoria half crown which the other man gave me, to the Serjeant at the station, the same night.</p>

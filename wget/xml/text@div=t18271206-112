On the 20th of November, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning, a gentleman came to the foot of the stairs, and said, "Come down, Mrs. Acles, and bring some money;" I put my hand into my trunk, took out my money, and went down - I saw Mr. Hurst, who said, "I want two sovereigns and a half to pay for some ballast;" I put down two sovereigns and a half on the counter - the prisoner came in at the time, and, in stepping back, I dropped a sovereign from the paper in my hand; I saw the prisoner stoop and take up something - I said, "Mrs. Mills, that is my sovereign, give it me" - she said, "No, it was a half-penny" - I said, "No, it is my sovereign" - she said,"You old cat it is well come to your time to have a sovereign;" I said, "Mrs. Mills, give me my sovereign" - she said, "You old cat, I did not rob you of your sovereign, I picked it up, and all you can demand is half of it, and I will spend the other half jolly with you:" the gentleman of the house then said, it might have gone down in the cellar - I said No, but he took a light, and went down - when he came up he said no such thing had dropped there; the prisoner was then gone; I had given two sovereigns and a half to Mr. Hurst, and had the other sovereign to wrap up in the paper. I went and got the officer, and took the prisoner; she pushed and shoved me about, and would have beat me but for a gentleman - she was sober.</p>

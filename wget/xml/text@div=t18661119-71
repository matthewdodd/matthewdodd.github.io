I keep the Railway Tavern, Richmond—on 14th November, about half-past eleven at night, the prisoners brought in a Richmond man, named Henry Littlewood, whom I had known for years, to treat him—Barton called for a quartern of rum, which came to six-pence, and gave me a bad florin—I said directly, "This is bad; have you any more of these?"—none of them answered, they appeared to take no notice of what I was saying—I said, "Give me good coin, and get off the premises, or the police will have you; and if you are not out directly I shall lock you up myself"—Barford gave me a good shilling, and I gave him sixpence change—I asked Littlewood if he knew them—he said, "No; they merely asked me to come and have a glass of some-thing to drink"—they were all present then—a policeman then came and called me out on the private side, and I told him to lock them up—I slightly bent the florin—Barford took it up, and it was found on him afterwards.</p>

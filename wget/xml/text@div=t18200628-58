On the 18th of June, about half past one o'clock at night, I was returning from a society of which I am a member, and was rather the worse for liquor. When I got to St. Paul's Church-yard, I met the prisoner, who offered to conduct me home. I accepted his offer, but was able to go alone. Instead of his taking me to my door, I found myself in <placeName id="t18200628-58-crimeloc324">Knight Rider-court</placeName>

I immediately felt and missed my watch, collared him, and charged him with taking it. The watchman came and found it in his pocket.</p>

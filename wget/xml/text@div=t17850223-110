               <p>- BROWN sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 30th of January, about two minutes after six. I was going to take the relief out, and I had got about half way to the place, to relieve the first sentry in Scotland Yard, and I met the prisoner with the trunk; two men passed me in a great hurry, and the prisoner was behind them with the trunk; I stopped the prisoner, he never got from me, I took him to the Guard-room, and down to the Savoy Barracks, to the serjeant who belonged to the regiment, to know how we should act with him; and I took him to Sir Sampson's, with the same trunk; this is the trunk.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. It was six in the evening you say? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many went by before you saw the prisoner? - I saw two pass me in a very great hurry, the prisoner had it in his hand, I took it out of his hand, he had got it upon the ground on the end; he said he met some men, and he asked them what they were going to do with that trunk, and he said some of them knocked him down directly, he did not make any resistance, he did not say that he hoped to have any of the reward, if the rogues were taken.</p>
               <p>Did you ask him to leave the trunk in your hands? - No.</p>
               <p>Did your fellow soldiers, in your hearing? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not he say, that he recovered it from the persons that were running on before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Recollect if he did not say he hoped for some of the reward? - I never did hear him say so.</p>
               <p>Court to Dixon. Did you desire the prisoner to go away and leave the trunk in your hands, and he refused? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to the Corporal. In what posture was the prisoner when you first saw him? - The trunk was an end, and he had the handle in his hand, and I took it from him, he just stood still; I met him at the corner of a narrow passage.</p>
               <p>Then at the time you first saw him, he was standing still? - Yes.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. I have at least twenty more.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, under the circumstances in which this man is described, and immediately saying he had stopped somebody with the trunk; a man of bad character could hardly be convicted on that evidence: but where a man appears<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230167"></xptr> to have a good character, there can be no doubt.</p>

            </rs>.</p>
               <p>Court. It is but justice to that man, to say, that I do not believe he was the man that took the trunk, and I think there is no imputation upon him, from this charge.</p>
               <p>Tried by the first Middlesex Jury before Mr. RECORDER.</p>

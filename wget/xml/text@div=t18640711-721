                  </hi>. I am now valet to Mr. Beresford Hope—in November last I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Teleqraph;</hi> it was something about getting employment for people—there was a reference in it to Mr. Magarigle, 1, Farringdon-road—consequence of that advertisement I went there, and saw the prisoner Magarigle—I went there there several times—there was an office there on the first floor, and a sort of private room adjoining and another private room upstairs over that—I don't know whether Magarigle's name was up; there were several names both on the window and on the side of the door—I told Magarigle I was looking out for, employ<lb></lb>ment, and if he could assist me in obtaining such I should feel obliged, or</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186407110056"></xptr>
               <p>something to that effect—I don't know that I pointed out the advertisement at that time—I told him I had got a little money, and if he could assist me in investing it I should be obliged—he said that he could obtain me a situation, and mentioned Mr. Broughton's name—he said that Mr. Broughton was publishing a directory at Sydenham, and he wanted such an one as myself, and he thought the place would suit me and I should suit the place—he advised me to go down to Sydenham and see Mr. Broughton, and he gave me the address, "Paxton Park, Sydenham"—he said that Mr. Broughton would require a deposit of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot say exactly what was stated then—nothing more took place at that interview—the following day I went down to Sydenham—I found Paxton-park; it is in Lower Sydenham; it is a sort of street formed with no outlet at the end—I made inquiries for Mr. Broughton, and found he was living in a house there—I told him I had come about the situation Magarigle had mentioned to me, and he made an appointment to meet me at Magarigle's—I cannot say exactly what passed between me and Broughton at that interview—he told me the nature of the work I should have to do—he said I should have to assist him in getting the directory for Norwood and Penge, and all round there.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was anything said about you having to collect money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he said he was a debt-collector as well, and I should have to collect a good many debts—nothing was mentioned about the money on that occasion—a few days afterwards I went by appointment to Magarigle's office, in Farringdon-road, and saw him and Broughton there—we went into Magarigle's private room—Broughton stated the nature of what I was to have to do; that I was to receive 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week to commence with, and wanted me to be bound for twelve mouths—Magarigle took down in writing the terms which Mr. Broughton offered, to enable him to draw an agreement out—Magarigle said, "By-the-bye, you will want a deposit," and Broughton said, "Yes, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said I should have a deal of money to collect on account of the directory, likewise to collect debts; and he had a tradesman's book with him, which he showed me, and said, "You will have a good many of these to collect"—there were names and amounts—I said I should be prepared to deposit the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told Magarigle that if I deposited my money I ought to have security—he said he did not suppose that I should get consols for my security—Broughton was not present at that time—Magarigle said if I left the case in his hands he would see that I was righted, so that in case of Mr. Broughton's death, or anything occurring to him, he would get a man to stand in with him in the agreement, to sign the agreement—I did not agree to go into the employment for a month in the first instance—at first, when the draft of the agreement was made out, it was for twelve months, and he told me to sign that the same evening; and he said, "It is merely to authorize me to draw the agreement"—that was a memorandum—I signed it with the understanding that it was merely to authorize him to draw the agreement out—this agreement (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was afterwards prepared—I signed this about the end of November, at Magarigle's office—Broughton was present when I signed it, and he also signed it—Keighley was there; he was introduced by Broughton as a respectable tradesman—it is witnessed by J. Magarigle and E. H. Keighley—at that time I told them that I did not think I should like the work, and I would rather give it up altogether—that was before I signed this agreement, and after I had signed the other, which was in Magarigle's possession—Broughton said I had put him to great inconvenience; he had lost his time, and it was some expense coming up and down by the train, and that he had provided a respectable tradesman to sign with him, and he was prepared to sign then—Magarigle said I was putting him to inconvenience as well, because he thought Mr. Broughton's place would exactly suit me, and he had turned two others off—I offered to go and find one or both of those parties for them, but they said they did not consider that would be business-like, after they were once turned off that they should be sent after again—Broughton then left, saying to Magarigle, "Never mind, I will see about it in a different way"—I took that at the time as a threat to take legal proceedings against me, because I had signed the other paper—when he had gone out I asked Magarigle what Broughton meant, and he did not appear to know, but brought up the other paper that I had signed before, and said, "Here is your own signature"—I said when I signed that paper he told me it was merely a formal affair, to enable him to draw the agreement out, and asked him what I had better do—he said he had been telling me several times what I ought to do, trying to get me out of the scrape, that I should enter into the engagement with Mr. Broughton for a month, and at the end of any week I could give notice to go; he could provide Mr. Broughton with another man to succeed me, that man should have 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposited, and if I failed in getting my 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Broughton, I should have that 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I should be doubly righted—I then signed the agreement; it was altered from twelve months to one month by Magarigle, at his office, in the presence of Broughton and myself—Keighley was not there then; he came in afterwards—I wanted Magarigle to sign it as a witness—he did not appear to like that much; however he did afterwards—when Keighley came in, Broughton said to him, "This is considerably altered"—he looked over it and said, "Yes, I observe it is"—Broughton said, "Will you sign it?"—Keighley asked whether he should get into trouble about it, or something like that—Broughton said, "No," and then Keighley wrote his name at the back, and this, "In the event of Mr. Broughton not fulfilling this agreement, I undertake to do so. E. H. Keighley"—that is Keighley's writing—I afterwards paid Magarigle 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was a cheque drawn by Lord Fortescue—I proposed to take it to Coutts's bank to have it changed, but Magarigle said as he paid his bankers for cashing his cheques it would save trouble, and he would undertake it, and Broughton agreed that that should be done—"This agreement is a receipt for the money," is written on the agreement—on 1st December I went down to Sydenham for the purpose of fulfilling my engagement—I took lodgings there at a beerhouse, just at the corner of Paxton-park—I remained down there eleven weeks—I did not see any office there; Broughton lived in a house—I saw him from time to time, and went to his house, and he some<lb></lb>times called upon me at my lodgings—I was employed to take down the names and addresses of the inhabitants of Penge, Lower Norwood, and Upper Norwood—he said he was going to publish a directory of that district—I wished to leave as I did not like the work, and I asked Magarigle on several occasions to find a substitute for me—I gave Broughton the due no<lb></lb>tice, a month's notice, I believe the first Saturday after I went there—no sub<lb></lb>stitute was found—I did not get any salary while I was there—I was expecting to leave at the month's end—I did not ask for any salary—I had several interviews with Magarigle, and he told me that as I had not paid my commission for getting the situation, he had not exerted himself in getting a substitute—I had written to him previous to that, and said that if he had told me I would have paid it at once—I had not got the money with me at the time, but I called the following morning and paid him a guinea—before that I received this account for one guinea in this letter, asking me to forward the amount of the enclosed account—I got no receipt for that guinea, some other part; was in the office at the time—Magarigle then said he would exert himself to find a substitute; no substitute was found—I told them I was very anxious to get away, as I wanted to go into service again, and that was the time of the year gentlemen's service was to be obtained—I said I was doing no good to myself down at Sydenham—I never got my 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, back—I left in February—I was there eleven weeks and three or four days—I stopped till the Saturday—I did not ask for the money exactly—I understood that Magarigle was to find this substitute to go on with Broughton's work, and I asked several times if he was forthcoming—on the last occasion when I called upon Magarigle, he put his hand upon my shoulder, threatened to turn me out of his house, and forbade me to come again—that was because I annoyed him about this substitute—he said he had never been annoyed so much in his life by anybody—that was the last occasion I was there—(<hi rend="italic">The agreement was read, dated 28th November, and was between William Broughton of Paxton Park, and Colin McVean, who was to have </hi>78<hi rend="italic">l. a year, payable monthly, and to give one month's notice if he wished to terminate the engagement It contained a receipt for the money paid, and a guarantee signed by Broughton and witnessed by Magarigle and Keighley</hi>)—I got 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Broughton after I left; that is all I received.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 23, St. Mark's-crescent, Clarendon-road—at the end of January, or beginning of February last, in consequence of seeing an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph,</hi> I went to Magarigle's office in Farringdon-road, Snow-hill—I saw him, and asked what the busi<lb></lb>ness was—he said to establish a local paper; that he was acquainted with, a gentleman at Sydenham of the name of Broughton, a person of very great influence, who was well known to all the gentry and clergy in the district, and he thought there was a great prospect of its success—he said that Mr. Broughton had brought out a directory—I said I did not think the prospects of a local paper were very good alone—he said it was not to establish the paper alone, but also to establish a house and land agency business—I was to pay 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down, and to receive 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month, 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I entered into a written agreement after I had seen Broughton—I saw him first at Magarigle's office—I asked him the nature of the business; he said he thought it would be a very good thing, but the business part of the arrangements he could not speak to me about, that was Magarigle's affair—this is the agreement that was entered into between us, dated 11th Febru<lb></lb>ary. 1864—it was drawn up partly by my solicitor, Mr. Jackson, of Lincoln's-inn-fields, from instructions given to me in the first instance—I paid 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on deposit before the agreement was entered into, and after it was signed I paid Magarigle 190<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in Broughton's presence—security was mentioned beforehand; I wanted to know what security I should have for the money—Magarigle said, "Well, that is rather a difficult matter; I can't offer you consols, or anything of that sort; if I produce two first-class tradesmen, you will be satisfied with that?"—I said, "Yes, I should be satisfied"—he agreed to provide one security and Broughton was to provide the other—Magarigle introduced me to Mr. Cox—I went with him somewhere to the other side of Blackfriars-bridge, to Cox's barge-yard, I think, in Wharf-road—when I had got Cox's signature, I said, "It remains now for Mr. Brough<lb></lb>ton to get his security," and when I called at the office Magarigle said that Broughton's security had been and signed the bill—when they gave me the bill there was Mr. Keighleys name on it—I cannot remember that Magarigle said who Keighley was: I never saw him till he was in Court the other day—after signing the agreement, and paying the money, I went to the office in Farringdon-road for two or three days and Magarigle told me I had better go round to the different house-agents, and ascertain what property was to be let about Sydenham and that neighbourhood—I had my salary paid regularly every month—I went on 11th February, and left about a month before this case came before the Court—I had three payments of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—I have not received any portion of the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. except that—I left in cones<lb></lb>quence</p>

I have been in the army; I am nothing at present—in March last I saw this advertisement in the paper: "Traveller and collector wanted in a suburban office, must be steady, and a member of the Church of England, and must be able to deposit 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cash as security. The situation will be permanent and lucrative"—I am a member of the Church of England—I also had a little money—I went to Farringdon-road, and saw Magarigle—he said that Broughton had a situation that would suit me very well as clerk and collector of the <hi rend="italic">Sydenham Chronicle,</hi> that he was a most respectable man, and every one lifted their hats to him down at Sydenham—he said cash security would be required from 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not pay anything that day—next day I paid 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit, and got this receipt from Magarigle (<hi rend="italic">Read: "22d March,</hi> 1864, <hi rend="italic">Received of Mr. Fowler, </hi>5<hi rend="italic">l. on account of Mr. Broughton at Sydenham, and having an agreement between them, as per instructions.

I am now a licensed victualler in the Edgware-road—at the beginning of August, I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph,</hi> and went to Magarigle's office in Farringdon-road—I saw him, and told him I called in reference to an advertisement I had seen in the paper, requiring a person to take charge in the absence of the principal, and to invest 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I afterwards entered into this agreement, dated 17th August—it is signed by myself and Magarigle, and witnessed by Mr. Cox, and there is this at the end for security, "We, the undersigned, become security for Mr. Maga<lb></lb>rigle in the sum of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. referred to in the foregoing agreement.

                  </hi>. I carry on business as a coal merchant, at 2, Wharf-road, King's-cross—I know Magarigle and Keighley—I first knew Magarigle about October, 1861—he was then trading as Smith, Barry, and Co. as an advertising agent and promoter of partnerships—I was introduced by him to Keighley in 1861—since April or May, 1862, Keighley has been carrying on business in six or seven different names.</p>

I was entrusted with a warrant for the apprehension of Keighley—I went with Mr. Burton and the last witness, and saw Keighley at the corner of Moorgate-street and London-wall—when he saw us he ran away—I pursued him and caught him in Leatherseller's-buildings, London-wall—I took him to the station, and then went to his lodgings at 10, St. James's-road, Holloway—there was no name on the door—I found a quantity of papers—I found this book in a desk at the Bedford Pantechnicon—I found on Keighley two blank cheques on the London and Westminster Bank, and this paper relating to some furniture at the Bedford Pantechnicon—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Bedford Pantechnicon, June 19th, 1864. Received of Mr. Keighley 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account, as delivered for J. Tingey. Geo.

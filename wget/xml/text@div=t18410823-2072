                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother William—we live in Peerless-place, City-road, and are butchers. On the evening of the 10th of July, the prisoner came to the shop with another female—the pri<lb></lb>soner asked for 1lb. of mutton chops, and she paid 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them—di<lb></lb>rectly they were gone I missed a piece of loin of mutton—I ran out and overtook them about fifty yards off—I accused them of taking it—they denied it—I requested them to lift up their arms, which they did, and it was not there—a gentleman who came by, pointed my attention to the mutton, which was at their feet—I cannot say which of them took it, but the other offered me a sovereign to say no more about it—I believe the words were, "Let us have no more <hi rend="italic">bother</hi> about it"—I took them back, and gave them in charge—as they were going to the station, some persons interfered and rescued them both.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable G</hi> 112.) I received charge of the pri<lb></lb>soner and another woman—I am certain the prisoner is one of them—I had not seen her before—when I got about twenty yards from the shop the prisoner had a basket in her hand, and she struck me with it vio<lb></lb>lently on the head, the contents of it came over me, and with her other hand she tried to take hold of my person—a man pinioned my two arms behind, and three or four more pressed me, and both the women es<lb></lb>caped—as soon as I was let go, I followed the same way I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner run, and in about ten minutes 1 found her in the parlour of a beer-shop—I said, "I am very glad to come up with you"—she denied that she was the person, but I knew she was—I sent for assistance to the sta<lb></lb>tion,</p>

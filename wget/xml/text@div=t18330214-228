On the 14th of February, I got an officer, and went to his house; I there found this piece of cloth, which I know to be mine - the prisoner denied it, and said he had bought it in Oxford-street, but afterwards he said he thought it was mine - that he had put into his pocket to do a job to some nobleman's carriage, and had forgotten to take it out of his pocket again; but he had no business with it, as he is not employed in that way - I found this patent washer-cutter there and some other things; this cutter has my initials on it - I found this file, these brads, and other articles; I found this wrench, which he acknowledged to be mine; he said he had had it upwards of six months to do a job, and had forgotten to return it - these two knives and a fork have the name of Gurney, of Maidstone, on them, and I bought them there by chance - the value of the property is about 100l.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Might he have had these things for use, and not returned them? A. I found part of my property working up for other persons; he ought not to have worked for other persons - he told me he was satisfied with his wages, and did not wish to work over-time.</p>

             (Police-serjeant D). I took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This washer-cutter my master gave me to use, and said if I lost it he should expect another made - I could not use it, and he got me a new one made; I took the wrench in my pocket on the Saturday before to work at the other shop; I took it to my house to take the next morning - I took the piece of cloth to finish a gentleman's carriage, and there is grease on it now; I did not say I bought it, my wife said she thought I had - these brads and screws are what I bought before I went to the prosecutor; I was out of a situation four months, and worked for different stable-keepers, in repairing carriages.</p>
               <p>MR. HOADLEY. He was a coach-maker's labourer, not a coach-maker; I should not think he could repair carriages; he stated that he bought near a thousand nails and brads at the same place where he said he bought this file, but they do not sell files there; I lost some thousands of screws in whole papers, and these papers were found at his house.</p>

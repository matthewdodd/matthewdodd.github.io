               <p>Q. They have no shop-mark? - A. No; one of them is a very particular one; the object is let in different to what they generally are, and the eyeglass is larger than it ought to be; I have no doubt of their being mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. A boy gave me these glasses to have a glass put in; and when I went into the shop, I could not find any body, and I came out again, and then that gentleman laid hold of me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

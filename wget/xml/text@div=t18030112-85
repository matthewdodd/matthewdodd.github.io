               <p>Q. Do you recollect having been at Cock and Bell public-house on Monday night? - A. Yes, from seven till about ten; I saw the prisoner there in the course of the evening, but not so late as that.</p>

            ? - A. Yes, very well; he was there when I went in; the prisoner came in after me, but I cannot tell how long.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there other persons in the company of the prisoner? - A. He was in company with another gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any conversation about a wager of a guinea that evening? - A. Not to my know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180301120053"></xptr>ledge; the prisoner and another man came in, and had six pennyworth of gin and water, after that they had another, and then went away; in a very short time after the prisoner came in again, and looked round for a seat,one of the witnesses would not let him sit down by him, and I said come here, upon which he put his hand to his side and said some of you shall have the contents of this.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what is was? - A. I did not properly see the rights of the property; a little while after I got up and stood at the bar door, and there was an argument between him and Mr. Telfar, and he went up towards him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that after he said some of you shall have the contents of this? - A. I think it might be about five minutes; the deceased was getting up to go out of doors, and before he could get out, somebody shoved him against Mr. Tier; he immediatlely turned round and went to the end of the settle and drew a knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Goldsmith near the settle at that time? - A. No, he was going out at the door; the prisoner 
               <persName id="t18030112-85-person627">drew</persName>
             a knife, and said any body that offended him should have the contents of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner sober or not? - A. He was not sober, nor he was not drunk he was about half and half; Goldsmith then came back, went to the site place and caught hold of either the tongs or the poker, I don't know which; he immediately went round after the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no outcry in the company, upon his producing his knife? - A. No, I did not hear any body say any thing; Goldsmith went round the settle after the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the way to go into the street? - A. Yes, Goldsmith went after him; in a very short time the deceased cried out he is in me; upon that alarm one of the witnesses went to assist in getting the knife out of the man's body; he was led back into the tap-room, and said he was given me the contents of the knife; he unbuttoned his waistcoat, pulled up his shirt, and there was his bowels in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there been any violence offered to the prisoner before that? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Do you mean to say no violence was offered to him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not a shove against him so violent as to make him reel against the kitchen grate? - A. It did not bruise him.</p>
               <p>Q.Perhaps your memory will serve you to say that the majority of the company were calling out poker him, poker him? - A. I did not hear any body call out poker him.</p>
               <p>Q. I should rather suspect you were not sober? - A. Yes I was, I had only had a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been in the house? - A. I suppose about an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect what time you came in? - A. No; I did not look at the dial.</p>

The landlord of the house, he is here; the landlord said, part of the guinea was spent in punch, and the parties must settle it among themselves for he had nothing to do with it; I know no more that passed between the parties till afterwards; Mr. Tier and me were having some words together, he was very near the table by the fire, and during that time somebody pushed Goldsmith against Tier.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had Goldsmith been in the house? - A. I did not observe, nor did I know the man. Tier made a stagge against the fire-place, whether he sell or not I do not know, but he staggered; after which Tier withdrew to the corner of the settle, and then it was I saw the knife.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of a knife wa it? - A. A large knife, apparently a butcher's knife; some voices in the room then called out, knock him down, he has got a knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say any thing first? - A. He said something, but what it was I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Q. More than one? - A. Yes; upon that Goldsmith ran towards the fire, and caught up the tongs; he followed the prisoner into the passage, with the tongs before him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to him? - A. Not that I heard; in a few seconds, or a minutes, I heard the unfortunate man say, he is in me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. At this time the prisoner was in his working dress, a a butcher; he had his blue apron on, had he not? - A. I have not a doubt but he had.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You are the landlord of the Cock and Bell public-house? - A. Yes; I recollect seeing the prisoner and the deceased there, about half past seven o'clock in the evening; the prisoner and a cheesemonger called for sixpenny worth, and two pipes of tobacco, which I served them with, and the prisoner addressed himself to me respecting returning him a guinea, which he had left with me to make good a bet some time before; I told him I could not say any thing to it without the other parties were present, that they had seven shilling worth of punch out of it, and if he chose ot wait, I dared to say the other parties would no tbe long before they came; just as I said that, they came in; and I said to the prisoner, here they are, settle it with them, and whatever you agree to I have no objection; the prisoner after that, had a few words with Mr. Telfar, paid the reckoning, and left the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether he had any knife with him or not? - A. I did not see any with him then In the course of five minutes, he returned into the house by himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether he had a knife when he returned? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q.Before he left the house, the first time, did he say for what purpose he left it? - A. No; I conceived he was gone home; when he returned, he called for a pint of porter, and change for a sevenshilling-pieces, and set himself down by the side of Povey, when a conversation took palce between him and Mr. Telfar, respecting his going and making a complaint about having some wine at my house; Mr. Telfar accused him of having asserted it, he denied it, and a person was sent for to prove it; just as the person came in, and the question was put, the prisoner arose from his seat, went across the tap-room to continue the conversation across the table, and after some words between Mr. Telfar and him, the prisoner put himself in a position for fighting; I was in my bar, but I turned round, and saw the prisoner in the attitude for fighting, and doubling his sist.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen any attempt made by any person to offer violence to him before you saw him in that attitude? - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that effort towards fighting the first attempt towards riot you saw in the room? - A. Yes; in consequence of his being in that position, somebody shoved the deceased against him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body attempt to shove him, or assault him, before he stood in that position? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who it was that shoved the deceased against him? - A. No; because the settle prevented my seeing.</p>
               <p>Q. When the deceased was shoved against him, what did you see? - A. The prisoner see backwards towards the fire-place, and the deceased with him; the prisoner was next the fire-place, but neither of them fell, they only staggered with the shove against the fire-place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing on receiving the shove? - A. He returned to the corner of the settle, and 
               <persName id="t18030112-85-person630">drew</persName>
             a knife; I did not see him draw it, but I saw him with it in his hand, holding it out towards the company, and exclaiming some words which I cannot repeat perfectly, but it was, that if they came near him again, they should have the contents of the knife, or something of that kind; I think they were very aggaravating words, and holding the knife in his hand; immediatley there was a hue and cry, he has drawn a knife; the general voice prevailed.</p>
               <p>Q. That was after he 
               <persName id="t18030112-85-person631">drew</persName>
             the knife, and held it in that menacing poisition? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What else did they say? - A.Knock him down, or knock it out of his hand, I cannot say which, they might say both.</p>
               <p>Q. Did more than one person say it? - A. Yes, the general voice; more than one, two, or three; according to the best of my opinion, I think it was, knock him down; and the deceased immediately turned towards the fire-place for the poker, or tongs, I don't know which, but he took up the tongs, and appeared to me to follow the prisoner behind the settle.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you enabled to ascertain for what purpose he followed him? - A. I should suppose to knock him down, or to knock his knife down; almost instantly that he went behind the settle, I heard the deceased cry out, he is in me, or something of that sort.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any blows? - A. I think the deceased, after the knife was in him, made a blow with his hands.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he had the tongs? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you hear any clashing of the tongs, so as to say there was a blow given the prisoner before you heard the deceased cry out? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. I think this cannot be carried further that manslaughter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. No, my Lord; and I think I cannot make less of it.</p>

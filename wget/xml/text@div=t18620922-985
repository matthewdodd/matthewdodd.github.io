I am a detective of the City police—in consequence of some instructions I received, I went with Green and Smart to Cannon-street-road, St George's—after remaining there a short time, I saw Goodman and Kaufman in the street together—after a few minutes they entered 96, Can<lb></lb>non-street-road, occupied by Goodman—a servant girl came out after<lb></lb>wards; the door was left open, and we entered the house—I proceeded up<lb></lb>stairs, and met Goodman coming down—I tried to open the door of the first-floor back room but could not—I allowed Goodman to pass—shortly after<lb></lb>wards he came upstairs; I told him I could not open the door, and he took the key and immediately opened it—the house was a sailors' lodging-house, kept by Goodman—I found Kaufman in the room—I looked under the bed<lb></lb>stead and found an old wooden case, containing 517 ladies' and gentlemen's riding whips—Green was with me—I said, "We are police-officers; I have every reason to believe that these whips have been stolen from the City some week or two back; what account can you give of your possession of them?"—he said, "I know nothing at all about them, therefore I can give you no account"—Goodman was in the room; I said, "Goodman, what account can you give me?"—he said, pointing to Kaufman, "That man brought them into my house about half an hour back; they were brought in a truck, and a boy was with him"—Kaufman made no answer to that—I took possession of the whips, and brought the two men to the Old Jewry police-office—I took Goodman from there in a cab to Moor-lane police-station—Kaufman was with another officer—the whips were afterwards shown to the prose<lb></lb>cutor, and he identified them.</p>

I am a wholesale clothier, at 90, Leman-street, White<lb></lb>chapel—I have known Kaufman three or four years—he had a beer-shop when I first knew him, and of late I have known him to manufacture slippers—he supplies wholesale houses with slippers—he came to me lift Sunday fortnight, between 11 and 12 o'clock I should say, in the morning—he said, "I hear that you are shipping, and I think I have got a little lot of goods that will suit you"—I said, "Very well"—he said, "If you come to my house, I will show you"—I went with him to his house, 96, Cannon-street-road—he took me into a ware-room on the right-hand side of the passage; he opened a handle with about twenty-five whips—he told me there were between five hundred and six hundred—I said they were goods that I did not know anything about, and I should decline buying them—Kaufman and I then left the house together—just as we got out at the door we met Goodman, who made a full stop as he was going past, and said, "Hallo, what brings you here?"—I said, "Mr. Kaufman wanted to sell me a lot of whips; I don't understand what they are, and I declined buying them"—Goodman said, "Kaufman, if you have a lot of whips, no doubt I could sell them for you"—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are riding-whips, something like those pro<lb></lb>duced by Kaufman.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">The prisoner.</hi>) I am a lodging-house keeper, at 141, Cannon-street-road, St Gtorge's-in-the-East—I first saw Kaufman in re<lb></lb>ference to these whips last Sunday fortnight—I have known him this last three or four years—he has lived near me latety—last Monday fortnight, I was walking down the street where I live, and met Kaufman coming out of his house with Mr. Henry Freeman—Freeman said to me, "You ought to see the whips Kaufman has got to sell"—Kaufman said, "Do you think you can get a customer for them?"—I said, "If I can, I will try—he did not show me the whips then—the following Saturday I met a gentleman samed Ridledge, who keeps an office at 65, Old Bread-street—I saw Kauf<lb></lb>man on the following Sunday at his own place with that gentleman, and he showed me one whip for a sample—the gentleman said, "That is not the my I do business; you must show me a fair sample of every one of them, sad tell me the price of them, how many there are of every one of them,—Kaufman said, "I will send you a sample"—on the following Thursday Kaufman came to me and brought me a sample—it was tied up—I did not see what was inside—there was a piece of paper with it—I took it to the gentleman's office; he was not at home, and I left it there—I saw Kaufman next on the Friday, the day that we were both taken in custody—the sample was in a little box tied up in paper—it was not in my house—I met him in the street and he gave it to me—on the Friday the gentleman came and said he must look at the whole lot of them—I went by myself to Kaufman's house—Kaufman was not at home—an hour afterwards Kaufman came to my place and said, What do you want of me?"l—I said, u Those gentlemen went to me the whole of the whips"—he said, "Well, if they come about 3 o'clock, I shall be at home"—I came home about half-past 3 and the whips were then at my house—I went up stairs and saw them, and a little while after that the police came in, while I was up stairs with them, Kaufman heard the row and said, "What's that? for God's sake go down and shut the door"—I did so, and locked the door—these are the whips that he brought—we were then both taken in custody by the officers.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you to have gone to Kaufman's house with the gentleman to look at the whips? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes: I do not know whether the gentleman is here, I have not seen him—I know him—he keeps an office in Old Broad-street—I gave a card of his office to the officer—there was only one gentleman when first I saw him—there was no arrangement with me that Kaufman should bring the whips to my house—the gentleman came to me because I introduced him to Kaufman—I do not know whew he was to go to see the whips—Kaufman never told me where he was to go—I went to Kaufman's house to tell him the gentleman wished to see the whips—I did not know they were at Kaufman's house—he was not to go to Kauf<lb></lb>man's house that I know of—when Kaufman asked me to go down and lock the door, I asked him what for, and he said, "Come up and I will tell you"—after it was locked I suspected there was something wrong, but not while I was locking the door—it was so quick—I did not call any witnesses before the Magistrate—Henry Freeman was called for me, and also Julia</p>

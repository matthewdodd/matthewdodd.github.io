             went out of the shop by herself; soon after she was gone out, a lady gave information about some muslin, and Mr. Fisher sent me out immediately; I followed the prisoner Sarah Young about one hundred yards from the shop; I overtook her seeing her stoop down, pulling a piece of muslin from under her petticoats, and putting it into her apron, and folding it up; after she had done that, she was walking off, I catched hold of her hand, I told her I should be obliged to her if she would come back to the linen draper's shop at the corner with me, for there was a mistake between her and the young person that waited upon her, with that she immediately<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178707110059"></xptr>turned and looked in my face, and said, she could not think what mistake it could be, as she had only brought one handkerchief and paid for it; I told her I did not know any thing what it was, but if she would be so kind as to come back along with me, we could soon determine it; she came back with me, I brought her back against the counter, and I asked her what that was she had in her apron, she answered nothing at all only the handkerchief she had bought; she immediately unloosed her apron, and dropped the muslin down near to the counter, and gave it a kick back with her foot, towards the prisoner Arbin; I asked her if her pocket handkerchief would make such a bulk in her apron as what she had when I brought her along the street, and she said she had nothing but her handkerchief, and she shewed me her handkerchief; I told her she had dropped the muslin there; she said I had accused her very wrong; I said, I saw you pull it from under your coats at the corner of the street, and put it into your apron; she denied knowing Mary Arbin, or seeing her before that time; and Mary Arbin said the same, she knew nothing of her, and protested she wished she might never see the Almighty with her eyes, if she ever saw her before.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you heard them whisper together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I produce the property; my master took it up and gave it to me; it has been in my care ever since.</p>
               <p>(Produced and deposed to with the mark upon it.)</p>
               <p>I know it to be the shop mark; and I can prove it to be my master's hand writing.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether you sold such a remnant? - No, I do not believe we did; we had three pieces much about the same price and pattern; the night before, and the night of the robbery we had but two pieces of that kind in the wrapper; we straighten the wrappers every night, and the night before they were all right; we discovered that piece to be missing that evening.</p>

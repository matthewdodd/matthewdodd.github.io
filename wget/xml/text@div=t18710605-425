                  </hi>. I am a cashier at the Bayswater Branch of the Lon<lb></lb>don and County Bank—Mrs. Stewart, of Pembridge Crescent, keeps an account there—I knew the prisoner as her servant—she has been in the habit of coming regularly to the bank and transacting business for Mrs. Stewart—on the 3rd March she came with a written order from Mrs. Stewart for a cheque-book—I delivered her one—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—about the end of March Mrs. Stewart brought the book to the bank, and I found that four cheques had been torn out bodily, counterfoils and all—when the book was delivered there were twenty-five cheques in it, four were missing—on the 9th March the prisoner presented this cheque for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., drawn by Mrs. Stewart, payable to bearer—I paid her 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and one 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—on the 13th March the prisoner came again, and pre<lb></lb>sented this cheque for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I paid her 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I asked</p>

               <p>her how she would take it—she said "All gold"—I said "All gold?"—thinking it was a large amount—she said "I will take one 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note"—the number of that note is in the pay-book—the cheque was drawn on one of the blank cheques out of the book I had delivered.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have frequently seen the prisoner—she, and no one else, was in the habit of coming from Mrs. Stewart—I had paid her different sums at different times during the present year—I did not know that she could not write—I saw her write her name very indifferently, not such a hand as that on the cheque—I had no reason to suspect the cheque to be forged at the time I paid it—I took particular notice of the person presenting it, from the alteration in the figures and the general character of the signature not being so good as Mrs. Stewart's—if it had been to any one but the servant who usually came, I should not have paid it—I should say it was paid about 11 o'clock in the morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 15, Pembridge Crescent, and am the wife of Robert Stewart—I keep an account at the Bayswater branch of the London and County Bank—the prisoner was cook in my service—I have been in the habit of sending her to the bank to take and fetch money—about the 3rd of March I sent her for a cheque-book—she brought it to me, and I put it into my desk, which I looked—I generally kept it locked up—I did not notice that any cheques had been taken out—on 9th March I drew the cheque produced for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which being the first in the book, I remembered "1"—I gave it to the prisoner to get the cash forme, which she brought me—this 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque was not written by me or by my authority—I did not authorize the prisoner to get 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the bank on that day—up to that time I had only drawn this one cheque for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when my bank-book came back I saw that I had been debited with this 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I then com<lb></lb>municated with the bank, and I took my cheque book to be examined.</p>

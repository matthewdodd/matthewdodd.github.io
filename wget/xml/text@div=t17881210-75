On the 16th of November last, between the hours of seven and eight in the evening, Palmer sent word to me, that he heard the noise of people on the premises; I immediately went to the publick-house to collect some working people; and in the room, I saw three men in sailor's jackets; I went backwards to the publican and enquired about them; and we went with a gun and some people, and the watchman; and me and another took one man in the garden, that was Conner, and another let himself down from a roof into the garden, that was Smith: we took them to the publick-house; and I took Conner into a room, and he cried very much, and said it was the first time; I did not promise him any thing; he said there were six in the gang, but three worked at a time, and the other three were at the publick-house; (them were the men I saw in sailor's habits) then I called in Smith, he would not tell me any thing; then we took them to the watch-house; and on Monday I went with Mr. Palmer, and saw the first gutter was stripped of every bit of lead, which was half a ton, and part of the next gutter was stripped, and another part loosened ready to cut off; and we found another man in the chimney, and sent for the officer of the parish to take him up, and the man was dead: Conner and Smith had no lead about them when we took them; I had not been to the top of the house lately.</p>

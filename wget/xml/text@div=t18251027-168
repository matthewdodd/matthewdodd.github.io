I purchase orchards of different farmers about the parish. I had purchased the fruit of this orchard, which is in the parish of Edmonton, of a person named Standingford, about three or four months before - I had paid for all the fruit in it, of different descriptions - it contains between thirteen and fourteen acres, and is inclosed with a hedge all round it. On the 28th of September, I and a witness who was with me saw nine boys, (of whom the prisoners are part), under the trees in the orchard, hitting them, and dashing the trees about, with sticks and stones, and pocketing the fruit - I can swear they were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270073"></xptr>all in the act of knocking them down. I ran up to them, and called to Thomas Marne, who had worked for me six years, and said, "Mind Sir, I know you - I am sure to have you," - they all ran away as fast as they could. I was then about two acres from them - I gave some directions to my man, and we caught Townsend in the ground - the others got away. I said, "Now Townsend you have been in the ground many times, and I have caught you at last - you have given me a great deal of trouble." He begged I would forgive him - which I had done many times before - but then he was not with such a large gang. I sent for an officer, and had him out of the orchard - about nineteen walnuts were taken from his pocket. I took him before the Magistrate, and took warrants for three more, whom I could recognise. I can only swear to Marne, Sawyer, Townsend and Fury. I know they have been in the ground hundreds of times. Nothing more passed on that day, but Townsend told who the rest were. I know nothing at all about the woman - but the lads said, they sold the walnuts to her.</p>

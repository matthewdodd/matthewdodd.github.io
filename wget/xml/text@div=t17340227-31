               <p>Thomas Carpenter. I was robb'd about May or June last, I don't remember the Time exactly, for I am very antient ( near 100 Years old) I had about 40 Guineas in a Bag, in my Coat-pocket, and when I went to Bed I laid my Coat in the Chair and the Maid came and fetch'd the Candle away. I knew of no Body being in the House but my self, the Maid, and the Prisoner. In the Morning when I arose, I miss'd all my Money. I suspected the Prisoner had taken it, because he ran away.</p>

             The Prisoner was taken 3 or 4 Months after, at Poole in Montgomeryshire. It was thought he would go thither, because he had some Relations there. He was carry'd before Justice Nichols, and confess'd the Fact; and here the Confession is in writing.</p>

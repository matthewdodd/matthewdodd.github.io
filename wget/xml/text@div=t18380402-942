                  </hi>. I am clerk and cashier in the banking-house of William George Prescott, Grote, and Co.; there are more than one other partner. On the 21st of February, 1837, this cheque was produced to me, about eleven o'clock in the morning—I believe it was the female prisoner who presented it—I speak from a recollection of her person—Mr. Pearson saw her—I believed it not to be the writing of the drawer—I believed it not to be a genuine cheque—I showed it to the adjoining cashier, and then referred to our signature book, but, that being rather new, it had not the signature in it—I then referred to the pass book of the society, but that is not here—I then took it to a senior clerk, and showed it to him, and then showed it to Mr. Prescott, and, after some hesitation, he gave me instructions to pay it—I paid it in notes, 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to the person who brought it—previous to paying her, Mr. Prescott asked her if her name was Hall—she said no, she re<lb></lb>ceived it for Mrs. Hall—he questioned her as to the nature of the cheque, and then requested her to write her name and address on the back of it, which is here now—I suppose she was a quarter of an hour, or longer, in</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Prescott and Co. I was in attendance at the counter on the 21st of February, last year—I remember this cheque being presented for payment to Mr. Borton—my attention was called the person who paid it—I believe the female prisoner to be the person—the was some hesitation about paying it, which induced me to pay more an ordinary attention to the person—she was a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes under my view—when she left the banking-house after it was paid—I followed her into the street, my attention was attracted by her being very much like a relation of mine—I saw her again in October, and was confirmed in my opinion that she was the same person—I think is <hi rend="italic">the</hi> same person—I will not swear to her positively, but I believe her to be the person—I saw her writing, but I was not very near her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and live in Lincoln's Inn-fields. I succeeded Mr. Lane in business—the business of the New Jersey Society was still continued in the office—the male prisoner was my clerk in February, 1837—the cheque-book used for the Society was kept in an iron chest, in my room—the prisoner would have access to that room—there are very few cheques drawn on account of the Society—I have not missed any blank cheques from the Society's cheque-book—I keep a partnership account at Prescott's, and have missed from my cheque-book several cheques, which have been cut from the end of the book—that book was usually locked up, but during the day was frequently in the drawer of the table at which I sat, which drawer was open all day—the prisoner had the opportunity of getting at the book, if he chose—he could have access to both cheque-books, as the iron chest was also open—I have compared the cheque in question with the remaining part of a cheque cut from the end of this partnership-book, and it exactly corresponds with the lines through which it is cut—I entertain no doubt of its having been taken from that book—the prisoner was absent from the office the whole of the 20th of February, and part of the 21st, without my permission—I saw him in the office in the middle of the day on the 21st, not before one o'clock, and he was in liquor—he was discharged from my office in consequence of his absence, and left me on the following Saturday—I was not aware where he lived at the time.</p>

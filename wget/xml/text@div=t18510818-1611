I said, 'I think I do, I am going to see if a vessel is going to Guernsey,' and they asked me if I was coming back again, and I said, 'Yes, as soon as I have been down, if the vessel is going;' and I found there was no vessel going; they asked me if I would take anything to drink; I said, I did not mind at no vessel was going; they said they were going to Limehouse, and we went together to a public-house, just over Tower-hill, in a narrow street; one went away, and the other asked me if I would give him two sovereigns for some silver, which I did, and soon after that the other man came in again; we had three or four pints of half and half together, and they asked me to stop for them as they were going on towards Limehouse, which I did for some little time; I fell off to sleep, and when I awoke up I did not see them, and I was that stupified I did not know where I was, and I do not know anything about the money, or how it came into my possession; I never had a key turned on me in my life." <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

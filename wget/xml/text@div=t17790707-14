               <p>Cannot you tell with certainty where you went? - To the best of my remembrance I went into Brewer-street. Whether I had got my watch with me then or no I cannot say. When I came from her company I missed it.</p>

               <p>Was you in liquor? - I cannot say that I was really solid, if I had I should not have been guilty of such a thing.</p>

               <p>The prisoner at the bar, on Saturday the the 20th of June last offered this watch to pledge with me; having a suspicion that she came by it dishonestly, I stopped it, and advertised it the Tuesday following, when this gentleman owned it as his property.</p>
               <p>(The watch was produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutor. I suppose you was upon the bed with her? - I do not know that I was; I believe I was not; I cannot be positive.</p>
               <p>Was you in any situation that the watch might drop out? - It might be, but I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I desire to ask the pawnbroker whether I brought that watch to his master's house?</p>
               <p>Edwards. She is the person.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you ever seen her before? - Yes; and am positive to her person; she had, not five minutes before, brought a shirt to pledge. She came from a publick-house opposite us to bring the watch to pledge.</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutor. Are you certain that this is the woman you picked up in Brewer-street, and went to Peter-street, in Carnaby-market with? - I am; and do swear she is the person I was with.</p>

               <p>I met that gentleman in Brewer-street; he asked me to go with him to a house in Gravel Pits, Carnaby-market; I went with him; we were together the space of half an hour; we had a quartern of brandy together; he laid on the bed; when he got up he missed his watch; he had me searched to my shift before the master of the house; then he went away contented, and said he believed he had left it behind him elsewhere. After this I went to make the bed, and found the watch. That was after he was gone.</p>

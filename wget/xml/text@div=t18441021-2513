                  </hi>. I am a chimney-sweeper. On Monday, the 22nd of July, I left my room about nine o'clock in the morning, leaving my watch, chain, and two seals on a chair by the bed-side—I returned about two o'clock, or a little after, and found the door unlocked and open, and the watch gone—the prisoner lived in the next room at the time—I saw her last on the Wednesday—I did not see her the night I lost the watch, and never saw her after till she was in custody, which was three months after she left the lodg<lb></lb>ing—she bears a very bad character—she is married—I believe her husband was living with her at that time—this is my watch and seals.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He did see me that night, and next morning he gave me a paper which I took round to the pawnbrokers; he has drank twice with me; it is be that has caused my husband and I to live unhappily.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I did not see her that night—I did see her on Tuesday morning, and she said, if I would give her a description of the watch, she would go round to the pawnbrokers', and I gave her a kind of note—I saw her again on Wed<lb></lb>nesday, and after that I lost sight of her—I never drank with her in my life—I have not been acquainted with her more than as a neighbour—she did not go round with me about the watch—she said she went—I have no means of knowing that she did go.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker. I took this watch in pledge of the prisoner on the 22nd of July—I took the seals and chain the same afternoon, but not at the same time; it was a separate pledge, by the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the evening of the 9th of February I was on duty in Clare-market, and saw the prisoner with a bolt of canvas, which I produce—I saw him go into a pawnbroker's with it—he came out again with it, and I took him into custody with the can<lb></lb>vas</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner was in my father, Thomas Edgington's service, who is a rick-cloth and sun-blind-maker—his manufactory in Kent-road was burnt down on the 9th of February—the fire broke out about three o'clock in the morning—I gave orders for the goods which were saved to be moved into the prisoner's room—he was employed as a watchman to sleep on the premises, and locked every thing up—among the things saved was a bolt of canvas, which was put into his room—there is no mark on this, as the ticket is gone—I am sure only one bolt was put into his room—he was present at the fire—the canvas was produced before the Magistrate, and I gave the same evidence as I have to-day—I saw the Magistrate sign this examination—I had not sent the prisoner to make the canvas into blinds—I saw the Magistrate sign the paper which I did—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—my signature is here—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"The prisoner says, 'I took the canvas, but was only going to pawn it—I intended to redeem it when I took my wages at night."</p>

The Prisoner and the Deceased came in next Morning and call'd for a Quartern of Liquor. He took up the Musquet. I desired him to let it alone. He said it was not charged. I told him that was more than I knew, and again desired him not to meddle with it, and I had hardly spoke before it went off and shot her left Eye out. He and she lived together as Man and Wife, but she was reckon'd to be the Wife of the Queen's Coachman, for she went by his Name - Neal. This was done on the Friday Morning, and next Friday she dy'd.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he present the Piece towards her?</p>
               <p>Dodding. Yes, he held it up and pointed it to her Face, and when he found what he had done, he seem'd in a Fright, and set it down and went out.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he threaten to shoot her?</p>
               <p>Dodding. No. They came in very friendly, and no Words pass'd betwixt 'em in Anger; they only talk'd of going to their Work. She was a Quilter, and he was a Labouring Man.</p>

How do you know that! said the Landlord again. Whereof the Prisoner play'd the Fool with it, and it went off and shot the Woman's left Eye out of her Head, and then he went away.

The prisoner took the cloak, and the apron, and the handkerchief, and the money, I gave them to him for the ring; and he was to return them the next morning at seven o'clock, he was to come for the ring and give me three guineas, and return my things. The other man wished me a good night; and I thought by the manner of his behaving, he did not mean to come again. I went home, and looked at the ring by the fire, there was no candle, and I thought there never was such a stone as that set in gold. I went to a silversmith that lived near, and he told me, I had lost my cloak; he advised me to take the rascal, but he did not tell me what the ring was worth. I went to another silver-smith, and he told me the same: as I was going home, I saw the prisoner facing Scotland-yard, in Buckingham-court; I said to some children, that were there, there were the men, and the men hearing me, and seeing me, ran away; I called, Stop thief! and they were taken by a gentleman; and I desired the men to give me the things again, and the prisoner gave them me; he did not give me back my money, I did not recollect it then: the prisoner was committed. (The ring produced.)</p>

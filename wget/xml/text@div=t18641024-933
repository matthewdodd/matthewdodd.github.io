                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JAMES BRANNAN</hi>. I am employed by the Mint—on 1st October, about 11. 30A. M. I went to the Champion beer-shop, Essex-street, Hoxton, in consequence of information, with a search-warrant—I saw the prisoner standing in front of the bar, and directed Inspector Brannan to seize him—I ran up stairs with the other officers, expecting to find his companions there—the prisoner was brought up, and while he was coming up Sergeant Leather said, "He is putting his hand in his pocket"—I said, "Do not let him," and the officers seized him on each side—he became exceedingly violent, kicked Sergeant Leather, and made a kick at me—I shifted out of his way, and said, "You scoundrel, you might have ruined me for life"—he said, "I did not intend it for you; I intended it for that b-who was going to put the bad money into my pocket," alluding to Leather—I saw him struggling on the floor, and saw Leather take from him two packets, which he handed to me, each containing ten counterfeit shillings—he also gave me a packet which he said he picked up on the floor—I said, "I have received instructions from the solicitor to the Mint to look after you, as an extensive dealer in counterfeit coin"—he said, "<hi rend="italic">Lor</hi>, Mr. Brannan, I never had one in my life"—he was on the floor when the parcel was taken from his pocket—he became so exceedingly violent that they had to get him down—he kicked Leather on the knee—I opened the packets in his presence—they each contained ten counterfeit shillings, and the packet found on the floor contained ten counterfeit shillings separately wrapped up—Fife called my attention to a very large quantity of counterfeit coin which he found con<lb></lb>cealed under a form which gave way—he turned the form upside down by stepping on it, and there was this piece of wood temporarily nailed, from which one or two packets fell—the landlord of the house was taken in custody, but discharged—the packet contained counterfeit shillings of similar date to those found on the prisoner—he gave a false address.</p>

ORRIDGE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you the people here with whom he said that he lodged? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, but I went there—when he made the second kick at me, I intended to hit him on his foot with this little cane (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), but he put his hand out, and it struck his hand; if I hurt him, I sincerely regret it—it was Fife who jumped on the form—that was fire minutes before the prisoner was thrown down—he was two or three minutes on the ground—the landlord was examined before the Magistrate, and twice remanded—I did not ask the prisoner to be searched before he was thrown down, because he kicked the sergeant down directly he entered the room—he was then knocked down by Leather and Elliott, but not with a staff—there was no weapon used except my stick—the coin was got from his pocket with great difficulty when he was down.</p>

I went with Brannan—I seized the prisoner—Brannan went up stairs, and ordered me to bring the prisoner—I took him up, and saw him put his hand to his left side—I caught hold of him—a small parcel fell from his hand which I picked up—he kicked me severely on the knee, and I feel it still—a struggle ensued, and I took two other packets from his left inside pocket, where I had seen him put some<lb></lb>thing</p>

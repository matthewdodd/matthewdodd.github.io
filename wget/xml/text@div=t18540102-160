                  </hi>. I was married to Mr. Burton in Feb., 1853; his name is Thomas Jones Burton. In the year 1852 I became acquainted with the defendant Crutchley; he was introduced to me by a person of the name of Stanborough—the first transaction between us was his getting me to dis<lb></lb>count a bill for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did discount it—I think it was upon the application of Stanborough, who was to take it to Mr. Crutchley, at Brighton—I was asked, as a very great favour, if I would lend him that money; and I never, until then, discounted a bill in my life, or ever did to anybody but them—before that bill became due, an application was made to me by Crutchley, with regard to another bill—that was a bill for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was represented to me by Crutchley that a lady of the name of Nash wanted some money—the bill purported to be drawn by her—I made inquiries about it—I went to a Miss Bowles—I made inquiries about every bill, though I have been so deceived—I gave back the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill and 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in money for that 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—that was 270<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I advanced upon that bill—that was what he himself said I ought to give—I never suggested what I was to give—it was Crutch<lb></lb>ley's own suggestion—I did not know what I was to give—before that bill of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. became due, another bill was offered to me by Crutchley—that was a bill of a person of the name of Rawson, upon Wright; it wag a promis<lb></lb>sory</p>

               <p>note for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Crutchley brought it me—by the tenor of that note I should say that Wright was to pay the money upon it—it might be from Wright to Rawson, I cannot say—I am sure Wright was the person that was to pay it—when Crutchley brought me that note he told me that Wright was a man of large fortune; landed property in Northumberland—he told me the name of the place where he lived was Whitley-court—that was the name of his residence—I asked Crutchley particularly that I might see Wright; but he always told me, throughout the whole affair, that Wright was a person that did not wish to have anything to do with ladies; that it was all right; but that I could not see him, because he did not wish to have anything to do with ladies in the affair; but that he would see that it was all right—I said I could not advance such a large sum of money; that I had never done anything of the kind; and that I could not do it unless I knew that Mr. Wright was really the man of fortune that he was represented to be—upon that Crutchley said, "There is a gentleman, a friend of his, who will be up in London about this time, and you had better come and see this person, and he will satisfy you who and what Mr. Wright is"—it was then arranged that I and Crutchley were to go and see this person—I cannot remember the day on which we went, but it was in the beginning of May, because I know on the 13th May I went to Childs', the bankers', to draw out the money—Crutchley and Stanborough went with me to see this person—we went in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> together—Stanborough got out before we got to the place—I cannot swear where the place was—I was talking at the time, and I really do not know—it was at an hotel, either in Berners-street or the lower part of Oxford-street, or Holborn—it was a large hotel—when we got there Mr. Crutchley inquired for Mr. Gray or Grake—I cannot exactly remember the name, but it was not Morton—I am quite sure of that—he asked if this Mr. Gray or Grake was within—the answer was that he was—Crutchley then said to me, "You had better go up alone, because you can ask questions better without me than with me; ask every thing you like"—I went up alone, and was introduced into a room where I saw a person who I have since known as Morton, and who was tried here last Session, and convicted—he is the person who was represented to me as Mr. Gray or Grake—he was sitting there with a bag of papers, like a lawyer—I said I had come to inquire about a Mr. Wright, who I was told was a man of large landed property in Northumberland, that I was going to lend some money, and wished to know if he was highly respectable, and a man of fortune—Morton said that he was a man of large fortune, and highly respectable—he said, "Your money is as safe as possible," and said that the fortune was in Northumberland, and consisted of landed estates; that the residence was Whitley-court, and that he was a near neighbour of his, and the money was as safe as could possibly be—before I left, Crutchley came up stairs into the room, and said, "Well, have you asked what questions you pleased of Mr. Gray?" or "Grake"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Are you satisfied?"—I said, "Yes; this gentleman says he is a near neighbour of his, and is a man of large fortune, and my money is perfectly safe"—I said I wanted to see Mr. Wright; he said I could not, and I said I must have the money back in October, as that was the time I wanted it—Crutchley assured me that I should have it, and I lent the money—I went to Childs', the bankers', to get it; Crutchley went with me—I advanced a 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and about 650<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 660<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 670<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash; it was 970<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether, but you know I have never had a farthing back—I had 378<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Childs'—about June, Crutchley came to me again with a bill of 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., drawn by Colonel</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185401020003"></xptr>
               <p>Bulkeley on Mr. Wright—I said I knew something of Mr. Bulkeley; I knew the lady he had married, and I did not think he was a man of large fortune; Mr. Crutchley assured me that he was—of course I advanced the money again—Crutchley said it was all right about "Wright, and he repeated to me in the most solemn manner that it was all right, that I should never lose any of the money, that it was as safe as possible—in consequence of those representations, I gave back the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, and 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in money for the 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—I have got that written down on a piece of paper, which I can swear to—it is only a scrap of paper—I received 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for discount—he was the person that suggested it, and I had confidence in him, and thought him very honourable—it was the bond that was to be paid in Oct.—the 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill would fall due in about two or three months—about the middle of Aug. Crutchley came to me, and said he had been thinking of the affair, and it would be much better to change the bill into a bond, because it would be so much more secure—I asked him over and over again; and I asked Stanborough the same, and he said it would be so much more secure on land, on his own Land, his estates at Whitley-court—the bond was to be for 2,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I was to go with him to Mr. Boucher, a lawyer, at Guildhall, for the bond to be given—I saw a letter from Wright at Mr. Boucher's at that time, saying that he should be in funds in Oct.—Crutchley showed it to me—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the bond—it purports to be made from Wright to Crutchley; and I said it was a very extraordinary thing, as the money was mine, that it should be made out to him, and he said that made no difference—he always said Mr. Wright did not wish to have anything to do with ladies—that was told me every time—before the bond was signed, I said I could not advance so much as the additional 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and Crutchley said, "I will join you in doing it"—he said he would pay 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I was to pay the rest—I paid about 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave back the 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill of Captain Bulkeley, and gave 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Crutchley—he was to make up the difference—I never had the bond myself at that time, it was kept by Mr. Boucher—in Dec., 1852, or Jan., 1853, Crutchley called on me, and said if I gave him a bill for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I should have his interest in the bond—I did so, and Mr. Burton has paid it since my marriage—between Oct. and that time I had made application constantly to Crutchley for the money, which was to be paid in Oct., and he said he did not suppose it made any difference to me, as I was receiving 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent, and he supposed it was not convenient to Mr. Wright—I have never received the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent.—I asked him for it several times, whenever I saw him, because I wanted the money—I told him repeatedly that I never should have lent it if he had not assured me that I should have it back in Oct.—I have frequently seen Mr. Wright, and he assured me that he had not 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the world—if I had once seen him, I never would have lent him the money—I first saw him two or three months ago, when this trial was first coming on—with great difficulty he had been found—I went to a house to identify Morton, and there I saw Wright—I saw a person named Wright at the Police-court at the time when Crutchley and Morton were under examination—I heard Wright examined—there was no other Wright examined with reference to this particular case—I do not speak about his personal appearance, because a most gentlemanly man may look vulgar; but I never saw a more vulgar, low man than he was—just before my marriage, I told the defendant he had always promised me that the money should be paid on 18th Feb.; and after my marriage, when I came back from Paris, which was much about</p>

               <p>that time, I spoke to him about it, and he then said he had done a great deal better for me, he had made it into another bond for 2,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and it would not now be paid till 1855, and I was to receive 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent., for it, and he had added another 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the interest—nothing was advanced by me after that—that bond was in Mr. Boucher's hands, and we paid 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for preparing it—I have never received any portion of the money I advanced—I afterwards called on Mr. Crutchley, at his residence, and frequently spoke to him about it—a few days before the last Session, I was at a ball at Willis's rooms, and saw Mr. Hawke, Crutchley's solicitor, there—he joined in a game at whist, at which I was engaged, and asked me if I would speak to him after the game was over, and by his inducement I went with him to Crutchley, in the Bench, and saw him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do not you know, as well as that I am speaking to you, that this young man, when he came of age, sold whatever property he had, and advanced upwards of 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to your husband in March, 1853? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not; I have heard that there has been some squabbling about money, but I have never listened to it; it does not at all concern me.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

I am the attesting witness to this bond—I prepared it by the instructions of Mr. Burton and Mr. Crutchley—Mr. Crutchley had been a client of mine—as far as my recol<lb></lb>lection goes, they both came together when it was first mentioned to me—I had not known the lady before—I know nothing whatever of the circumstance.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you been concerned for Mr. Crutchley? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I once had matters of business with his family—his sister was entitled to property under her father's will, and the prisoner also—all the children were—it consisted principally of houses—I believe it was not sold—it was not to be sold until they were twenty-four—portions of it had been mort<lb></lb>gaged by his brothers—I cannot give you a very good idea of what the prisoner will be entitled to when he comes of age, because it is leasehold property, and it is difficult to say—I have often considered it would be worth 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

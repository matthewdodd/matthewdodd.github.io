                  </hi>. I am one of the police constables attached to the General Post-office in St. Martin's-le-Grand—in consequence of instructions, I was watching on 12th March, in such a position that I could see the passage which leads from the Inland Office to the District Office—it is a passage about five feet wide—it runs direct under the hall where the public pass through—there are steps to go down at one end from the Inland Office and steps to go up to the District Office at the other end—at one end of it there are folding doors—about half-past 6 that morning I saw the prisoner come from the Inland Office—I knew him previously by sight—he was a sorter in the Post-office—he was coming from the Inland Office to the London District Office, through the tunnel, with four or five large letters in his right hand, with his left hand placed underneath—whilst he was going through I observed him draw his left hand with a smaller letter, from under<lb></lb>neath—it was a bluish-looking coloured envelope—he crumpled it up in his fist, and placed it in his left hand coat-pocket—I believe he has on the same coat now—he went through into the London District Office, and I lost sight of him for about a minute; not through the folding-doors; he was through them when I saw him—I followed him through afterwards, and met him returning from the Letter-carriers' Office towards the Inland Office—he had nothing in his hand then—I stopped him and took him into the Comp<lb></lb>troller's room—he was close against the door when I met him—he there</p>

               <p>commenced putting his hands first into his waistcoat-pocket and then into his coat-pocket—I told him to keep his hands out of his pockets, and sent for the inspector, Mr. Delany—I had no one with me at the moment but the prisoner—a messenger came in with some letters for the President just at the moment, and I sent him for him—upon Mr. Delany's arrival, I said to him, "I have reason to believe the prisoner has a letter in his pocket that does not belong to him"—the prisoner could hear that—Mr. Delany in reply said, "Have you, Cooke?"—the prisoner said, "No, sir; what I have is my pockets belongs to myself"—I then asked the prisoner if he had any objection to be searched—he said, "No"—I commenced searching him, and it his left-hand coat-pocket I found this cloth; at that time there was some bread and butter in it, and the letter, now produced, crumpled up—it was the coat-pocket where I had previously seen him put his hand—the letter was crumpled up and <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> down by the side of the cloth in the pocket, between the cloth and the side of the pocket, <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> down tight—the letter was not in the state in which it would come from the Post-office; it was crumpled right up: the same as if a person were to take a piece of paper in their hand and crumple it up—it is addressed, "Messrs. F. L. Carver &amp; Co. 57, Skinner Street, London, E.C."—it was opened before the Magistrate, and contained a half-sovereign in a card, nine penny postage-stamps, and an order for a new hat—the card was crumpled up—it was smoothed out when it was opened—the envelope bears the London postage-stamp of the morning of the 12th, and the stamp of St. Columb, Cornwall, of the llth—after I had done searching the prisoner I said to him,"Is this your letter, Cooke?"—he said, "No; if that came out of my pocket, some one must have put it then; I know nothing about it"—I then asked where he lived—he said at 55, Gopsall-street, Hoxton—I asked what part of the house he occupied—he said the two parlours and back kitchen—I went there and found a quantity of Money in two cash-boxes, amounting altogether to 312<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and some promissory notes—the prisoner subsequently told me that he had brought it home from Australia, and he was going to purchase a house in Pakington-street, Islington; I think he said for 430<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he was endeavouring to raise the money to pay that sum—as I was about taking the prisoner from the Comptroller's room to another room of our own, he said, "This is a piece of villany on the part of some one; I will swear before all the judges in London, if it was necessary, that I never saw that letter before"—I said, "It is no use you talking in that way to me, Cooke; it is not the first letter you have put in your pocket, and that I know with my own knowledge"—the prisoner replied, "Oh no, sir, you are wrong"—he was then taken into custody—directly I commenced searching him Mr. Powley, the president of the London District Office, came in—I found a pocket-book in the prisoner's pocket, containing some memorandums; there was no other paper in that pocket—Rumbold, a brother officer, was with me when I was watching the prisoner—he was with me at the place where I first saw the prisoner in the passage.</p>

               <p>not know for What amount, it is for part payment of the house—in addition to that there were, I think, two or three promissory notes; everything is here that was brought away—these were all found on his person; I have kept them separate—I do not see a promissory note amongst these—to the best of my belief this paper was found in his breast coat pocket—I do not know whether the person who has signed this, "Hy. Chas. Holgate," is a clerk in the Post-office; I do not know him—the prisoner said that he had been applying to some letter-carrier for money that was owing to him; he stated that at Bow-street—in his box was a license applicable to the diggings in Australia, and one small nugget.</p>

I am a constable attached to the Post-office—on the morning of 12th March, about a quarter to 6, I was with Smee watching—I had received instructions, there is a passage going from the Inland Office to the District Office—while I was watching I saw the prisoner, about half-past 6, going from the Inland Office to the District Office—the under ground passage is lighted by gas—he had some letters in his right hand, with his left hand placed close under the right with the letters—as he came towards me, he drew from underneath the packet in hia left hand, a bluish coloured envelope, crumpled it up and put it into his left coat pocket—he then went on into the District Office.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of letter carriers in the Post-office—the prisoner was a letter carrier in the General Post-office—he has been engaged there about six yean and a half—on the morning of 12th March, he was engaged in subdividing letters—he began his duties about five minutes past 5 o'clook—he would be engaged until about twenty minutes to 7, or a quarter to 7, or nearly 7 o'clock; it all depends upon whether the work is very heavy—he was employed in the Inland Office, in the A section of the East Central district—this letter, addressed to Messrs. Carver, Skinner-street, would go to the A section, in due course—there would be three or four persons engaged in sorting there at that time I think; I am not quite sure; there might be more—the prisoner was not immediately under my control—I was sent for to the Comptroller's room on this morning; I found</p>

               <p>the prisoner and Smee there—I did not see the letter taken from the prisoner's pocket—Smee said in his presence, "I have reason to believe, sir, that this man has a letter in his possession which does not belong to him"—I said, "Is that so, Cooke"—he said, "No, sir"—a letter carrier should not take letters from one part of the office to the other without he has orders from his superior officer, the superintending sorter—there are collectors regularly employed, who clear away the letters when they are subdivided—a portion is taken to the letter carriers' office, which is the London district office, and there the letters are made up for delivery.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I suppose a great many persons had been in the sitting-room during that three weeks? A. Yes - I never saw either of the men before, but I kept Gladden in my memory, and described him to the officers next morning; I kept his features in my memory, and described him as a tall thin spare young man, with high cheek bones, and pock-marked a little; Gladden wore a new hat, but I cannot say whether he had it off or on in the room; I gave the gloves to the officer.</p>

            . I am a publican, living in the parish of St. Mary, Islington. I went into the bed-room on the 30th of July, and put three or four sovereigns into a drawer in a bureau; I put them into a canvas bag, in which there was about 38l. partly in silver, about 11l. in silver, 23l. in sovereigns, and about eight half-sovereigns, and there was some plate in a handkerchief close to the bag - it was tea-spoons, table-spoons, salt-spoons, butter-knives, and some plated articles, which were a pair of gravy-spoons, a fish-slice, and one or two pairs of plated nut-crackers - they were all safe when I went into the room about half-past two o'clock in the afternoon; I locked the drawer of the bureau, put the key into my pocket, and locked the room door, but left the key in it - I went up a story higher, and laid down; about half-past five o'clock I was called by my little boy - I went down to the bed-room door, and the key was gone; I called for it - it was brought to me, and I found the lock hampered: I could not open it with the key, and I at last forced the door open, and found the drawer, which I had left safe, forced open, apparently by some iron instrument going between the top of the drawer and the bureau, and the handkerchief, plate, and canvas bag were gone; a pair of the plated gravy spoons have since been brought to me by Collyer, Policeman 94

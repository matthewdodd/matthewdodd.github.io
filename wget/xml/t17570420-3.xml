            . I am the company of copper miners cashier and warehouse man.</p>

               <p>Q. Where is their warehouse?</p>

               <p>Barker. That is in Bush Lane. (A cake of copper produced in court.) I verily believe this belongs to the company. I have one here to compare with it. They are made in Wales, cast in an iron mould. I have the bill of lading, and the letter of invoice, 2052, and there were only 2049 received at the company's works at Lambeth.</p>

            . I live at Letchley, and bring copper up here for the company. I have often lost some. The bill of lading of cakes, which I brought on the 17th of March, was 2052, and when they came to town there were three cakes missing.</p>

               <p>Hunter. To nine shillings.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>

               <p>I went on the shore near Queen-Hithe, and found that cake of copper. I carried it to Hunter's house, and told him I had found it, and if any body own'd it to let them have it.</p>

               <p>Q. to Hunter. Did he say so?</p>

               <p>Hunter. He did.</p>

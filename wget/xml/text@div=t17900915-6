               <p>JOHN SPILSBURY sworn.</p>
               <p>I serve in the shop of the prosecutors. On the 10th of July the prisoner came into our shop, and asked to look at some muslin handkerchiefs, as she had before: she came in alone: those handkerchiefs were all sold: I said I had some check muslin handkerchiefs, which I offered her, and if the lady did not approve of them, I would take them back again? she said, no; but I should shew her some lace; I shewed her a box of lace, No. 1, which were not good enough; she asked me the price of some in No. 2; I asked twenty-one pence; and she bid me eighteen shillings for twelve yards, and twenty-four shillings for twelve yards, at two shillings and four pence per yard; I told her we always asked one price; she said she wanted a mode; I turned round to get the mode, and pushed the box a little from me; and I observed when I returned with the mode she had arisen from her seat, and seemed very much agitated: I went about three yards for the mode: I left her sitting; when I returned she was standing by the same stool; she looked at the mode, and sat down; I looked at her very much, and in her lap I saw her pocket handkerchief, and underneath a square card, which I supposed to be the card of lace; she was trying to get it into her left hand pocket, and whether it was too large I cannot tell; but she put it into her right hand pocket; I then spoke to one of the young men to fetch down Mr. Strafford; he came down: I told him the prisoner and me could not agree, and that she wanted the lace a considerable deal less than what it cost; Mr. Strafford then spoke to the prisoner respecting the black mode; she bought four squares not quite a yard each; she then said she would leave the lace alone till another day; but wanted some black ribbon for the neck of the cloak: Mr. Strafford said to the prisoner, I believe our young man says, that through mistake you have taken a card of lace that belongs to us; she said, if I have it is more than I know; and putting her hand into her pocket, she pulled out a number of papers, and then afterwards took out her pocket handkerchief, and the card of lace was inside of it; I asked her to pull out her pocket handkerchief, and the card of lace would be found; she then ordered the card of lace to be measured over, and offered to pay any price we chose for the lace; after that a constable was sent for.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. I believe some money had passed between Mr. Strafford and her before he spoke to her about the lace? - Yes; she was not short of money.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect her desiring he would let his young man go home with her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I think that was before he charged her with the lace; for what purpose was the young man to go home with her? - She pleaded about her character, that if any one would go and make enquiry, they would have a good character of her.</p>
               <p>I would ask you, whether, before Mr. Strafford addressed her as you have described, she had not for some purpose desired that a young man should go home with her? - No, Sir, she had not.</p>
               <p>You are quite sure? - Yes.</p>
               <p>She had not told you where she lived before Mr. Strafford spoke to her? - She had not.</p>
               <p>She had paid all the money due for the things that were bargained for? - She had paid for the mode; the ribbon I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did you enquire whether she had told you the truth or not? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court. What became of the piece of lace that came out of her pocket in the way you describe? - The constable took charge of it.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before? - No more than serving her once before.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Strafford. Now relate what passed when you came down? - The young<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150007"></xptr>man was shewing her some mode for a cloak; they disagreed about the price; soon after I came down she agreed to give me the price; I cut it off, and received the money; I then asked if she wanted any ribbon for the cloak? she said, she did; I brought the drawer, and shewed it to her; I stepped aside to ask Spilsbury if he was sure she took the lace; I immediately went to her, and said, I supposed she had put a card of lace in her pocket, it might be by mistake, and should be glad if she would feel if she had it; she was dressed in a very decent manner, and being an old woman, one could not suspect her; she seemed a good deal agitated; she said, no, she never did such a thing; I desired she would feel; and she brought out a pocket handkerchief wrapped round this card of lace; I then thought it proper to have her searched; I took her into a lower warehouse, and sent for the constable; he came and searched her; she dropped one piece of ribbon on the floor, from under her stays; the other the constable found in her pocket, with a pair of gentlemans gloves; I could not absolutely swear to the gloves; there was a paper of them kind of gloves laying on the counter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Had not she proposed to you to let her have some lace for a guinea, and to send a young man home to receive it? - No such thing.</p>
               <p>Did you know her before? - I knew her face.</p>
               <p>How many people serve in your shop? - About eight or nine.</p>

               <p>I produce a piece of black lace.</p>
               <p>(Deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>It is black silk lace; it is worth two shillings and four pence a yard; I searched the prisoner below stairs in the warehouse; I believe there is a cieling to it; I found there two pieces of ribbon in her pocket, and a pair of gloves; one roll is marked, the other is not: I do not swear to the ribbon.</p>
               <p>Spilsbury. Nor I.</p>
               <p>PRISONERS DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I cheapened no black ribbon at all; I had my umbrella, and the mode; when Mr. Strafford asked me if I had not made a mistake, I immediately felt in my handkerchief, and there it was; I said, Sir, I have it, I beg you ten thousand pardons; the ribbon was my own, I brought it from home to give a little girl, upon my word and honor, if I was to die this minute, and the gloves were my own, I bought them at Mr. Stafford's in the course of the week, and brought them to change them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called seven witnesses, who all gave her a very good character.</p>

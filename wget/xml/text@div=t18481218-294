                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Butcher; we live at 49, Ironmonger-row. The prisouers came and lodged in my first-floor about five months ago—they passed as man and wife—my bed-room is on the same floor with theirs—I went out of town for my health in Sept.—I left my keys with Stevens—the places were all open—my business is the India-rubber and brace work—the prisoners left me three weeks last Friday—I afterwards missed a scarf, which had been kept in my bed-room, and 37 sovereigns in a purse from my drawer—I went to Steveas with a policeman—he asked her about the scarf, and it was found in her box in my presence—the prisoners bad the appearance of having a great deal more furniture than they had when they lodged with me—they had scarcely anything when with me, and they were old things—the reason they assigned for leaving me was that they wanted a coalcellar—we said we would let them have one for 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week more—Macers said he should lose as much as he gained by having to pay 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a-week more—I was told they paid 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-week where they went to—they paid us 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-week.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, G</hi> 118). I went with Mrs. Butcher to the pri<lb></lb>soners' lodgings—Stevens was there—I told her I belonged to the police, and charged her with stealing 37 sovereigns and a scarf—I asked her if she had any money in the house—she said sixpence was all that she had—I asked if she had a scarf, she said, "No"—she said I was welcome to search—I com<lb></lb>menced searching—I found a black scarf, and this scarf was concealed in it—Stevens said, she did not know how it came there; somebody must have put it there—I found this small box—I asked her what it contained, she said, "3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I said, "Where is the key?"—she said, "My husband has got</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, G</hi> 86). I took Maeers—he was asked if he knew the box—he said it was his—he was asked what was in it—he said, about two sovereigns, and there might be a shilling or two more, he could not say—I found on him a small key which unlocked the box—there were two small back brooches in it, besides the money—there were in the room new fire-irons and fender, new blankets, and a varity of things, as if persons had set up afresh.</p>

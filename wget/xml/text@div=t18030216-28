             sworn. - I am one of the officers of Worship-street; I apprehended both the prisoners, on the 21st of January, at the house of Jonqua, in Pelham-street, with Jellison and his wife; I was in company with Armstrong; we had been at Gale's house before, and left Ray there. When we went into the house, Jellison and his wife were sitting by the fire-side, Jonqua, and his wife, and Gale, were in the room; they knew Armstrong, he was addressed by several of them with how do you do, Armstrong? he said, he had an information for stolen goods; we found an old black cloak, a man's shirt and a boy's shirt; Gale turned his back to the fire, and put a silver spoon into the fire; we took them all into custody; there was nothing found at that time that relates to this robbery. The same day, in the evening, we went again to the house, with Mrs. Thomas, and in a bag we found a piece of silk, which she said was her's; the bag was tucked behind the bed's head. When we took Gale, we asked him where he lived; he said, he lived in Compton-street, St. Giles's; we knew where he lived, and took him to his house, with Jonqua and his wife; he took us up into a one-pair of stairs room, and said that was his apartment; we searched the place, and turning over some things at the bottom of a chest, we found a piece of cotton of the pattern of a piece the prosecutor had given me, it was about half a yard; I said to Gale, I have a piece of cotton in my hand from the person robbed, with which this seems to correspond, is that your's? he said, yes, all that is in that chest belongs to me; from thence we took them all to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160020"></xptr>the Office. We then went to the apartment of Jellison and his wife, in Angel-alley, Bishopsgate-street: Jellison's wife at first went with us; we found the bed-furniture, which the prosecutrix afterwards spoke to. We went to the house again with Jellison and Mrs. Thomas; Mrs. Thomas picked out a part of a muslin apron, and some other things, which she said were her property; I have had the custody of the things ever since. The cotton found at Jonqua's house, Ray has the possession of. The prisoners were committed, and brought up the following day, and re-committed. Then Jellison and his wife said, they wanted to speak to the Magistrate. They had been up once before.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what they said to the Magistrate, they were admitted Evidences for the Crown? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it at their own desire they communicated what they did to the Magistrate? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.When you were at Jellison's house, neither of the prisoners were with you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.There was nothing found at Jonqua's till you found the bit of silk in the evening? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Did you see the bag when you were there before? - A. Yes, but we did not examine it; it stood then by the side of the bed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q.Did you see what the bag contained in the morning? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q.You don't know whether Armstrong examined it? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to Gale's with a pattern, and found a piece of patch-work? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.When you came to Jellison's house, did you find the things concealed? - A. No; they were in a box with wearing apparel of their own.</p>
               <p>PETER MASON sworn. - I was with Vickery and Mrs. Thomas at Jonqua's house; I know no more than Vickery has stated. This is the piece of silk found in the work bag at Jonqua's, (producing it).</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoners were apprehended, did you hear any thing pass between them? - A. I happened to be in the necessary when they were locked up; one was in one lock-up room, and the other in another; I heard Gale call to Jonqua, says he, this is turned out a pretty business; what a bl-d rogue Jellison has turned out; and Jonqua asked him, whether they should ask to go to Newgate at once; John Gale made answer, no, it is of no use, there are so many things against us, we must come up again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.This was after they had been examined? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And knew there were many charges against them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body hear this conversation but yourself? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How were they separated? - A. By a thick partition, that they were obliged to holloa to make one another hear.</p>

               <p>Q. You know there is forty pounds reward if they are convicted? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JOHN ARMSTRONG sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Worship-street; I went with the other officers to Jonqua's house, I was present at the first search, none of this property was found.</p>

             sworn - I live with Mr. Davison, a pawnbroker, in Bishopsgate-street; I have a gown and petticoat pawned by a woman of the name of Jellison.</p>

               <p>Q. What name was it pawned in? - A.Mary Jellison.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Jellison.) What is your name? - A.Susannah.</p>

               <p>Q. Does the ticket describe where she lived? - A.Angel-alley, Bishopsgate-street; they were pawned for 16s.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Thomas.) Is that petticoat your's?- A. Yes, and the gown likewise.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you quite sure of it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Was that gown and petticoat in the box in that room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.What is the value of the gown and petticoat; are they worth a pound together?- A.More than a pound.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at the silk? - A. That is mine; it was in the box.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the bed-furniture? - A.It is my property; I made the eyelet holes in it myself.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at the patch-work? - A. It is mine; I am quite sure of it; the muslin apron is mine, and the pieces of the white gown, and a little skirt; they are all my property, and were all in the box, except the bed-furniture.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. The patch-work is only pieces not put together? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Gale's defence. Since I was in trouble, Jellison said she bought the things in Rosemary-lane.</p>
               <p>Jonqua's defence. At the time I was apprehended the things were lying about; Mrs. Jellison came in and said, I am come to sell you some children's caps; she had a heap of things in her apron, and when Armstrong came in, she let them down, and went to the window; she must certainly have dropped the things in the room.</p>

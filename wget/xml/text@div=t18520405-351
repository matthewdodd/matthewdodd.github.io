On the 22nd March, at a quarter past 6 o'clock in the morning, I saw the two prisoners coming down Holborn-hill—they were both riding in a cart which a donkey was drawing—Hurley was driving—I followed them to Victoria-street—I stopped them, and asked where they were going—Hurley replied that the man told them to mind the cart—I took him and the cart and donkey to the station—Crawley got away then, but I am sure he is the same person.</p>

                  </hi>. I have seen this donkey and cart—they are mine—I get my living by selling flowers in the street—I went to the market at a quarter before 6 o'clock—I gave a boy 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to mind the cart, which I left in the regular place where I always do leave it, in Shoe-lane—the boy came in the market afterwards, and I saw him unloading a load of plants—I went out to give the donkey a bit of hay, and it was gone.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Crawley. Q.</hi> Did not the boy tell you it was gone to the station? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I went as far as Holborn-hill looking for it—I afterwards saw it with the policeman—you ran away, I was told—I do not know whether I said it was done for a <hi rend="italic">lark.</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">Hurley's Defence.</hi> I was coming down Shoe-lane, and I met this little boy; he drew the donkey out, and said, "Which way are you going?" I said, "Down Holborn-hill;" he said, "Will you have a ride?" and he took us down to Victoria-street, and left us there about five minutes, and the policeman came and took us; I said, "What do you take me for?" he said, "On suspicion of stealing this donkey;" I said, "Come back, and there is the man," and he would not.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Somersetshire, but I am visiting at Hamilton-terrace, St. John's-wood. On 26th Oct., about 2 o'clock in the morning, I was in Waterloo-road, coming from Waterloo-bridge to Westmin<lb></lb>ster bridge-road—the prisoner and another female met me, stopped me, and asked where I was going—I said nothing, but walked on—the prisoner said, "Do come and see me"—she was standing before me, and would not allow me to pass—I suppose I walked two or three yards, not more, when a man came behind and pushed me somewhere about the shoulders (I had seen two men just before)—the prisoner at the same time caught hold of me, and another woman came up—the prisoner was endeavouring to unbutton my great coat—the other woman pulled open my coat, and the prisoner put her hand into my waistcoat pocket and took my watch—I am quite sure it was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185210250091"></xptr>
               <p>the prisoner—after I discovered my loss, I said, "You good-for-nothing woman, give me my watch"—I put down my right hand, and felt my watch in her hand—she was endeavouring to pass it to the other woman—I felt the prisoner put her hand in my pocket; I was able to see whose hand it was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then why did you say that you knew she put her hand in your pocket because you felt it; did you tell the Magistrate that it was her that put her hand in your pocket? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I did not tell him it was one of them, and not tell him which I felt it in—I am prepared to say that I saw her put her hand in my pocket, and what is more, I told the officer so—the prisoner had her hand under my great coat, the other woman stepped back—I saw the prisoner in that position, that I believe it washer band that was in my pocket—I consider that the other woman was very much intoxicated, she only pulled my coat open—the prisoner first tried to unbutton my great coat—the other woman came and pulled my coat open—the prisoner let go from below from the button as I kept my hand at the button, and she put her hand in my pocket and took my watch—the other woman was standing by—I caught hold of the prisoner, and would not let her go—I caught the other woman also, but she escaped, and left her shawl behind—I had great difficulty in holding both—the policeman came up immediately—the two men I passed a very few yards before I came to these women, and one came and pushed against me on the right—when the policeman came, these two men came back a little way—they did not come close to us, but a short distance off, to see what was going on—I was sober—I had been out to supper, but I had drank very little—the man pushed me on my right shoulder just before the women came to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But you said before, "Two men came up at the time, as soon as I called "Police!" and pushed against me"—is that true? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; they did not; that is the clerk's error—they did nothing, they stood at a little distance—the other woman came back—I did not see anything pass from one to the other, but the policeman said, "That is the woman who has your watch," and he pointed to the other woman—he said this woman had passed it—he said that in the prisoner's presence—the prisoner did not say anything at the time—I was very much excited—I could not have held the two women so long as I did if I had not been excited—I felt the watch in the prisoner's hand—the moment after she took the watch, I endeavoured to seize it in her hand—she had not had time to pass it then; but the other woman came up afterwards, and she passed it, but I did not see it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Are you sure that you felt my hand in your pocket? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I am perfectly certain it was your hand—you took the watch out of my pocket—I felt it in your hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then how came you to say before the Magistrate, "It was in the hand of one of them, but I can't say which?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The hands were together—she was trying to pass the watch—this deposition was read over to me—I only know that this woman took the watch from my pocket—I felt it in her hand—I have no recollection of swearing that I did not know in whose hand I felt the watch—I cannot account for it—I feel confident that this woman took it—I had supped in Fore-street—I cannot say what time I went to supper; it was late—I was not in liquor all the evening—I suppose it was between 10 and 11 o'clock when we supped—after that we had a friendly game at cards—there was drinking going on during the time—during the whole evening I drank two glasses and a half or three glasses of very weak gin and water; I never drink it strong—I was then going to West<lb></lb>minster Bridge-road—I knew it was too late to have an omnibus, and I did</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185210250092"></xptr>
               <p>not feel disposed to pay for a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I had made up my mind to go to a coffee house in Westminster Bridge-road to sleep, and I slept there that night, at Campbell's coffee house; a very clean place, and not expensive—many respectable persons sleep there.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, L</hi> 106). I was on duty in Waterloo-road, at 2 o'clock that morning—I heard a cry of "Police!"—I went up directly, and found the prosecutor standing by himself, and the prisoner by herself—the prosecutor had not got hold of her—one was standing by the houses, and the other by the side of the pavement—the prosecutor said, "I give this person in custody for robbing me of my watch"—the prisoner said nothing only that she heard the cry of "Police!" and came up—I took her into custody, and as I took her the one that is now at large came up—the prisoner put her hand out, and they grasped each other's hands—the woman that has escaped then ran away—I took the prisoner to the station—I could not prevent their hands grasping—I had the prisoner by the left arm, and she turned and put her right hand out to the other woman—the other woman ran away—I kept the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not tell the Magistrate, "I heard a cry of 'Police!' I went up, and saw the prosecutor holding a woman?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, that was the woman that has escaped—I had seen him holding a woman before I got up to them—that woman ran away—on her running away, her shawl dropped from her; she went away without it—I went up, and found the prisoner and the prosecutor standing—two men stood about twenty yards' distance when I first went up; but on my taking the prisoner forward, they came up to me, and said, "What is the matter?"—the woman that escaped came up with them when they came to ask what was the matter—the men came about the same time that the woman came and grasped the prisoner's hand—I believe the prosecutor had been drinking—he appeared to be in liquor, but appeared quite conscious of what he was doing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> The woman ran away? <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> The woman came up, together with the men, I am positive—they all three came up at one time, within about a yard of each other—I did not see the watch at all—I am quite sure that the woman who ran away in the first instance was the same who came up with the men—the shawl dropped from the woman six or seven yards from where I was—while I was taking the prisoner away, one of the men came and picked it up—it was impossible for me to make an effort to take the other woman—I must have let the prisoner go, to take the other—I did not call for assistance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I heard a cry of "Police!" I went up to see what was the matter; the prosecutor had hold of a woman; when he saw the policeman, he let her go, and came to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am serjeant of the 12th Lancers. I knew the deceased James Hamilton—he had no other Christian name, that I know of—he was also a sergeant in the 12th Lancers—the prisoner was a private in the same regiment—on Thursday, the 21st of June, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I received an order from Troop Sergeant-Major Murphy—in consequence of that I went in search of the prisoner Rickey—I went to Hampton Court Palace—the regiment was quartered at Hampton Court Barracks—that was where he ought to be if he was in to place—on that day he was stable sentry, and ought to have been at the barracks—I found him at the palace, within the quadrangle—when I first saw him he was standing at the entrance gate of the palace, going into the barrack yard—the deceased Hamilton joined me in the square—that was not before I saw Rickey—when Hamilton joined me we went towards where I saw Rickey—he did not stay till we came up to him, but went away—he went in the direction of Sir Horace Seymour's apartments—that is within the palace, up one of the passages—Sir Horace Seymour has</p>

               <p>apartments in the palace—we then went into the archway leading to Mrs. Wright's apartments, which are in the same passage as Sir Horace Sey<lb></lb>mour's—I saw Rickey again after we got into the passage—he was stand<lb></lb>ing at the angle of the passage—he had a pistol in each hand—they were cavalry pistols—he ought not, as stable sentry, to have had pistols with him—he presented the pistols in the direction that we were going—he per<lb></lb>sented them both at the same moment, one in one hand, and the other in the other—Hamilton asked him to go quietly home—that was after he per<lb></lb>sented the pistols—the prisoner said, "Hamilton, if you do not go back, I will shoot you"—Hamilton then requested me to return, as he thought he was better able to get him back than I was, because he was better as quainted with his temper—I then returned by the way I had entend—I had got about twenty yards off, into the court-yard, before I heard any thing—they would not be in my sight if I had looked that way—I then heard the report of fire-arms—I did not go back to the passage that was but entered the passage by another direction—I saw the deceased, and saw Rickey in charge of the guard—he was two or three yards from Humilts when I saw him—Hamilton said to me that he was shot—he was standing up—he was in charge of the guard.</p>

                  </hi>. I am troop serjeant-major of the 12th Lancer. I know the prisoner Rickey—on the 21st of June he was the stable senty at the stable of the troop in the old barracks—it was his duty as such sentry to be at the stable in the evening of that day—on the evening of that day I found he was in the barrack-room, between seven and eight o'clock—this was before he was taken into custody, before the misfortune happened—there was a file of guards sent for to take him into custody before he was taken I saw him in the barrack-room—this was before the misfortune—I saw him go in the direction of the palace—he had a pistol in each hand—I did not go with the guard—I only saw him going from the barrack-yard—I saw him going, with a pistol in each hand, in the direction of the palace—I did not see him leave the barrack-room—I did not see him taken into custody.</p>

               <p>selected him to an appointment under myself, by which he derived some advantage; it was to clean my horse and accoutrements, and to keep the stores clean—I saw him in custody afterwards—I observed the appearance of bit face and eyes—his eyes seemed staring, and rather wild, and his countenance flushed—I believe he had been drinking—I had not seen him drink any thing that night—he had the appearance of a man who was ex<lb></lb>cited by liquor.</p>

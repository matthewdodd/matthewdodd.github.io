                  </hi>. I live at 39, Radnor-street, and am employed by the Mint—on 6th December I; went to 2, Leslie's-gardens, Bermondsey about 8 o'clock in the morning, with Inspectors Fife and Brannan, and Sergeants Leather, Elliott, and Raymond—I found the street door shut and locked—it was forced open, and I immediately proceeded to the second floor—on the way up stairs, before I got to the second floor, there was this flap-door, which I produce—it was on the landing; it covered the well of the stairs completely—when I went up the flap was thrown open—I went into a top room on the second floor—the house consists of three rooms, one over the other—there was a little boy there in bed—the prisoner was not in that room—there was a fireplace in it; the fire was not alight—I found there this ladle with white metal in it, and this pad on it—the lead is in the ladle now as I found it—this ladle was also close to it, with some portion of dregs of metal in it, which had also been melted—on the table I found three files, with white metal in their teeth, a cup with sand and water in it, and a basin with sand and water in it, some brushes, and by the table close to the fire two galvanic batteries (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>,) charged with acid solution, with wires attached to them, and several pieces of small wire which had also been dipped in solution—close to that I found a bag containing plaster of Paris in powder, some sand, some slips of paper out and some uncut—under the stove, in the cinders, I found a quantity of metal, and I also found several bottles containing acid, three iron clamps, and a tin band with plaster of Paris in it, as it now appears—it is used for making a mould—when the plaster is in a fluid state, it is poured on to it—I also found this glass with plaster of Paris on it; the clamps are used for holding the mould while the plaster of Paris is poured in—I also found on the table a piece of antimony and a get, that forms the channel of the mould when the metal is poured in—this is the metal which remains in the channel; it overflows—I found several pieces of silver leaf, and a quantity of copper wire about the place, an iron spoon with plaster on it, and the bottom of a bottle with a little composition on it, which is used for scouring the coin, to give it a dull ap<lb></lb>pearance, to make it appear as if it had been in circulation—all the things that I found are materials and implements which can be used in the false making of coin—I found every requisite there for that purpose, except the mould—after finding all these things, I went down stairs, and found the prisoner in the custody of Sergeant Leather—I called the prisoner by name, and said I had received instructions from the solicitor to the Mint to en<lb></lb>deavour to put a stop to his coining, and his extensive dealings in counter<lb></lb>feit coin—he made no answer to that—I said, "Do you occupy the house?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Do you occupy the room above?"—he said, "Yes, my little boy is in bed there"—that was the room where I found</p>

               <p>these things—I then showed him the things, and said they were coining implements—he said, "Yon are very clever, Mr. Brannan, they are not coin<lb></lb>ing instruments"—I then showed him the get, and said, "What do you call this?" and he made no reply—nothing was said about a <hi rend="italic">plumb</hi> till afterwards at the police-station—I believe he adopted the word from some one else—he was taken to the station—there was no name on the house or the door; it is in a secluded place, nearly opposite the Congregational Church, leading into the market-gardens—I believe respectable parties would be frightened to go down there unprotected—there was no appearance at all of a business of electro-plating in the house.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant G</hi> 6). I went with Brannan and the other constables to this house—I followed Brannan up to the first floor, and went into the room, there I saw the prisoner run to the window, shove it up, and he was about getting out—I laid hold of bin and dragged him back—he said, "Ok, dear, I thought I bad got out of the old b—s way, I never thought he would have found me out down here"—he then said, "So help me God, I have not been making these two or three days, for I wag in<lb></lb>formed he intended paying me a visit; it is a fortunate job for me that you came so early this morning; had you been a little later you would have bid me to rights. You will find enough to get me committed for trial, I dare say, but I shall be turned up"—I believe the meaning of "turned up "is ac<lb></lb>quitted—something was said about the trap—he said, "Had you come a little later you would have had me to rights. It would have taken you all your time to get up"—there were three children in the room, and he said, God help his children, they could not help his roguery; one of them is blind—I found one good shilling on the floor and seven in his pocket.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How far did he get out of window? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> His head was partly out, he had no chance of getting any further—I said nothing to him before he made the statement which I have repeated—I was in the room about an hour with him—he said it without the least suggestion on my part—I knew nothing of what was taking place up stairs, or what was found there—Sergeant Elliott was in the room; he was near enough to hear the statement the prisoner made—the room is not large—I was in plain clothes.</p>

I went with Brannan and the other officers to the prisoner's house on 6th December—I first went up to the top room with Brannan—I went into the room to Leather, after hearing him call for assistance; I found him struggling with the prisoner—the prisoner said, "Oh, dear, I did not think the old b would have found me out down here; but, so help me God, I have not been making these two or three days. No doubt you will find enough up there to commit me, but I shall be turned up. It would have taken you all your time to get up"—he was very violent, and I had to put a pair of handcuffs on him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of coin to the Mint, and have been so for many years—counterfeit coin is invariably electro-plated before it is sent into circulation—here are batteries, acids, antimony, sand, a frame for making a mould, tins for holding a mould, and a ladle for melting metal, with metal in it—this get has been attached to a coin, and, most likely, to a shilling—when coin it removed from the mould, it is usual to file it, to take away the mark of the get; but at the present time they make it almost perfect, and the file is less used than it was formerly, on account of the formation of the mould—the <hi rend="italic">nurling</hi> is more complete—the only thing wanting here is the mould—there is plaster of Paris in this basin, and a piece of glass, for the purpose of putting it on—here are files for finishing the coin, with metal in the teeth—then comes the finishing part of it, the battery coating it with silver, and then the sand to clean the coins—this is the sort of battery which is used for coating counterfeit coin—it could be used by an electro-plater, but it would be on a very small scale—the antimony is used to mix with the other metal to make the coin sound better—there are some strips of paper here, which may be Used for wrapping the coin up. in when it is made—there is plenty of silver leaf, which is put into the battery, and the action of the battery puts the silver on to the coin—the sand is used to take away the brightness after it is completed—sometimes they put on grease, or black stuff—there is here a little pot containing grease for that purpose.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Which is the end of the get attached to the coin. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The small end—there may be some cyanide of silver here; there is a solu<lb></lb>tion of sulphuric acid—cyanide of potassium is not at all necessary, but it is sometimes used—sulphuric acid is used for the battery.</p>

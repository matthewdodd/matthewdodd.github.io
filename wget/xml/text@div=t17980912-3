               <p>Q. You were half an hour, or an hour, perhaps, before you returned from your dinner to make up your bundle? - A. We were not ten minutes.</p>




               <p>Q. It was some time after they were gone before you missed these things? - A. It was about a quarter of an hour.</p>

               <p>Q. Nothing of your property was found upon them? - A. No.</p>

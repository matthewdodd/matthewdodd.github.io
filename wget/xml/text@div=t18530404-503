                  </hi>. I am a barge builder, and live at Shadwell. On Sat, 5th March, between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening, the prisoner passed me in Bishopsgate-street; he said something to another man, and I passed him—I had never seen him before, he seemed to be very much in liquor—he then overtook me and said something in his own language, I said nothing to him; he came alongside of me, and said in English, "Look at my nose?" I turned round to look at it, and he up with a knife, and cut my forehead (I have had two or three half pints of porter, but it has not hurt me), my forehead bled very much indeed; the prisoner said something and walked off—I went to a doctor—I was quite sober, I bad not bad my week's money five minutes.</p>

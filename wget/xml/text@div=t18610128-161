                  </hi>. I keep the Adam and Eve public-house in York-street, Westminster-road—on 18th January last, about a quarter to 4 in the afternoon, the two prisoners came to my bar—they called for 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of gin and 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of peppermint, which they were supplied with by my son; I was then in the adjoining bar—as soon as my son had served them I came into the front bar—I saw that Holloway had something in his right hand by way of payment, and I stepped forward to take the money—he then withdrew his right hand and put out his left hand with a half-sovereign and asked for change—that strengthened my suspicion that something wrong was intended, and I went to my till and was very particular in giving them change—I put down a crown-piece, a half-crown, two shillings, and three pence, making 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he had previously given me the half-sovereign—I placed the change on the counter before them—they did not seem inclined to take it up—I waited about half a minute—I never lost sight of the change for a moment, but I turned myself round partly, so, with my eye still fixed on the change, and I saw Holloway immediately snatch up 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and pass it about two inches below the counter, and the left band of Holloway met the right hand of Cole simultaneously, as it were, as if by magic—I imme<lb></lb>diately turned round, and Holloway said, <hi rend="italic">"Governor</hi>, you have made a mistake, there is 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. short here"—I said, "I see there is only 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. there now, but I put down 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—"Oh, no, you have not," he said, "I have not touched it"—I said, "I know better, I saw you take 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and pass it to that man"—he said, "No I have not"—I said, "Have you it in your hand, then?"—he paid, "No," opening both hands—I then said to Cole, "You have it in that hand"—without opening his hand he put his hand into his pocket; he would not show me his hand; and brought up a quantity of silver, and said, "I have plenty of money of my own"—I said, "One of those shillings are mine, and I shall either charge you with stealing that 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or endeavouring to obtain one from me by false pretences"—they said, "That is just the thing, <hi rend="italic">governor</hi>, that will suit us; you dare give us in charge, we will have your by house from over your head, if you dare charge us; and set Mr. Lewis on to you; we will have the gold watch out of your pocket: you dare do anything to us"—I said I should send for a policeman, and I sent my little boy—I said, "As you have no particular objection to the presence of a policeman, perhaps you will wait"—I called my potman and went round the bar to await the arrival of the policeman—they waited for about half a minute and then said, "We will not wait for any policeman, we will summons you, that is the best way;" and they threw me violently on one side and my man on the other, and made their escape through the door—I sent my man in pursuit of them—a policeman came within half a minute and we pursued the prisoners for about 150 yards; as soon as they saw we were in pursuit of them they stopped.</p>

I met this man in York-street, Westminster, I had not seen him for a month or two; he asked me to have a glass; I was talking to him and did not notice what he put down. I heard a dispute; he said, "Landlord, you have not given me sufficient change;" I looked and said, there was only 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. there; the landlord said, "You are b----y scoundrels"—I said, "That is not a fit way to speak; don't have any; disturbance, you have got another remedy for it." He flew out of the bar and said we should not go out, but he would give us in charge. We went out, but as soon as we saw the policeman we stopped.</p>

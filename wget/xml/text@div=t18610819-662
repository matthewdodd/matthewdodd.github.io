I keep a chandler's shop in Myddleton-street, Clerkenwell—on Thursday-evening, 11th July, I gave the prisoner in custody—she had been there as near as I recollect about a month before—I did not notice what she purchased then—she gave me a sixpence—after she had gone on that occasion she came back again in about an hour after, had an egg which was</p>

               <p>three farthings, and paid me with a sixpence—I gave her change, and she left with the egg and the change—I kept the sixpence in my hand; it was not a minute before I examined it, I should think; and I said it was just like the one I had taken before—I found that it was a bad one, and kept it by itself—I gave it to the constable on 11th July, when I took the other bad one—the prisoner came again on that day, in the evening, and wanted articles to the value of 6 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I knew her again—she tendered a crown; I saw it was bad directly she put it down—I sent my son for a constable, and gave her into custody with the bad sixpence—I gave the crown to my son, and he gave it to the constable.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 6, Beresford Street, Wool<lb></lb>wich; I receive an allowance of 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and draw it monthly—on 13th May I met the prisoner; he spoke to me, and at his request I went to the Woodman public-house and had some ale—I had in my purse three sovereigns and five shillings mixed with some coppers—it was in the right pocket of my dress—the prisoner was on my right side, and another soldier on my left—I saw my purse in the prisoner's hand, and said, "That is my purse, give it me"—he said, "It is all right, drink"—I thought he was joking—I asked him for it several times, but he still kept it, saying, "Drink, it is all right"—I went to the people at the bar and asked them to get me a policeman, but, as one did not come, I went to the door to get one—I then went back and begged the prisoner to give it to me—he showed me another purse with gold and silver in it, and said he had plenty of money belonging to him, he did not want mine—I followed him and gave him in charge—I had noticed a scratch on one of the sovereigns—my purse buttoned over with a brass button—this is the sovereign (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), it is marked across the nose—there was a scratch similar to this and I recognise it—I was sober.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you known the prisoner before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I met him casually in the street, and went to drink with him—I have a weak ankle, and was very glad to sit down—I did not reel about—I was not the worse for liquor—I had not been with a sergeant of marines in the course of the day; beside this man there was a civilian—it is not a fact that I had been with a sergeant of marines and drunk 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of drink—I met the prisoner in Artillery Place, about a quarter of an hour's walk from the public-house—I did not take his arm—he overtook me on the road—it was between twelve and one in the day—I have not seen my purse again—the purse I afterwards saw with money in it was not mine—seven or ten minutes elapsed from my leaving the public-house to my giving him into custody—I followed him and tried to keep my eye on him, that he did not run away—the money was produced before the Magistrate—I looked at it and returned it to the Magistrate—I did not point out to the Magis<lb></lb>trate the mark on the nose, it was at the back; there is another scratch; the scratch I refer to is not where the Queen's head is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then just point out where the scratch is? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> This is the one that I fancied I saw—the mark is on the nose.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But you said just now that the mark was on the back, another mark? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had noticed one on the nose.</p>

STRAIGHT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not this put into your hands at the police-court, and did not you examine it before you said by what you identified it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I did not say before the Magistrate that I identified it by a mark on the back as well as on the nose—I tell you to-day for the first time about the mark on the back—I saw no mark on the back before—I gave no description of this sovereign at the police-court.</p>

               <p>had seen the sovereign? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I said to the man I gave him in charge to, that there was a scratch on one of the sovereigns—I did not describe to him what the mark was—all I said was, that there was a mark on one of them—the mark I do speak to is over the head—the mark on the sovereign I lost, was on the nose.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where is there any mark from the back of the head to the nose here; you had not observed on any sovereign you lost, a mark from the point of the nose to the rim? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was on the face, I did not take much notice of it.</p>

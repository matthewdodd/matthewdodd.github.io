                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>). On 13th January, about 9 in the evening, I was in Fenchurch-street with a brother officer—I saw the prisoner Cook pass down the street with a bundle on his arm—I and my brother-officer stopped him, and asked what he had got—he said that he worked at a wholesale fruiterer's in the city, and they had given it him for a Christmas-box—I looked, and found it was a drum of figs—we asked him who his master was, and he refused to tell us—I thought his pocket looked very bulky, and found in it these boxes of fruit—he said he had that to deliver—I asked him where, and he refused to tell me—I took him to the station, and there he said, "I will tell you who I had them from, from a young man named William, in Botolph-lane"—when Conway was brought in, Mr. Bower, who was there, spoke to Conway, and he said he was very sorry that he had stolen these two boxes, and given them to Cook—he afterwards told Mr. Bower he had been robbing him for a fortnight—Cook afterwards said Conway gave him all the boxes.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am overseer to Mr. Baldwin.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the prisoners? - Yes; I know them both; one was an apprentice in the house; but I knew nothing of the woman till she brought the information. I went with the clerk to Pearce's lodgings to see about the paper; she said, though she was concerned with him, he was so great a villain she would do any thing she could to get rid of him. I went and found the paper at Mr. Kettle's; then I went in search of Blake. As soon as Blake found the woman had betrayed him, he told me the woman was equally concerned with him; that she was as guilty as he was; that she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177806030030"></xptr> went with him, knowing he was going to rob his master. I promised him nothing. After he was fully committed, he confessed twice to me that he took the paper.</p>
               <p>- KETTLE sworn.</p>
               <p>I keep a chandler's-shop in Union Court, Holborn: Blake sold me twelve quires of paper; this is the whole of it (producing it) he brought a quire first, and asked me if I would buy any of that paper; I looked at it; it was a damaged quire. I asked him if he had any more; he said he had, and brought the rest; he asked me three shillings, I gave him half a crown.</p>
               <p>Mr. Selfe. I have compared the paper with that which is at home; it exactly corresponds both as to size and marks. I have no doubt of its being Mr. Baldwin's property. The paper was made for a particular piece of work - Johnson's Poets. Upon the woman's information we examined and missed the paper.</p>
               <p>Question from Blake. Ask Mr. Selfe if ever I was near the house since I was out of my time, which was two years ago? - Yes, my Lord, and he knows I have frequently bid him go out.</p>
               <p>BLAKE's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>A young fellow, one Clews, brought this paper to me; he is a barber; he said he was going to Bath, and bid me make the best of it. I sold it to that man.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 75, Campbell Road, Bow, and am a floor-cloth manufacturer to a large extent—on 31st January I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in the envelope marked "A"—in consequence of that I spoke to the police, and on 3rd February I wrote a reply—on the 8th I received this other letter marked "C"—I wrote another reply to that, and received this marked "E"—I wrote again—this is the letter I then wrote (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was sent to the address mentioned in the letters—I know nothing of the prisoner beyond having seen him at a house of business three or four years ago.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have never seen him write—I have a letter in my pocket which purports to be signed by him, written from the prison—when I received the first of these letters, I did think something of it, inasmuch as I had discharged a man some three or four mouths before, and that man told my watchman that he would burn my place down, and when I received this letter I thought very likely it might be connected with him in some way, and I immediately placed it in the hands of the authorities at Arbour Square—I thought that somebody had heard of the workman's threat, and was trying to get money out of it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer K</hi>). From information I received I went to 12, Chalk Farm Road, post-office, on the 10th February—I saw the prisoner come in, and heard him ask for a letter addressed "C"—I saw a letter given to him—he opened it—I had previously seen that letter in the post-office, and had posted it by order of Mr. Jeune—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "75, Camp<lb></lb>bell Road, Bow, 11 February, 1871. Sir,—In reply to your note of yesterday, a gentleman will meet you at the time you call for this note, with instructions what to do in the matter. W. R. Jeune.")—On the 14th of February the prisoner came to the post-office—he looked in at the door, and passed on—I went and stopped him, and said "Walk into the post-office.</p>

               <p>Are you the gentleman who wants a letter addressed to 'C?'"—he said "Yes, what of that?"—I said "I am a police-constable; you have been writing letters to Mr. Jeune, demanding money by menaces"—he said "Yes, I have written three, and I can give him information, but I don't know how I shall be able to prove it, as I only got the information second-hand, and the party is out of London"—I then took him into custody—the post<lb></lb>master gave him this letter marked "G."</p>

I had one letter, in November last, in the name of Childs, who I did not know, offering to sell me something, but no other letters offering information, except these three—(<hi rend="italic">The letters were read as follows</hi>:—(A.) "Sir,—You are in danger of suffering a heavy loss; say, of thousands; but can be saved from it for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., at once paid to C., 12, Chalk Farm Road, with promise of silence and secrecy; not a sentence must be uttered to anyone; write answer"—(C.) "Violence bodily; forgery; competi<lb></lb>tion; arson. Sir, you are in iminent danger from one or other of the above things, C."—(E.) "Sir, it is impossible I can explain until I have re<lb></lb>ceived the reward. I would not incur the loss or injury for 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to say the least, if I were you. I have no doubt you might consider the loss of 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or more, preferable to the impending loss, &amp;c. If I receive the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which is little enough, surely, for such a service; after receiving which, I will at once give you all necessary information, and you will be in a position to get larger damages, without a doubt: certainly, you can have a justifiable action. You can send the money in Bank of England notes; send the first halves, and wait for an acknowledgment of them before send<lb></lb>ing the whole. On Monday, I shall expect another letter from you. Your great friend, C."</p>

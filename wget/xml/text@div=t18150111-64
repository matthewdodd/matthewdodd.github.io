In Long lane three men surrounded me. As soon as they surrounded me I put my hand to my watch, it was gone, I took notice of the man in front of me, I believe the prisoner to be the man, but I do not speak with certainly. I followed them into Aldersgate street, when they run I lost sight of him before he was stopped by the watchman; I wished him to give me my watch before he was charged; the watch was not found upon him.</p>

            . I am a watchman; I saw the prisoner running in Aldersgate street; he turned, and run the other way, as if he was going to Islington. I catched him; the prosecutor was near; he said he believed he was the man. I took him to the watchhouse; the constable searched him, nothing was found upon him.</p>

There was a cry of stop thief; the watchman stopped me; the prosecutor came up and gave charge of me because I was running.</p>

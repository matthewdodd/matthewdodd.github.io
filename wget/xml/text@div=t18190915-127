               <p>1209.

            . I am a bookbinder. I was at the Two Brewers, public-house, the prisoner was buying old clothes, and I sold him a coat; he called me into the yard, shewed me an old coat, and asked if I wanted any of these things, and said the very best were only seven shillings a score; I said I would meet him again, and went and informed Armstrong of it; he gave me three half-crowns, a sixpence, and six shillings, which he marked. I went to the Two Brewers, in Soho, by appointment, and after sitting an hour the prisoner came in, and asked if I was ready for him. I had ordered two score. I said I was, and gave him the 14 s., which he put in his right-hand pocket. He went out, I followed him, he gave me from his left hand into my right hand, a parcel containing counterfeit shillings. I kept talking to him - the officers came from the opposite public-house, and took us both. The bad money was taken from me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ARABIN. Q. Was you ever here before - A. Once, against a person for selling bad money. I live in White-street, Bethnal-green.</p>

            . I am an officer. Masters applied to me, I took him to the magistrate, who ordered me to attend to it. I gave him directions to meet me at the Horns, at Shoreditch, which he did, and we proceeded, with my son and Gleed, to the Two Brewers; he went on, and we went to the White Swan, nearly opposite, waited there, and went out in about an hour - I saw my son take the prisoner, I took Masters, and found a paper containing forty counterfeit shillings; he said he had them from the prisoner - the prisoner said nothing.</p>

            . I searched Masters all over - he had nothing about him. I gave him three half-crowns, six shillings, and a sixpence, which I marked; we got into a coach, and went to the White Swan. I saw the prisoner and Masters walking from the Two Brewers, I saw something go from the prisoner to Masters, which he put into his pocket. We went out, took the prisoner, and found all the marked money in his pocket. He said he brought it from home that morning.</p>

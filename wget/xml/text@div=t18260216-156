            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the 16th of February - I searched his premises with Mr. Colling; the house was shut up, but we got in by knocking; the prisoner had been taken at the sugar-house, and he went with us; I found this sugar in the kitchen.</p>

I have two partners - the prisoner was in our employ, On the 16th of February, I had him apprehended - and searched his house; I was present when this sugar was found, and I have here some sugar which corresponds with it - it was refined last Tuesday week; I have no doubt whatever that it is ours; this lump was taken on Wednesday; he asked me some time ago, if I would allow him sugar - I said, "Certainly not;" I thought his salary very ample, but I would sell him a little, provided it was broken up, and entered in a book, and paid for; on the 17th of January we sold him seven pounds broken up into small pieces.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. CRESWELL. Q. How long had he been in your employ? A. About six years; I have sold him rather better than seven pounds of sugar, but not without mentioning it to my partners, and its being entered in the book; these lumps are all numbered on the bottom, - the days they are made, or cut out, as we call it.</p>

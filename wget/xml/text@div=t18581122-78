On Monday night, 1st November, the prisoner came with another man about five minutes past 11 o'clock—I served the prisoner with half-a-quartem of gin; he gave me a shilling—I saw that it was bad, but gave him the change and put it on the top of the till—they both went out, and I took off my cap and apron, and went out after them, keeping the shilling in my hand—when I got outside they were not above twelve yards off—I followed them into Mr. Louder's, the Old King's Head—they went in at one door and I at the other—Mrs. Butler was serving—I called for a pint of ale, and they called for a pennyworth of gin and half-a-pint of ale—I could not see them as there was a partition between—some one gave Mrs. Butler a shilling which she said was bad—I went round to the other side of the partition, and said to the prisoner, "I want another shilling for this one which you passed at my house—he said that he knew nothing about it—I said, "You have just left my house not two minutes ago, and I followed you"—he pretended to be drunk, and said that he knew nothing about it—I fancy that he was sober when at my house—I said, "I do not want any more bother with you, give me the 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I gave you"—he said that he had not got any more money—the man who was with him got away—there was a woman waiting outside—a constable was sent for, and the prisoner was given in charge with the shilling which I marked (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

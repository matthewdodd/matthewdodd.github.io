            . I lost my watch on Friday night, the 11th of May, between ten and eleven o'clock. I was going from Shadwell to Limehouse: I met the prisoner Arnold in the street, she accosted me. I was very much intoxicated she drew my watch from my pocket, at which time I catched hold of the seals and part of the chain. I turned the chain round my finger with my left hand, by some means she forced the watch from me. She then said if I would go home with her she would give me the watch back again; I then went on with her a little way; she repeated the same, if I would go home with her she would give me the watch. She took me to the house of Mrs. Mead.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you pass some watchman - A. I believe I did, but I had not my regular senses although I knew what passed. Mead lived in <placeName id="t18130602-86-crimeloc456">Angel-gardens, Shadwell</placeName>

I went up stairs with her, and Mead came in the room; some discourse passed between the prisoner, but what I do not know. Mrs. Mead went out of the room. The prisoner Arnold persuaded me to go to bed, and she would give me the watch in the morning. I went to bed and fell asleep, and when I awoke a candle was burning, and no one there but myself; I dressed myself and went down stairs. I saw some people down stairs, but not Arnold.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw the prosecutor; from his information I apprehended Arnold; she said she would not be transported by herself, Mrs. Mead had as much right to be transported as she, they went together to pawn the watch, and Mrs. Mead had one of the one-pound notes. I went back and took Mrs. Mead in custody. I found in a box a one-pound note, which the pawnbroker said he gave.</p>
               <p>- . I am a pawnbroker. I produce the watch; Arnold pledged it with me on the 18th of May, in company with another woman, not Mead. I lent her two pound on it; the one-pound note produced by Mr. Brown is one of the one-pound notes.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is my watch; my name is upon the dial plate.</p>

I was coming home; I met Mr. Cole; he asked to come home with me; he came home with me; he had no money to give me; he said he would leave the watch until the morning. The prosecutor went away. I never saw him again until the Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Mead was not called upon for her defence.</p>

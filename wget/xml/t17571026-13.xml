            . I am an officer in the parish of St. Leonard Shoreditch. Last Tuesday was se'n-night in the morning, the prisoner was observ'd by one of the watchmen to be lurking about with a copper boiler and saucepan; he watch'd him into the Bull alehouse in Kingsland road, and then came and told me what he had seen. I went and found the prisoner there, and ask'd him where he got these things from? he said he had them at Hackney, of a person that was in necessity, and in fear of being seiz'd by his landlord. I went with him thither, and found what he said was false. Then he said he had them at Islington. I went there, and enquiring about found they belong'd to the prosecutrix. She saw and swore to them. (Produced in Court.)</p>
               <p>Q. Where have they been since?</p>
               <p>Chappel. They have been in my custody ever since.</p>

               <p>I had them of a man that is not to be found. He took them from Mrs. Chapman.</p>

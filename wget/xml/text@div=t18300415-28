On the 5th of April, about four or five o'clock in the afternoon, I saw two rings in Mr. Savage's bed-room drawer- I suppose them to be diamond rings; I left them there - I had gone into the room to make the bed, as Mrs. Savage was without a servant; in the course of the afternoon I heard the kitchen door open, locked out of window, and saw the prisoner come out of the kitchen with hot water in a pail - I did not see where he went - the door was not locked.</p>

            . I live at No. 22, Compton-street, Clerkenwell. I was in Clerkenwell-prison last Thursday, on suspicion of felony, and have been discharged - the prisoner came into the same yard as I was in, and sat down by me; I was at tea - it might be between three and four o'clock; he asked me how I thought he should get on -I said he knew his case better than me; I had not talked to him before, and did not know what he was there for - he told me he was charged with stealing two diamond rings, one a plain one, and the other a white one, with two rubies in it - I asked what made them accuse him more than the other servants; he said, because he went in for some hot water that afternoon - I asked whether he had them; he said Yes, he had them, but no blame was to be attached to him, for the coachman's wife had had a young woman to see her, and they had examined the rings, and also the other servants were held in 50l. bail - he said the rings were not missed that day, but he went out with the carriage, and his master told him he might go home about eight o'clock in the evening; that his master returned between twelve and one, missed them, called some of the servants up, and told them he missed them - that he went to bed, and tied them up in his shirt that evening; the next morning he was cleaning his harness in the stable, and his master sent for an officer<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150032"></xptr>and while the officer was gone for he concealed the rings in one of three empty stalls, between the bricks; that he pulled up the dirt, covered them over again, and threw some loose hay-seeds over them; I went with Duke, the officer, to the stables, on Saturday, and was with him when he found the rings in one of the stalls, as described by the prisoner; he said, when he went for the hot water he opened the looking-glass drawer, and took them out - that there was a gold watch and gold snuff-box there; I asked what made him take them in particular - he said because they were the most portable, and that he intended to have pawned them.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the occasion of his telling you all this? A. He said if I could sell them for him he would give me half the money; I told him I did not know what to do with such things - I was liberated the same day (Saturday) and told Reid, the officer, at Hatton-garden, of this directly I went there; he was the first officer I saw.</p>

            . I am a constable of Hatton-garden. I first heard of this robbery on Saturday morning last, when Wood was before the Magistrate - I made a search between eleven and twelve o'clock, and found nothing; I made another search in about half an hour - I searched for some time, and in the third stall from the door, between the bricks, about two inches down, I dug up with a knife a piece of paper with these two rings; after finding them I understood the prisoner wanted to speak to Mr. Savage - I went to the lock-up room with Mr. Savage; he began to cry, and said, "Oh, Mr. Savage, do forgive me! I am guilty, it is my first offence;" nothing had been said to induce him to say this.</p>
               <p>MR. SAVAGE. These are my rings - I gave sixty guineas for one, and fifty for the other; I was on horseback on Monday afternoon, from four to seven o'clock, and then went to a friend's in the coach at eight, but discharged it at half-past ten, with the two servants, the prisoner and another - I went to the prison two days after he had been there; he then began crying, and pretended to know nothing about it - I said, "I wish you would confess, because suspicion is greatly on you, and I think you are the person; if you will confess to me I will give you something;" he said he was as innocent as a lamb and cried - this was on Tuesday or Wednesday.</p>

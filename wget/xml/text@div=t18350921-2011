                  </hi>. I am a sailor. On Sunday, the 13th of September, about two o'clock in the morning, I was returning home down Back-lane, Smithfield—I was rather fresh—I remember seeing three sweeps and two girls standing together as I passed—I did not speak to them—the two girls left them and <hi rend="italic">clapped</hi> hold of each side of me—they walked a little distance with me, and asked where I was going—I said I was going home—I walked a few paces further and two sweeps came before me and one behind me, and struck me—I did not hear them say any thing—they struck me, and I struck at them again—I fell down and my hat flew off—when I was down the sweeps kicked me—when I got up, I looked for my hat and it was gone—I do not know who had got it—It was a silk hat—I had bought it about four weeks before—that was all I lost—I cannot swear to any of the pri<lb></lb>soners—I had no money about me—I had been to a public-house with a friend, who treated me—I had no money when I went out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an unfortunate woman. I was out on the morning in question in the Back-lane, East Smithfield—I saw Lewis there at two o'clock—he had got hold of these two girls arm-in-arm, one on each side—I did not take notice whether they had hold of him or he of them—they were walking together—I then saw the three male prisoners about five minutes' walk from the prosecutor—they came up and knocked him down—I said, "For God's sake if you rob him, don't murder him"—with that the girls took his hat and went up Anthony-street—the male prisoners are the three sweeps—I had not seen them standing with the girls before—Connell said he would serve me the same if I did not go away—I saw one of them kick the sailor in the side at the time Connell knocked him down.</p>

The prisoner has been my shopwoman for fifteen months—in consequence of circumstances I gave a marked sixpence and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to be brought to the shop—it was her duty to enter everything in this book, and also to make a check on a small piece of paper, with the number of the customers she had served during the day, the amount of money she had taken, and the number of her book—I produce two tickets, No. 6, for 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and No. 9, for 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and they are so entered in the prisoner's check-book—I charge her with having received 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the first occasion, and 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the second—she only paid 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—that was on Saturday, the 9th of April—she ought to have paid 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—both payments were made within a half or three quarters of an hour.</p>

               <p>sold of stock—we have had bills up, stating, "The stock of this shop selling off under prime cost," and "Tremendous Sacrifice!"—I re<lb></lb>moved a stock from a shop I had a little higher up, and we were endeavour<lb></lb>ing to sell that stock off—that was the stock that was stated to be sold at an immense sacrifice—that has happened about three times in the course of my life, within two years—the goods are all ticketed—I gave some of the marked money to Mr. Weeks to give one of the witnesses—it was a trap—the 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. consisted of a sixpence, a penny-piece, and four halfpence—I have not been here before—I had a person up some time ago for robbing me—the 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. consisted of a sixpence and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. marked—I cannot be positive whether they were pence or halfpence—I never was positive about it—I received the prisoner from her sister—she had lived with her fifteen years—her sister is in trade—I heard that she had borne an unblemished character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the sister of the prisoner's first wife. Her name was Ann Lover Reeves—I was present at their marriage, on 3rd June, 1841, it the Sub-deanery parish Church, Chichester—he got between 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with her—they had both been in the service of one of the canons—they lived together nine months, at the Nag's Head, Marshall-street, London—I did not see them there—I only saw them for three days after the marriage—about twelve months afterwards she came down to Chichester by the road wagon, with only 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., ust enough to pay her fare—after that I supported her some time, and then she applied to the parish—about twelve months after she came, she went into the Bethnal-green Lunatic Asylum—about nine months afterwards she came to me again, and remained with me two or three years, and then went permanently to the Lunatic Asylum, where she is now—I saw her there this morning—she came down to Chichester three times, and went three times to London—I did not see the prisoner again till this day fortnight—I bad received one or two letters from him after she first came down—I received the letters in 1843—I Have not got them here—I have received none since—I have written several letters to him, but not since 1843—I never had any answer.</p>

                  </hi>. I have known the prisoner these eight years—he was living in Portland-place—I knew he was married, but thought his wife was dead—I went through the ceremony of marriage with him, on 3rd Feb., 1849—he had represented himself to me as a widower; and to my best belief, he thought he was, for I had reason to think his wife was dead, because he had a letter in Boulogne to that effect—I saw the letter, and he told me he had received it in reference to his wife's death—he was very low, and said he had had bad news, and his wife was dead—he did not tell me who it came from, only from Chichester—that was late in 1844, five years before we were married—he had told me about his previous marriage at Chichester—he told me he had sent his wife to Chichester—I knew she was an inmate of the Marylebone Infirmary—that was before I knew him—I had very little money, I do not know how much—I was left a widow, and had not saved much—I have a child by the prisoner—I had been a widow ten years when I married him—I went down to Chichester myself.</p>

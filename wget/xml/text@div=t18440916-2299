                  </hi>. I am a carpenter and beer-shop keeper, and live on Twickenham-common—the prisoner has been occasionally employed at my shop—on the morning of the 23rd of Aug. I saw the prisoner in the skittle-ground, behind the beer-shop—I left the premises that morning between nine and ten o'clock, and went up to work—I left the prisoner in the skittle-ground—m house is adjoining the beer-shop, and the beer-shop is by the side of it—the prisoner had no business in our part of the house—I left no one in our part of the house—the prisoner could get from the skittle-ground into our part of the house by going through three doors—I was away from nine till twelve o'clock—I left the watch and key and seal over the mantel-piece—I missed them the next morning—a boy came and told me something—I went with him to the police-constable, and then he and I went to a stable of the prisoner's father, and found the prisoner there.</p>

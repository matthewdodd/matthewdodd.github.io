I am assistant to Mr. Haynes, of 3, Clare-court, cheesemonger—on 19th March the prisoner came for two nice eggs for twopence—she gave me a shilling, which I put in the till, there was no other shilling there—I gave her fourpence in silver and sixpence in coppers—after she had left the shop I found the shilling was bad—about five minutes afterwards she came back and asked for two nice duck's eggs, which came to twopence halfpenny—she gave me another shilling which I found to be bad—I told her so, and that it was like the one she had given me just before, and that I should send for a constable—she said, "Do not do that, as I have got some children sick at home and my husband is bad—I will find someone to give me a character—I sent for a constable and gave the two shillings to him.</p>

               <p>Adderson. I had the Misfortune to be confined in the Fleet 22 Weeks, and was discharged 3 Weeks ago this very Night. I entrusted this Woman to lye with my Daughter, thinking her to be an honest Woman; but when I came home, I found all my Things gone: I knew she was absconded before I came out of the Fleet, and have never seen her 'till she was taken up. Several of my Things I found at

            . The Prisoner used to bring things to pawn, and fetched them out again; I thought she had been entrusted by Adderson with the things, and that it could not be a Felony. She pawned them with me in her own Name; here's a List of them. April 12, an Apron for 1 s. April 22, a Cap for 1 s. May 24, an Apron for 1 s. March 4, a Cloak for 4 s. April 16, an Apron for 1 s. The 17th or 18th of May, a Suit of Pinners for half a Crown. February 7, an Apron half a Crown. May 19, a Cap 4 d. May 15, a Petticoat 8 d. May 1, a Handkerchief 8 d. April 28, five Napkins 3 s. May 12, a Handkerchief 6 d. May 13, a piece of Stuff 4 d. The same Day a Mob 8 d. May 5, a pair of Stays 9 s. May 20, a Petticoat 7 s. 6 d. May 24, a Quilt 14 s. 9 d. and with this 14 s. 9 d. she redeemed two Spoons of Mrs. Adderson's; so by that I took it she was entrusted with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you entrust the Prisoner to pawn Goods for you?</p>
               <p>Adderson. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you commit these Goods to her Custody?</p>
               <p>Adderson. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the Pawn-broker is mistaken in his Law. You ought not to have received these Goods, without knowing what Authority she had to pawn them, and you are very faulty in taking them in.</p>
               <p>Dorman. Here are other Things in the List of Mrs. Addersons, which the Prisoner brought to our House. She always pawn'd them in her own Name; and when I asked her any Questions, she always said she was sent.</p>
               <p>Q. If you thought she was sent, why did you take them in her Name?</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Harvey's Defence.</hi> On the 23rd I was from home. When I came home my landlady said a man had been there for me, to do something to a chaise—I went out and met Rosedale—he said Mr. Aubin's servant had en to him with a chaise to paint, for 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., if I would help him I should have part of the money—we then heard of a job at the rail-road, and we went there, but the job was not to be done—this man said we were to meet the man near the Town-hall—we went there, and the man came with a phaeton—it was-a very wet night—the man was in a coloured coat, and had a handkerchief round his neck—we got in the phaeton and drove to Rodale's brother-in-law in Whitechapel, and knocked there, but could make anybody hear—Rosedale said he would sleep in it—the man took the horse away, and said he would meet us the next morning at six o'clock—we went and waited till seven o'clock, and he did not come, and then I met Rosedale, who said he had pawned his part of the harness—I said I had left mine through fear—I looked in the paper, but saw no ad<lb></lb>vertisements nor bills about it—then we agreed together to write a letter to Mr. Aubin, which I did, and I do not see any cunning about that—I never saw the man that brought it in my life before.</p>

               <p>I am a butcher at Turner's-end; the prosecutor Mr. Kimpton came on Saturday the 10th of November, and claimed two sheep skins; this man the prisoner had come to me the Tuesday before and told me he had two ewes to sell; the next day Wednesday he brought two wether sheep. I was killing a bullock; I bought them; I had no knowledge of him; I gave him 19 s 6 d. a piece, he asked 2 l. Mr. Kimpton came to my shop when I was not at home, and my landlord shewed him the skins; I came home directly, and shewed them to Mr. Kimpton, and he carried them to the office along with him; I told him I was not sure where abouts he was at that present time; but he was soon found; when he brought the two wethers he said, I made an exchange with my brother; my brother bought four wethers at Hertford fair, and I exchanged them; he told me he was a shepherd.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. These sheep that you talk about have a ruddle mark across the loins; you have seen many sheep have the same mark? - To be sure I have.</p>
               <p>Q. These wethers were not worth so much as laid down in the indictment 2 l. 12 s. - No, I have bought cheaper and I have bought dearer.</p>
               <p>Q. Of whom did he say he got possession of these sheep? - Of his brother, and afterwards he said, of Duck and Gisborn, and he said, that they said, if he would not go and sell them for him, they would kill him, and he was to have 18 d. for his day's work, and the sum was to be returned to Duck and Gisborn, and they were to divide the money into three parts; but he said he would not do that, he would only have his 18 d. for his hire.</p>
               <p>Q. This man was taken up before Duck and Gisborn? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you again the mark that was on these two wethers, was it a common mark that all the farmers in the county have? - It is.</p>

               <p>I was employed by my father-in-law, Mr. Harvey, from whom the sheep were brought the night before; on Wednesday I was going to Turner's-end, and I met the prisoner with two sheep, driving in the road; I did not know them then to be the same that I had sent to Mr. Kimpton; I asked him whether he was going to the welch butcher's with them, he said, yes; I was by when he was with Mr. Thomas; and the butcher asked me to look at them; I asked the butcher what he asked, he said a pound a piece; I told him I dare say the man and he would deal. On Thursday morning I was going by the butcher's shop, and he was killing one of the sheep; I asked him, if the man and he had agreed; I told him, if they were my sheep I would not have sold them under 30 s. a piece: then I recollected they were Mr. Kimpton's sheep; I observed the marks, and I was certain they are the same I saw at my father-in-law's; this was on Thursday; I took an horse and went over to my father-in-law's to know if any sheep were lost, he said he did not know, as Mr. Kimpton was gone to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150060"></xptr>town, and was not at home, and said it would be as well for me not to go then, but he would go in the morning. Mr. Kimpton came over on Saturday morning, and I told him where the sheep were, and went with him; the skins were produced, Mr. Kimpton claimed them as his property; I went immediately and took the prisoner at the Fox, at Farnham's-green.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Now my friend you say you met the prisoner at the bar, on the road, with two sheep; at that time you had no suspicion of their belonging to Mr. Kimpton? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you close to the prisoner at the bar, when you had the conversation with him; you asked him whether he was going to take them to the welch butcher's? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know them then? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now the sheep that you saw on the road, you can recollect they were Mr. Kimpton's, and now you can take on you to say they were the same at Mr. Thomas's. The fifteen wether sheep you sent to Mr. Kimpton, had the ruddle mark on them? - They had.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a common mark? - Not very common.</p>
               <p>Q. Some mark in one place and some in another? - They do.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you did not recollect them to be Mr. Kimpton's, when you saw them on the road, yet you recollected them to be Mr. Kimpton's, when you saw them cut up; you know them by the ruddle mark? - And by the breed.</p>
               <p>Q. You talked to Thomas about the price he had given for the sheep, you seemed to think he had a good bargain of it? - I am certain he had.</p>
               <p>Q Do you think if he had been driving some stolen sheep to the butcher's, he would not have hesitated a little, to have told you where he was going? - That was the place he had appointed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he would have readily told you where he was taking them, if he had been guilty? - I don't think he should.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that the common mark you made use of? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see any sheep marked in that way without a slit in the ear, or some other mark? - I cannot say; there is an ear mark in one of them that my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150061"></xptr>master does not know of, I know of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. The slit in the ear you have seen in other people's sheep? - I have.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman of the labourers to Mr. Joseph Flet<lb></lb>cher, of Union Dock, Poplar; the prisoner was a shipwright there. About a quarter before eight o'clock, on the morning of the 31st of December, I saw him near the warehouse-door—I watched him, as I had received instructions, and I saw him go into the warehouse twice—when he came out the second time he went towards the gate—I overtook him, and asked if he had got any thing—he said, "No"—I took him into the lobby, over-hauled him, and found 4lbs. weight of composition nails in his hat—I put them on the desk, and tent for a policeman—I saw the porter take some nails up—there were nails of that description in the warehouse.</p>

While the prisoner was standing before the fire, I heard something drop from him, and under the grate I found 2lbs. weight of the same nails as were in his hat—he had been standing with his back to the grate, and his hands behind him—the nails were not there before.</p>

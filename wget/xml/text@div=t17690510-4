I went with one of Sir John's men; we found the mug in Angel-alley, Long-Acre, up two pair of stairs, in Carryl's lodging-room, between the sheets of her bed, with the bottom taken out. ( Produced and deposed to.) Medley was apprehended and committed to Clerkenwell Bridewell. I went there to him; he confessed he took it, and said he was drunk when he took it.

After he had drank the beer he never paid for it; but put the pint under his jacket. I saw him do it as I was serving a customer with a pennyworth of gin; but I did not think he intended to go away with it. He got off with it.</p>

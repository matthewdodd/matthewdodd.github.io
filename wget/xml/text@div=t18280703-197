On the 24th of June I was going home, and met the prisoner with my saddle and girths on his shoulder; I said"That is mine;" he threw them at me and turned down Red Lion-court, and ran as far as Old Fish-street - he was quite a stranger; I had seen them safe on a pin at my stable door, about two hours before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was your yard gate locked? A. Yes: I had a good many servants at work for me - the prisoner had got about one hundred and fifty yards off perhaps; it was between eleven and twelve o'clock in the day - I am satisfied none of my men had been there while I was out.</p>

I met a man who asked me if I wanted a job; I said Yes, and then he asked me if I had a saddle - I said No; he went and got this and told me to go on to the docks - I had not gone above one hundred yards, when Mr. Mahony dragged the saddle from me - I was alarmed and ran away.</p>

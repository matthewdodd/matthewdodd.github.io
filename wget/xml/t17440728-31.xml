             went in, and I staid without, and in a very little time they brought out the ticket; then we went to Mr. Henshaw's office on Tower-Hill, and they wanted to sell it, but there being some deflection [defect] in the will, it would not pass there - for the will bore date several months before he went on board the Hector .</p>
               <p>Council. It appears by the books of the Navy that he went on board the Hector in 1739, and the will is dated in 1738.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you told that it was wrong, or did you know it yourself?</p>
               <p>Sherlock. The Prisoner shewed it me, and asked me how I could make such blunders, and I saw plainly afterwards that it was wrong when I compared it with the ticket. Mr. Henshaw sent for the Purser of the ship, and asked if he knew Callaway's sister? He said he did not know his sister, but knew nothing to the contrary but that it was his will. Mr. Henshaw said if she would go to the Pay-Office in Broad-street, where the ship was paying, and get the first payment, he would discount the remainder; (that was what the Prisoner and Ogden said to me when they came out) then the Prisoner cursed and swore at me, and Ogden said if she did not get the money for her trouble, she would go to the office where she got the ticket and deliver it up again. The Prisoner took the probate and I took the ticket, because I remember we did not care to trust one another; we appointed to meet next day at Tower-ditch, this

He said, never fear, we will get it sold; the Prisoner and I went directly and had a bill of sale made, I think it was to one Mr. Tarver by Ratcliff-cross, we went to Mr. Tarver's house and shewed him the ticket, and got a note on Alderman Hankey, we got the money mostly in Portugal gold.</p>
               <p>Council. How much money did you receive?</p>
               <p>Sherlock. I know there was above 20 l. it might be 25 or 26 l. for I know we divided above 20 l. and he took 4 s. or 4 s. 6 d. in the pound. - Mr. Tarver gave Gulleland a draught for 20 l. and upwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Tarver give you a draught on Alderman Hankey?</p>
               <p>Sherlock. Yes, Mr. Tarver would do such a thing for the Prisoner at any time, he would have trusted him with 50 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the bill of sale made?</p>
               <p>Sherlock. It was made at the office in Brichin-lane ; the Prisoner and I went directly to Towerditch where we had left

             and the young man waiting for us, and went to the seven Stars or fourteen stars in Rosemary-lane, I can't tell which (for there are both those signs there) then the Prisoner gave her the ticket for her to put her name to it, and she said if you don't pay me for it, you shall not have it any more; then he held the money in one hand and the probate in the other, and he said (holding out two moidores and a guinea to her) here is the money for you.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she sign it before she made this demand or after?</p>
               <p>Sherlock. It was after; she made her mark and then the Prisoner gave her two moidores and a guinea, and the Prisoner took the paper to himself and she made a great noise because she had not more; that Money was to be between her and a young fellow that used to wait on her. Then the Prisoner and I went to Goodman's-fields to settle our affairs, and there we had 2 chickens and asparagus, and two bottles of wine. I asked the Prisoner how it was to be ordered? He said he had had a great deal of trouble about it, and advanced the money; so I had 4 or 5 moidores for my share, and we paid 8 s. for the reckoning; after that he said, there is an Attorney at law by Moorfields who has got a bond of mine and he threatens to run me to an execution, if you will go along with me, I will go and pay him the money; I went with him into Moorfields, and he paid the Attorney four or five moidores before my face, and the Attorney delivered up the bond. - It was somewhere by Moorfields, I can't tell the name of the place.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. What account was the bond upon?</p>
               <p>Sherlock. I don't know what account, he said he was threatened with an execution about it - this was all in May 1742 - there were two or three people came to me to New Prison to ask me to make a deflection in my evidence - one Hart who is a publican in St. Catharine's came to me and said, if I would make a deflection in my evidence, he would give me 12 guineas, and would get it out of Gulleland , and he said if I did not find the bill, I should have the money directly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. You say you had two chickens and asparagus, and two bottles of wine, and all for 8 s - if the rest of your account is as true as this, 'tis a very good one.</p>
               <p>Sherlock. I think it was the Green Man that we went to, to the best of my knowledge the reckoning came to 8 or 9 s.</p>
               <p>Council. I suppose you had some strong beer too?</p>
               <p>Sherlock. I don't know but we might.</p>

               <p>Ogden . I have known him about two years. Between Easter and Whitsontide I think, about two years ago, the Prisoner and this rogue [pointing to Sherlock ] told me I was to do something for them, and it was only to tell a lie; they gave me a letter, and I was to go with a will.</p>
               <p>Council - Who gave you the letter?</p>
               <p>Ogden . Gulleland did.</p>
               <p>Council. What was the letter given you for?</p>
               <p>Ogden . I was to give the letter to somebody in Doctor's Commons. Gulleland went with me and shewed me the door, and I had a will, which I gave to the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Council. Should you know it again if you were to see it?</p>
               <p>Ogden. I don't know that I should know it, I never saw one before, and I hope I never shall again: after they had done it, they spurted beer upon it.</p>
               <p>Council. Who did?</p>
               <p>Ogden. Gulleland did.</p>

               <p>Ogden. It is by a tavern, the sign of a head in the Commons, and then he gave me the will.</p>
               <p>Council. Who gave you the will?</p>
               <p>Ogden. The Prisoner, he knows it, he will not deny it, I know he will not tell a lie.</p>
               <p>Council. What sort of a man is Mr. Lee?</p>
               <p>Ogden. I believe he was a man, a little round shoulder'd.</p>
               <p>Council. Where did you go then?</p>
               <p>Ogden. He took me to a handsom man, he had a gown upon him like you, a very fresh handsom man, and he handed me a book, I don't know what he said, and he gave that gentleman a shilling. I left Mr. Lee after I had delivered him the will; he gave his service to Mr. Gulleland, and bid me come the next morning about eleven of the clock; then I went to these honest gentlemen [pointing to Sherlock and Gulleland] where they ordered me to come to them, and I met them the next day in Blowbladder Street, and afterwards I went with this Sherlock to a coffee-house in St. Paul's Church Yard, and Gulleland and I went to Mr. Lee's and got the Administration, and paid for it: Mr. Gulleland, did not you pay for it? he will not deny it.</p>
               <p>Council. To whom was the probate of the will given?</p>
               <p>Ogden . It was given to Mr. Gulleland, he knows it was; then we went to the Ticket Office , and he sent a little boy in to see if Mr. Purvis the ticket clerk was in the way. [It was not you, Sir, it was another little man, speaking to Mr. Bentham.] I went into the ticket office, and they staid till I got the ticket, then I went out and gave it Gulleland, for they would not trust me with it, and you never saw such work, fighting and quarrelling, and Sherlock said to the Prisoner, You shall have the sheep skin, and the Prisoner said, You shall have the other. Did not you say so? [speaking to Sherlock] the parchment he called the sheep skin.</p>
               <p>Council. Did not you ask Gulleland for some money?</p>
               <p>Ogden. Not that night, it was late before we parted, I believe it was six o'clock before we got the ticket; they were didling and dadling backward and forward till it was too late to go to Mr. Henshaw's. Gulleland said in the Ticket Office , Mrs. Callaway, the Hector will be paid to morrow; I thought he was going to call me by my own name. The next morning we went to Mr. Henshaw's , and he sent for the purser of the ship, and asked him if he knew

Mr. Henshaw asked him if he had made any other will, he said he did not know that he had. Mr. Henshaw said, well Mrs. Callaway, go to the Pay Office in Broad Street, and get what money is due to you, and then come to me. I said to Gulleland, how can I go there to face so many men as the whole ship's crew? I said I would not do it, I would carry it to the gentleman that gave it me, and really I did not think there had been any harm in it till I handled the book, and they know I would not do such a wicked thing if I had known it: they were afraid I should go to Mr. Henshaw and discover it; one was worth money, and did not care to be exposed; and as to the other, he did not care to go to a goal, but he is not afraid of scandal, for I believe he is pretty good proof against that: as I had done it, I thought I might as well have something as nothing, and I said, I would not sign it till I had the money.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you sign it before you had the money?</p>

               <p>Q. Who proposed it first to you?</p>
               <p>Ogden. Really I can't tell; Gulleland said that Callaway belonged to the Isle of Man .</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say nothing about what money you was to have?</p>
               <p>Ogden. I said I would have as much as they, and I thought it reasonable I should, I thought I ought to have as much for my lie, as they had for their's, as we were all liars alike.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you know that you took an oath?</p>
               <p>Ogden. The Court was sitting and there was a great noise, I could not tell what I did.</p>

             on board the Hector?</p>
               <p>Tarver . Yes, I remember it very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how much the ticket was for?</p>
               <p>Tarver. Yes, I received 22 l. 12 s. 6 d. upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give the Prisoner a draught for this money on Alderman Hankey?</p>
               <p>Tarver. No, I gave him the money, I gave him no draught: I did upon another ticket give him a draught, but I did not give him a draught for this; that which I gave him the draught for, was upon a ticket relating to a trial last Sessions. I gave him then 25 l. 10 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you pay the money to?</p>
               <p>Tarver. To Gulleland , I saw nobody else. - I paid Gulleland 20 l. 11 s. for it, the ticket was made out for 22 l. 12 s. 9 d.</p>
               <p>Sherlock. Ask him, my Lord, whether I can't tell any remarkable place in his house, and what pictures are there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. You will hardly see your own picture hanged.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. When you paid the money for the ticket, was the bill of sale filled up?</p>
               <p>Tarver. The bill of sale and every thing was ready.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any thing besides the ticket delivered to you when you paid the money?</p>
               <p>Tarver. I had all the papers, and the parchment too?</p>
               <p>Council. What ticket was that you gave him the 25 l. 10 s. upon?</p>
               <p>Tarver. It was the assignment of Donald Mcdonald's ticket, June 2d, from

               <p>Q. What is his character?</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Council. Do you think he would forge a will?</p>
               <p>Tarver. I should think he was the most unlikely person in the world to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any other will from Gulleland?</p>
               <p>Tarver . Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that a forged will?</p>
               <p>Tarver . It is not right; I was half concerned in that, he had one half and I had the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you had another that was bad?</p>
               <p>Tarver. I can't say I had not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Do you think he would be such a fool as to trust himself in the hands of an Irish woman, and Sherlock the witness?</p>
               <p>Tarver. He came up from Portsmouth last sessions, I told him how things were; and I said, sure you are not such a villain as to put these things upon me, because I have faith in you? He said he knew no more of it than I did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. I shall make no observations, we have contradicted Sherlock by what the last witness says, and the woman has positively swore she never was at Gulleland's house, and we can prove that she has.</p>

            , but they could not take him. About a month after, Gulleland came to my chambers, and said, his character was aspersed by Sherlock, and he had a mind to clear his character to the Commissioners of the Navy: the Commissioners said I should speak to Sherlock, and draw up any deposition he had against him. On Monday he came again, (Sherlock had sent me some accounts relating to Mcdonnah's will) The Commissioners were not willing to take him up upon the evidence of Sherlock alone. They examined the books, and found they agreed with the ticket, which he could not know without he had been concerned: they took time to consider of it, and then resolved to prosecute Gulleland.</p>

               <p>Justice Richards. I have known the Prisoner about ten years, I never knew him charged with any crime or vice. His character is as good both in publick and private life as any ones; he is a sober, honest, modest man; I was surprized when I heard of this; I never was more deceived in the character of a man in my life if he is guilty of what is laid to his charge - he was a check weaver when first I knew him, but since he kept an alehouse, sold slops, and bought tickets - he has been a very good husband and a father, and kind to his wife's friends that wanted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepphard. I have known the Prisoner ever since the year 1738. I always knew him to be just in his dealings; I should not have thought such a thing as this by any thing that I ever saw of him. Mr. Baker likewise appeared to his character.

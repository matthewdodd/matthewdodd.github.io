I am a surgeon, of 31, Ludgate Hill I have attended the deceased since August, 1871; she died on 2nd July this year—I have frequently seen marks of violence on her head, arms, and neck—I attended her for shortness of breath, that was her principal oom<lb></lb>plaint; she was in general ill health—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of her body, and found bruises on her left breast, left shoulder, and left hand, an abrasion on her left shin, and a bruise on her right hip—the bruises were not severe; the abrasion on the left shin was the worst, the skin was torn off—I opened her body; disease of the right lung was the primary cause of deith, and there was disease of the liver, with jaundice—that was not con<lb></lb>nected with the disease of the lungs—I have not the least doubt that treatment such as I have hearoj would accelerate her death, diseased as she was; it was hastened by ill usage.</p>

She died from absolute exhaustion, <hi rend="italic">asthemia</hi>—the right lung was totally disorganised, and I should imagine that the heart was very weak—there was regular want of power, and in such a state she would require to be kept perfectly quiet, and to be attended carefully, and not to have any hardships or knocking about, whioh would be certain to expedite death by aggravating the disease, by calling on the diseased organs to do more than they would have to do, and by shocking the nervous system—I have cautioned the prisoner two or three times, and told him that if he ill used his wife in the way he did he would get into a scrape, but he was generally so drunk that I don't think he understood me.</p>

            . I live in One Tun Alley, and coming home I heard a Tussel; there the Prisoner had got the Woman down, stripping her of her Petticoats. I laid hold on him, and asked what he was doing, and called the Watch. I asked him what he did it for; he said she was his Wife and was drunk, and it was no Business of mine. The Watchman took Charge of him, the Woman lying on the Ground. She was without her Shoes, Hat, Cloak, or Apron; a Watchman carried her to the Watchouse along with the Prisoner, and I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175312050003"></xptr> there with them. I did not see the Prisoner have any Thing in his Custody.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutrix. Were these Things taken away before you was knock'd down or after?</p>
               <p>E. Venesal. I had them on before I was knock'd down. I don't know whether this Man took them or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you his Wife?</p>
               <p>E. Venesal. I never saw him in my Life before.</p>

I also saw her after that at the Hours 10, 11 and 12. At half an Hour after 12 o'Clock Mr. Hudson sent a Watchman to call me to his Assistance.</p>

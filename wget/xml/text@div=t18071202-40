On Saturday evening the 14th of November, I was in the shop, a customer came in, I was serving her, it was about eight o'clock; I cast my eye round once, I saw a man look in at the corner of the shop, I had no suspicion that any body was going to rob me, I thought it was one of the men next door, waiting to see his master, expecting to have his wages; in about a minute I heard the name of Sack called out, I went to the door, I saw the constable bring the prisoner by the collar, he told me that the prisoner had been robbing me; the constable had the lamb in one hand and the prisoner in the other; the constable told me that the prisoner said he was a joking. I said, take him away, I am determined to prosecute any person I catch robbing of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before. - A. I have seen him before; I do not know that ever I spoke to him, I have heard that he has been in our business. I am quite sure it was my quarter of lamb; I think I had seen it two minutes before.</p>

            . I am a constable. On Saturday night the 14th of November, I saw the prisoner at the bar loitering about Mr. Sack's shop, I knew him to be a man of suspicious character; I watched him, I saw him make several attempts to take the quarter of lamb off the hook at the door; after making several attempts he took it off, he endeavoured to put it under his apron, it was too long, he could not; he walked towards where I was standing to watch him; I catched hold of him by the collar with one hand and the lamb in the other; he called me by name and said he was only joking, he desired me to take the lamb and say nothing about it; I took him to Mr. Sack and acquainted him with it, and then I took him to New Prison.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going up Islington; I saw something laying down by the wall, it was dirty, it was a small hind quarter of ewe lamb; when I was taken before the magistrate, they produced a hind quarter of wether lamb.</p>
               <p>Sack. The same lamb was brought before the magistrate; it had dirt on it.</p>

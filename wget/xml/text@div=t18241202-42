               <p>MARY FORSYTH. I live at Aberdeen, in Scotland. On the 4th of November I was at Miss Gordon's, who lives at Mr. Thorn's, in <placeName id="t18241202-42-crimeloc221">John-street, Oxford-street</placeName>

I missed the purse, and money at three o'clock in the afternoon of the 4th; I had left John-street at ten o'clock - I immediately went to my lodgings in Duke-street, to search, but could not find it. I did not go to John-street. The prisoner was <rs id="t18241202-42-deflabel222" type="occupation">servant</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You looked at home for your purse - I suppose you are not sure that you had it at Miss Gordon's? A. No.</p>

            . On the 4th of November, between five and six o'clock in the evening, I was at my sister's, and saw her find 16 s. or 17 s. in the coal scuttle, on the first floor landing place; I asked the prisoner what she was doing with the money in the coal scuttle; she said it was the change of a sovereign which she had received from her mother, and she had bought her child a hat with the rest. I sent for a constable.</p>

            . I am an officer. I and Westcoatt were fetched to Miss Gordon's about six o'clock - I went up into the drawing room: Miss Gordon said a lady who had slept there the night before, had sent' to say that she had lost her purse; they shewed me the silver which was found in the coal scuttle. I asked the prisoner how she became possessed of the money - she said that on Tuesday, when she came to her situation, her mother gave her a sovereign - that she had been to her mother-in-law at Somer's-town, that morning, and she had given her a half-sovereign. I then took her up to the attic, and searched her box, and found a wedding ring, apparently new; she said it was hers. We went into the kitchen, and found a sovereign and a guinea on a hand basket on the table - any one in the kitchen could see it; she said she knew nothing of it; there was a little servant girl in the house, who also had access to the kitchen. I asked her a question on the 9th of November, after she had been in custody; Westcoatt had been with her before that.</p>

            . I had been with the prisoner when she was in confinement. I made her no promise or threat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw her on the 5th? A. Yes; and had her stripped and searched by a female turnkey.</p>
               <p>Q. After that did not you say "Well, Yates, don't you think yourself a pretty creature? I have been to your mistress, and make no doubt but you will get over it if you confess the truth?" A. No; I said I had found out that she had passed a sovereign at Mr. Atkin's, for a gown and shawl - she made no answer. I then said, "You have been to purchase a bonnet at Mrs. Lacey's, in Oxford-street, for 32 s. and left a sovereign there." She said, "Yes." I said nothing whatever to induce or frighten her to confess. I then asked her "Have you left the 5 l. note in the same kind of way as the sovereign?" She said "No." I said, "What have you done with it?" She said, "Why the ring you found in my box I bought at a silversmith's in Monmouth-street, and paid 11 s. 6 d. for it." I asked what she had done with the change. She said, "Where you found the money last night, there you will find the remainder, for I threw it down in the kitchen," I went to the kitchen but could find no more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you regularly employed at Marlborough-street? A. Yes; for nearly four years, and was at Bow-street before that. I frequently ask questions of prisoners, when I think I have a clue to a robbery. I said nothing to her about telling the truth.</p>
               <p>THOMAS CLEMENTS re-examined. On the 9th of November I asked her what she had done with the change she received out of the 5 l. note, when she bought the ring - she said "You will find it where you found the sovereign and guinea." I said "I cannot find it there - have you not left it in the purse, and put it away somewhere." She said, No, that she had thrown it into the dust hole. I went to her mistress's, and, after stirring the dust about, found a purse which I produce.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This was six days after the first examination? A. Yes; what I said to her was in consequence of what I heard from Westcoatt.</p>
               <p>MISS FORSYTH. The purse is like mine, but I cannot swear to it. I had never minutely examined mine. I called at several places on that day.</p>

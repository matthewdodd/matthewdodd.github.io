               <p>WILLIAM BOND. I am an officer. On the 25th of June, I went to the prisoner's lodgings, it is at a corner house between Well-street and Margaret-street, Oxford-road. I went up stairs into the bedroom with her; I found this trunk. I have got the key of it. The key was in it. I found fourteen shirts in it, six waistcoats, and three pair of drawers; and behind the tester of the bed I found six towels. I found a great quantity of duplicates. I found them in a man's blue coat between the top of the tester of the said bed. I asked her how she came to take these things from her master; she said she did it on account of the young man,

                  </hi>. I live with my parents at the Leopard coffee-house, Newington—on Monday evening, 30th December last, I was at home—the prisoner came between 7 and 8 o'clock that evening, and asked for a cup of coffee, and a slice of bread and butter—I served him—they came to 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me what I supposed to be a shilling—I gave him change, and put the shilling in the till—there was no other shilling there; only a sixpence, a fourpenny-piece, and some halfpence—he went away then—my mother was there and said something to me after he had gone; in consequence of which I took the shilling out of the till and gave it to her—I saw her give it to a lodger—I did not lose sight of it at all—I saw the lodger put it between a split piece of wood, and put it into the fire, and it melted in no time—on the following Wednesday, 1st January, I saw the prisoner again about the same time in the evening—I recognised him immediately—he ordered a cup of coffee and a slice of bread and butter, and paid with a shilling—I called my mother's attention to him as soon as he came in at the door—I passed the shilling he then gave me to my mother—a policeman was then sent for.</p>

                  </hi>. On Monday, 30th December, I saw the prisoner at the coffee-shop—I did not know him by sight before—I saw my daughter serve him, and after he had gone I spoke to her—she went to the till and took out a shilling—there was no other shilling in the till—I had taken the money out of the till a few minutes before he came into the shop—the shilling was put between a piece of wood, and held just within the fire—it melted directly—on 1st January I saw the prisoner come in again—my daughter spoke to me; but I knew him before she spoke—I saw her serve him, and saw him give her a shilling—she gave it to me; I examined it, and found it was bad—I went to the prisoner and told him I should give him into custody—he said, "What for?"—I said, "Because you have brought a bad shilling here to-night, and one on Monday night"—he said "Oh no, not me"—I said, "I am positive you are the same person; I shall give you into custody"—he said, "For God's sake don't give me into cus<lb></lb>tody,</p>

               <p>for I shall lose my situation; and if I lose my situation it will be the ruin of me"—I told him if he was a respectable person he had no need to fear going to the station—he did not say where his situation was—he gave me no address—I sent for a constable and gave him in custody—the shilling which my daughter had given me I gave to the inspector at the station, and saw him give it to the police-constable.</p>

                  </hi>. This is a bad shilling—bad shillings melt almost instantly when they are put to the fire—a good shilling would not—you could not get sufficient concentration of heat in a common fireplace; you must have a furnace.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I came from Chester a few days before this occurred.

I did not go to the shop the two days before, as the woman says I did; I was never there before in my life.

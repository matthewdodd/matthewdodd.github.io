                  </hi>. I am an auxiliary letter-carrier—on Sunday, 11th April, about 11.30 p.m., I was in York Street, Westminster—I was not quite sober, but I perfectly knew what I was doing—the prisoner knocked me down; two more men were with him—I swear to the prisoner, I saw him when he was on top of me, and if it had not been for the policeman I should have been killed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I am sure the prisoner is the man—I had been with some friends at the West End—I had had some whisky and some ale, but not more than I could do with—I was not quite sober—I told the Magistrate that the prisoner and another man got me into a court and began striking me—I was knocked down before I got into the court—I have not been having ale to-day—I do not remember saying "They got me into the court"—I did not feel the prisoner put his hand into my pocket, but I heard the policeman say at the police-court that he saw him do so—it was lamp-light—I cannot remember whether I said at the police-court that it was the prisoner and another man or two other men—the policeman and I have been together ever since I have been here, and I have been talking to him about the case, but he did not say anything about there being two men instead of three.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman B</hi> 264). On Sunday night, 7th April, I was on duty at Smith's Rents, York Street, Westminster, and saw High at 11.45—the prisoner and two other men were there, and the prisoner got hold of High, dragged him down the Rents, and threw him down—I saw the prisoner put his hand into High's pocket—the shortest of the three men sang out "<hi rend="italic">Cheese</hi> it"—that is a slang term, meaning that some one is coming and to stop what they are doing and run away—the prisoner ran, trying to get into the dark, and met me; I jumped out of the dark and took him back to High—I held him with one hand and helped High up with the other; his hand was cut very much—the prisoner threw something away—I asked him what it was—he said "A penny"—I said "All right, I shall find it directly"—I afterwards found this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the lower walk, where there are some little railings—High said that it was not his knife—I have not seen the other men since—High was under the influence of drink, but was not drunk—he walked to the station after me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. At the police-court High said that it was the prisoner and two other men—I swear that—the two men in the court got away—the prisoner could see me if he looked that way when he ran against me, as there was a lamp—I could see very well, and saw the prisoner put his hand in the prosecutor's outside coat pocket—High said at the police-court that he could not tell whether the prisoner put his hand in his pocket or not</p>

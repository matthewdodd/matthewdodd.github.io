                  </hi>. I live at No. 2, Hatch-row, Broadway, Lam<lb></lb>beth. On 13th Dec. I saw the prisoner pass my house—just before he passed, when he was just by No. 1, he said, "Mr. Apps, it is a long time since you and I have spoken to each other"—I made a reply, "I hoped it would be a very great while longer"—there was no further remark—he passed two houses further down, and he said that I had been speaking ill of his wife in a public house, and knowing I had not been there, I went down to save his wife from a thrashing, which he was in the habit of giving her—I went to his house, and he said to me, "Go away from my place"—I said I would, and my wife came up and caught me, and said, "Come away"—I said, "I will"—I was just on the point of turning round and he struck me with a hammer—it was not the one produced in Court, it was One much larger—he hit me in the left eye, and said, "Take that, you b——"—I cannot say whether I fell, for I did not remember anything for a day or two—I do not recollect anything after I was struck—I had not said anything to pro<lb></lb>voke him before he gave me that blow, not one word—my wife was with me when the blow was struck—she caught me by the sleeve, I was in my shirt sleeves—the sight of my left eye is entirely gone—I have been suffer<lb></lb>ing in my other eye—the doctor says he does not think I shall be able to see to do work much longer.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Blackfriars-road. I was called to visit the prosecutor—I found him insensible, and with the left eye very much injured, a portion of the nose and the left eyebrow cut—I have attended him since—the result is that the left eye is entirely lost to him—I believe there are no means whatever of its being restored—the right eye is sympathetically affected, and it will render it impossible for him to pur<lb></lb>sue his trade for some time—I do not think this hammer could have pro<lb></lb>duced the wound—there appears to have been but one blow given, and the diameter of the wound is much larger than this hummer.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> On the evening of 13th Dec. I was returning to my home after taking home some work when, coming to the top of Hatch-row, I encountered Mr. Apps; he asked me how I did; I said, "Well, Mr. Apps, how are you?" to which he replied, "Oh, I am very well, how are you?" feeling pleased at his speaking to me, for we had not spoken friendly for about seven months, I said, "Are you going to be friends and make up our difference?" he then replied, "We shall never be friends again, see what you called my wife;"I then said I did not speak that foul word to your wife; if that is your temper I will wish you good night, saying as I left him, "See how basely you perverted the words I said to you at the Mitre about my wife;" returning inside my own little shop, I began to put up my tools, it being Saturday night, when Mr. Apps came, and slapping his hand on my counter, said, "You did say that you first met your wife at a low concert room;" I then told him to leave my shop, upon which he said, "Come outside now and I will punch your b—head for you;" he very well knew that the sinew of my right arm was injured that I could not properly defend myself; he kept on using abusive words, when I told him twice more to leave my shop, and he would not, when having my ham<lb></lb>mer in my hand, and about to put it on my seat, I unfortunately struck him, I knew not where at the time, for which I am ashamed, and shall never forgive myself; what made my excitement worse was the feet of our having all our clean washed linen stolen out of our wash house on Friday night, which upset me all day on the Saturday, and I eat very little all day, and then going out in the evening, and having two glasses of old ale along with a customer, I was very excitable; I did not strike him with a mali<lb></lb>cious intent; I sincerely regret and repent of what I have done; I have a wife and five children; I have been in prison more than seven weeks already.</p>

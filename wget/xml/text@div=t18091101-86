            . I am a constable. On the 11th of October I was sent for to Mrs. Wright's, I asked the prisoner where she lived, she told me, No. 6, Banner-street. I was going there to see whether she lived there, she begged me not to take her there, and offered me a crown piece to let her go; this is the crown piece; I told her. I could do no such thing, I took her back to Mr. Wright's shop, and searched her; I found this pocket book, she said it was hers; on my taking her to the watch-house, she offered me the whole of the silver things if I would let her go.</p>

On 3rd March, about 5 minutes to 11 o'clock in the morning, I was relieved by another officer, for the purpose of going for the report slate, which was kept hanging over where the prisoner was sitting—I went and took the slate down, and put some prisoners' numbers upon it; not the prisoner's number, but some prisoners' numbers—I then hung it up again—after I had hung it up the prisoner rose from his seat and stabbed me in the left breast with a knife—it inflicted a severe wound below the left nipple, just above the region of the heart—nothing whatever was said at the time he did it—not a word passed between us—I never gave him the least provocation—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sub-warder in the House of Correction, Coldbath-fields. On 3rd March I was engaged in the same room where Cross was—the prisoner was sitting on a form against the wall of the work room—he was engaged in stripping the cuttings of rope or junk, previous to the prisoners picking it into oakum—he was doing that with a knife, similar to this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw the slate there—Cross was by the side of the prisoner—the prisoner was sitting on the right hand side of Cross, who had been standing, with the slate on his arm, writing—he dropped his left arm, and was standing with the slate against the wall, when the prisoner rose suddenly from his seat, and struck Cross with his right hand on the chest—when he drew back his hand I saw the knife in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon in the House of Correction, Cold-bath-fields. I examined Cross's wound about a quarter of an hour after it occurred—it was about half an inch in length, and about half an inch in depth—it was on the outer side of the left nipple—the blow that caused it must have been given with considerable violence—it struck against the rib, which fortunately prevented it penetrating the chest.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> The governor told me the other day, when I came here, when I asked him about this case, and applied to the Sheriffs for somebody to speak for me, that my case was already settled; that my certificates from the doctors, about having my head fractured, and being in a lunatic asylum, were already forwarded; and I want to know now what is the result; I have got nothing to say to Dr. Wakefield; I know nothing about the case.</p>

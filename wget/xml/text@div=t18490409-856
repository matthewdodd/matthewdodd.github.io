On 13th March, about seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came for a penny saveloy—he paid me with a new shilling, which looked very white—I tried it with my mouth—I thought it was good, and put it into the further end of the till—there were two shillings and two half-crowns there, but they were in the front of the till—I gave the prisoner change, and just as he was going out the officer came in—I then looked into the till—I found the shilling in the back part, where I bad put it, apart from the other money.</p>

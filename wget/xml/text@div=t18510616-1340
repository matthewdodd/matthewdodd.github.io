                  </hi>. I am an American seaman. I was on board the ship <hi rend="italic">Devonshire,</hi> in the London Docks—the prisoner belonged to the same ship; he says he is an American—I never knew him before he came in our ship, from America—on 7th June I was very drunk, and have no recollection of what happened—the first thing I recollect was, I was on the deck, and the doctor and mate were dressing my wounds—I had three wounds in my back, and one in the breast—I had had no quarrel with the prisoner that I know of.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an American, and belong to the <hi rend="italic">Devon<lb></lb>shire.</hi> On 6th June, I saw Sparks in the forecastle, about half-past 6 o'clock, he was very drunk—the prisoner was sober; he and Sparks were having a few words together—the forecastle is not much lighted—I heard some scuff<lb></lb>ling, like two men fighting—I then heard Sparks cry out, "My God he has stabbed me"—I went up and found Sparks lying on the chains, and the prisoner making a blow at him with a knife in the breast—he had hold of Sparks's hair with one hand—I hit his arm away—two or three came round, and we had a little scuffling to get the knife from him—I held him by the wrist, while another man took the knife from him—he was given into custody—I saw him strike at Sparks twice—the prisoner had accused Sparks in the former part of the day of taking some clothes belonging to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, in Upper East Smithfield. I was called to Sparks, and found three wounds in his back, and one just above the region of the heart—those in the back were not so serious as the one in the breast, which was about two inches below the left nipple—it struck</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> The words commenced between me and Sparks, between 3 and 4 o'clock; one of the <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi> said Sparks took three shirts and a jacket, and three razors, and half a pound of soap; I missed them, and told the mate, who sent me on shore to a policeman; then Sparks went on the main deck, and pulled off my jacket; be began quarrelling, and strack me; that was the commencement of it.</p>

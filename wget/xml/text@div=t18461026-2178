                  </hi>. I am an unfortunate woman—I live in St. Sa<lb></lb>viour's, South wark. About one o'clock in the morning, on the 23rd of Oct., I was standing on the Surrey side of London-bridge—the prisoner came up to me, looked me in the face, and said, "There you are, my dear"—I said, "Yes"—he asked how I was—I said, "Very well"—I asked if he would treat me—he said no—he asked if I would take a walk with him—I said I had no objection—we went down the steps of St. Saviour's church—I stood there, and he wanted to pull me about—I asked what he was going to make</p>

               <p>me a present of—it appeared as if he had had a little to drink—he was not tipsy—he said, "I will see what I will make you a present of "putting his hand into his left hand pocket, and in drawing it out again, he turned his back towards me and said, "A present you want?"—I said, "Yes"—I saw a knife in his left hand, by the point—I saw it coming towards me—I stooped, and it cut me on the head—he then struck me with his fist with his right hand—I screamed and fell to the ground—the blood flowed from me—he went up the steps again and I followed him—I saw him on the opposite side of the way at Thomas-street, catching hold of another young woman—I kept him in sight till I found the police-constable, and gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am unfortunate—I was going home that night, and just as I got to the corner of St. Thomas-street I saw the prisoner run<lb></lb>ning from St. Saviour's church—he held both my hands together and de<lb></lb>clared he knew me—he would not allow me to pass one side or the other—4 said, "You are mistaken, I never saw you before"—I said, "I wish to go home, and without you allow me to pass I will give you in charge"—he held me, and tore the pins out of my shawl—I saw a policeman coming across, with Margaret Cunningham—the blood was running from her head—she said, "I give this man in charge; that is the man that stabbed me"—the prisoner was pulling me about for three minutes—I am sure he was running from St. Saviour's church.</p>

                  </hi>. I am dresser at St. Thomas hospital—Margaret Cunningham was brought there about two o'clock that morning—she had a superficial wound over the right eye—it appeared to have been done by a knife or a sharp instrument—I do not think it could have been done by a blow or a fall—if it had the edges of the wound would not have been so clean cut—she had bled, but the blood had dried before she came to me.</p>

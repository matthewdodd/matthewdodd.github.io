                  </hi>. I am shopman to James and Thomas Higgs, of Wentworth-place, Mile-end-road. On the afternoon of the 6th of February, a man applied to be served with ribbon; and while serving him, I saw the prisoner in the act of drawing a piece of canvas out of the shop, from about two yards and a half inside the door—he had got it four or five yards from the door, and was walking away from the shop—when I came up, he said, "I believe this belongs to you, sir," and pat it from his shoulder—I took the goods, and let him go, but kept my eye on him till I saw a policeman, and he was brought back in a short time—I am certain he is the man that took the canvas.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 55.) Hanks told me to stop the prisoner—I saw him in Cleveland-street, about twenty yards from the shop—when he saw me after him he ran away, and I lost sight of him—when I caught hold of him he was flurried, and could scarcely speak—I took him back.</p>

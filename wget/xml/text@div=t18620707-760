                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 45). About 10 o'clock on the night of 16th June I was in High-street, Shadwell, opposite the prisoner's house, No. 153—I smelt something burning as I passed the house—I looked about, and saw smoke coming out of the shutters—there were two holes in the shutters—I looked through, and saw the prisoner with this box of iucifers in his left hand—I saw him take out three lucifers, strike them, light them, and put them to the bed-clothes—the bed was burning then—I did not hear him say anything—I burst in the front door, went into the back room to him, and asked him what he was about, setting the bed on fire—he said, "I am going to have a b—y <hi rend="italic">lark"</hi>—I immediately took hold of him by the shoulder and pulled him back—the bed was very much burning, and I turned the clothes over, as the flames almost reached the ceiling—I smothered them. with one hand, and held the prisoner wish the other—he said, "I have got a bucket of water, and I will soon put that out;" but instead of throwing the water over the bed, he threw it all over me—the house is in the parish of St. Paul, Shadwell.</p>

RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you smoking? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; there must have been something on fire before I went near, as I smelt something burning, but I saw him still light three lucifers—before I saw him do any<lb></lb>thing at all, the clothes must have been set on fire, when I looked through the shutters I saw them burning, the sheets and counterpane were in a blaze; he was not sitting on the bed, but standing by the side of it—he was not smoking, nor had he been smoking, I searched, but could not find any pipe—I searched his pockets—he said at the police-court that it might have been done with a pipe for he was smoking—he did not seem to have been drinking, he knew perfectly well what he was about, but he appeared as if he had been drinking in the fore part of the day—I gathered that from his appearance, he looked rather heavy-headed—I cannot tell you the number of hours that had elapsed since he had been drinking—this was that ground-floor back-room—there were two places cut out of each shutter about the size of my finger, to let the light in, and I could fully see through; it was nearly an inch wide and four inches long, each hole—it was a good sized room—the shop is in the front and the bed is in the back-room—I had to traverse, with my eye, the whole shop—the door was no doubt put open for my special convenience—I do not suppose he knew I was coming—it is a fair sized shop for a small trade—there was no light in the shop, except from the fire—the head of the bed in the back-room lies up towards the shop, towards the shutters, and the foot towards the window—the door leads from the shop into the bed-room—the bed is on the left side of the door as you go in—the space on the left, where the bed is, from the door to the partition wall, is about two yards—the bed was not quite up to the partition wall, it might be half a foot from it; I examined it—it was a good four-post bedstead, about six feet long and five feet wide, it was a very large bed—the head was about half a foot from the wall—the pillow cases were not on fire—I saw no fire in the grate, but, the sheets were blazing up</p>

               <p>to the ceiling—I mean deliberately to swear that he took up the matches and struck a light; I saw him strike three, one after the other, and at that very time the flame was nearly up to the ceiling—there was no one in the room but himself—there was not a great deal of furniture—he is not insured, but the house is—he did not say, going along, that he had been smoking, and the ashes of the pipe must have set it on fire, but at the police-court he said that it might be a pipe, as he was smoking.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 153, High-street, Shadwell—I was living there on the night of 16th June—the prisoner also lived in the house—Henry Skinner, James Butler, and James Foulham, were also living in the same house—about 9 o'clock this night the prisoner knocked at the wains-coting, and asked me what o'clock it was—the clock was stopped, and I said, "Well, as near as I can tell, about 9, or it may be a little later"—it is a shop divided into two, and he knocked at the panel of the door—I occupy one side and the prisoner the other—this was before the policeman had been—the prisoner said that he had had a narrow escape for his life, he had fallen asleep and his pipe caught light to the bed—I asked him if it was out, he said, Yes, and I was not to make a noise—it might perhaps be that ten minutes after that, I sent my wife out for supper, and when she came in I smelt it stronger, and I said I would go in and see if it was out, and when I went in Sergeant Cox was there.</p>

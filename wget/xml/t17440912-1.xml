            . On Monday last in the afternoon about 3 o'clock, my aunt and I were walking towards Kilburn : I saw as I thought three rogues, and told my aunt of it; she said she did not think any thing of it, that they were only boys a mushrooning . They came up to us, and the Prisoner took hold of the bundle that my aunt had in her hand, and felt of it and said, what have you got here? She said I have got nothing, my dear, but a little Apothecary's stuff; then he put the pistol to her breast and bid her deliver. I saw a gentleman on horseback at the end of the field; I called to him and told him we were robbed, and the Prisoner was taken and carried into an alehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them took the bundle and the cloaks?</p>
               <p>Goring. I saw them taken away, but I cannot tell who took them.</p>

I happened to be taking a little walk in the fields, and accidentally went into the house the Prisoner was carried into; and Mr. Charles offered White half a crown to go for a Constable, and somebody said that I was a Constable. I said I was not; he said if I was a Headborough it was the same thing, and then I took charge of the Prisoner, and by the assistance of two more carried him before a magistrate.</p>

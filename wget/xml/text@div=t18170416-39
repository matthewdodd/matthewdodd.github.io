             was the other. They asked me to treat them. I went to a public-house, and gave them some gin-that was all we had there - I am sure Briant was one of them. We then went to another public-house and had supper - We drank a pot of beer at supper, but nothing else. We then took a coach; which I ordered to drive to Whitechapel; they got in with me-the coach drove to <placeName id="t18170416-39-crimeloc215">Old-street</placeName>

I went to bed; the prisoner, Briant, said she was sick, and went down stairs - She came up again. E. Hiet remained in the room, and Briant said she was sick, and went down again. After she was gone, two men came up-Hiet put out the light as they came up. It was moon-light, and said I could see, by a light from an opposite window, who came into the room; I saw the two men come-in I am certain that the prisoner, Kelly, is one of them. He took my clothes from me, and took seven 1l. notes out of my pocket, and gave them to John Hiet to count, and he took them to the window and counted them. I had seven 1l. notes in my waistcoat pocket, and 11s. 6d. in silver. John Hiet said I should not lose them. I put my clothes on and followed them down stairs-they ran away. I did not like to leave the house, for fear I should forget it. I went to a house on the opposite side, and they let me in. I went to the watch-house, and told Burchill - I have recovered two of my notes. I am sure the two prisoners are the persons.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CERWOOD. Kelly took the money - I tried to keep my money. The other man had a knife in his hand. There was a candle on the other side of the way, which shone through the windows - I could see clearly.</p>

I told the prisoner, Kelly, what I wanted him for; the prisoner, Briant, immediately took the candle off the table, and went to the other side of the room - I went after her to prevent her from putting it out, and Kelly opened the window, and threw himself into the street. We got down as soon as possible, and took him in Golden-lane - He was running, and had fallen down; we seized him, but found nothing on him-this was ten days after the robbery - We had left Briant in the room; we took her about five o'clock in the same room. She said she had none of the money at all, and that Kelly was at home when we took Hiet. She said Kelly told her not to go home, as she would be hanged for robbing the sailor. She said she was ill, and knew nothing of the robbery.</p>

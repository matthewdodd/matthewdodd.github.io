                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Edward Biggs, a cow-keeper in the Edgware-road; the prisoner was employed by him as a wheelwright; he had 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week. I received information, and was on the look out—I found a piece of oak timber for the spoke of a wheel, under the bench where the prisoner was in the habit of working—it was stamped at each end—I after<lb></lb>wards missed the piece of wood—I went into Little Carlisle-street, waiting the prisoner coming from work—this was on Wednesday evening, the 11th of Nov.—he passed me with a basket—I asked what he had there—he said, "A spoke I have bought"—I requested him to let me look at it—he showed me a spoke he had in his hand, but that was not the one—I said, "This is not what I meant; you have another"—he opened the basket, and there was this spoke in it—it has our mark on it, which was put on on purpose, by an<lb></lb>other witness—I met a policeman, and gave him in charge—I am able to say that the spoke I found in his basket is Mr. Biggs's.</p>

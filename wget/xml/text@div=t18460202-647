                  </hi>. I am secretary to the British Plate-glass Company; Mr. Thomas Cockburn is one of the proprietors, and there are several others; I live at Albion-place, Blackfriars-road, where the business of the company is carried on; the prisoner Charlotte Rand was cook in the family, and had access to all parts of the house. In consequence of information, I directed the officer to watch her, and on Monday evening the 5th of Jan, she was brought back to the door in custody—I went with her and the officer to the station, and after having been there I went with the officer to No. 32, Wel<lb></lb>lington-street, Waterloo-town, Bethnal-green—I there found Robert Rand—the officer stated to him that his wife was in custody for robbing me, and asked whether he had at any time received from her any articles that she had taken away, and whether he had any in the house—he stated certainly not, and he hoped I should be lenient with the woman; he had never received anything but a very few pieces of broken victuals—the officer said, "Well, I presume there will be no objection to searching the house?"—he assented, and we proceeded to search—in a desk in the lower room were these seventy-three postage-stamps—I cannot identify them—there were such articles amongst the property of the company—I cannot say that we have missed such—we have them in sheets—in the bed-room we found a quantity of paper and envelopes—the paper was of various qualities and descriptions, all of which are used by the company—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the articles</hi>)—this kind of paper the com<lb></lb>pany have from the manufacturer, at Maidstone, and this other from a dealer—we found 129 envelopes, some of which I had purposely made for the company—I think there were seven or eight screws of paper containing sugar, some loaf<lb></lb>sugar, some in powder, and some in lump—we keep our white sugar in powder—there was some black-lead, some mould candles, six or seven different bundles of scouring-paper, containing eight or nine sheets each, about 100 sheets in all; two large pans of butter, one plate, two dishes, and a soup-ladle—this is the plate—I know it; it has been with us fifteen or sixteen years—we found some kitchen cloths, some boxes of lucifer matches, and a knife and fork—I believe them to be my property and the property of the company—some of them I know.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant A</hi> 20.) I was employed to watch the movements of the female prisoner—on the evening of the 5th of Jan., between six and seven o'clock, I saw her leave the premises of the British Plate-glass Company—she appeared to have something under her cloak—she went to Seacoal-lane, and was met by Braham—they went together into the lobby of a pawnbroker's shop—I took them both—I then proceeded with Mr. Wilson to the house in Bethnal-green—I there saw Robert Rand—I asked if he was the husband of Charlotte Rand, and told him his wife was in custody for robbing Mr. Wilson, and I wished to search his house—he said he had no objection, and in a box below I found seventy-three Queen's heads—I asked how they came by them, and the mother replied her son had found them—I found these other articles up stairs—the man did not give any account of them—I asked, when I found the butter and other things, where he got them from, and he said he should reserve his defence.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The mother was living at the house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I understood she was Robert Rand's mother—I believe no other woman lives there—two rooms are let out to lodgers, but I believe they are men—there were articles of female apparel in the last drawers, not in the first—I cannot say positively who produced the keys at first—it was a bundle of keys—the mother was not doing anything about finding them—she was present—he and his mother occupy the house—the candles that they were burning down stairs were mould, and I found similar ones up stairs.</p>

            . I am a fisherman. On the 6th of February, about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, I was at Limehouse Corner, the prisoner came, and asked me if I knew anybody who would buy some Spanish dollars? I took him to Mr. Dickens, a pawnbroker, at Limehouse. He unbuttoned his belt, and pulled out six Spanish dollars - he said he had some quarter dollars, and pulled them out - I found they were four or five English half-crowns. He put them into his belt, and sold the six dollars to the pawnbroker for 4 s. 6 d. each. He bought a pair of shoes, two cotton handkerchiefs, and about four yards of canvas there. He came out, and gave me a shilling for my trouble. He took the things, and left them at the Barley Mow, public-house, at Limehouse. He then bought a pair of pumps at a shoemaker's shop; he met a blind man, and bought a pair of garters of him. We then went to the Indian Arms - I left him there. I am sure he is the man.</p>

He pulled a belt from round his body, and said he had some Spanish dollars to sell - I bought six of him, at 4 s. 6 d. each, which I produce.

               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am an officer. I was sent for on the 6th of February to a house of ill fame to apprehend a man whom the prisoner charged with robbing him of sixteen dollars. In the afternoon, the prosecutor sent for me to take the prisoner into custody. As we were going before the magistrate, I neither threatened or promised the prisoner, he said he was sorry for it, that it was a drunken job, and he took them in a frolic. I found the pumps at the India Arms, and the other things at the Barley Mow.</p>

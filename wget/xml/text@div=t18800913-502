I am a carman out of employment—on 6th August, about 3.30, I was in Fenchurch Street, and saw Hummerston and Smith, who is not here, rolling a quarter cask of wine to the next building, where they put it on a truck—I spoke to them and went with them to Bedford Street, Commercial Road, where I stood outside the Bedford Arms while Smith went in, and I saw Cornwell waiting inside, and then Hummerston</p>

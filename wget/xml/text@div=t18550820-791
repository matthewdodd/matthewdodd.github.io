On 19th July I was opposite Mr. Bone's stable in Upper Thames-street, about 7 o'clock in the morning; Allen, another policeman, was with me—I saw Brown come from his master's, Mr. Westley's, stable, and go into Mr. Bone's stable with this bag (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it appeared to have something in it—I saw him come out again, he had nothing with him then—I did not follow him, but I saw him come back into Mr. Bone's stable about ten minutes afterwards—I and</p>

               <p>Allen followed him in, and I asked him what that was that he had brought in that bag—he pointed to these wrappers and book covers, and said, "Only a few wrappers"—I asked him where he got them from; he said, of his foreman—I asked him where he worked; he said, "At Mr. Westley's, the bookbinder's," and that he had borrowed them of his foreman—I saw about two tons of different sorts of papers there, several reams of newspapers, and several works which had been printed but never published—there was a great quantity more of wrappers—all the wrappers were in the coach house, but the printed paper and newspapers were up stairs—when we went in, the prisoners were standing over the goods by the scales, the wrappers were at their feet just inside the door—I asked Halliday how he accounted for that lot of goods (that was this large bundle)—he said that he got them of Cox and Wyman—they were in the coach house—I went to Mr. West<lb></lb>ley's, and returned to the stable with him—Mr. Westley, Jun., was there when I returned, and Mr. Bone, and the prisoners also—when they were all present I said to Brown that Mr. Westley had not given him these things, and he knew nothing about them—he said that he had borrowed them of Halliday one wet day to cover his master's goods up—I pointed to the book covers, and said, "Did you borrow these to cover up your master's things?"—he said no, but he had lost some which he borrowed of Halliday, and had brought these to make up the weight—I told him to consider him<lb></lb>self in custody—I said to Halliday, "Where are those bags which you brought in yesterday at tea time?"—he pointed to these others, and said, "They are them, they came from Cox and Wyman's"—there was a large quantity—this is only a sample.</p>

Graham &amp; Sons, of Trigg Lane, iron merchants—in December the prisoner Browning came to know our terms of selling iron—he gave the name of Richard Browning—he showed me an order for wrought iron tubes, and then he asked what our price and terms would be—I said our terms were for cash, and if credit, two satisfactory references would be required—he said "Very well," and went away—he came again about</p>

               <p>two days afterwards, and brought as references Mr. Charles Barker, of Chalcott Crescent, and Mr. Reynolds, of Victoria Road, Peckham—I wrote to those addresses—I received this letter from Mr. Samuel Reynolds. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "31, Victoria Road, Peckham, December 3rd, 1874. Sirs,—Yours received, respecting Mr. Richard Browning of 3, Stacey Terrace, Peckham, I beg to say I have known him several years when I have had many trans<lb></lb>actions. I always found him prompt in his payments and engagements with me; I consider him a safe person to do business with, and trustworthy, say up to 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I am, yours obediently, Samuel Reynolds.") This is the answer I received from Mr. Charles Barker. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: 24, Chalcott Crescent, December 2nd, 1874. Gentlemen,—in answer to your letter respecting Mr. Richard Browning, of Peckham, I have known him many years, he is a most respectable man; I consider him most trustworthy, should have no objection, should he require it, to trust him 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Yours in confidence, C. Barker.") Browning called the following day and wished to know whether the references were satisfactory—I told him Mr. Graham had consented to give him credit—when he gave Mr. Barker as a reference, he said he was a gentleman living in a fine house and worth thousands of pounds—he also said "I am a retired publican, and have just sold my business for 6, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he gave me his address on the first occasion as 3, Stacey Terrace, Peckham—I first supplied him with goods on 9th December, to the amount of 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—a cart came and fetched the goods away, and they were delivered to a person who signed for Browning—on the 18th I supplied goods to the. amount 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the whole amount of goods supplied was 151<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., consisting of boiler tubes of different classes, gutters, pipes, stoves, ranges and such things—those goods were taken away from time to time in the same manner—he came again in January and brought a further order which I declined to execute until the goods which had been already delivered were paid for—he did not have the goods then—a day or two afterwards he brought this bill dated 18th January, drawn by Browning, and accepted by, Charles Barker payable to us for 151<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said it was the same Barker whom he had referred us to—I took that bill and believed it to be genuine—he asked if he could have the goods that he wanted before, and he had them on the 20th January—they amounted to 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we delivered further goods to the amount of about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., making altogether 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods delivered—about 10th February he brought or sent another order which I declined to execute until the bill was paid—the bill passed through the banker's but was not paid—I did not present it myself—there is an endorsement on it "Gone away"—the matter was then placed in the hands' of the police—I communicated to Mr. Graham what had happened—we have never been paid for any portion of the goods.</p>

Miles, Gould &amp; Co.—it corresponded exactly with the sizes we supplied—I did not go to either of the houses to which we got references.</p>

Miles, Gould's man recognised it and I recognised some, a great deal of it was marked with the maker's brand "M. G.

On the morning of 18th March I was at the top of Quadrant Grove—I saw Barker leave No. 25 about 9.30—I followed him into Maldon Road and Queen Square and eventually spoke to him—I asked him if his name was Charles Barker—he said "That is not my name"—I asked him if he lived at 25, Quadrant Grove—he said "Yes, I live there, my name is Harrison"—I asked him if he ever lived at 24, Chalcott Crescent, Regent's Park—he said "Yes, I did live there"—I told him I was a police officer and I should arrest him on a charge of conspiracy with J. Baxter &amp; Co., 25, George Street, Chelsea, to defraud various people of their goods—he asked me to show him the warrant—I told him I had not it with me, but he could see it at the station—he said that he never knew such a person as Baxter—on the way to the station I met Inspector Pay and Sergeant Morgan and I handed him over to Morgan and went with Pay to 25, Quadrant Grove, where Browning was apprehended—I saw the two women—I searched Barker's sitting room and found' several documents there, and also in the kitchen—Browning's wife told me in his presence that no other persons lived in the house but Browning and Barker—I found this letter on the mantelpiece in the kitchen. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: 12, Nile Terrace, March 16th.

Graham of 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of iron—he said "I don't know Barker and Browning, neither do I know Messrs.

On 18th March, I received Barker from Sergeant Gibbs, and took him to Albany Street Police Station—while he was there Inspector Pay and Sergeant Gibbs brought in Browning, who nodded his head in a familiar manner expressing his surprise to Barker—from the expression I thought they were acquainted with each other—I then said to Barker "Do you know that man," pointing to Browning—he said "Yes"—I asked him what his name was—he said "His name is Smith. He has lodged in" my house with his wife Tory about a month. I know nothing of him"—Barker was then near the fire at the end of the room—I noticed him tearing some papers in his pocket and took possession of them—I produce them—as I took them from him he said "Be very careful with those papers, they are of great importance to me, they are communications between me and my solicitor"—I looked at them, some were addressed "Charles Harrison, 25, Quadrant Grove," and others "Charles Barker, 24, Chalcott Crescent, Regent's Park"—I asked him what his name was—he said "Harrison"—I said "The papers are not all addressed in the name of Harrison, some are addressed Barker"—he said "Yes, my correct name is Charles Harrison Barker. I only lodged a few nights at Chalcott Crescent, and had my letters addressed there"—I found in his pocket-book an acceptance for 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the name of George Foreman—he asked me several times what was the nature of the charge—I told him I did not know exactly till I saw Mr. Pay—he said "Well, about Baxter, I know nothing about Baxter; I never gave a reference to Baxter or any other person in my life"—he told me he was a skin dealer in the City—I asked if he could give me the address—he said "No"—he should decline to, he should not held any further conversation with me.</p>

I am a tea dealer at Little Trinity Lane, City—I know Browning and Barker—about 23rd or 25th November Brown<lb></lb>ing came in and said he had been recommended to our house and gave an order for some tea which came to 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he did not pay for it at that time—he gave as a reference Mr. Charles Barker of. Chalcott Crescent, Regent's Park—before I let him have the tea I made enquiries—I went to the house, Mr. Barker was not at home, but I found that he lived, there—Browning called the next day and I let him have the tea—he afterwards paid for it—</p>

               <p>a few days after he came again and ordered a small amount of tea and some sugar—I eventually let him have goods and fruit amounting to 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on the oc<lb></lb>casino of the second order I told Browning that for such an amount of goods it was necessary I should have cash or some security for the payment espe<lb></lb>cially as I had not much to do with fruit, and if I supplied him with the fruit he required I should have to give my cheque for it, and I should require payment at a certain date—he said "I will bring this gentleman Mr. Barker who will no doubt accept two bills for me"—he told me that Barker was a; gentleman who had retired from business, and owned several houses in the neighbourhood of Primrose Hill—he brought Barker to my place, and these two bills of exchange were given to me—I drew them, Browning accepted them, and Barker endorsed them in my presence—I saw him write his name on both the bills—they had the goods—I presented the bills at maturity but have received no money on them—the amount of the bills was 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>

                  </hi>. I live at Oxford Market, and have the letting of the shops there—on 26th November I let a shop, No. 6, in the market to Browning, who gave the name of Henry Byrne, 24, Chalcott Crescent Regent's Park—an agreement was entered into—he gave me two references which are on that paper, "Refer to Mr. Reynolds, hay salesman, 31, Vic<lb></lb>toria Road, Peckham; also, Mr. W. Kelly, 54, Regina Road, Tollington Park, Holloway"—our people in the office applied to those references and had very satisfactory answers—this was one—"Dear Sir, In reply to your enquiry respecting Mr. H. Byrnes, I beg to state he held a house of mine at Barnet fourteen or fifteen years; I regularly received my rent, 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum, and I believe him to be a responsible man, and make no doubt you will find him a desirable tenant. Yours obediently, Samuel Reynolds"—I did not find him a desirable tenant—goods came to the shop, poultry, pigs, butter, eggs, and all manner of goods, which were taken away either in the morning or the night as they were delivered in the day by railway vans—I gave them notice to quit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Browning.</hi> I did not see you sign the agreement you went to the office with a clerk to sign it—Byrne did not owe any rent when he went away, because we always have two months down in advance—two months' rent was paid, and you were there two months all but one week—lots of things came there—I don't know whether they were paid for or not.</p>

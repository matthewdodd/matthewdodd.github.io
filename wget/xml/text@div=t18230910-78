On the 25th of August, about one o'clock in the afternoon, I went to Dock-head, and was returning about eight, and was not at all in liquor.

               <p>"Pray, Sir, will you have the kindness to tell me my nearest way to Sadler's Wells?" I said,</p>
               <p>"Sir, I think you cannot go nearer than down Wood-street, and when you get to the bottom, turn up White or Redcross-street, that will take you to Old-street, then turn to the left, which will take you to Old-street-road, and you will be in a straight direction for Sadler's Wells." I walked on the pavement, and he continued in the road, where he was when he first spoke to me. He said,</p>
               <p>"I am a perfect stranger in London, and have only been here a few days; and am a carpenter, and have been at work in the Commercial-road, and, to tell you the truth, I am so exceedingly exhausted with the heat of the evening, and fatigue of my day's work, that I am ready to faint." I said,</p>
               <p>"Sir, I think you are an Irishman, by your accent; I have met with great hospitality in that country; I am known to the landlord of this public-house (the Woolpack, in Hart-street) close by, if you think proper to go in I will give you a little refreshment;" we went in, and the landlord said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Ackroyd, step into the parlour" - the tap-room is exactly at the entrance, and the door wide open; I said,</p>
               <p>"Thank you, I'll step in here for a few minutes, we are not going to stop long." I ordered a pint of beer, sipped it, and gave it him to drink; and when it was gone, I said,</p>
               <p>"Will you have any more?" he said,</p>
               <p>"No, I am thankful for this." I got up and went out; he followed me, and as I left the door, he said,</p>
               <p>"Sir, I think there is a person stands there, who is a very suspicious character." I said,</p>
               <p>"Oh dear, it's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100047"></xptr>nobody who knows any thing of you or me; it is somebody who is going to take some beer, I suppose." I walked on and he behind me, till we came to Cripplegate-buildings.</p>
               <p>"Now Sir," said he,</p>
               <p>"I am as much at a loss which way to go, as when I first met you." I pointed over to Lower Whitecross-street, and said,</p>
               <p>"Go right forward in that direction, and when you get to the top turn to the left, that is Old-street, and will lead you to Goswell-street-road." I had myself to go to Mr. Arnold's, a chymist, in Aldersgate-street, who I do business with; so my nearest way was to turn out of Whitecross-street, about a hundred yards, as far as the Grapes public-house, which I did, and then had to turn to the left; he was to go straight on; so I wished him good night, and he did the same, and left me ten or fifteen yards; then turned round quick and called after me, saying,</p>
               <p>"Oh Sir, it strikes me at this moment, if you will tell me where Barbican is, I shall know where I am, and which way to go;" I said,</p>
               <p>"Barbican, is within a few yards of where I am going; he joined me following me behind, at a short distance, and on crossing Redcross-street, he got a few yards before me - and we proceeded thirty or forty yards up Paul's-alley, he being a few yards before me; and when I passed the corner of the court, I said, I thought it was later than I expected as Mr. Reeves's, the pawnbroker's shop was closed.</p>
               <p>"Now," said I</p>
               <p>"if you take the first turning to the right, it will take you into Barbican, and then you will know where you are;" the words had scarcely escaped my lips, when he turned round as quick as lightning, and struck me a dreadful blow in the eye; I never had a morsel of rest for six or seven nights, the pain was so excruciating; he said,</p>
               <p>"D - n your eyes your blunt or your life immediately." I collared him, and said</p>
               <p>"You ungrateful scoundrel, sooner than I would give you a shilling, I would sacrifice my life on the spot;" I dragged him back towards Redcross-street; he cried out</p>
               <p>"For God's sake, for Christ's sake, let me go, leave me alone;" but I was determined to have him punished. I held him at arms length, and he displayed all the energy and power imaginable, striking me whenever he could, in all parts of my body; I got him to the end of the court, called out Watch, and called for assistance, and in the course of a few minutes, I was surrounded by a number of friends, who I knew; the watchman came up and did not know the cause of the tumult. I had fast hold of him, he wished to get loose; he struck my heels; I fell with my head on the stones, but I never quitted my hold; he kept calling out,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake let me go, you will strangle me." The watchman then interfered, but seeing he was a feeble man, I kept hold of him; he said,</p>
               <p>"D - n your eyes, I am in the hands of the watchman, let me go;" but I would not till we got him to the watch-house. I then gave charge of him, for demanding my blunt or my life.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where did you come from - A. Bradford, in Yorkshire. I have lived in town since 1811 or 1812. I rent a first floor, and am married - we were about half an hour together. I have mentioned all the conversation which passed. Paul's-alley, is one side of Hall's brewery; the other side is a dead wall. I have lodged where I do now, since Good-Friday. I lived in Jewin-street before that; I once sold some goods on commission for Mr. Brown, of Red Lion-street, Clerkenwell; we parted because he could not supply goods. I took the benefit of the Insolvent Act in 1812 or 1813. I was never in prison but at that time. I did not owe 200 l.</p>

            . I am a watchman, of Moor-lane. As I came down Red Cross-street, at a quarter to ten o'clock, I heard a cry of Watch; I crossed over to Paul's-alley, and at the end of the alley saw the prisoner and prosecutor scuffling. He gave charge of the prisoner. I took hold of him. He made no particular charge then, but said he had insulted him, or something to that purpose. He said nothing then to lead me to suppose he intended to rob him. We pulled him along, and in Red Cross-street he hustled with us, then turned round and tripped the prosecutor up. We all three fell together; I pulled him up, and the prosecutor kept hold of him by the neck. He said,</p>
               <p>"Let me go, d - n you, I am in the hands of the watchman." He turned himself about, and hit the prosecutor over the face. The prosecutor kept hold of him till he got to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. While you and the prosecutor had hold of him, did you hear from the prosecutor any charge against him of attempting to rob him - A. No; blunt means money; I did not hear him say that the prisoner demanded blunt; but, as we went along, he said, I suppose you wanted to diddle me if you could. I heard nothing about blunt, but what passed at the watch-house I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far is it from where you took him, to the watch-house - A. About a hundred and fifty yards; we might be about five or ten minutes going there.</p>

            . I was constable of the night. The prisoner and prosecutor were at the watch-house about five minutes before I came, as it was not ten o'clock. He gave charge of him for an assault, and said they were in Paul's-alley, near Reeves's door; that the prisoner walked before him, and turned round all of a sudden, and caught hold of the breast of his coat with both hands, and said,</p>
               <p>"What do you mean to do; d - n you, have you got any blunt; d - n you, I will have your blunt." That he collared him, and said he should have none of his blunt; when a dreadful scuffle ensued, and both came down together, but he kept his hold. I took the charge down as an assault, and asked the prisoner. in the prosecutor's presence, why he had been guilty of this behaviour, and if he had struck the prosecutor. He said he had, and did not wish to deny it, and would strike him again, or any man who behaved indecently or unmanly to him. I asked what he had done. He said he had put his hand ***, and he would strike any man who did that to him.</p>
               <p>JURY to ACKROYD. Q. When you came to the alley, you told him the first turning to the right would bring him to Barbican; how came you to send him up that dark alley - A. Because I was going into Aldersgate-street, and Jacob's-wells is a thoroughfare into Barbican.</p>
               <p>To TAYLOR. Q. Did the prosecutor hear the prisoner say he had taken indecent liberties with him - A. Yes; I cannot say whether he made any reply - his eye looked red, and in the morning it had turned black.</p>

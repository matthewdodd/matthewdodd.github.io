                  </hi>. On the 5th of January I was in the service of the Bishop of London, and was in his grounds at Fulham, in company with Samuel Hay. I noticed the prisoner and another in the field carrying a plank of wood—we went round and met the parties in the lane—I was ordered to detain the prisoner till we could get a constable to take him on a charge of stealing the plank which he had on his shoulder—I collared him, and he struck me two violent blows on the forehead with a large bone, and threw me with violence on the ground—the blow made my head bleed a good deal—he struck me a second blow, and I fell—Hay seeing him des<lb></lb>perate, desired me to let him go, which I did, and he made off—some pieces of wood were thrown at me by the other man—I found a piece of wood in the direction they had escaped from the field into the lane—the plank the prisoner was carrying was part of the fence of the Bishop's ground—the prisoner was apprehended on the 5th of October.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of the Bishop of London, and was in the grounds.

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> There had been a flood a few days before, which washed the wood away; there were men picking wood up; I found a piece and crossed the field; the man took me; I said, "If it belongs <hi rend="italic">to</hi> you, you may hare it;" the other man threw me down, and threw the bone at me. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi> He did not offer to give up the wood—Baldwin never had the bone.</p>

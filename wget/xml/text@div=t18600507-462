                  </hi>. I am manager to Elizabeth Maria Pasley and another, wholesale milliners, of 2, Forster-street, City-road—the prisoner came into their service in 1858, as traveller—his salary was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, and 2 1/2 per cent commission on what he sold; which made his salary over 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—his duty was to sort out the stock, and go to the customers—the stock was kept on the premises, he selected what he thought fit, and put it in his own boxes—two or three times he used to tell us that one, or two, or three lots were taken—I never checked the stock that he had selected—it was his duty to take it to our own customers—he used to make a duplicate of the invoices he left, to give one invoice to the customer, and bring one home—the one he brought home ought to contain the amount he received for the goods; and there was a general statement made of what he had sold, and what he had received during the day—that would not be made in duplicate—here is an invoice, of 18th March, in his writing—the a, mouirt, is 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the goods to the amount of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. had been sold to Mr. Gibbons, and the money received by the prisoner—we ought to have had the impression of this—the marks are on the back, showing that this has been prepared with the apparatus, but the one that we received of this same date, 18th March, is only 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the difference between the two is 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the second</p>

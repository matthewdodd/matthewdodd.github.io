I do not remember the day of the week; it was between twelve and one o'clock, I turned it down there, while I was serving my customers that wanted some stale bread for dinner. I left eight quartern loaves in it, and three three-penny loaves, of wheaten bread.</p>
               <p>Q. You was absent; how long? - A-about ten minutes; and when I came back my basket was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get it again? - Yes, about three hours after.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find it? - There was a young man coming out of the shop, and he saw the prisoner with the basket.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose hands did you first see it after you lost it? - In John Hill's; it was at his mistress's shop, in Chapel-street; his mistress is a baker.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know your bread and basket again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you kept it ever since? - Yes; I have got one of the loaves here. I can swear to the loaves and basket too. We have had it some time; it was almost new; we had it about three weeks or a month.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any name on it? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell it by the size of it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the basket were there any loaves in it? - Yes, eight quarterns and three three-penny, the same as I lost exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you swear to your loaves? - I know them by the make of them; I make them myself, and set them myself, and I know them by baching of them in taking them up; I put my four fingers in.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't other bakers do them in the same way? - I never see any.</p>

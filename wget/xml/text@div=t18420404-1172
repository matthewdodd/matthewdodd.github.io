I live at 73, Margaret-street, Clerkenwell-the prisoners occupied my first-floor front-room furnished—they took posses<lb></lb>sion of it about the end of May or the first of June, and remained with me about eight months—the female took the lodging—they left on the 28th of February, 1842, and I missed the property mentioned in the indictment they lived there as man and wife, and paid 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per week—they have left four weeks due—George Payne's father paid 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them, back rent a month before they left—they paid as well as they could themselves, but not in any way regular, for they were so drunk and disorderly, and fight ing, when he came home, I was obliged to give them notice to leave—I believe he is a law-writer—by going to his employer I found where he was gone, and found him at work there—I do not know where he rent to lodge after leaving me—the property lost is worth about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—we were not aware but that they were man and wife till they denied it at the police court.</p>

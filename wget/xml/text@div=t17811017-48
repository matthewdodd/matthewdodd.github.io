               <p>I am servant to Mr. Mounsey. When I came down stairs, at seven o'clock in the morning, I found the dining-room door and the window open. I was the first that came down stairs. I looked into the dining-room; and on the chair by the window there was a a bason and a sugar-basket: the basket was silver, the bason was glass. On the chair, or on the table or window, I don't know which, there was the handle of a punch-ladle; the bowl was broke off, which was silver. On the table there was a plated candlestick. On the floor there were three more plated candlesticks. I looked into the beaufet, and all the plate was gone. I went up stairs, to look into the back-parlour, and a little clock was gone, that stood over the fire-place. I looked into the fore-parlour: my mistress's hat was on the floor; the cloak, to which it had been pinned, was gone. The next thing I saw was, that the house-door was open: the chain lay on the mat, by the door. I went down again into the kitchen, and missed the salts from the salt-closet. None of the things have been found.</p>
               <p>Was there a coffee-pot among them? - A coffee-pot and silver waiter. I went up, and called my master.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any appearance that enabled you to judge what way the persons got into the house? - I can't say, without they got in at the dining-room window.</p>
               <p>Were there any marks of feet? - I did not observe any.</p>
               <p>Was it shut the night before? - I can't say; I was not in the dining-room all the day before.</p>

               <p>On the 11th of September, you went to search Harris's house? - Yes; the house was searched; and I came down, with some of the gentlemen, into the kitchen. One of the gentlemen, I believe Mr. Blasson, brought the cane out of the cellar into the kitchen. I looked at it, and said, I am certain this is my cane. Harris said, Your cane! I have had it these five years. His wife asked me, Is the string yours? I said, No, the string is not mine: for there has been a hole bored through it: my cane had no hole through it: and there has been a new ferrill put upon it; and it seems a good deal shorter than it was. Says I, It is very extraordinary, a cane that you have had five years, that you should have never used it; for the ferrill is neither soiled nor dirty. His wife said, the reason he had never used it was, that the first Sunday he had it, he struck at her, coming from Hoxton, and she swore he should never use it again. He said, He could prove, by several people, it was his. I said, I was positive it was mine, and gave it to the constable, and desired the constable to take him into custody. The next day he was brought before the alderman, and I saw him there. He called a person, who, he said, had been his servant, who pretended to say it was his cane, that she had beat the carpet with it. He was questioned when the alteration was made in the cane: he said, about a fortnight or three weeks before. He said he bought the ferrill at a stall in Moorfields, and put it on himself. He was then asked, If there was a hole through the cane, for the cane-string to go through? I believe they call them pipes they put in for the string to go through. He said, There was. Then he was sent by the alderman, to shew the place. I am perfectly sure it is my cane. I described the marks on it.</p>
               <p>(The prosecutor described the marks in court with great particularity.)</p>
               <p>(Mr. Miller, who was present at the finding of the cane, confirmed the prosecutor in the account he had given of what passed concerning it.)</p>

Harris was at home. He asked my authority. I pointed to the city constable, and he produced the warrant. He requested that one person might make the search. I did; and, going down into the cellar, I found the cane standing behind the stairs. When Mr. Mounsey described the marks of the cane, and said it was his, Harris insisted it was his cane.</p>
               <p>Was you present when Underwood's lodgings were searched? - Yes, both times. We had some difficulty to find out his lodging. We found no property of Mr. Mounsey's there.</p>
               <p>Did you find any thing that was claimed by Underwood? - I found this supple-jack in his lodging.</p>

               <p>I live by Moorfields. On the 7th of September, the prisoner Harris brought me this cane. I made this hole, and put this pair of pipes in a new string, cut it shorter, and put on a new ferrill. He came for it in the morning of the 11th, between ten and eleven o'clock. There were two men in company with him when he brought it; Underwood might be one: there was a person like him; but I cannot be certain it was Underwood. The second time there was none but himself. I sold one of them a supple-jack for sixpence: he would not have a ferrill upon it: we generally ferrill them when we sell them.</p>
               <p>Is it more likely to be able to swear to that, with or without a ferrill? - There is nothing remarkable in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at 66, Baldwin's Gardens—on 21st October, about 3.30, I met the prisoner in Lincoln's Inn Fields—I had known him three or four years ago—we went and had some beer—he treated me to a pot of beer, and I gave him two—he asked me to go home with him—I went to his place—his wife was in the room—he spoke to her, and she left the room—he locked the door then—I said "I will go home"—he said "You shan't go home for a minute"—I said "I will go now"—I got up from the chair—he put his legs between mine and knocked me down, put his hand in my pocket, and took my purse and two half-sovereigns, and three shillings—he did not strike me—I cried out "Murder!" and "Police!"—Catherine Brown came up stairs and then the prisoner unlock<lb></lb>ed the door and let me out—I went home because I was afraid of my life—I mentioned it to the police at 10 o'clock the next morning.</p>

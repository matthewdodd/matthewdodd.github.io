I keep the Rose public-house at New Cross—on Saturday evening, 8th June, at a little after 9, the prisoner came in and asked for a pint of stout, which came to 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I served him, and he gave me a half-crown in payment—I took it up, saw it was bad, and told him so, and then broke it in three pieces—the prisoner then made use of rather abusive lan<lb></lb>guage to me for suspecting him of dishonesty, and with great persuasion I let him go—I asked him if he had any more, and he pulled from his pocket some coppers and some silver—I took out a sixpence, and gave him 2d. change—I kept the pieces of the half-crown, and gave them on the Monday to the constable Snell.</p>

I am the wife of William Luckhurst, the landlord of the Amersham Arms, New Cross—that is about a quarter of a mile from the Rose public-house—on Saturday evening, 8th June, about 10 o'clock, the prisoner came in and asked for a half-quartern of gin and some water, which was 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he paid me with a bad half-crown—I bent it in the detector, told the prisoner it was bad, and gave it to my husband—he examined it, put it in the detector again, and bent it still more—I then saw him put it on a shelf in the bar—he told the prisoner it was bad, and he said he had taken</p>

On Saturday, 8th June, I was on duty in the New Cross-road, Deptford—Mr. Luckhurst spoke to me, and I took the prisoner into custody for passing bad money at the Amersham Arms—he was in front of the Amersham Arms—he did not appear to be drunk, because he ran away as soon as the other person said he had tendered another half-crown at the Rose—some man came up from the Rose, and said that he had watched him from the Rose down to where I had got him, and the prisoner then ran away—I ran after him, caught him, and took him into custody—he kicked me, and resisted very much—it took three or four of us to take him to the station—I there searched him, and found 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., good money; one half-crown, a two-shilling piece, seven shillings, four sixpences, a fourpenny bit, and a penny—I produce three pieces of a half-crown which I got from Mr. Hagger.</p>

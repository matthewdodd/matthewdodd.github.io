                  </hi>. I live at 42, Museum-street, and am an artist—a little after 12 o'clock on Wednesday morning, 29th November, I was going down Newton-street, close by where I live, and saw the four prisoners coming out of the Bell public-house, and they surrounded me—Southwell stood in front</p>

               <p>of me, and took my watch out of my waistcoat pocket while the others held me—he did not get the money—he ran away with my watch—I ran after him down Newton-street into Charles-street—the other prisoners stopped there—I came back—when I got into Holborn again, I looked for a police-man, but could not find one—George came and put his hand into my pocket—there were three there—the one that took the watch was away—George did not get the chain, it was still hanging in my waistcoat—he got some loose money out of my right-hand trousers pocket—I went to look for a policeman, and then went to the station-house and made the charge—I was called out of my place about half-past 12 or 1 o'clock—I went to the station about a quarter to 2 to see if I could identify the prisoners—I went into the yard and directly identified Southwell as the one that took the watch, and also identified the others—they said that the police told me to pick them out; which I deny—the police-constable said, "Which one?"and I went to him and took him out; he was placed among twenty of thirty others—I picked the four out of the lump.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 7, Waterloo-street, Albion-town—on 28th November I went to see my sister, and on returning home, I met Lemore, whom I had never seen before, and a female whom I knew, by the Eastern Counties Railway, Shoreditch, about half-past 11 o'clock—I con<lb></lb>tinued in their company till a quarter past 12—I walked with them as far as the Primrose public-house, Norton Folgate, and had some ale with them—we stopped till the public-house closed.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DALEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What are you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A milliner and dressmaker—my husband was a general salesman—I never knew Lemore till last Tuesday three weeks—I met the three parties together in Shore-ditch—the female gave me to understand that it was an uncle who was with him—I do not know what business he is, or where the woman lives—her name is Barrett—I do not know where she gets her living—she had a dress for me to make for her—she brought it on the Saturday, and asked me if I remembered the young men she was in company with and had the ale—I said, "Yes"—she said, "One of them is taken up on suspicion of robbery, and has sent to know if you will come and state the time you had the ale with him"—I said, "Yes"—she said that she was given to understand that the robbery was committed on the Tuesday night I had the ale—I remem<lb></lb>bered that it was the 28th by the female coming to me—I had occasion to see my sister that very evening, and I know it was the same evening—I am sure it was Tuesday the 28th—it was last Tuesday three weeks—I knew it was the 28th when the young woman told me there was a robbery—I re<lb></lb>membered that it was the latter end of the month, the 28th—I can tell you</p>

               <p>what I was doing on the 27th—I was making up this widow's bonnet that is on my head—the 27th was Monday—my husband died on 7th August last—I have only known the young woman six weeks—I never asked her address—she brought a dress for me to make it—I was not speaking to the prosecutor yesterday, but on Tuesday I asked him to drink, and he took two glasses of porter in my company, and I had one—I did not ask him not to appear—other persons were present—he asked me what sort of a man Mr. Lemore was—I said that he was rather a pleasant young man, but rather slight in the whiskers—I did not say a word to the prosecutor to try and induce him not to prosecute—he voluntarily gave me this card, and told me to call upon him when I thought proper—I visited the prisoner in Newgate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LILLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> For what purpose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Only because I should like to see the young man, as it was very hard for him to be there, knowing he was in my company—Mrs. Barrett is here, and the young man has been here until to-day—Mrs. Barrett spoke to me on the following Saturday, and I then recollected perfectly well being in her company with the young man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am married, and live at 33, Charles-street, Drury-lane—I sell things in Covent-garden-market—I know Lemore—I was in his company at the end of November with another young man whom he called his uncle—we met Mrs. Blackett in Shoreditch, facing the railway station—it was as near as I can guess from 11 to half-past—we had two pots of ale at the Primrose at the corner of Primrose-street—I continued with them till about a quarter past 12, when the house was shutting up—Lemore came right home with me to Drury-lane, and did not leave me till he wished me good night at the end of the street—it had then gone 1 o'clock—I after<lb></lb>wards spoke to Mrs. Blackett about the matter—I have known him about six months.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you tell her your address? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, because I did not think it was needed—I do not live with Lemore—I am a married woman—I was not there when his place was searched—I was at Moore's place—I live with my brother and sister, Mr. and Mrs. Lemore—I was not at the lodging of either of the prisoners, when they were searched—I did not visit either of the prisoners in prison as his wife, nor did I tell any one in the prison that I was his wife—that man (a gaoler) asked me if I was his wife, and I said, "No"—I did not use the word "alibi" in the prison—Lemore said, "You can prove I was not there"—he did not tell me I was in the Primrose drinking—I knew I was there—no one spoke about the Prim<lb></lb>rose in the presence of that warder—I only know Lemore by that name—I have known him two or three, or it may be four or five years—I never knew him by the name of Sinclair—I do not know Sinclair to be his right name—a young man who was a perfect stranger to me said that a young man was taken, Lemore, who wanted to speak to me—I said that I would go and see him, and when I went Lemore told me—he told me going along Bow-street, that I was in his company on Tuesday—he did not remind me of the date—I can think of what I was doing on 27th November, I was washing—I cannot remember what I was doing on the 23d—I know the 20th was Sunday, and Saturday I was out with my things in Covent-garden-market—I was not in a public-house the week before—I have only been into two public-houses in my life to drink with him, and one was in Drury-lane.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MRS. SOUTHWELL</hi>. The prisoner Southwell is my son—we occupy two rooms in High-street, Bloomsbury—my son does not sleep in the room with me—my husband and I sleep in the work-room—he works for his father, and sleeps at home—he was at home on the night of the 28th Novem<lb></lb>ber—I opened the door to him at half-past 11, or it might not be so much, and he came up stairs, and went to bed—I unlocked the backdoor and let him in—I did not go into his bed-room with him that night—I always sit up to let him in, and lock him in every night—we have a reason for it—because the work is kept there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you let him in at 11 every night. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and sometimes at 10—he never sleeps out all night—he is never out after 11—I have heard that he was taken by Sergeant Ackerell at a public-house—he was not at home that night; he was in prison, and could not be—my husband is a tailor, and my son and two daughters work at the business.</p>

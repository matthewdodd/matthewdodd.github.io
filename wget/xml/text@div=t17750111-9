            . I am a shopman to the prosecutors. When I came down from dinner, on the 13th of December, the apprentice was shewing the prisoners some handkerchiefs I had shewed them some before; I had some suspicion of them, therefore I chose to serve them myself, being determined to watch them narrowly. I saw Jones convey something under her cloak or apron: I let them go out of the shop, and then I acquainted Mr. Hussey with it; he went after them and brought them back: the handkerchiefs were dropped after they were in the shop; I did not see the prisoner drop them, but I saw them as soon as they were dropped:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177501110007"></xptr> I know there were no handkerchiefs in that place before.</p>

            . I was by when Mr. Hussey stopped the prisoner, I followed them into Mr. Hussey's shop, and I saw Jones drop the handkerchiefs: the other prisoner said, there was nothing found upon her, and attempted to run away, I ran after her and brought her back.</p>
               <p>There being no evidence to affect Smith, she was not put upon her defence.</p>
               <p>Jones called five witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

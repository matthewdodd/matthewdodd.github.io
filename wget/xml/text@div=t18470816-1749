                  </hi> I am warehouseman, in the service of Joseph Bow<lb></lb>man and John Maine, of Wood-street, Cheapside. On the 19th of Aug., about half-past nine o'clock, the prisoner came into our shop, and asked for Brailey—I said he would not be in till ten o'clock—he waited there—our traveller came down, I went to speak to him, and my back was turned for about two minutes—I then saw that the prisoner was stooping—I walked up to meet him, and saw him take a bag off the counter which he had brought in with him—he was drawing the bag up, and I discerned these handkerchiefs in it, they had no business in it; they are the property of john Bowman and another—I took the bag from him, took it into the counting-house, and gave it to the head clerk—I then went down, and brought the prisoner up.</p>

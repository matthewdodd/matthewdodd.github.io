                  </hi>. I am a planterer, of 122, Cornwall Road, Lambeth—on Friday evening, 19th September, I was standing at my door, and saw Leonard nearly opposite the White Horse dragging Hobbs, who was trying to get away from him—he dragged him across the road, and attempted to get him into the public-house, when Collier came out, and there was a severe struggle between the three—Hobbs got away and seemed to stagger back two or three yards, and then Leonard pinned him by his arms and Collier assisted in holding him—they took him a few yards up King Street, and his hat fell off—they were still struggling, and 1 saw Leonard put his hand into Hobbs's right trousers pocket and take out something very bulky, and then they both ran down St. Andrew's Court—this was about 6.30 p.m., and it was a very clear, bright evening—I informed a constable, and afterwards picked the prisoners out from a group of a dozen at Kennington Lane Police-station—I recognised Collier the moment I saw him, but I had a tho ough good look at Leonard because he was holding his head sideway, but I went in front of him, examined him thoroughly, and identified him—that was on the following Wednesday about 10 p.m.</p>

I am a groom, and live at 1, King Street, Cornwall Road—I was sitting at my tea on 19th September, about 6.30, and saw Hobbs between the prisoners; Leonard had his right arm and Collier his left; they paused in front of my window—Hobbs seemed to want to get away, but they would not let him—I believe they saw me, and shifted about two yards to the right—I afterwards saw a group of about 20 men at the station, and picked out Collier first; Leonard's face was very red, and I did not pick him out for a minute or a minute and a half.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 4, New Street, Webber Street, and am a slater—Leonard is a fellow-workman of mine—we started work on Wednesday, the 10th, and he worked with me till the 24th—we left off work just before 5.30 every night, and sometimes 10 minutes or a quarter past—our specified time was 10 hours a day—I was employed in Tooley Street, but I was at work at the distillery, South Hampstead, at this time—I gave evidence at the police-court, but not at the first hearing—I was bound over—on the evening in question I was with Leonard till 6.50; we walked to William Street, which is a good half-hour's walk to the Coburg Arms—afterwards, when I was leaving, I heard Big Ben strike 7 o'clock—he worked with me till he was taken in custody—I recollect the night this occurred, because it was the last Friday he worek do with me, and it was on the next Wednesday that he was apprehended—I was subpœnaed to the police-court for 2 o'clock, but the summons came off at 12 o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I know Leonard perfectly well, and was with him the day before, and the day before that, but not on the Tuesday—we went home on Wednesday at the usual time, it might have been 6 o'clock; we did not stop to have any beer on the Wednesday night—we left at 6.30 on the Thursday—I swear that because we went to the Coburg and had a drop of beer—I was once charged with assaulting the police and once with felony—I was not convicted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have been getting my living honestly since—I have been in the employ of the master for whom I am working for years and my father before me—it was my custom to go into the public-house after work, it is a slaters' house of call, and that constable uses it also and saw me there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a slater—I was summoned to attend the police-court, but got there too late in consequence of the summons being marked for 2 o'clock—I have occasionally worked with Leonard, but not at this time—I saw him in the Coburg, in Webber Street, on 19th September, at a few minutes after 6 o'clock, with Murray—they stayed there about 25 minutes, and went from there to the Crown public-house and had a pot of beer—I left them shortly before 7 o'clock and went and had a wash, having been on a black job.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I parted with Leonard at the corner of Marlborough Street, about 6.53—I will swear it was not at 6.30, because I was in the Crown at 6.45, and the clock there chimes the quarters and half hours—it is five or six minutes' walk from Marlborough Street to King Street—I can undertake to swear that Leonard could not have been in King Street at 6.30, because he was in my company—I have never been in trouble—the prisoners have worked for me occasionally.</p>

I am a cheesemonger, at 5, Farringdon Road—on 4th May Rodgers came into my shop about 12 o'clock for two pennyworth of cheese, he gave me a shilling in payment—I gave him the change and put the shilling in the till, there was only a florin there—after he left Brown came in for a rasher of bacon, and gave me a shilling—when he left a constable came in and spoke to me—I went to the till and found two bad shillings—I crossed the road to speak to the constable and saw the two prisoners together, at the corner of Farringdon Street—as soon as they saw me speak to him they walked off down Farringdon Street—Brown came in again on the 14th of May for two pennyworth of cheese—he paid me, a bad shilling—I sent for a constable immediately and gave him into custody, and gave the three bad shillings to the policeman Holt.</p>

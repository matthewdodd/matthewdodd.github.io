I immediately contradicted him, and said I did not live there, and that I knew nothing of him. He ran to call a coach, as he said; I told Cane to follow him, for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140105"></xptr>he had my money: he was brought back by Cane, and taken to the watch-house, and the money found upon him.

               <p>Mr. Knowlys, prisoner's council. I believe you was very much in liquor? - Yes, I was a good deal in liquor.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect what time you had been on the ground before the prisoner helped you up? - About three minutes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner did not request you to take him into this alehouse? - No.</p>
               <p>How came you to trust the prisoner with your pocket? - I was so very sick, I could not get at my pocket.</p>
               <p>Do not you recollect desiring this man to take care of what you had valuable about you? - I am sure I did not. I only drank once, a drop of brandy and water, in the house; I do not know how much there was. The person that helped me up with the prisoner, went with me to the watch-house, and saw me home after.</p>

               <p>I was coming from Villars-street, York-buildings, about ten minutes after eleven: As I came down to the bottom of St. Martin's-lane, I saw a person fall, on the other side of the way. Curiosity led me to cross the way; I went close by the prosecutor, and the prisoner asked me to help him up on his feet, which I did. I asked the prisoner if he knew the gentleman; he said he was an old acquaintance of his, and lived in Duke-street, St. James's. The gentleman immediately contradicted it; and the prisoner then said, he had one shilling in his pocket, and would treat the gentleman with a coach home. We staid together some time, helping Mr. Shaw; then the prisoner went to call a coach, and the prosecutor desired me to run after the prisoner for his money. I did not place so much confidence in the prosecutor, being drunk; and I followed the prisoner, to see whether he called a coach or no: he ran past the coach stand; then I called the watchman to my assistance. When we got to the watch-house, the property that Mr. Shaw described was found about the prisoner; four guineas and a half, and a snuff-box, and a part of a lottery ticket, was dropped by the fire-side at the watch-house, within half a yard where the prisoner stood; he stood outside of the fender, and it was inside. I know nothing of the parties.</p>

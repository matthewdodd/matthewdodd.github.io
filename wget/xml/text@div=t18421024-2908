                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Abbee, a grocer, in Vine-street, Westminster. On the 13th of October, about nine o'clock in the even<lb></lb>ing, Kidd came, and bought a pennyworth of cheese—he gave me a sixpence—I put it into my pocket, gave him the change, he left, and in about two minutes Escott came, and asked for a pennyworth of bread—he gave me a sixpence, which I put into my pocket, and gave him the change—Hockley afterwards came, and, in consequence of what he said, I took out of my pocket the two sixpences which I had received from the prisoners—I had two others in my pocket, but the two which I had received from the pri<lb></lb>soners were on the top of a letter which I had in my pocket, and I can swear they were the two which they gave me—Mr. Hockley came over directly, before I had left the counter—I gave the two sixpences to the officer—I am quite sure they were what I had received from these two pri<lb></lb>soners—those which I had in my pocket before were very much worn, the letter was lying flat in my pocket, and the sixpences which the prisoners gave me were new, and very different to those.</p>

I saw the pri<lb></lb>soners—a little after nine o'clock that evening—Escott went into Mr. Ab<lb></lb>bee's shop, and Kidd stood outside—I saw Escott come out of the shop—he joined Kidd, and they went away together—I went and spoke to Mrs. Abbee—in consequence of what she said I went after the prisoners, and gave them in charge.</p>

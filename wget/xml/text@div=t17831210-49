               <p>My Lord, I had been to Smithfield last Friday was fortnight, and sold a horse, and coming home, I saw this horse about the top of Great Queen-street loose, I laid hold of the horse, and took home the saddle for safe custody, and took the horse to the Green-yard, I told the prosecutor I would send<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100089"></xptr> the saddle home to the Green-yard, says he to me, if you send the saddle home I would not wish to hurt any young man, I did not take the horse with any intent to steal it, if I had, I should not have taken it to the Green-yard.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Willes to Mackland. What did he say when he brought her? - I asked him where he found her, he said, near Queen-street.</p>
               <p>Did he bring to you to take care of? - He brought her to me as a stray</p>
               <p>Then he could not have had the mare again from you? - No, my Lord</p>

In about a quarter of an hour after after, Penny said, will you have a little more grog; I said, I should like a little more, where am I to get it; he hauled a nine gallon keg out of the bed place; I said, Penny, who brought it here, he said, he did, I told him he was the properest person to take it back again; some time after he took it to the hold. After some time, Penny and the stranger went on shore, they were all forward in liquor.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You know what sucking the monkey is. - A. Yes, drinking and carrying nothing away but what is in the belly; I do not believe they did any more.</p>
               <p>GEORGE SEARS. I am a lighterman to Messrs Lucas and Co.</p>
               <p>Q. On the morning of the 6th of May were you on board the Emma - A. I was, between the hours of three and four, I perceived the hatch was off and down in the hold; this vessel was laden with anchors of Hollands gin by the Excise. I immediately went down in the cabin, I found Walsh and Penny was quite drank, and the other was cherry merry. I saw Penny take a keg from the cabin and put it down in the hold. I told Penny he had better come up and put the hatch on; he did, and he assisted in mooring the craft. We unlocked the barge, I then missed two kegs.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before had you seen the kegs safe - A. On Saturday evening, between five and six, I stowed them in tiers. I told Penny that I would not go down with the craft with the kegs deficient, because if I had, I must have been accountable for them, as I took them in; he replied, that he would buy some kegs and fill them with water; I told him I would not. I took a boat and went down to the London docks, and after that I communicated it to Mr. Lucas's foreman. On the 9th of May I went on board again, I handed the keg on shore that Penny took down into the hold from the cabin.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Now I ask you upon your oath, did you taste of the gin on board that lighter - A. I did not, before it was poured out to me in a bason.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the oath you have taken, did not you drink of the liquor that came out of the keg - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Court. You went down in the cabin and drank some with the rest - A. Yes, I never saw any liquor taken from the cask.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Penny. Q. Did not you broach a keg on Saturday afternoon - A. I never broached a keg in my life.</p>
               <p>MR. PEARSON. I am an Excise officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you guage these several casks before they were put on board the Emma - A. I did, that is one of the casks that I guaged, it contained eight gallons and three quarters; I guaged it after it was on shore, it contained seven and a quarter. I looked over the casks I found three deficient; the casks all contained foreign geneva.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You say you guaged the different casks on board the Emma on shore - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Whatever quantity there was put on board; you cannot tell no more than the man in the moon.</p>

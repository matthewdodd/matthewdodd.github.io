               <p>and a threepenny piece by the side of it, and asked for the half-crown—Itold her that that was not the florin that I had given her—she said that itmust be, for that was all the money she had got in the world—my daughtercame in and said "What have you got in your left hand?"—the prisonersaid "Nothing"—my daughter forced her hand open, and there was mygood florin—the prisoner then begged to be forgiven as she had two sickchildren—she said that I might keep the half-crown—I gave her in charge, with the two florins.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 8, Upper Wood-street, Woolwich—at 1 o'clock on Saturday morning, 11th June, I was awoke by my wife, and heard some noise downstairs—I got up, struck a light, and went down—I found the place all in disorder; some coats which were hanging up the night before were displaced—I heard a noise in the kitchen, rushed in, and saw the prisoner coming out—we had a most desperate struggle—I got him down and held him till assistance came; I then gave him in charge—I found several things in the front parlour—the entrance had been effected by the parlour window—it fastened with a catch—he must have shoved that back—the prisoner's hand was bleeding; it must have been cut before he entered the house, because on the window-sill outside the house there</p>

               <p>were marks of blood—I shut up the house about 10 the night before; it was all safe when I went to bed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did I not say that I had been ill-used? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; you said you had been ill-used by some civilians outside the house before you came in.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had he bruises about him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, his eye was discoloured as though he had been ill-used by somebody recently—he said he wanted a lodging before he got into the house, that he met three civilians, who said, "We will give you a lodging," and they pushed him in through the window—I found some things moved in the parlour—there was this quadrant, which had been taken off the sideboard, and a vase, a decanter, and other things, all lying down together in the middle of the room—the bolts of the street-door had been pulled back, and when I ran into the passage he made for the door, and knocked the candle oat of my hand—there was also a letter which had been in this coat-pocket, hanging up the night before, and I found it in the front parlour; it had been taken out of the pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I was corporal on guard on the morning of 11th June, and was called to Mr. McCarthy's house about half-past 1—I found the prisoner in the custody of Mr. McCarthy and his brother-in-law—I found this snuff-box underneath the prisoner's body as he lay in the passage—I took him into custody, and charged him the next day—he appeared to have been drinking, but he was not drunk.</p>

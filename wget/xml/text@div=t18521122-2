                  </hi>. I live at No. 1, St. James's-terrace, Harrow-road, and am a corn and flour factor; I have been carrying on business in London since last June; previous to that I had carried on business at Reading. I know Keene; I knew him when he was in the service of Messrs. Avex and Terry—in July last I saw him at the corn market; he told me be could recommend some good customers, who would buy some flour of me—he said he had left the house of Avex and Terry, and was living on his income, which was between 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I told him to bring no customers but those he knew; he said he would bring me none but the very best—a friend of mine had some transaction with him about some sacks—about 6th Aug. I saw him again in the market—he said he had an excellent customer, a man very trustworthy indeed, who was going to open a shop at 10, Southampton<lb></lb>place, Camberwell, and he wished me to send ten sacks of flour there; he gave me the customer's name, and I wrote it down as he spelt it to me, "William Jerrard"—I have the name here, which I wrote down at the time—I asked him if he was a man of property, and trustworthy; he said, "Yes," he had known him many years, and done business with him, and he had always paid uncommonly well—some few days afterwards I sent the ten sacks of flour by my carman—on 12th Aug. Keene and Jarrett came to my</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185211220006"></xptr>
               <p>house together; Keene introduced Jarrett as his friend, who wanted to buy some oats—he said, "This is my friend Jerrard"—Jarrett then handed me his card—I said, "Why, this is spelt Jarrett?"—Keene replied, "That is right," and said he had made a mistake when he gave me the name of Jerrard—I asked him how he liked the flour—he said he liked the flour in my sacks better than that in the sacks marked "Longford"—I asked him some ques<lb></lb>tions about his business—he said he had a very good business, an excellent shop; the lease previously was worth 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he had got it under peculiar circumstances, and should be able to do a good business, and he should want to buy a larger quantity of flour—Keene and he looked at some samples of oats, and directed me to send in ten quarters—he then said he should be a buyer of a larger quantity of flour, for he had some money, and he might as well lay it out in flour—I told him I should be very glad to sell him some, if he could find the money for it; they then both left—I saw Keene on the market, two or three days afterwards; that was the third time—I asked him what he thought of Jerrard—he said he was a man of plenty of money, and was going to buy some flour, and he had seen him with three 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes the night before, and he was sure he had plenty of money—Jerrard came again two or three days afterwards, with a person, whom he introduced as a neigh<lb></lb>bour and friend, and who I have since learned is named Nicholls—he said he had come to buy fifty sacks of flour, if we could deal—I said I should be very glad to sell him some, or Mr. Nicholls either—Nicholls said he was not a buyer at present, but he should like to buy some hereafter—I sold Jerrard fifty sacks; he asked me what I would allow him for fetching it away—I said I generally did it myself—he said he had a horse and cart—I ultimately consented to allow him fourpence a sack—he said he would pay me for the flour, I think, on Monday week—he said he wanted to buy a considerable quantity, as it would improve by keeping in his shop, as he was only doing a small trade at present—he and Nicholls ultimately left my house together; they afterwards came back again; Nicholls stood at the door and said, "My friend Jerrard left home without money, and as this is to be a money trans<lb></lb>action I will give him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the money for this <hi rend="italic">deal</hi>, and he has promised to pay me when we return home"—I told him no, I was not desirous of receiving the money yet; and Nicholls said it would be inconvenient for him as he was going to pay his millers, and should have to go all the way to Camberwell to receive the money of Jerrard—on the following day, the 24th, I think twenty-five of the sacks were fetched away; the other twenty-five were delivered on the following day—Jerrard came to me, I believe it was on the day after the delivery of the flour, and paid me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that reduced the account to 113<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he gave an order at the same time for twenty quarters of oats, at 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and thirty quarters, at 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said when he had the oats he would pay the balance altogether—some time after that he wrote me a note, in consequence of which I sent half a load of hay; I did not send any straw, because I had none—on my return home that night, my man told me something; in consequence of which I went that same night to Keene's house, in Harriet-place; I think Southampton-street, Camberwell—I found him at home; he said he was just coming up to my house—I asked him what this was that I had heard about Jerrard; that I heard he was gone to gaol, and that Jerrard's wife took in the hay, and she was drunk; that I could not under<lb></lb>stand it—he said she was very much excited about her husband's going to gaol, and that he was gone for being security for a person for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said, "What does Nicholls know about Jerrard?"—he said he would go with me</p>

               <p>to Nicholls; he got into my gig, and we drove up to Nicholls's shop—Keene stepped out of my gig and went into Nicholls's, and then into his bakehouse; he was some time there, and they both came up together—I asked Nicholls how long he had known Jerrard—he said, "About a month"—I said, "I thought you must have known a great deal of him;" that was in Keene's presence—I asked him if he had heard that Jerrard was gone to gaol, and how he came to offer to lend him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he thought he was a respectable man, and he had not known him long—I asked him if he would go with Keene to Jerrard, and get some particulars as to what arrangement he meant to make regarding my debt—he promised me he would go, and with that understanding I left—next day I saw Keene at the market; he said Nicholls had been to Horsemonger-lane and had seen Jerrard, and he brought a note from Jerrard to me—he said the money would be all right, and Jerrard was coming out of gaol next day—he said nothing about what had been done with the flour—I saw Keene once afterwards in Mark-lane, but not since; I asked him where Jerrard was, as he had not been to pay according to promise—he said be expected he would have been with me before, and no doubt he was over at the Elephant public house opposite; he went to look for him, returned, and said he could not find him—I went to look for him at another public house, but never saw him afterwards—on 8th Sept. I went to Jerrard's shop; the place appeared in a general state of confusion; I saw no flour there; there were a few twopenny loaves there—I have traced fifty of my sacks of flour to Nicholls's shop, and the corn and oats to a man named Brown, who is here—when I heard of Jerrard being in gaol, I asked Keene how he came to say he had seen three 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes in his hand—he said it was a mistake, that they were three fives—I was somewhere in the neighbour<lb></lb>hood of Bayswater, and saw Jerrard through a public house window, as I was sitting in my gig; I went into the bar, and he was gone; I went into the back premises; he came out from an outhouse, and I gave him into custody—Keene was taken some time afterwards at Gloucester.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 9, Southampton-place, Camberwell, next door to where the prisoner Jarrett opened a shop about the beginning of Aug. On or about 9th Aug. I saw ten sacks delivered at the shop, and on Friday, 13th Aug., the ten sacks were taken away between 5 and 6 o'clock in the morning—Mr. Keene was present, but I did not notice who else—I noticed the shop during the whole time it remained open—I do not think the oven was lighted more than twice—I recollect seeing some thirty quarters of corn or oats delivered early in Sept.—I rather think it was Thursday, from Mr. Pin<lb></lb>nock's van, it was a large van-full, I suppose about fifty or sixty sacks—two sacks go to a quarter—they did not remain long, they were taken away on 7th Sept. by Mr. Brown's van, the prisoners were present—I cannot say whether they were delivered in Sept., or on the last day of Aug.—I also saw two sacks of flour taken away in a barrow.</p>

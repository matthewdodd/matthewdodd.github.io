On the 18th of April I was in the parlour behind the shop, and saw a person turn out of the shop with something under his arm in a handkerchief - my cousin said to him, "What do you want?" but he made no answer - I looked on the counter, missed half a cheese, and followed the man out; I lost sight of him at the corner of a street - the prisoner was afterwards taken; I cannot speak positively to him -I did not see his face.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.What distance were you from him? A. About twenty-five-yards - I pursued him instantly; I thought it was a joke - we often have false alarms; there were other persons running - there were none running before him; when I gained sight of him again I think there were two men running before me - I did not know the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.There were several persons nearer to him than you when you first pursued him? A. Yes, but I passed them in running - the prisoner was the foremost of all the persons running; I had only a back view of him coming from the shop - he kept running till he was taken; I lost sight of him at a turning - my brother officer got before me there.</p>

            . I am a hoop-header, and live in Caroline-street, Brook-street. I heard an alarm of Stop thief! from a female voice, upwards of one hundred yards from Parker's shop, and found a piece of cheese six or eight yards below my door - it was picked up about half way between Parker's shop and where the prisoner was stopped; the crowd passed in that direction, but on the other side of the way, I presume, I did not see them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.About how many persons did you see altogether running? A.About four or five, I suppose - a neighbour was standing at his door, and some other persons were standing about; I set the cheese on the step of the door, and spoke to my neighbour - I then took it to the prosecutrix.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you told all that occurred from the time the prisoner came in sight? A. I have an<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120052"></xptr>swered every question that has been put to me - when I took the prisoner he was in liquor; he walked very steadily to the watch-house - I did not see him throw any thing away, and do not think he could without my seeing him; there might be eight or ten persons following him.</p>

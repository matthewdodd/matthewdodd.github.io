                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 5, Conway-court, High-street, Marylebone. I had a brother named James Geary—he died there, in his bed, on Thursday, 20th Sept., at ten minutes after three—he was twenty-eight years old, and was a plaisterer—on Saturday night, 18th Aug., five weeks previous to his death, between twelve and one at night, I saw him in charge of the police by the Angel, in High-street—he was lying on his back, with his head hanging over the kerb-stone; sergeant Bushell, the prisoner, had his hand in his neck-handkerchief, and knelt on his chest—I went to his assistance, to get his head up, and he told me to keep out of the way, and keep out of trouble—he got up by some means, and Bushell and sergeant McRaw pushed him against the railings outside the public-house, and Bushell hit him violently twice on the right thigh and arm with his staff—I did not see that McRaw had a staff; but he was on his right side and Bushell on his left, both holding him—as they took him to the station he received a great many blows about his body from both of them with the staff—I saw McRaw beating him after they left the public-house—I said, "Do not kill him, he is going quietly"—the deceased said, "I am going quietly"—he had no weapon, and I did not see him strike them—he was quite sober when I saw him at eleven o'clock—I followed to the station-door—I did not see him again till next morning, when he was in a very bad state, and said he was all pains and aches—he took to his bed all that day—he got up next day to appear before the Magistrate—I went with him—he was discharged—he complained every day when he got up—he remained at home from his work a fortnight, but did not keep his bed—he had been at work the week previous and up to the very day, and was perfectly healthy up to that time—after that fortnight he went to his work about ten days—he used to come home every evening and complain—after the ten days, he took to his bed and</p>

                  </hi>. I am the widow of the deceased, and live at 5, Conway-court. He was a plasterer—his age was twenty-eight—on a Saturday evening or Sunday morning a man told me something, and I found my husband by the Angel, in the hands of the police—he was lying down in the gutter sink—the prisoner was on the top of him, kneeling on his chest—I said, "What is the matter? don't killthefather of my children"—the prisoner said, "Lock up the b—b—h"—a policeman behind me said, "My dear woman, keep out of trouble; you will get locked up with your husband"—he scrambled up somehow from under them, and then they pulled him along, and used great violence—Bushell stood at his right side with a staff in his hand, and beat him with it on the body, on the right shoulder, and under the right ear, as they went along—he was struck all over his body—he had no weapon—it was while they had hold of him on each side, that Bushell was beating him—my husband said he was going quietly, and what were they knocking him about for?—after that, they continued striking him all along as they went—he went to the station, but a constable kept me back, and said if I went to the station-house door I should be locked up—Morris Geary came up, and saw his brother between two policemen, and saw Bushell hit him, and he said, "Sergeant Eden Bushell, if you knock my brother about, I will see you to-morrow for it"—I cannot say how many yards off be was then, but quite close, four or five yards from him—Bushell did not answer, but two policemen laid hold of Morris and took him prisoner—that was quite close to the station, within a very few yards of my stopping back—I got bail, and got my husband out—I saw him at seven o'clock in the morning—he was very much disfigured—there was blood about him—he bled out of the right ear; no, I think it was</p>

               <p>the left—there was a great swelling of the jaw under the left ear—his left arm was bruised from the wrist to the shoulder, his body and both his legs were bruised, as if he had been kicked, and there were black and blue marks all up his side, his loins, ribs, and his chest, on both sides—on the Sunday he kept his bed all day—the first thing, when he came home, I went with him to Mr. O'Flaberty the surgeon, who gave him some lotion—I stayed with him all the while be was there—he took his coat off, and showed the doctor his chest, neck, and arms—he was going to strip, but the doctor did not want it he did not take his trowsers off—he went home, and went to bed—he got up on Monday morning, about eight o'clock, went to the police-court, and was discharged by the Magistrate on the ground of being ill-used so much—he remained at home for a fortnight afterwards, and complained of his body—for the first week he used to get up in the afternoon, but he used to lay in bed in the morning part—(I live on the first floor front, and my sister in the first-floor back)—I am near my confinement—the second week he got up, but not before eight in the morning—he walked about, but he was not in his usual health—at the end of the fortnight he went to work, as his master did not wish him to lose it—he worked at Mr. Rice's, or Fry's, over the Great Western Railway—after ten days, he came home ill, and took to his bed—on the Friday morning when he got up, and when he was going to work that day, he complained of being very bad—I wanted him to stop at home, but he went to his work—at half-past five I was fetched home from my work to him at eight, and found him in bed complaining of his body—he never left his bed, but died on the 26th, five days after—he continually complained of his body all over, not of any particular parts—he had not caught cold, that I know of—he wished me to fetch the doctor when I went home, and I fetched Mr. O'Flaherty—on the night this happened I had seen him a few minutes to twelve o'clock, he was sober then—during the ten days he was at work he was not out on any evening that I was not with him, because he was not well—prior to these injuries, I never knew him to be in bad health—during the seven years we had been married he never drank anything but beer hardly, and very little—I have four children.</p>

On this night I saw him at the corner of Wigmore-street, in the hands of two policemen—they had him at each side by the neck-handkerchief—they were continually striking and ill-using him with their truncheons, and punching him in the ribs with the points of their staves—this was not near the Angel—I said, "Mr. Bushell, if you ill-use my brother in the way you are, I will report you for it on Monday"—he instantly turned round to a private, who was standing behind him, and said, "Blixton," or "Broxton, take that b—"—I was then taken and collared by my handkerchief—I took it off—I did not see my brother struggling or resisting in the least—I was taken to the station on a charge of intending to excite a mob to rescue, the police gave evidence against me, and the Magistrate fined me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—a great many people were about, crying "Shame!"—I should think thirty, but I was looking at the police ill-using my brother—I was taken close by the station—at the station door the prisoner turned my brother's face towards him and gave him a severe blow under the eye with his fist—I knew the prisoner before, and had heard of his ill-treating people—my brother had given evidence against him.</p>

On 18th Aug., about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, the deceased came to me, with his wife—he complained of having been beaten by the police—he had his right arm in a sling, and complained of having been bruised and beaten—I examined him, and found his right arm bruised from the wrist to the shoulder—he was also bruised on the right side of the neck, from the top of the shoulder to the lower jaw—he had also a bruise on the right side of his face, which gave him a black eye; and there was a drop of coagulated blood, if I remember rightly, in the hollow of his right ear—the ear was not bruised particularly—the man was of a dusky complexion, so that I could not judge—there was no black mark—the blow on the side of his neck and the side of his face might have occasioned the blood I saw in the ear.</p>

               <p>questions I put to him, I did not think it neccssary to examine those parts—the bruises on the right arm and right side were repeated bruises, rather of a severe character—the blows on the side of his neck did not appear to be so numerous as those on his right arm—on the Sunday evening his wife came to me for a certificate to present to the Magistrate, which I gave—the blow under the ear was dangerous in this respect, that it was inflicted in a very dangerous locality; but the severity of the blows I do not consider greater than those which were inflicted on his arm, in point of the force used to give them—the injuries I observed were such as to incapacitate him from following his work for some days—I gave him an opiate lotion; told him to go home and keep quiet, and to send me wlord if he got no better—I did not see him again until 20th Sept.—I then saw him in bed at his own house, 5, Con way-court—he then complained of a severe pain of the lower angle of the left <hi rend="italic">scapula,</hi> or blade-bone, and that the pain was increased by breathing—he was feverish—he complained, if I remember rightly, of headache, and of the general symp<lb></lb>toms attending fever, or an acute attack of illness—he complained of pain at his chest on coughing—I inquired whether he had a cough; I do not remember hearing him cough; I dare say I did not before I asked that question; I did while attending him—I attended him from 20th Sept. till he died, on the 26th; during that time I heard him cough—I examined his chest, and found symptoms of inflammation of the <hi rend="italic">pleura,</hi> or investing mem<lb></lb>brane of the lungs on the left side—I ordered remedies—I inquired of him his other symptoms, and the conclusion I came to, from the examination I made, and from the answers I received to my questions, was, that he had pleurisy of the left side—there was only one symptom absent, namely, spitting of blood, and next morning (the 21st) that also appeared—I did not make any particular examination of his chest or arm on the 20th—I saw no bruises on his body that day; I did not direct my attention to them, nor did I afterwards—the examination I made of his chest was by means of my ear, to ascertain his breathing—I visited him next day; he then complained that the symptoms were rather aggravated—I then bled him, and he was relieved of the pain in his left side—about two days afterwards he complained of pain of the right side—I then re-bled him, and he was partially relieved—I bled him on each occasion with a lancet on the arm; and he also had leeches on the right side, and a blister—I continued to see him day by day, sometimes twice a day—he died on the morning of the 26th Sept.—I did not see him that day, for I had word sent me that he had died early in the morning—I made an examination of the body forty-eight hours after death—my uncle, who is an apothecary, and a friend of mine, an unprofessional man, were present; they are not here—I found the body exceedingly decomposed, so much so as to prevent ray observing any external bruises if there were any—I opened the chest, and found symptoms of inflammation of the <hi rend="italic">pleura</hi> of the left lung—the cavity of the chest was filled with water, which is one of the evidences; and there were bands of fibrous lymph, which bound the surface of the lung to the internal side of the cavity of the thorax, which was another evidence—the <hi rend="italic">pleura</hi> of the right lung was also inflamed, not to the same extent—that examination of the chest satisfied me as to the cause of death—I did not examine the head; I examined the ribs, to ascertain whether any of them had been broken, or whether a point of any broken bone, which often occurs, had penetrated into the chest, and thereby wounded the <hi rend="italic">pleura,</hi> and occa<lb></lb>sioned the pleurisy; but that I found not to be the case—the immediate cause of death was inflammation of the <hi rend="italic">pleura</hi>—I have heard the evidence to-day as regards the violence he is alleged to have received—supposing it to</p>

               <p>be correct, I do not think that it could have been the direct cause of the inflammation I saw; it might have been the indirect cause—I mean that if he had lain up in bed from the beating he received, and afterwards gone out into the cold and worked, and caught cold, that might have induced pleurisy—I think if be had never gone out at all he might have survived.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose a person were thrown violently to the ground on his face, and then whilst on the ground, a man of the size of the prisoner knelt on his chest and stomach with violence, might that produce the inflammation you saw, coupled with other injuries? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think if such violence as that were used some of the ribs would be fractured before the inflammation could result—I believe the inflammation to have been the result of cold—I am of opinion that the injuries he is said to have received bad nothing directly to do with his death—they might have induced a certain condition of body which would render him more susceptible of cold—such injuries have a depressing effect on the general system.</p>
               <p>The <hi rend="smallCaps">RECORDER</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">was not aware of any authority for saying that the mere fact of a person being rendered more susceptible to disease, was sufficient to render a party criminally responsible, if something supervened which caused death.</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">had no direct authority to offer to that effect, but he urged that a blow, which in any way accelerated death, would render the party inflicting it responsible to a charge of manslaughter; and if a party received a wound which would not be mortal, but from the nature of his avocations, as in the case of a sailor exposed to the severity of the weather, gangrene was produced, and death resulted from that, that would be murder or manslaughter as the case might be.</hi> The <hi rend="smallCaps">RECORDER</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">had no doubt that if the blow accelerated the death (referring to a passage from Lord Hale) that would be sufficient, but that in his opinion differed from the present case; however at</hi>

On Sunday night, 18th Aug., between a quarter and half-past one o'clock, I was on duty in High-street, Manchester-square, and heard cries of distress—I concluded from the voice that they came from Bushell—I have known him about eight months—I hastened to the spot, got some distance from Thayer-street, near the Angel, and saw Bushell, M'Raw, and the deceased, struggling on the ground together—the deceased was trying all he could to keep them down, and to get on top of them—he was kicking and struggling—he had the advantage at that time—he had one hand in Bushell's neck, and with the other he had got hold of M'Raw in a similar way, and was kicking at both as violently as possible—the two females were there, trying as much as possible to excite the deceased to further violence—they surrounded him, and said, "<hi rend="italic">Jim,</hi> kill the b——s if you can; give it to them"—they both said so—I assisted in clearing back the two females and an oldish man who was there, for the sergeants to get up—they got up—the deceased got very violent, kicking the sergeants, and trying to throw them up—he caught hold of them, one with each hand—Bushell drew his staff, and told him if he did not go quietly he should use it—M'Raw asked for a staff, as he would not let go of his collar—I gave him mine, and he struck the deceased across the right arm, which loosened his hold—they walked on towards Tbayer-street, where we met the deceased's brother, Morris, who sprang at Sergeant Bushell, and took him by the collar—when the decased saw that, he said, "Now no two b——y policemen shall take me to the station, and I don't care a b——r for the best man in the police"—I pushed Morris away—Bushell's collar was torn quite away—we proceeded towards the station till we got to the corner of Wentworth-street,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185010210107"></xptr>
               <p>where another violent straggle took place and Morris sprang upon Sergeant Bushell again, and said, "You b——r Bushell, you shall suffer for this another day"—I took him by the collar, and took him into custody—the women left after they saw I had got Morris in custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did Bushell strike the deceased at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not once; he threatened to, if he did not go quietly—I made the charge against the deceased at the station for trying to rescue, and assaulting me—he was fined 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not strike him—M'Raw did once—I swear it was not more than three times—nobody else struck him—I did not give evidence at the in<lb></lb>quest; I was not called on, no witnesses were called for the defence—I would answer that Bushell is incapable of causing the death of the deceased—no rattle was sprung during the whole time—I had a rattle—after I came up, other assistance came—I cannot say how many police there were—the mob did not cry "Shame!" or anything of the kind—there was no mob—I did not hear Mrs. Geary say, "Do not beat my husband t spare the father of my children!"—there were only two females, an old man, and one or two lads, as there generally are in that neighbourhood; when we got to the station there was not one with us, they had all left us—his wife and sister incited him on, but they did not implore us not to beat him—I had a job to keep the women back; they tried all they could to close in upon the sergeant—they did not cry "Shame!" quite the other way, they were inciting him—I have been in the police nearly two years—I charged Morris with being drunk and attempting to rescue.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, D</hi> 60). On the morning of 18th Aug., I was on reserve duty at Marylebone-lane—the deceased and his brother were brought there about half-past one o'clock by Bushell and M'Raw—I assisted Loxton and a man named Phillips in taking them down and locking them up—the deceased was drunk and very violent—it took two constables to get him downstairs—the sergeants appeared very much exhausted—I visited the pri<lb></lb>soners four times during the night—they were both drunk—they laid down and went to sleep—they did not make the slightest complaint.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, D</hi> 111). I assisted my brother constable in taking the deceased to the cell—he was very violent; he resisted, pulled himself against the banisters, and kicked and plunged about—I have known him two years—I saw him outside the Grapes, Duke-street, Manchester-square, on Sunday night, 25th Ang., about half-past eleven o'clock, with his brother, four or five women, and a man or two, standing in the middle of the pavement, quarrelling—I spoke to them, and recommended them to go away—I passed them, and was returning down my beat on the other side—I went across to them, and they dispersed—they were all going into the public-house—just as the deceased was entering, he turned round, shook his fist, and used violent language—I saw him again about half-past two o'clock, coming out of Gray's-buildings, just opposite the public-house—there were several people about him—I just got up as the sergeant had dispersed them—the deceased was just going into Duke-street, towards his home—he had some blood on his mouth, whether it came from his mouth or nose I cannot tell.</p>

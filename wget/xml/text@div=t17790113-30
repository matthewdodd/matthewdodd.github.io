I had notice from my client, that no such note or letter had come to hand, I read Mr. French's letter in the presence of the prisoner and two others of my clerks. On receiving the letter from Mr. French, I told my clerks I was sure the letter had not gone fairly out of the office, that I suspected one of them, and if any one of them would confess taking the letter, and let me have the letter again, it should go no farther; none of them would confess it; upon which I took them to the Rotation-office, and they were examined. I went to the Bank, and found the note indorsed,

I took the prisoner on the 1st of January, after he had absented himself from my service nine days; he then showed great concern, and desired to speak to me in private, which I refused to do. I charged him with stealing the letter and taking the 20 l. note out of it, and he offered to give me a note for the 20 l. I refused, and ordered him to be taken to the Rotation-office. On the Thursday before he absented himself, he desired me to settle his accounts. I was going out in a hurry to settle some deeds. I said I would when I came back; when I returned, he was gone. I saw no more of him till I took him on the 1st of January; he had absented himself previous to this, from the 10th till Monday the 14th, under pretence of having cut his thumb; that was before I knew that the note was lost.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>This conversation about giving of a twenty pound note was on the 1st of January? - Yes.</p>

               <p>You took him in his own lodging? - Not in his own lodging; when we went after him, he fled into a two-pair-of-stairs room, where he never was before.</p>
               <p>There is a door out of the office into the street without going into the house? - Yes; there are two doors to the office, one into the street and the other into the dwelling-house; but my orders are that the door into the street shall always be kept shut when they go out of the office; and I believe they were complied with.</p>

               <p>I am clerk to Mr. Frost. About the 5th of December last Mr. Frost wrote a letter to a Mr. French, and threw it down upon my desk and desired some of us, meaning the clerks, to put it in the post.</p>
               <p>How many clerks were in the office then? - Three of us. Some time after, wanting to go to dinner, I desired Mr. Bonney, the youngest clerk, to take the letter to the Post-office; he desired I would take it; I told him I should not, and desired he would take it, as he had taken a copy of the bill which I believed was in that letter; I left the letter and went out; the prisoner was then present. Mr. Frost gave Mr. Bonney the bill to copy; the prisoner examined the bill with Mr. Bonney; I was present at the time. When I left the office, the letter was lying on my desk; the prisoner was standing by the fire, and Mr. Bonney was at his desk. I did not return till the Monday following.</p>
               <p>Was you there when Mr. Frost came into the office and gave the intimation that the bill was missing? - I was.</p>
               <p>What did Mr. Frost say on that occasion? - He came in, and told us it was a very serious matter, that somebody must have taken the letter, meaning, I imagine, one of us; he said that if either of us would acknowledge that we had the note or the letter, that he would really forgive it, and take no farther notice of it.</p>
               <p>The note or the letter, was it both? - Either.</p>
               <p>None of you did acknowledge it at that time? - No; we were all taken that evening to the Rotation-office, and examined; when Mr. Frost again repeated, that he would forgive the person who had taken the note or letter, provided it was either of us. We all denied knowing any thing of the matter.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the day of the month when this promise was made, and you were taken to the Rotation-office? - I cannot exactly remember the day of the month.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner continue in the office till you had notice that the letter was missing or miscarried? - Yes; all the time; he was absent, after the letter was missing, from Thursday to Monday. I do not know the day of the week; he was taken upon the first of January; I was present when he was taken; Mr. Frost charged him with taking the note that had been missing; he said he hoped he did not intend to charge him solely with it; he said he certainly should, for he had received the money; then he wanted to speak with Mr. Frost in private, and said that he would give him a twenty pound note.</p>
               <p>Did he do that of himself, without any promise or threat whatever? - He did.</p>
               <p>Did he intimate what the twenty pound note was to be given for? - He said he would give him a note for twenty pounds; he wanted to speak with him in private, but Mr. Frost refused it. We had received a letter on Wednesday from an acquaintance of Mr. French, informing us, that Mr. French had not received the letter. Mr. Mollineaux came in the evening, I think, of the Wednesday, before Mr. Frost came home, and told us he was surprised to find Mr. French<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177901130031"></xptr> had not received the letter and the twenty pounds. Just as Mollineaux was going out, I said it was very surprising what was become of the note, somebody must have it; it would come out; the prisoner said, do not acquaint Mr. Frost with it now, stay till another time; I said why not?</p>
               <p>What time in the evening was this? - I believe it might be about six or seven; our candles were lighted at the time. When Mr. Frost came home, I was going to tell him; he turned away and met Mr. Bonney, the young clerk, who informed him of it.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You knew in the office that this note was missing before you saw Mr. Mollineaux? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then it was no secret in the office, Mr. Frost knew of it before? - Yes; but he was not acquainted with the contents of Mr. Mollineaux's letter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Frost knew that the letter was missing before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Frost. I knew of it on the Monday, this was on the Wednesday.</p>

               <p>How long after did Mr. Frost leave the letter? - About a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Did you carry the letter? - No; it lay some time on the desk where Mr. Frost put it. Mr. Williams was going to dinner, the prisoner was standing by the fire; Mr. Williams and I had some words about taking it as he was going out.</p>
               <p>Did Williams give any reason why he would have you take the letter more than any of the other clerks? - Yes; because I had taken a copy of it.</p>
               <p>Was that in the hearing of the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did Williams go away? - Yes; and left the letter behind him.</p>
               <p>Did you take it? - No; the prisoner and I went into another room to look for a book; when I went out of the office, I locked the door that opens into the street.</p>
               <p>You left the letter in the office? - I am not certain whether it was there then, it was there when Williams went from the office; after we had been looking in a room or two, we returned into the office and the prisoner took his hat and we went out again and went up stairs; the door was then locked; we could not find the book; I let him out at the street door into Charlotte-street, then I returned into the office.</p>
               <p>Did you see the letter, or do you know whether it was in the office at that time? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see the letter again? - No; I sat down and wrote some time; the letter came into my mind I looked on the desk it was not there; I searched a little time, but could not find it.</p>
               <p>Is it usual to be so careful to lock the office every time you go out into any room in the house? - I always do if there is nobody in the office.</p>
               <p>There is a door out of the office into the street, and a door into the house? - Yes. When the prisoner returned from dinner, I asked him if he had taken it to the post; he said, as I understood, that he had taken it and given it to James, Mr. Frost's servant, he seemed to laugh at me for thinking it was not safe.</p>
               <p>Did you think it was not safe, by asking after it? - I thought it was safe when he told me he had taken it. On the 10th of the same month he went out about twelve o'clock, and never returned till the Monday following.</p>
               <p>What day of the week was the 10th? - Thursday; Monday was the 14th. Mr. Frost came to town on the Monday morning; we received a letter for him on the Saturday before, from Mr. French.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177901130032"></xptr>Did he tell you that he had received a letter from Mr. French? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was the letter, that was intended to be sent, directed to Mr. French? - Yes; here is a copy of the direction, I took it at the time (producing it with the copy of the note)</p>
               <p>( The note and copy were both read in court.)</p>
               <p>There is written at the bottom of the copy of the note, inclosed in a letter to Mr.

            , Tatonhall, Wolverhampton, in Staffordshire; there are the initials of my name to the copy.</p>
               <p>What did Mr. Frost say to you when he found Mr. French, had not received the letter? - What he said was after Mr. Mollineaux came, I believe.</p>
               <p>Was you in the office when Mr. Mollineaux came? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where was your master? - Gone out. I went out just as Mr. Mollineaux went out; when I returned I met Mr. Frost as I came in, and told him what Mr. Mollineaux had said. The first time I spoke to the prisoner about it was before Mr. Mollineaux came. When I found that the letter did not go safe, I asked him if he did not give the letter to James; he said no, he did not; that he said perhaps James might take it; I told him I thought he said that he had given it to James. I was not certain what he had said to me; I was doubtful.</p>
               <p>You doubted whether he had said perhaps James might take it, or whether he said he had taken it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you think now he said James had taken it? - Yes. Upon Tuesday the 22d of December Mr. Frost came into the office, and told us it must lay amongst us, it must be one of us that had taken the note, and that if either of us would confess it, and give him the letter, he would forgive the note.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that was his expression? - Yes, my lord, I am pretty certain of it.</p>
               <p>What reason did he give you, or did he give you any, why he was anxious to have the letter? - He said there was something private in it, that he would not wish any one to know but Mr. French and himself.</p>
               <p>Then you were carried before the justice of peace? - Yes; we were all examined there.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner continue in the office all the time after that? - No; the next day he was very anxious to see Mr. Frost, to settle his accounts; that was the 23d, I believe, between ten and twelve in the morning.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Frost settle his accounts? - No; Mr. Frost was going out about a good deal of business; he told him he could not do it then, he would when he returned.</p>
               <p>Did he stay till Mr. Frost came home? - No; he said he was going out and would return again; he went out and presently returned; then he said he was going home to dinner, and went away but never returned again.</p>
               <p>You never saw him afterwards till he was taken up? - No.</p>
               <p>Was you present when he was taken up? - No; I saw him at the Rotation-office.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>At the time the prisoner was absent from the 10th to the 14th, Mr. Frost himself was out of town, was he not? - No; he went out of town on the Saturday, and returned on the Monday.</p>
               <p>Do you remember his saying that the reason why he could not come was because he had cut his thumb? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You say that you thought at first he said that he had given the letter to James; when he said he did not say so, but that perhaps James took it, you doubted which was the expression? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did he give any reason why he wanted his accounts settled? - He said he was going to see his sister in Hampshire.</p>
               <p>You did not see the Bank note put in the letter? - No.</p>

               <p>Did you ever receive a letter, or take a letter from the office? - No.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with the prisoner, about any letter being taken out of the office? - No.</p>
               <p>That is all you know about it I suppose? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Frost. There is another note which has not been mentioned, which the constable took out of his pocket, which is another<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177901130033"></xptr> 20 l. note, which I lost from a drawer, marked with the letter N in my office, where I usually keep these notes; I gave that note to the prisoner the latter end of August, or beginning of September to receive; the woman that drew it desired me to wait a little while. After the time was expired, I gave it to the prisoner to present to the Board of Green Cloth; he returned it to me again, and to the best of my rememberance I put it in the drawer. When he was absconded, I looked in the drawer for the note, and missed it, and said, that he had taken that as well as the Bank note.</p>
               <p>You said you gave it to him first to receive; that an excuse was made desiring you to wait a particular time, and he then gave it you again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You gave it him a second time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you think he gave it you again and you put it in the drawer? - Yes; I think I asked him for it and he gave it me, and I put it in the drawer.</p>
               <p>And the moment he absconded, you looked in the drawer where you expected to find it, and it was gone? - Yes; and I went immediately into the office, and said he had got the note of Mrs. Carter's too with him.</p>
               <p>(The note was read in court, and answered the description given of it in the indictment.)</p>
               <p>Was that drawer locked or open? - Open.</p>
               <p>Court. Why did you do those things, it is a great temptation? - I would not have kept him in my office, if I had not thought him honest.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. I took the prisoner, and searched him by the order of the magistrate. When we went to search him, he objected to it, and strove very much against it; but when he found that he was rather overpowered he clapped his hand in his left hand breeches pocket and pulled a paper out of it, it was immediately observed, and twitched out of his fingers.</p>
               <p>He did not deliver it to you? - No; it was taken by force out of his fingers.</p>
               <p>Do you know what it was? - It was delivered into Mr. Frost's hands; I saw it opened.</p>
               <p>Should you know it again? - No.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Frost. Is that the paper that was delivered into your hand? - Yes; it was delivered to me immediately.</p>
               <p>How long was it from the time the bill was returned unpaid the second time before he absented himself? - I think it was returned the second time in November. I did not look after that note till he was absconded. I had given her time, and the Board of Green Cloth had given her time the second time.</p>
               <p>Was the time they had given her expired? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Were there other letters besides this left that night to go by the post? - Not one.</p>

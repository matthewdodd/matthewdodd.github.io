Check, whom I knew before, came to my shop on the 20th of April, with a bundle of wood in his hand, which he offered for sale, at 4 s. a hundred; I said I did not want any - he then offered me some smaller wood, but I did not have any; he asked for some tobacco, but I had not got the sort he wanted; he then went away, and I went into an adjoining room; in about two minutes I heard somebody in the shop, and saw him going out at the door; I came into the shop again, when he turned back, and asked for a quarter of an ounce of returns tobacco; I said, "What business have you in the shop - you have stolen something:" he said he had not. I went to the door, and saw my soap laying at the door; I cried Stop thief! he took his coat under his arm, and ran, and cried Stop thief! too; he was stopped by some working people. The soap had come in that morning, and was laying by the counter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Moser and Co., ironmongers, in High-street, Borough. This order for some spades and shovels was brought to our house, I believe, by the prisoner—I gave instructions to our porter to deliver the goods—they were looked up, and an invoice made out.</p>

                  </hi>. The last witness gave me instructions to make up these goods, which I did—I came down to ask him who they were for, and I met the prisoner in the shop—I said, "Who are these for?"—Mr. Godson said, "They are for Harding"—I said to the prisoner, "Are you Harding's man?"—he said, "Yes"—I asked him how it was that Mr. Harding sent to our place for them, as he generally had them from the country—he said they had got a customer waiting for them, and would I lend him a truck to carry them, which I did—the truck came back the same afternoon.</p>

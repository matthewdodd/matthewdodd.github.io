                  </hi>. I have been working as a cooper, lodging at Greenwich, for six or eight weeks—the prisoner had lodged there three or four weeks. On 6th Aug. I went home to tea—I saw the boy—I said, "Have you found anything?"—he abused me with very bad language—he then struck me with something sharp, and stamped on my leg, and broke it twice—he had a knife in his hand—I became senseless—I have been lame ever since—I came out last Monday, for the first time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, living at the same house. I was sent for, and found the prosecutor lying down—he was sober—his leg was broken—the prisoner ran away—I had seen the prosecutor that morning, but not since.</p>

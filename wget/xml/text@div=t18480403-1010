                  </hi> I am a tide-waiter in the Customs. On 14th March I was on board the <hi rend="italic">Clarissa</hi>, in the London Docks—some wheat was un<lb></lb>shiped from that vessel into a barge alongside, belonging to Mr. Groves—the work was finished about four o'clock—the batches were put on and a tar<lb></lb>pauling over—neither of the prisoners assisted in the loading—about fire my attention was called, and I saw the prisoners at the stern end of the barge, with one of the hatches and the tarpauling off—they were filling bags and examining the quality of the corn—I looked at them for a while, and the bags being very large and marked differently, I went and asked what they were doing—Mellish said, "Getting a sample"—I asked for whom—he said, "For the merchant"—I asked who was the merchant—he said, "Mr. Groves"—I knew Mr. Groves to be a lighterman, and not a merchant, and his name was not on the bags—they filled the bags, and placed the hatches and tarpauling on as before—each of them took a bag, and was carrying them forward from the further end of the barge—one of the bags was lowered into a lug-boat that was lying alongside—I then told them that they should not take it without an order—Mellish said, "Very well," he would leave it till to-morrow, and would bring the order—I said to the captain, who was stand<lb></lb>ing on the deck, "These men are evidently stealing this wheat; what shall we do with them?"—he said, "Do as you like; I shall have nothing at all to do with them"—we then allowed them to <hi rend="italic">start</hi> it back again into the balk—I sent for the police, and they were taken into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where had the vessel come from? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Odessa—I do not know the prisoners—I had been in the vessel fifteen or sixteen days previously—I cannot say how many persons had come with bags to take samples during that time—parties sometimes bring orders and some<lb></lb>times not—I hesitated very much before I gave them into custody—the cap<lb></lb>tain did not say they had only come to sample the corn—I allowed them to put the wheat back.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Thames policeman</hi>, 73.) On the afternoon of 14th March I was called on board the <hi rend="italic">Clarissa</hi>, and found the two prisoners there—Howell charged them with the unlawful possession of one and a half bushels of wheat—I asked Mellish whether he had an order for any samples out of the vessel, and who authorised him to go on board the barge and take them—he said, "No one"—I said, "Where is the bag you had the grain in?"—he said, "I have not got it"—I searched him, and found this sample-bag under his jacket—he said, "It is my <hi rend="italic">grub</hi>-bag"—I said, "Where is your bag of samples?"—he said, "I have no bag"—I searched, and found it under the old sheet of the barge, and this other one that Saunders had—I took them to the station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> These are sample-bags, are they not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; for oats, but not for wheat—wheat sample-bags are not quite so large—Mr. Howell was present when Mellish denied having the bags—one of Mr. Groves' lighters was lying alongside, and a lug-boat of Phillips and Co.—then, prisoners had no business in that boat—it must have been cast adrift off the quay.</p>

                  </hi> I am a master mariner, in partnership with my two sons. On 14th March, we had a barge lying alongside the <hi rend="italic">Clarissa</hi>, to be filled with wheat—the prisoners are not in our employment—I know Saun<lb></lb>ders by sight—we had not given them orders to get any samples out of the barge—no one would have a right to open the hatches, and get a sample out without authority from us—I do not know these bags—they are much larger than we send for samples of wheat—this small one is the proper size, and holds about four quarters—the large ones hold nearly a bushel—if they were filled they would hold about one and a half bushels—it would be worth 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

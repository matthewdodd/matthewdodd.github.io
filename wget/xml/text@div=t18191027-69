I stood near the end of the table, and in about a quarter of an hour I felt a sudden grasp and pressure at my coat-pocket - I immediately felt, and missed my pocket-book - my coat was cut. The crowd being very great, I ran down to the street-door, got the porter, Bloss, to lock it, and then got a constable. I went up to the room, as I went up stairs I met Haltom, who delivered me my pocket-book, with the money in it. I saw the prisoner in the room; a penknife was found on him. The book was also cut in cutting the pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When you was at Hatton-garden, did you not instruct Bloss what to say - A. I believe I corrected him in a statement about myself. He said I ran up stairs with him, I was rather behind. I gave him a shilling for his time.</p>

            . I am a porter at auctions. Mr. Jones came to me, I left him at the door, and went up to the auction room - the prisoner was standing against the folding doors. I saw him shuffling his hands about behind him, and kept my eye on him while the officer was sent for. I saw him draw a pocket-book from behind his coat, and throw it behind the door. Haltom picked it up, and took it down to Mr. Jones.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You said at the office you saw the book in my hand - A. Yes, I saw him throw it from behind him. He was laid hold of immediately.</p>

I saw the prisoner coming down the stairs, but the door being shut, he returned. I had made it known in the room that the robbery had been committed; he came back, and stood against the folding doors. I kept my eye on him - he moved. I said to myself, perhaps he has dropped the book. I looked, picked it up from behind the door, and gave it the prosecutor. A penknife was found on him.</p>

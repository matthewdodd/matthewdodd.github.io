               <p>On the 24th of July, while I was standing at my door, between nine and ten o'clock at night the prisoner came and asked me if I knew which was one Mealing's. Seeing something stick out under her cloak, I turned her cloak aside, and saw a silver pint mug under it. I secured it and her. She was next day carried before a magistrate. She said she found the mug. Upon enquiry I found that the mug belonged to Mr. Street.</p>
               <p>(The mug was produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

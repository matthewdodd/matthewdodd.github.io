            . I am a constable. On the 2d of March I was walking past Mr. Gedge's door, I perceived the prisoner come out of his door, he had something under his apron, I walked after him about forty yards; I asked him what he had got under his apron, he said nothing; I insisted upon seeing whether he had or not, he lifted his apron up; I perceived that he had got this ham concealed in his breeches; I took the ham from his breeches, and took him back to Mr. Gedge's warehouse, I asked Mr. Gedge if he knew any thing of this man, he said, yes, he worked for him some time. This is the ham.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is my ham.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The man is not here that took the ham from me, it was taken by one Thompson, it was not taken from me by Wesley; a man gave it me at the corner of Pudding-lane. It was through the instigation of Thompson that that ham was given to me.</p>
               <p>Wesley. I saw him come out of the house, Thompson had nothing to do with him first nor last.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Green-street, Stepney, Mile-end, Old Town. On the 4th of June last, about half-past one o'clock, the prisoner came to my house—Mr. Hobson, the bookseller, and Mrs. Belaney, the lady who afterwards died at my house, were with him—they agreed to take of me the front and back parlour of the house for one week certain—they came in at half-past four the same afternoon—Mr. Belaney took a rump-steak by him<lb></lb>self—he dined by himself—Mrs. Belaney did not take any dinner that day—after that they took tea at my house—Captain Clark and Mr. Hobson re<lb></lb>mained there with them—they brought in a bottle of port wine and a bottle of whisky—after that they went to the play—Captain Clark and Mr. Hob<lb></lb>son were there during the evening after dinner—they did not accompany them to the theatre—they went away before—they live in my neighbourhood—Mr. and Mrs. Belaney returned home at a little after twelve that night—Mrs. Belaney appeared very well then—a little after seven on the following morn<lb></lb>ing (Wednesday) the prisoner desired a black draught to be fetched—my ser<lb></lb>vant fetched it—shortly after that I heard that Mrs. Belaney was sick—I was in the kitchen when I heard that—she was sick several times during the day—she did not get up at all that day—I saw her between ten and eleven that night—she was then on the couch in the front parlour—she appeared poorly—the prisoner went out more than once, in the forenoon, afternoon, and even<lb></lb>ing—he was out all the afternoon—in the course of the evening Captain Clark called—Mrs. M'Eachern, Captain Clark's daughter, also called in the evening—they were with Mrs. Belaney—after ten at night she went from the bed-room into the front parlour, when Mrs. M'Eachern and Captain Clark were gone home—the back parlour is a bed-room—I did not see her on the Thursday—they took breakfast and she went out early with the prisoner—they were out till five in the afternoon—I did not see her that evening—they had half a pound of ready dressed ham with their tea when they came home—Captain Clark spent the evening with them alone, and he went out in the evening with the prisoner and purchased some pickled salmon—they came back and supped there—there was a pianoforte in the room—I did not hear it played—on Friday morning they arose about the usual time—they breakfasted at home, and went out about ten—I saw Mrs. Belaney just as she was going out—that was all, not to speak to her—I heard no complaint about her health—she told me on Wednesday night that she was much better, that she was only fatigued from travelling—they came back between one and two, in the middle of the day on Friday—I did not see her then—they remained at home about half an hour—they then went out again and returned about half-past nine at night—I saw her through the door after she returned, not to speak to her—she was sitting at the end of the table in the front parlour, and Mr. Belaney was lying on the couch—she appeared, as far as I could judge, in good health—they retired to bed shortly after—they took no supper—just before seven o'clock, on Saturday morning, I heard them conversing in their bed-room—I heard Mrs. Belaney's voice in the bed-room,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184408190016"></xptr>
               <p>but I could not distinguish what she said, and Mr. Belaney's also—at about a quarter or twenty minutes to eight I was called to the room by the prisoner—he said, "Mistress, mistress, come up here, my wife is very ill"—I went up immediately—the prisoner was then at the bed-room door, which was open—my servant and I both entered at once—the foot of the bed comes to the right hand as you go in, a chest of drawers stands on the left hand, and behind the drawers are folding doors, that open into the sitting-room—when you pass the foot of the bed and turn to the right to go up to the side of it, there is a washhand-stand in a recess facing you, the recess is between the chimney and the window—there is a small table and chair near the head of bed on that side—when I and the servant went in I saw Mrs. Belaney lying on the bed—the bed-clothes were all thrown up against the wall—she had no cap on, nothing but her sleeping gown—I said when I entered the room, "She is very bad indeed, sir," and I immediately went to the head of the bed—she was lying quite motionless—she only breathed from her chest—her eyes were shut, and her teeth appeared closed—she was foam<lb></lb>ing a good deal from the mouth, and with it some fine biscuit, chewed biscuit—I went up to the head of the bed, raised her up, placed her head on my shoulder, and supported her with my arm—the prisoner was standing close beside me, between me and the fire-place—I said, "She is bad indeed, I have seen many fits—I have seen my dear girls in fits before this, but I never saw fits like this"—the prisoner answered that she had had fits—I asked if she had been subject to fits—he said she had had fits before, but not like them, she would not come out of it—I said, "What do you mean, will she not come to?"—I said, "Do something, sir, do some<lb></lb>thing"—he did not answer, and I said, "Do something, pray do something, send for a doctor, pray send for a doctor"—he said, "I am a doctor myself, I should have let blood before, but she has no pulse"—he had a lancet in his hand, but before that I had sent my servant down for the foot-pail with hot water, and she then came into the room with it—I said, "I do not care, sir, if you are a doctor; two heads are better than one; send for a doctor, send for your friends, send for Captain Clark and Mrs. M'Eachern, send for somebody"—he said, "Send for them"—I sent the girl immediately—before the girl was sent, he said, "She will not come to, this is an affection of the heart; her mother died like this nine months ago"—I put my hand on her heart to feel—I could not feel it beat at all—the only sign of life she exhi<lb></lb>bited was a convulsion from here (the chest)—the throat was drawn towards the mouth—(<hi rend="italic">describing it</hi>)—her mouth was closed—the phlegm appeared to have a trouble to come—it came all over my face two or three times—in the force of coming it splashed all over my face by this convulsion—Captain Clark lives seventeen doors off—the girl returned alone—Mrs. M'Eachern was not up—the girl was followed soon after by Mrs. M'Eachern—while the girl was gone, I was still holding the deceased, and kept urging the prisoner to do something—I put my hand on her stomach, and told him I thought it very much swollen, and he then told me she was pregnant—the girl and the prisoner put her feet in warm water—he assisted in doing that—after the girl returned, I desired some vinegar and water to be fetched—she brought it up directly—the prisoner took the pail of water from her feet, placed it on the middle of the bed, and put both her hands into it—I complained that the heat of her head was very great, took some of the vinegar and put it on her head—I said, "Send for somebody again; why does not Captain Clark come?"—the girl said, "I did not ask for Captain Clark, only for Mrs. M'Eachern"—I then said, "Run for Captain Clark then"—he was sent for—when he came, he called for a clothes-brush immediately, and began to rub her legs—I sent the girl down</p>

               <p>for a mustard poultice—it was brought, and placed across her chest—I think Captain Clark did it—she died, as near as I can tell, about twenty minutes after I came into the room—I did not look at the clock—she gasped twice before Captain Clark came—the prisoner was in the room from the time I went in till she died—when Mrs. M'Eachern came into the room, Mr. Garrett, the medical man, was lent for—Mrs. M'Eachern came in before she died—directly she came in, I begged of her to fetch a doctor, and motioned my head to her to be quick—she said, "Who shall I fetch?"—she fetched Mr. Garrett—he lived some distance off—he did not arrive till some time after her death—I asked the prisoner what she had taken that morning—he said, "Only a little salts"—I saw a small tumbler close to the head of the bed, on the table—it was one-third full—it was clear, but whiter than water—there was an empty tumbler at the other side of the table—there was a paper of Epsom salts and a tea-spoon—there was no bottle, tumbler, or anything of the sort, on the drawers—I did not notice the appearance of any broken glass about the room—I did not perceive any smell of any particular kind in the room at any time—after she was dead, the prisoner gave Mrs. M'Eachern a phial full of laven<lb></lb>der water, and she sprinkled the room—I went into the front parlour that morning, soon after she died—I noticed on the table a letter folded, ready for the post, and another letter partly written—there was no bottle or phial in the room—the phial in which the black draught bad been contained had been brought down on Thursday by my servant—I saw it on the kitchen dresser, and desired it to remain there—the rooms are rather small—there is a table and chair in the bed-room, which filled up from the bedstead to the recess, and answered for the washhand-stand—the drawers are the height of a table—when you are in one of the rooms, you can hear what takes place in the other.</p>

                  </hi>. I was servant to Mrs. Heppingstall, when Mr. and Mrs. Belaney came to lodge there—I waited on them on the Thursday evening when Captain Clark and Mrs. M'Eachern supped there, I attended during supper—they had salmon for supper—Mrs. Belaney partook of it—there was a piano in the room—Mrs. Belaney played on it in the course of the evening—she appeared in good spirits, and in very good health indeed—I waited on them on the Friday in the usual way—they went to the Tunnel in the afternoon—they came home about half-past two, stopped at home about half an hour, went out again, and came home about half-past nine in the evening—when they went out in the afternoon I did not hear them say where they were going—they had no supper when they returned—they retired to rest about ten o'clock—on Saturday morning, about five minutes before seven, the prisoner rang the bell, and asked for a jug of hot water, a tumbler, and a spoon—I gave it him—I went into the parlour, and be took them into the bed-room—he was dressed—he did not go out at all after that—about half-past seven I was dusting the parlour—he told me not to do so, for he was going to write—he came into the parlour from the bed-room—I went out—I saw him get the materials for writing—he got the paper and laid it down on the table to begin to write—I did not see him begin to write—he said he would not have the breakfast up, when he wanted it he would ring—I left the room—about twenty minutes to eight I heard him call out, "Mistress, mistress, my wife is very ill"—I was in the kitchen with my mistress—I had not heard the least noise before I heard him call—on hearing him call, I and my mistress went up stairs directly—we went into the bed-room immediately—the prisoner went in with us—Mrs. Belaney was lying on the bed—her cap was off, and her hair was hanging about her head—the bed clothes were right off of her—she was lying straight on her back—she did not appear to be sensible—she had not got her eyes open, or her mouth either—she was foaming very much at the mouth—she was not moving at all only about her neck and head—I and my mistress raised her up in the bed—the prisoner felt her pulse, and said he would use the lancet, only he was afraid her pulse was gone—I went down and fetched some hot water, and the prisoner helped to wash her feet with the hot water, with his hand—he wanted some more hot water, and was going to fetch it himself I got it—he then sluiced her hands, took the pail, and put her hands into it—I went down, got some vinegar, and put it over her face, and across her forehead—he sluiced her face with it—I cannot say who sent me for the vine<lb></lb>gar—I think it was my mistress—after that I went down for Mrs. M'Eachern—she came shortly after, and Captain Clark too—Mrs. M'Eachern went for Mr. Garrett—when I went into the room I noticed a tumbler on the table, it was a tooth glass, it was about half full of stuff, rather white and rather thick—I did not see any other tumbler—the water-bottle was on the washhand-stand, that was not very far from the bed—it could not be reached from the bed—I did not take notice where the jug of hot water was that I had taken up that morning—I did not take down the small tumbler that I saw—the con<lb></lb>tents were thrown away when the glass was washed—I did not take down any other tumbler—after Mrs. Belaney was dead, she was laid out,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in New-road, St. George's. On Saturday morning, the 8th of June, about half-past eight o'clock, I was called by Mrs. M'Eachern to attend on Mrs. Belaney—I live full a mile from the house, probably more than that—when I arrived at the house, Mrs. Belaney was dead—I made a general examination of the deceased, and remarked that the death was very sudden, and I could only account for it by supposing she had died of disease of the heart—the prisoner said he was of the same opinion; that her mother had died of disease of the heart some months before—I inquired whether she had taken any medicine that morning—he said she had merely taken some salts—I called Captain Clark into the front room—the prisoner came in shortly afterwards by my desire—I told him it would be necessary there should be an inquiry into the cause of death, it was so sudden—he said if I thought it necessary—he begged me to take the usual steps on such an occasion—an inquest was afterwards held—I at<lb></lb>tended it—it was on Monday in the forenoon—it was adjourned for the pur<lb></lb>pose of a post-mortem examination—I assisted in the examination, about four o'clock on the Monday afternoon, in company with Mr. Curling of the Lon<lb></lb>don Hospital—we found the whole of the organs generally healthy, and in the stomach we found about a pint of fluid, or nearly so, strongly impregnated with the odour of prussic acid—the fluid was put into a bottle, and sealed, in the presence of Mr. Curling and myself—it was taken to the London Hospital, and has since been examined by an analytical chemist—between eight and nine o'clock the prisoner called at my house with Captain Clark and Mr. Hobson—(the first time he called I was absent)—Captain Clark first inquired as to the state of his daughter, and then he inquired if we had ascertained the cause of Mrs. Belaney's death—I told him that we (meaning Mr. Curling and myself) had not finished our consultation—about ten o'clock that same evening the prisoner called on me again with Captain Clark and Mr. Hobson—the prisoner then made a statement to me—he said, "On the Saturday morning I was about to take some prussic acid, which I had been in the habit of taking for an affection of the stomach, and on endeavouring to remove the stopper from the bottle I had some difficulty; I used some force with the handle of a tooth-brush, and, in consequence of breaking the neck of the bottle by the force, some of the acid was spilt; the remainder I put into a tumbler, and placed it on the drawers at the end of the bed-room; I went into the front room for the purpose of obtaining a bottle wherein to place the acid; instead of doing so I began to write to my friends in the country; I had been there but a few minutes when I heard a scream from the bed-room; I immediately went in; my wife exclaimed, 'Oh dear, I have taken some of that hot drink, give me some cold water,' and she immediately became convulsed;" that was the chief of the conversation—I inquired what he had done with the bottle—he said he had destroyed it, made away with it in some vacant place in the immediate neighbourhood—I asked him why he had not mentioned it before—he said that he was so distressed in his mind, and so annoyed with himself, and so ashamed, that he had not, and he was very sorry he had not communicated it earlier to me—the cause of the deceased's death was decidedly the prussic acid—if prussic acid is spilt on the floor, and some of it poured into a tumbler, there will be a smell in a room for some time, a peculiar smell, as of bitter</p>

               <p>almonds—the sensation is immediately perceived in the throat, at least it is so with myself; I have a peculiar bitter taste in the throat, as it were—that would be the case if a large quantity was spilt and became diffused through the room—I did not observe any peculiar smell of that kind when I went into the house—if half an ounce were spilt it would have that effect, if the room was closed—the window was open—I do not think it was much open, but I am not clear on that point—by letting in the external air I think the smell of the acid would be considerably weakened, and I think it possible that a per<lb></lb>son might not perceive it—I am not acquainted with the symptoms or effects of a poisonous dose of prussic acid—I am acquainted with it as a medicinal agent, but not as a poison—I know what are the proper remedies or re<lb></lb>storatives to be applied where a person has taken prussic acid—they are required to be well known in the medical profession—stimulants are the proper remedies, brandy, or any stimulus indeed; if you have not brandy at hand, whisky, gin, or wine, dashing cold water in the face, the smell of ammonia, hartshorn applied to the nostrils, and artificial respiration; those are the principal—I should consider that putting the feet and hands in warm wa<lb></lb>ter, or a mustard poultice would be a loss of time—I do not think it can be considered an improper remedy; it would be of very little use—bleeding may be occasionally necessary; but, as I have just stated, I have had no experience of the acid as a poison.</p>

               <p>contents of the stomach were placed in a tumbler—the tumbler was covered with a bladder, and carried away by us to the hospital—I opened it the following morning, and delivered it to Dr. Leatheby—the contents were tested in my presence the following morning, at the hospital, by Dr. Leatheby, and was found to contain prussic acid—at that time no attempt was made to ascertain the quantity—whilst the analysis was proceeding I received a com<lb></lb>munication from Mr. Garrett of the prisoner's acknowledgment, therefore we took it for granted—the quantity was subsequently examined.</p>

               <p>in lecturing in the chemical department, as well as that of <hi rend="italic">materia medica</hi>—I have made chemistry my particular study—I have frequently made experi<lb></lb>ments of the effect of prussic acid—the first effect, after taking a strong, or over-dose, is that of a peculiar giddiness in the lower animals, a disposition generally to run round, as if the head was affected; then the respiration be<lb></lb>comes rather uncertain and irregular; subsequently, there is a scream, or pro<lb></lb>bably before the scream, the animal drops; at that moment there are two or three violent expiratory efforts, which generally produce a cry, a noise, a shriek; convulsions occur; they foam at the mouth, and in a longer or shorter time, die: the time depends on the strength and quantity of the acid—I have never had an opportunity of seeing the effect on any person—after the shriek or scream there does not appear to be any volition—volition and sensibility have ceased—in my judgment, after the uttering of that shriek, a person cer<lb></lb>tainly could not be able to walk or converse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am professor of medical jurisprudence, at the London University. My attention has been for some time directed to chemistry—among other things to the properties of hydrocyanic acid, and its effects on the system—I have been present during the examination of the witnesses, and have heard the account given of the state in which Mrs. Belaney was found—accord<lb></lb>ing to my judgment they are the symptoms hydrocyanic acid would produce, but they might also be the result of any powerful sedative poison—there is a peculiar smell in hydrocyanic acid—it is extremely difficult to give a name to the smell of acids—it is peculiar to itself—it has been described as the smell of the bloom of a peach, or bitter almonds, but in my judgment that is a mistake—the smell is very peculiar—if any was spilled on the ground, the odour would continue a considerable time, unless much movement is made in the air of the room, and the room has a free draft—if poured into a tumbler the smell will remain a considerable time in the. room—if the tumbler was taken up to the lips, the smell would be strong to the nostrils—if a quantity sufficient to produce death was taken, the first effect would be a sensation of giddiness, followed by faintness, a peculiar uneasiness about the chest, vertigo, giddi<lb></lb>ness, the falling down of the patient, sometimes a sound somewhat like a shriek, insensibility, loss of volition, convulsions resembling those of tetanus, (which is a disease accompanied frequently with locked jaw,) and death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When the symptoms have advanced to what you describe, as a shriek, or scream, in what state are the powers of sensation, or volition? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Com<lb></lb>pletely gone—it would not be possible in my judgment after that scream, for a party to talk, or speak, or give any account of what had happened—the re<lb></lb>storatives ought to be well known to medical men—they are the subjects of lectures, and books—they are stimulants of various kinds, ammonia, brandy, or any stimulant—chlorine diluted with water, and applied in the form of vapour, and also given internally, ammonia in various forms, dashing cold water on the face, head, and chest, and artificial respiration—I have tried the effect of these remedies on animals—I have administered hydrocyanic acid—I have not tried merely the cold affusion alone—I have tried chlorine, ammonia, and artificial respiration—I have not known cases in which artificial respiration alone has been effectual—putting the feet and hands in warm water would be of no use—a mustard poultice to the chest might stimulate a little, but the effect would be too slow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose prussic acid had been taken, and the party continued to breathe for twenty minutes, in your judgment, if the proper restoratives had been applied would there be a chance of recovery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The probabilities would be in favour of recovery—bleeding has been applied in strong plethoric people, but I believe has no beneficial effects.</p>

I knew the prisoner first about four years ago—he was in the habit of coming to my shop—I vend medicines—he lived in Tothill-street at the time—on Thursday, the 6th of June, he came to my shop—I was out—he wrote on my slate that Belaney, my old friend, had called, and would call again—he called about seven o'clock that evening, and wanted some prussic acid, some salts and senna, some acetate of morphia, and carbonate of soda—he said he wanted a small quantity of salts, about an ounce, and an ounce of soda, and an ounce of acid—those he took with him—he said he was in the habit of taking prussic acid, and he had told me so four years ago, and I knew he was in the habit of taking it—he wished me to get him some, as he said he was in the habit of getting it very spurious—I undertook to get it for him—he did not take anything away that evening in a bottle—I afterwards procured from Evans and Co., Bartholomew-close, one ounce of Scheele's prussic acid—he called for it about eight o'clock the following morn<lb></lb>ing—I gave him the prussic acid and acetate of morphia—the prussic acid was in an ounce phial, and the morphia in a half-drachm bottle—that had a cork—the prussic acid bottle, I judge by the feel, had a stopper—I took it out of the paper—on the Tuesday following he called, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, with Captain Clark—he said he had had a sad mis<lb></lb>fortune with the prussic acid, that the neck of the bottle or stopper had broken in it, in consequence of which he poured the remaining portion into a tum<lb></lb>bler; that his wife poured some water into it in the tumbler, to take it, hav<lb></lb>ing taken salts—he wished me to attend the inquest, which at that time was adjourned—I could not attend, having to attend a case of stabbing in this Court.</p>

               <p>(No. 1.) "Euston Hotel, London, June 5, 1844. Dear Sir,—We arrived here yesterday evening, safe and sound, although to-day, I am sorry to say, Mrs. Belaney is rather unwell. The fatigue of travelling such a distance, no doubt, to a constitution delicate like hers, was sure to tell a little upon her; and I think her spirit, to bear up and carry all before her, has been greater than her strength was equal to. However, I trust that in a day or two, after a good rest, she will be all right again, and we will be able to proceed to Arlington, to my brother's. She does not think very much of what, as yet, she has seen of London. That is easy to be accounted for, she being not over well on the one hand to enjoy anything, and, on the other, having seen almost nothing of interest but crowded streets. I hope all goes on well with you. As today I leave this hotel, and, as I will be moving about from place to place, you had better direct my letters to a bookseller's, who I have arranged with to receive and forward them to me wherever I may be. His address is, 'Mr. Hobson, bookseller, Commercial-road-east, London.' This, with my name, will find me, and I shall either call every day at the shop for my letters, or he will send them to me. If there be anything of importance requiring my consideration, you may mention it, and I shall make as little delay over it as possible. In haste, yours truly, J. C. Belaney. P. S.—The hotel ink is hardly to be surpassed by a Sunderland beer-shop."</p>
               <p>(No. 2.)—"London, June 8, 1844. Dear Mr. Bell,—I have little else to write to the north about at the present than to give you (who, I know, are all interested in it) a very unhappy account of Rachael's state. I have had her removed from the hotel to private lodgings, where, with two medical attend<lb></lb>ants, she remains dangerously ill. Symptoms of premature labour came on a few days ago; but what is still worse, one of the medical men pronounces the heart to be diseased. Of this I had some dread myself. This will alter my former plans greatly; but, if she be spared, that will be every thing. Hoping you are all well, I must in haste conclude, yours sincerely,—<hi rend="smallCaps">J. C.

As such could not be done at the quarry and lime works without great inconvenience to the partnership, I shall not desire the same there. I am hardly able to sit up; but hope to be able to write to-morrow more particulars. As her death has occurred chiefly among strangers and so suddenly, an inquest and post mortem exami<lb></lb>nation will be held. This has been mentioned to me.

               <p>Dear Mr. Bell,—I intended writing to you an account of what had happened to my dear Rachael, through my infatuity or inadvertency, and to myself; but at present am unable to do so. I have written Hall a sort of account of it, which I wish you to go immediately to peruse and consult with him what to do. Oh! what is this come upon me like a thunderbolt? I did not men<lb></lb>tion the cause of her death to you before, through a desire to bury the shame and avoid the public reproach for my fatal neglect. Yet I know well you can account for it under such circumstances; but, oh God! I can never forgive myself. I would like you to call upon Mr. Simpson, and give him the particulars of what I have given of the awful occurrence. Lose not a moment in getting for Mr. Darnel testimony of my marriage from Bamborough, and post it to Mr. Clark, 17, King-street, Stepney, London."</p>

My dear Mr. Bell,—By the time this reaches you, you will have learned from Hall's letter, and my communication yester<lb></lb>day, the awful cause of my loss; and you, well I know, can and will feel for me. O God! what a visitation comes upon me, like a thunderbolt shot down upon me in the midst of my happiness. Alas! where are all my sum<lb></lb>mer arrangements gone with my dear Rachael? But I cannot write. You shall hear from me immediately. To meet the next payments go to Thew for the price of the wheat. I will arrange for your supplies. Let no one in<lb></lb>terrupt you in your usual course. I have legal advice to direct and go through the case for me. I wrote a few lines for Captain Clark to direct him to write you, giving instruction for you to go on with the business as usual, and where to apply to for money to meet the pay. I did not think of writing you at that time; but have now done so. Besides several other friends who are coming up, and who have known me for some time, I should like to see Mr. Hunt of Belford. Do go and tell him what has hap<lb></lb>pened, and that I should like him to come up immediately to say what he knows of me. Mr. Hancock and several others have arrived. Tell him, for God's sake, to come off immediately. I will pay all expenses. I must have a few respectable friends to come forward to establish my character and say what they know of me. Oh, God! I know not what I am doing or saying. Tell him I shall pay every expense. When he comes he must call at Hob<lb></lb>son's, bookseller, Commercial-road East, London, or at 17, King-street, Stepney, London, at Mr. Clark's. Yours ever, in haste, <hi rend="smallCaps">J. C.

               <p>(No. 6.)—Post marks, 14th and 15th June—"London, June, 1844. Dear Hall,—Oh! I am distracted. I cannot write, nor do anything. I have lost my dear Rachel; and, what makes the loss so much the worse, it was caused by my own neglect, from leaving some medicine, which I myself had been taking a portion of for my stomach, in a tumbler on the top of the drawers, at the opposite end of the room where she was. She had gone for the tumbler, and poured some water into it, without observing anything in it; the medicine being only a small portion of liquid in the bottom of the glass, and clear as the glass or water; then she had drunk it. Oh, my God! I know not what to do. My dear Rachel is gone, gone for ever from me. You, and all of you, knew how happy we were together. I had just gone, leaving her in bed, out of the room for a minute or so, into the other room, in search of another bottle to put the medicine in; for I had broken the one it was in, and had got a tumbler in the mean time to secure the contents in, and she had got out of bed to use the----, and take some salts, which were on the table by her bed<lb></lb>side, and, wishing to take some water after the salts, and supposing the glass an empty and clean one, she had gone to the other end of the room, unknow<lb></lb>ingly poured water into it, and, oh, God! have mercy upon us all! she drank</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184408190035"></xptr>
               <p>a portion of it. I heard her cry for me in the other room. I flew to her; but, oh, God! it was all over in a few minutes, and I am now in a state of mind bordering on utter misery and madness. In the sudden shock I knew not what to do or say. I called for immediate assistance. It was brought, but it was of no use. The awful occurrence having taken place in a situation where I am entirely unknown, all are strangers around; and the people being much inclined to doubt my statement that she was my wife, and every thing else I said, I am in a terrible situation. The law has a right to suspect me, and as yet I have not a creature found to prove my marriage, or what I am or who I am. I have nothing to prove anything as yet. The solicitor who I have employed will either have to come down to establish my character, and prove how we lived, and that we were married, or else he will require a few of my friends who have known me and her also to come up and testify what they know of me. I know you will all do what is required for me. What I now regret the most next to the accident, in my confusion and half-stunned state, is, I did not say what had caused her death. I knew not what I was doing or saying, and of course, horror-struck and shocked at my infatuity in having left such medicine there, though it was only for a minute, and the poor dear Rachael was in bed, and knowing well that the world would blame me perhaps too severely for my carelessness in leaving such a dangerous medicine where it was in danger of doing such evil, I did not, until after I became a little more collected, say what had happened. This, though very natural at such an awful juncture, is considered as against me. Oh, God! I know not what to do or say. It came upon me like a thunderbolt. If I were able I would write to you all, I mean most of my friends; but at present I cannot. Go to Mr. Bell, and William Wilson, and Alexander Wilson, and who you think fit, and state the melancholy contents of this to them, because I cannot acquaint them all. As poor Mrs. Stobbs is now the only memorial of dear Rachael I know, go to her, and give her ray respects, and tell her that I have lost beloved Rachael; and although there was not much friendship existing between them for some time past, I hope better will now exist between us and that I shall always regard her for dear Rachael's sake. I must now step; for I am bewildered, as if in an unconscious dream. Yours ever, <hi rend="smallCaps">J. C. BELANEY</hi>. I wish William Wilson could give you Mr. Tewart'a address in London. He is one who knows me, and would say something for me. Go to Mrs. Stobbs immediately, for, as a relative, it is my duty to acquaint her. Tell Mrs. Patrick, and all others you think well of. Oh! I am gone. I hope the Lord will support me under such trouble. If I can write to Mr. Simpson, who is the minister of the parish, I will; but at present I cannot."</p>
               <p>(No. 7.) "To Mr. Dinning (<hi rend="italic">post marks</hi> 14<hi rend="italic">th and</hi> 15<hi rend="italic">th of June.</hi>) My dear Dinning,—I received yours to-day, but O what a change has taken place since I last saw you! O God have mercy on us all! My poor Rachael is gone—gone for ever! Instead of writing to you in that happy strain I had promised, when happy last both beside you, I must now in a state of half insensibility and frenzy communicate to you the awful account of my dear Rachael's death. I can hardly believe that this is not a dream, but it cannot be one. Too true it is that she is not beside me. O God, after she had al<lb></lb>most recovered from the fatigues of the journey, and after making purchases of some dresses in town for herself and myself, for going off to my brother's at Arlington, in Sussex, when we were about to fix on the day, and wrote to him, she mistook some powerful medicine, which I had been using for my stomach complaint, for water, or rather took the tumbler in which a portion of it remained, it being the colour of glass and in small bulk, and no doubt believing it to be empty, poured some water into it to take after her salts, which she swallowed, and O God, O God have mercy upon us all, I cannot</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184408190036"></xptr>
               <p>tell you more of it! I had just gone into the other room, the parlour (our lodging consisted of two rooms, bed and sitting-room,) for only one minute to get a bottle to put some medicine in, the one I had having been broken in my hand, and Rachel during this time having risen to take her salts, which were placed on a different table by her bed-side, the other medicine which I had left in a tumbler was on the drawers at the opposite end of the room. But I don't know what I am saying or doing. She called. I was in the other room. I flew to her, and O God, O God, she expired in my arms, or nearly so! I called assistance when I was able from the stun to do so, and after what could be done in the time, she went off in my arms, or rather in the mistress's of the house. I was in the mean time, as far as strength would allow me, trying remedies and holding her. As I am entirely among strangers, and an inquest is going on, I must use means to establish my cha<lb></lb>racter, to prove that she was my wife, which they have strong suspicions of, having no one to prove this in the mean time, and the law being strict, I am placed in an awful position; but what among the strangers makes it appear worse is, that I did not, during the shock, at first, being half insensible of what was going on, and horror-struck and ashamed of having, through the awful neglect of having left the medicine in a place where any one could get at it; but O, I little thought she was going to rise so soon, and then it was at the other end of the room! But I cannot tell you more. O tell your father, who I am sure will feel for my loss and unhappy condition. I am shocked, and all I can do—nothing! I know not what to do or say. It is for me to establish my character, and prove my marriage. O, I know your father will do all he can. I cannot say what must be done until I see a soli<lb></lb>citor here; he, I dare say, will have to come down for proof of my marriage and the state we have lived in. They did not believe we were married, nor that if she were my wife I would talk of leaving her in town or at Arlington, and go myself up the Rhine, as I stated. In this way, and in the absence of all proof, and being entirely among strangers, I stand in a very unhappy position. O do use every means to assist me. Your father, I hope, will do all too to establish my character since we were married. He knows whether she was my wife or not, and whether we were happy—so do you. O God, I know not what is to befal me; and poor dear Rachael is lost! Most of the people in the neighbourhood know something of me, and I dare say will do any<lb></lb>thing if required. I think if I required most of the Magistrates in the neighbourhood could speak to my character. Mr. Hancock, Sullidan, and others, whom I have written to for aid, will I know do all they can in this awful crisis. O God, What a change of things! The solicitor will perhaps either tell me what to do, or will see you besides others. I have written Dr. Embleton also; I know he will spare nothing to serve me in such an hour. I wrote to inform some of them in the neighbourhood of her death a day or two eince, but having inadvertently been the awful cause of my own wife's des<lb></lb>truction, I thought in the madness and agony of the time, I should save my<lb></lb>self from the censure and blame of the world by burying it in my own bosom. This was madness; but who can think rightly in such a condition? Thus it makes me stand on very suspicious ground, where I am not known. O tell Hunt and all other of my friends about it, because references of character will be required from many to serve me. Adieu, my dear Sir; I hope that God out of his love and mercy will defend and protect me in this awful crisis."</p>
               <p>(No. 8.) "To Mr. Embleton. London, Wednesday, June, 1844. Mr. Emble<lb></lb>ton—O God, what has happened to my beloved Rachel! she is gone, gone for ever from me. She took out of a tumbler which I had left on a table at the opposite end of the room, imagining it to be empty no doubt, as there did not appear to be anything in it to one in her situation, whilst there was a portion</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184408190037"></xptr>
               <p>of prussic acid in it, which I had been taking a small portion of for my stomach. The reason I had it in such an exposed situation was because on my taking a little of it for my stomach, which I dare say you are aware I am in the habit of doing, when my side or stomach is bad; I think you recommended it to me among others; the stopper having broken in the phial, I was obliged to knock off the neck of it, and having done so, set a tumbler to catch the con<lb></lb>tents, a portion of what was saved was left in the glass. I went into another room in search of another phial to put it in, knowing well how dangerous it was to have it exposed. I was not a minute absent when Rachel having got up to use the----, and take some salts out of the glass off the table, in order to take some water after the salts, and from the clearness of the acid, not per<lb></lb>ceiving it in the glass, poured some water in it, and drank a portion of it. O God, what a calamity for me. I heard her in the other room, and flew to her, I called for assistance; but in a minute or two it was all over. Ashamed of my awful neglect in having left the acid for a moment in such a situation, and in awful confusion in the shock, I did not communicate the circumstances until after a while, which in consequence of my being entirely among strangers, is likely to place me in an awful position, &amp;c. &amp;c."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon,. residing at Embleton, in Northum<lb></lb>berland. I am acquainted with the prisoner—he has consulted me several times about a complaint that he was labouring under—when he first con<lb></lb>sulted me he complained of palpitation of the heart, with slight difficulty of breathing occasionally—the first time he consulted me was either in the latter part of 1838, or the beginning of 1839—I cannot speak definitively as to the exact period—he thought that he was labouring under organic disease of the heart and the nerves—I examined his chest with the stethoscope, and told him I could not detect any signs of organic disease—on further examin<lb></lb>ation I found he was labouring under dyspepsia—a deranged action of the stomach, which had been existing a considerable time—I told him I con<lb></lb>sidered the palpitation of the heart and the slight difficulty of breathing were merely secondary symptoms—I advised him to take some bitter infusion, with a couple or three drops of prussic acid, twice a day, and to take some slight alterative pill, or blue pill at night—I also advised him to take a little pre<lb></lb>paration of opium when the pain became violent at any time—I advised mor<lb></lb>phine, which is a prepartion of opium—he consulted me from time to time afterwards about his symptoms—he said he had followed the plan I had ad<lb></lb>vised him, and had found the symptoms gradually amending—he got well—I frequently saw him after his marriage—I have known him well for many years, and Mrs. Belaney also—I had an opportunity of seeing what his con<lb></lb>duct was towards his wife—it was that of unvarying kindness—and her feel<lb></lb>ings seemed to be reciprocal to his—the affection seemed mutual—those ap<lb></lb>peared to be the terms on which they were living constantly—I never heard anything brought against his character—it has been that of kindness to all with whom he was connected.</p>

I was examined before the Coroner on the subject of this death, and was afterwards bound over as a witness for the Crown, to appear here on the trial—I appear now in obedience to my recognizance—I have known the prisoner between five and six years—he has published a work on Falconry—when he came up to London I introduced him to Mrs. Hepping<lb></lb>stall's lodgings—I saw Mrs. Belaney at the same time—I had never seen her before—their conduct to each other appeared most kind and affectionate—I helped to bring the luggage into the lodgings—Mrs. Belaney appeared at that time in a delicate state of health, and advanced in pregnancy—they went to the theatre in the evening—they both wished to go—it was on the Tuesday evening, the evening of their arrival at the lodging—he and I went together to the Euston Hotel, and brought their things from thence to the lodging—I did not see them on the Thursday—I saw Mr. Belaney on the Wednesday—I saw nothing more of them till the Saturday, when I saw Captain Clark—I was present before the Magistrate, but was not called—I went to Mrs. Heppingstall's house about half-past ten on the Saturday morn<lb></lb>ing, in consequence of seeing Captain Clark, and hearing that Mrs. Belaney was dead—I saw the prisoner—he appeared very much distressed, and was in tears—I afterwards accompanied him and Captain Clark to the burial-ground—he was at that time also very much distressed—there was nothing in his conduct which I should not have expected to see exhibited by an affectionate husband who had so recently lost his wife—I was with them on the Sunday evening, from seven till about half-past nine o'clock—I was also with them, on Monday, the 10th, the day of the inquest—I heard that they had called at my house, but I was not at home—I saw them at my house about ten o'clock on the Monday evening—the prisoner then appeared very much dis<lb></lb>tressed—they invited me to go out with them—seeing the state Mr. Belaney was in, I asked Captain Clark, in his presence, what was the matter—he appeared to me to be in a fainting state—I had to support him—Captain Clark, in his presence, gave me an account of what Mr. Belaney had repre<lb></lb>sented had happened at the time of the death—that was the first time I had heard anything of the prussic acid—I went to Mr. Garrett in consequence—I have received no intimation on the part of the Crown that I should not be required to give evidence—I attend in obedience to my recognizance—I was not taken before the Grand Jury—I had an intimation that I should not be required to go before the Grand Jury, but not that I should not be required to attend here as a witness on the trial—I have been attending ever since.</p>

                  </hi>. I live, at No. 17, King-street, Mile-end Old Town, and am a master mariner. I am a friend of Mr. Belaney's—I knew him for about twelve months from, I think, about July, 1839, to the follow<lb></lb>ing year—he was living in Cannon-street-road at that time—he attended me and my daughter during that time as a surgeon—on Tuesday, the 4th of June last, he called on me in company with Mr. Hobson, who is an acquaint<lb></lb>ance of mine through Mr. Belaney—Mrs. Belaney called with him—that was my first introduction to her—she dined with us that day while Mr. Belaney</p>

               <p>went with Mr. Hobson up to Euston-quare for his luggage—they then went to their lodging, and took tea—Mr. Hobson was in company with them, and they went to the theatre afterwards—I saw them again on the Wednesday evening—she had been very poorly all the day, and was in bed—my daugh<lb></lb>ter was there also when I called—I Saw Mrs. Belaney, and spoke to her—she did not appear to be poorly then—she was much better at that time, and very cheerful—she was in bed then—she complained of her head being light, but she was very cheerful—I saw them again on the Thursday afternoon—I understood they had been up towards the West End, to Regent-street, and that he had bought a hawk on a roll—he unrolled it, showed it to me, and said he had plenty of work for Mrs. Belaney during his absence—he said he should be gone a long time, if she had to finish it by the time he came back—I had heard a talk about his going to this hawking in Holland more than two years before—on the Thursday evening I took a little salmon with him—my daughter was not there—they were on very cheerful and agreeable terms that evening—I never saw them otherwise—on Friday, about half-past two o'clock, Mr. and Mrs. Belaney called at my house—they said they had been down to the Tunnel, and on to the Mile End-road, making some little pur<lb></lb>chases—they did not bring any stays or purchases with them—she appeared to be very much fatigued, and looked pale—she did not go out again, and he left her, and went to Euston-square to see for letters—he came back, I think, about half-past eight o'clock, to my house—we were at tea—he took some tea, and they went home—he produced an order that he had for Mrs. Belaney to go to the House of Lords on that day—he had received a letter from Earl Clanwilliam, inclosing two orders, one for him and one for her, to go to the House of Lords that day, but it was too late to make use of it then—he had been himself, and the House adjourned very early on the Friday—up to the time of their parting from me on the Friday evening they were on the same affectionate and intimate terms—I never saw anything to the contrary—they always appeared to be very affectionate indeed, and very happy together, much more so than I have generally seen, and I believe that was the general remark—on the Thursday evening, when at supper with him, he intimated to me that he should like very much for Mrs. Belaney to stop with my daughter during his absence to the Rhine, which would be about ten or twelve days—my daughter was not present—I spoke to her about it, and she told me some<lb></lb>thing—I do not remember his assigning any particular reason why a change was made about Arlington, only something about being in the country, and a distance from any medical man, or something of that sort, but it is very indis<lb></lb>tinct in my memory—on the Friday I stated to him and her that I had spoken to my daughter about her stopping with us, and she had given her consent, and they both seemed very happy that it was so—on the Saturday morning, as the clock struck eight, I began to rise, when the servant knocked at the door, and said I was wanted immediately—in consequence of what she said I got on my things as quick as I possibly could, and went with all speed to Mrs. Heppingstall's house—when I got there I found Mr. Belaney very much distressed in mind, and he seemed very much horrified—I did not see him crying when 1 first went in—he had a lancet in his hand—Mrs. Belaney was lying on the bed insensible, with her eyelids closed—I saw her heave twice—the first gasp was pretty strong, and I then supposed she was coming to—presently after she gave another slight sigh, and I believe that was all—I do not particularly remember what the prisoner's first observation was—the first observation I remember was that she would not recover; and about five or six minutes afterwards, I cannot say exactly, he said, "My God! this is entirely through my own neglect; I am</p>

               <p>the cause of all this, through my gross neglect"—I did not put any question upon that, but I certainly should had he been a stranger—I had understood on the Friday that she had been down the Tunnel and I said to Mr. Belaney, "You have done very wrong to take your good lady in that state down the Tunnel; had I known you were going I should have endeavoured to dissuade you from it; it is rather too much in her state, of pregnancy;" or something of that sort—I understood his words to refer to that; moreover, I stated that I thought it was too long a journey to bring her in her then state; and the construction I put on his statement to me then was that he had been neg<lb></lb>lectful—he had also said Mrs. Belaney had been very subject to costiveness, and I thought perhaps it might have been that he alluded to, as well as bringing her the long journey, when he said it was through his gross neglect—I was for trying friction, because I have seen friction tried in cases of fits——Mrs. Heppingstall went down for a mustard poultice, spread it on the drawers, handed it to me, and I put it on her chest, Mr. Belaney moving her linen on one side while I did so—we then had hot, or rather warm water, it was not very warm, and I requested brushes to rub her legs with—the pri<lb></lb>soner during this time appeared very much distressed and overpowered, but he stated it was of no use, she would not come to—he appeared from the begin<lb></lb>ning to have no hope whatever of her recovery—he put his hand to her heart and to her pulse, and said, "She has no pulse, it is no use bleeding her"—I felt her heart and pulse too, and there was no pulsation—the conversation shortly after passed about the inquest—Mrs. Heppingstall, Mr. Garrett, and myself, thought it was necessary—I do not remember whether it was pro<lb></lb>posed by Mrs. Heppingstall or Mr. Garrett, but he said he thought it would be right to have one—I considered so for Mr. Belaney's justifica<lb></lb>tion—it was mentioned to him while he was at the door of the bed-room—he came into the other room afterwards—he made no objection—he acceded to it immediately—a woman came to lay out the body, and she wished to have the deceased's clothes—the prisoner seemed indignant at the idea of taking her clothes away, and said he wished to have her clothes, and would pay money, for he would rather have those that she died in than all her other things—the woman had been brought in by Mrs. Heppingstall—he was so indignant at the desire of taking away the last things his poor wife had on, that he was desirous of having everything out of the house—I went away to Mr. James, the undertaker—I had spoken to the prisoner about the inter<lb></lb>ment, and he said he must leave it entirely to me and Mr. Hobson—I have been examined before the Coroner, and before the Magistrate, and was bound over for the prosecution—on my return from the undertaker, I called at Mr. Hob<lb></lb>son's, told him what had occurred, and begged him to come on—he presently after came on to Mrs. Heppingstall's, and after sitting there a while, and talking to the undertaker, Mr. Hobson and I proposed going to the cemetery, to see about a piece of ground—Mr. Belaney then said he thought he would go with us, and take the air—Mrs. Heppingstall said she hoped the funeral would take place as soon as possible, because it was a painful thing for the occurrence to take place in her house, and she suggested that it might take place on the Tuesday, as the inquest was expected to take place on the Monday—Mr. Hobson, myself, and Mr. Belaney, then went out—we first went into the Beaumont cemetery, and afterwards to the City of London cemetery—I do not remember Mr. Belaney making any observation to the man—all that passed was between me and Mr. Belaney—the man said he must have four days clear to prepare a brick grave, and it was arranged there should be a seven foot grave—I afterwards went with him to see a brother of his who is in trade at Mr. Cursitor's, in Whitechapel, and either in going or coming</p>

               <p>back, I do not remember which, he stated in similar words that he regretted very much that he was the cause of her death through his gross neglect, he was the sole cause—he expressed that once or twice—that was on the Satur<lb></lb>day afternoon—I made a mistake before the Magistrate with respect to the Sunday, which I beg leave to rectify—it was not on Sunday, it must have been on the Monday that I walked down to the Globe with him—he then said the same as before, that he was the cause of his dear Rachel's death, through his gross neglect—that was on the Monday, towards noon, and I ob<lb></lb>served each time he stated this to me, he seemed to wish to get away from the hearing of every one, towards the middle of the road; for example, in going to the Globe in the Mile-End-road, he seemed to wish to be in the very mid<lb></lb>dle of the road—although I paid no particular attention to that at the time, from what happened afterwards my memory has been thrown back—a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination took place on the Monday—I did not hear either of the surgeons say to the other what was the cause of the death—I inquired of them, and they gave me an evasive answer—I had no reason whatever to guess that it had been from prussic acid—I had not the least idea that there was anything wrong or unfair in any way, from the confidence I had in Mr. Belaney—on the Monday evening I was walking with the prisoner—I was going to see my daughter-in-law, who had just been brought to bed—I called on my way on Mr. Garrett, who was attending her—he was not within—I afterwards saw him, and after leaving him, the prisoner seemed to wish to get me, I think, into Chapman-street, in the Commercial-road, which appeared a retired street—we walked from there up the Commercial-road, Cannon-street-road, and ultimately into Jubilee-place—he there stopped, and was shedding tears very abundantly, with his handkerchief to his eyes, and he said, "My God, Mr. Clark, I am the sole cause of my dear Rachel's death"—he said it so forcibly that I began to think it very strange, as he had spoken in that way so repeatedly, and I said, "What do you mean, doctor?"—he said, "Mean! my wife has taken poison!"—"Poison!" I said, "what poi<lb></lb>son?"—he said, "Prussic acid"—I said, "Good God, do you mean to say that you have given your wife prussic acid?"—"No, thank God," said he, "I have not that to charge myself with"—he then began to relate how it had occurred; that he was in the habit of taking prussic acid, and I know he was in the habit of taking prussic acid when he was in London before—I had heard him say so—he said that he had been taking it, that he had by mistake broken the stopper of the bottle in getting it out, I understood him to say he had spilt some of it, that he got a tumbler, placed it on the drawers, and emptied the phial into this tumbler, and that it was his impression that his wife had come out of bed, and taken it after he left the room—he was in a dreadful state at the time he made this narrative—I then took him to Mr. Hobson—it was then proposed to go to Mr. Garrett—we went to Mr. Gar<lb></lb>rett, and there he made this statement.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mrs. Roberts, a bonnet-maker in the Mile End-road. On Friday, the 7th of June, about twelve o'clock in the day, a lady and gentleman called at our shop—the gentleman purchased a bonnet for the lady, and at the same time left a pair of new stays, to be sent home with the bonnet—the gentleman's conduct appeared most affectionate towards the lady—it made an impression on me at the time, and I remarked it at the time to the persons in the house—Mr. Belaney called in the course of the day for the stays, and the bonnet was sent in the morning.</p>
               <p>F----H----<hi rend="smallCaps">SALVIN</hi>. I live at Linton Spring, Yorkshire. I have been acquainted with Mr. Belaney for two years—I joined with him in his taste for hawking—I have visited him at different times—the first year of my acquaintance with him I visited him three times—I visited him once since he was married—he and his wife appeared to be perfectly happy in the mar<lb></lb>riage—I have become well acquainted with Mr. Belaney—he always bore a very good character for humanity and kindness in every relation of life—I knew him at the time when he was in practice—I saw him with his medicines about—he was a person of very careless habits, and his medicines were thrown very carelessly about his house—I have spoken to him about it once or twice—I have observed that habit.</p>

                  </hi> I am single. On the 25th of Sept., about two o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the Queen's show-room at the Custom-house—I saw the prisoner close to me—I detected his hand in my pocket and laid hold of him—I saw him pass something to a man standing behind—I then discovered that I had lost my purse containing two sovereigns, one half-crown, two shillings, and a sixpence—I have never seen it again.</p>

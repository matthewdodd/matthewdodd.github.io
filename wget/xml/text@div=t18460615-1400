                  </hi>. My husband's name is Charles—we live in Manor-lane, Rotherhithe—nobody else lives in the house—this handkerchief and coat produced are my husband's property, and were safe at nine o'clock last Tuesday morning, doubled up on a box—I went out, left the house quite safe, I locked the door, and put the key into my pocket—the window was shut down—I came back about one o'clock, and noticed a pane of glass was broken out of the window—all the things were scattered about the place—t person could get through the space—the whole pane was out—the thiogi were a great distance from it, and could not be reached from outside—the parties must have got in, because the things were scattered all over the place.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Bermondaey—on Tuesday, the 16th of June, about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, I saw the prisoner at the back of Mr. Pope's house, he had nothing with him—I saw him next day, and watched him; as soon as he saw me he ran away—I pursued and brought him back—I said I took him for Mr. Pope's coat—he said if he bad had a mind to be a thief he could have taken plenty of boots and shoes—I heard him say he pledged the coat—he did not say how he came by it.</p>

                  </hi>. I took the prisoner—he said at first he had not been near the house, but said afterwards he had been to the house, knocked at the door and found Mrs. Pope was not at home—he wanted her to recommend him to a job to weed a garden—when I saw Mr. Pope he said, "Tell me where the coat is, I have been a good friend to you, and am a poor man that cannot afford to lose it"—the prisoner said, "I have pawned it, you bate been a good friend to me, do not hurt me"—he said he had pawned it at Mr. Griss's shop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I had been to look for a job, and a man who was there said, "If you like to pawn a coat for me I will give you 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.;" I did so—he said, "You may have the ticket, I don't suppose I shall be able so take it out again;" I deny saying, "If 1 had been a thief I could have taken plefity of boots and shoes;" Smithers said he saw another man close to the house.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187509200032"></xptr>
               <p>Anthony, this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced marled A</hi>)—I gave it about 2 o'clock to the prisoner who I had employed to serve writs and told him to pay it to Mr. Anthony whose chambers are opposite to mine at 6, Martin's Lane—I think he had been there before to make payments—my bankers have debited me with the amount.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs.

H. Anthony"—Mr. Purchase said that he had not sufficient cash, only 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the prisoner asked for an I O U for the other 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and mr.

            . I live in Goswell-street, and am a bookseller. In January, 1831, I bought a quantity of printed paper of the prisoner - he said he had bought it at Mr. Colburn's, and there was about half a ton of it - I asked why he did not bring the whole, or let one of my men go and get it - he said the men were busy, and he could but bring it by 1 cwt. at a time; I agreed to have it so - I did not see him again till last April, when I saw him in Barbican; I thought he was the man, and as soon as he saw me, he ran off, but was bindered - I got up to him, took him, and said "You must go with me;" he said, "I will see you d-d first;" he gave a cast with his arm, and got from me - I seized him again, and kept him down till the officer took him - this is the paper - I had no other like it.</p>

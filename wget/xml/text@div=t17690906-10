On the 18th of August there was a fire in Bridewell, the court in which I live joins it; we were afraid of its reaching us. I got out my goods and put them down by the end of the court. When I came to look for my things, I missed a bed, and the next day I heard it was in the constable's hands. I knew it to be mine, and have got it now at home.</p>

            . I was sitting on a bench at the door of the George Inn, in Smithfield, that night the fire was, about eleven o'clock, and the prisoner was coming along with a bed on his back. I asked him if he had fetched that bed from the fire, and where he was carrying it; he said he brought it from the fire, and was carrying it to Islington, and that he must have a glass of gin. I went in, and told the people I thought he had stole a bed from the fire, so we stopped him with it, and then the constable took the bed to his house, and took the prisoner to the watch-house. Before the Lord Mayor, the prisoner said he was desired by a person to carry it to Islington.</p>

There were a good many people asked him where he brought the bed from; he said from the fire, and that he was going to carry it to Islington; yet could not tell to what house, or for who, but said one Mr. Jones desired him to carry it, and that he would follow him. He gave no satisfactory answers, and the people were all unanimous to send for a constable. He was taken to the watch-house, and from thence to the Counter.</p>

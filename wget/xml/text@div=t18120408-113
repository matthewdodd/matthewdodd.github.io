               <p>Q. When did you lose your handkerchief - A. On the night of the 28th of March, I was just returning from a short walk at half-past ten at night, I was standing at the door waiting for the door to be opened; as soon as I had rung the bell, my face was towards the door, I felt my pocket-handkerchief moved from my pocket. On looking round, I saw my handkerchief in a young man's hand, whom I supposed to be Spencer, I saw him give it to another man, whom I am confident is Jackson. They walked on a little way together, I followed them, and accused them of taking my handkerchief, which they denied, and I cried out stop thief, they run off, and in a few paces they separated, one went straight on, and the other crossed the road. I followed Jackson, thinking I should find my handkerchief. Mr. Vaughan brought up Spencer, having heard the cry of stop thief. They were both taken to St. Andrew's watchhouse. As they passed to the watchhouse they went through a crowd of girls of the town, they said, if they had any thing drop it; nothing was found on them. Spencer at Marlborough-street office, told the magistrate it was Jackson that took the handkerchief, I supposed it was Spencer that took my handkerchief, when he was brought back, he answered to the description of the man that gave it to Jackson.</p>

               <p>GEORGE VAUGHAN. I am an attorney's clerk. On the 28th of March, about half-past ten at night, I was on my way to Eagle-street, Holborn, I met the two prisoners, I saw them in company together, just by Red Lion-street. I heard the cry of stop thief, I saw Spencer cross the Road, I laid hold of him and told him I stopped him on suspicion of having robbed some person. I know him to be one that I had seen in company with Jackson. I am sure I saw Spencer in company with Jackson. On our road to the watchhouse, I heard the girls of the town say, if you have got any thing drop it.</p>
               <p>Jackson said nothing in his defence.</p>
               <p>Spencer's Defence. I never was in a court of justice before in my life. I am as innocent as a child unborn.</p>
               <p>Jackson called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Spencer called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>JACKSON - GUILTY, aged 20.</p>
               <p>SPENCER - GUILTY, aged 21.</p>

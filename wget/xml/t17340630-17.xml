            , came to lodge there but a little before Lady-Day, and then we observ'd the Prisoner look'd big, and at Easter, she look'd very lank. We suspected she had been deliver'd, tho' she appear'd publickly every Day, and we had never heard her cry out; but then we could not think what was become of the Child. In short, we thought the Family was all alike, or things could not be kept so private. We watch'd and harke'd all as ever we could. One while we fancy'd the Child might be at Nurse in the Garret, because they were often whipping up and down Stairs; but when we could find nothing, we concluded it was baked in the Oven. At last Mrs. Goldsmith, going in o the Cellar, came up, and told me and her Husband, she had seen a Wig-box below, and smelt something. He went down, and came up again, like a dead Man, and said, he put his Hand in the Box, and felt a Child, but was so surpriz'd, that he did not take it out. We consulted what to do, and, says I, as they have kept this Thing in hugger-mugger, we wont let 'em know the Child is found, before we send for a Constable; so Mr. Goldsmith fetch'd a Constable and Watch, and they brought the Child up, and it was all mouldy. The Prisoner, at first, deny'd she had had a Child; but in a little time own'd it was her's.</p>

               <p>Juryman. You seem'd very deligent in watching the Prisoner, did you ever tax her with being with Child, before the Child was found.</p>
               <p>Turnly. No, I never spoke a Word to her about it; for I could not bear the sight of the Creature.</p>

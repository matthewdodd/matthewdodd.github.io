                  </hi>. I am the wife of Abraham Grout, who keeps a beer shop at Plaistow. On the Monday before 16th July I had a purse safe in my box at 9 o'clock in the morning, containing 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold and 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—the box was locked—I saw the prisoner that day, and the next day too—she was there in the afternoon, as a customer—my box was in a chest of drawers in my bed room—I did not see her go up stairs at all, she went to go into the garden, I thought—I bolted the back door that she should not go in and out so much—I heard a step up stairs, and in a moment I saw the latch lift up—she must open it inside the house—I said, "What way did you come into the house?"—she said, "I came from your back yard"—I contradicted her, but she persisted that she did, and directly she was gone I went up stairs, and found that my husband's box had been opened, and then I found my box unlocked and the keys hanging where they had hung before—I looked for my purse, and it was not there—I went to the prisoner's house, but she was not there, but she came home at 10 o'clock at night—I was there, and accused her of going up stairs—she said, "No"—I said, "I have proof that you have robbed me, and if you give me my things, I will say no more about it; if not, I shall give you in charge"—she said that I might if I liked, and I did.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>). I received information from the last witness, went to the prisoner's house, and told her she was charged with robbing Mrs. Grout of a purse containing 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she said, "I know nothing about it, I am innocent"—on the way to the station I observed this purse (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in her hand—1 saw her take it from her bosom—I took it from her hand, and said to Mrs. Grout, "Is this your purse?"—the prisoner said, "No, it is not Mrs. Grout's purse, but it is her money, or part of it"—I found in it one sovereign, ten half sovereigns, nine shillings, and a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece—at her lodging I found a quantity of clothing, and on her fingers three gold rings.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you and the maid in the public house together. - A. I sat down and drank a pint of beer, there she came in with another man, whom she said was her husband, she came and sat by the side of me</p>
               <p>Q. What day was that. - A. On the 21st of August; at half past one in the afternoon; she pulled my watch out of my fob, and put it in her bosom, so she went out of the door; I said I want my watch, she said you shall not have it, she went from there to the Golden Chain public house, at the Tower; I went after her, and asked her for my watch, she said you shall never have it any more; the master of the public house said you shall give the man his property, or you shall not go out of the door; I sent for an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your watch. - A. She had got it in her bosom.</p>
               <p>Q. You were too well acquainted perhaps; how came she to take the watch from you in that manner. A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to let her go out of Mr. Bookmaer's public house. - A. I would not make any disturbance, I thought she would give it. me again.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been drinking together, had not you. - A. Yes, we had been drinking together before the watch was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. And the watch was found upon her, after she was taken in custody. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>- WILSON sworn. I apprehend the prisoner at the Golden Chain, I asked her if she had got the watch, she said she had, and she would keep it, she said me nor no other blackguard should search her; we held her arms and a woman took the watch out; I produce it.</p>
               <p>(The watch identified by the prosecutor)</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave her a good character.</p>

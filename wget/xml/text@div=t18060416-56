On the 20th, or 21st of March I had my first floor painted, the prisoner forced himself into my bed room, to paint the outside of the window, as another man was to do that; when he had done he locked the door, and brought the key down; on the 6th of April I missed the spoons, I had no suspicion of any one but the prisoner, as I never admit any person into my room, either to make the bed or to sweep it but my wife and myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the spoons again. - A. Yes, at Mr. Hinckesman's I found the spoons and the sugar tongs; I took the prisoner up, I knew he lived in Dyot-street.</p>

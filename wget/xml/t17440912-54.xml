               <p>Pris. Coun. Did the Prisoner pay that money?</p>
               <p>Dare. It was laid down upon the book with the ring, I can't tell who laid it down - they were married according to the form of the Common-prayer and the Ceremonies of the Church of England; I took the Gentleman's hand and joined to the woman's, whether he thought the ceremony was over or no, I can't say, but he went to salute her, and I said, pray don't be in a hurry, have a little patience, and then you may do as you please - she was given away by a Gentleman I don't know. After the ceremony was over he gave the gentlewoman of the house a shilling for officiating as clerk, I said it was usual to give something more; he frowned, which made the cresses in his forehead appear more than ordinary, and I took particular notice of him - I observed his nose was remarkable; my Lord, there is something more corroborating, a gentleman came to me some little time afterwards, to know whether I had married one Mrs.

               <p>Mrs. Crook produced a book of marriages which she keeps, wherein was the entry of the marriage, made by Mr. Dare at the time, signed W. D. and agrees as to the names and date as deposed by Mr. Dare; she also confirmed every material circumstance mentioned by Mr. Dare.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a broker, and live at No. 4, Union-street Woolwich. On the 16th of September, about twelve o'clock, I was going home, and met the prisoner in High-street—she asked where I was going,—I said, "Home"—she followed me through the gardens, and wanted me to go with her—I told her no, I had got a wife of my own at home—she followed me to a corner, and would not let me go away, and then she put her hand into my pocket, took the money and ran away—I had a sovereign, a half-crown, a shilling, and a sixpence—I followed her—she turned a comer and I lost sight of her—I went to a public-house and saw her—I asked for my money—she said she had not got it—I called the watchman and told him what I had lost—he took her to the station—she was very rough, and refused to be searched by any but a woman—they said they would be very decent with her—the sovereign, half-crown, shilling, and <hi rend="italic">sixpence were found on her</hi>,</p>

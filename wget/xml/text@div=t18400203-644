                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Friday, the 23rd of Janu<lb></lb>ary, I saw the prisoner in Vauxhall-bridge-road wheeling a barrow, about three quarters of a mile from the prosecutor's house—I stopped him, and asked what he had got—he said some old iron, which he had brought from Pimlico—I let him pass on, and followed him to Rochester-row—I stopped him again, and at the bottom of the barrow I found four pieces of lead concealed under a piece of iron—he said he had been repairing a house for Mr. Harvey at Pimlico—I took him to the station-house, and went to Mr. Harvey—I then returned to the station-house, and the prisoner said he had told me a lie, that he had it from a man at Pimlico, but he would sooner suffer himself than tell me who it was—I went and found he had been at work repairing a roof for Mr. Deacon—I went on the roof of the house, and found the tiles removed, and the lead taken away—I compared the lead with the roof, and it fitted exactly with the nail-holes and other things—I went to his house, and found two more pieces, which made the quantity complete.</p>

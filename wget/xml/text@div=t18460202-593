                  </hi>. I am in the service of Thomas Goodman and John Goodman, at Stepney. On the 3rd of Oct, in consequence of suspicion, I thought it necessary to mark a great deal of iron, and I missed some—the next morning, when I went for the keys, I saw the prisoner with his back against the wicket of our premises—as soon as I unlocked the gate I saw this iron grating was put ready to be drawn under the gate—when I came back the grating was gone, and the prisoner also—I will swear this is my master's</p>

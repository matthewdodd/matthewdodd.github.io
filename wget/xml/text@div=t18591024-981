                  </hi>. I live at Woolwich; I am a widow—I know the prisoner; I went through the ceremony of marriage with him on 15th March, 1858, at St. John's church, Deptford—he never told me he was married—I knew him about 9 or 10 months before he married me—I left him on 23d of April last.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long did you live with him, altogether? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About 14 or 15 months—I had two children of my own—I did not know he was a married man when he married me—I know Mrs. Bailey, his daughter by his first wife—I had no conversation with her—I did not ask her about his wife—I know a man named Johnson—I never asked him if he knew that he was a married man—I had no conversation with him about his first wife—I and my mother had the first floor in the prisoner's house—I did not know he had been separated from his wife—I was 9 or 10 months in his house—I knew his first wife was dead—I knew his second wife was alive, just before I left him—I did not know it at the time I married him—his daughter by his first wife did not come backwards and forwards, I don't think she was ever there but two or three times; I only saw her once—my mother did not see her—his daughter was not coming backwards and forwards while he was paying his addresses—I did not speak to Mrs. Bailey and Mr. Johnson, and ask them if I should get into trouble by marrying him, as he had a wife—I was very ill—the prisoner supported me during that' time—I had to work—he is a plumber, painter, and glazier—I worked at dress-making—a subscription was got up for me, to put me in some little way of business, but I did not have the subscription at all.</p>

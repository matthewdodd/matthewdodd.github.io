On the 30th of November the prisoner brought a parcel to my house, and asked me to let him leave it there till he called for it—it remained in my possession three weeks—I did not know what jt was—I showed it to Mr. Lambert on the 21st of December—it was then opened, and it was these four new tacks—I gave them up to Ayliffe that evening.</p>

I received four sacks from Mrs. Taylor—I then went to Mr. Lambert's, and took the prisoner into custody—I searched his boxes, with his permission, but found nothing there—the prisoner was in his shirt-sleeves—I asked if he had a coat to pat on—he said yes, he had one down at the slaughter-house—I went there with him, went up into the loft, and he took his coat and waistcoat out of a corn bag, in an empty corn-bin—I afterwards found this empty sack in the corn-bin—when I first took him, I asked if he knew any thing about the sacks at Mrs. Taylor's—he said he did not—while I was up stairs, searching his boxes, he was about saying something—I cautioned him again, and he then admitted that he did know about the sacks.</p>

On the 1st of June I was at the White Horse public-house, in Maiden-lane; I staid there - the prisoner came in soon after I got there, and sat at the next table; I went out between four and five o'clock - I went into a field near <placeName id="t18290611-324-crimeloc1708">Kentish-town</placeName>

               <p>WILLIAM LADWICK. I am an officer. On the first of June, between four and five o'clock, I was in the field; I saw the prosecutor, the prisoner, and three others - the prosecutor had hold of a table-cover, which he claimed, and said the prisoner had taken it; the prisoner said that he awoke the prosecutor up, or he would have been robbed by the others, and that he had been drinking in the same house with them, but the prosecutor denied it; the prosecutor said if he would go to the White Horse, and the landlord would deny that he had been there, he would forgive him; we went - the landlord said he had not been there, but the landlady said he had; I took the prisoner to the watch-house - he struck me in the face on the road, and was rescued at the Bellisle; I took him again at eight o'clock the next night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you, on the first examination, swear to him as the man? A. Yes, and he was remanded, that I might find the parties who rescued him - I found a sixpence and some copper on him.</p>
               <p>JAMES GRANT re-examined. The others were his comrades; I said to him, "Are not you the man who was drinking with me at the White Horse, a few minutes ago?" he said, "No - I am pot-boy at the King of Prussia public-house, and am gathering my pots;" he struck me a violent blow, and said he had saved me from being robbed by the others, but it was no such thing - he afterwards said he had been at the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Were you not asleep? A. I was nearly asleep; my eyes were shut; he had the cover in his hand when I awoke; I had not drank much - I was not tipsy.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

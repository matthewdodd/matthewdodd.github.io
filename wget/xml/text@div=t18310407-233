               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What is the peculiar make? A. They are made to fit candlesticks which I have - they are not a common length; I had them made short for the use of the bed-room; they are tallow - I had not sold any carpets - I had a man named Hill in my employ; I sold him some carpet once, but I sold none while the prisoner lived with me - when I said I had not sold any carpets, I meant while the prisoner had lived with me - some of these pieces are old, and some are much worn - I know nothing of the prisoner buying any carpet of Hill - I may have sold him six or seven patterns, or there might be twenty; these may be called remnants; they are cut up I took the prisoner on the recommendation of our head porter, Hill - I believe he had lived formerly with my predecessor, for four or five years.</p>

            . I am an officer, of High-street. I went to the prisoner's lodgings on the 14th of March; he was not at home, but his wife was - I found some of these carpets on the floor, and some on a chair - the candles were in a cupboard - I was called down stairs, and when I got up again, I found his wife had removed them into another room - I took the prisoner there between five and six o'clock next morning, and told him it was on suspicion of stealing various things from his master - he said, "My wife has told me all about it; I have not taken any thing" - he did not show the least fear.</p>

                  </hi>. I was barman in the service of Mr. Walker, who keeps the Duke of Cambridge. I lived in one of his other houses at the west-end for fifteen months—I had been at the Duke of Cambridge about a month before the prisoner was apprehended—when I went there, the prisoner was barman—one afternoon, about a fortnight before he was apprehended, we were both in the bar, and happened to be talking about the house where I had lived before in Mr. Walker's service—the prisoner asked me if I thought my fellow-servant up there ever took anything from the till—I said I could not exactly answer the question, but I believed that the last servant who lived with me would not have been particular, if he had stopped there long—the prisoner said, "Why should we work and slave ourselves for nothing, and not be paid for it?"—he then said, "If we put our heads together, we might get a sum of money each for ourselves in a few months"—I objected to the proposal, and said it would be sure to be found oat—I ultimately agreed to the proposal—he said, "It will be sure not to be found out, for I will secrete it where no person will find it"—after long persuasion, I agreed to taking money from my master's till—there was nothing said about the share that I was to have of it—about a week after, I rather objected to its going on further—on the day after the first conversation, I saw him about ten o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing take some money from the till—he then took the glass-cloth and the counter-cloth out to wring, and put the money in his pocket—he had the money under his hand—the glass-cloth was over his right hand, and the counter-cloth in his other hand—he had the glass-cloth in his hand at the time he took the money, and he covered it over his hand directly—he went out, and returned in about two minutes—he told me he had taken two shil<lb></lb>lings, and he said, "I have it here," pointing to his pocket—the same after<lb></lb>noon, I saw him take money in the same way from the till, and he put it in his pocket in the same way, by taking the cloths outside—he told me he put the money in his pocket—the next time was in the evening; he took money</p>

               <p>in the same way—T could not see what he took—he told me he had taken money, and told me the sum, but I forget—between then and 24th July, I saw him at my master's till four or five times every day—he took money from the till in the way I have explained—I think four or five days after is commenced he told me—"I have the money all safe that I have taken; I have got it in the cellar"—about a, week after it commenced, I asked him if he could let me have a few shillings; I believe I said ten shillings; and he said, "Here is a pound for you"—he went into the cellar and fetched it, and gave it me—I was in the back-kitchen when I asked him, and from there I could see the entrance to the cellar; I saw him go, and he returned, and gave me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.'s-worth of silver, wrapped in brown paper—it was different kinds of silver; I believe there were two half-crowns amongst it—on the day previous to his apprehension I went out for a holiday, and on that day, about 9 o'clock in the morning, he gave me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver, wrapped up in brown paper, the same as the other—I did not ask him for it, but he said he would go and fetch it—I was in the bar, and he went down and fetched it up—he said, "That is half the money I have taken," or, "that I have got"—I took the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and went to my brother-in-law, who keeps the King's Head in Belvedere-road, Lambeth; his name is Hodson—I told him the circum<lb></lb>stance, and he went to Mr. Walker's—I stopped in his house while be went.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Duke of Cambridge, in Whitecbapel-road. The prisoner was my barman—I think he came into my service on 29th May—I agreed with him, as I had with the barman previously—he was to have 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the first month; if I did not like him, I was to give him a week's warning—I was to give him a week's wages in advance—he had his board and lodging—when the month was up, he asked me on what terms he was going on; I said, "You shall go on another month on the same terms"—he had received 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of me in the whole—when he came to me, he said he had lived with a person named Clark three months previously—he said his money was nearly exhausted, he could not live on air; and if I did not employ him, or he could not get another situation, he intended to bring an action against his former master for defamation—Grapes was in my service—the prisoner would have access to my till, as all my barmen have—there was money of all kinds in the till—the prisoner got up at half-past four o'clock in the morning—after he had been there some time, I got up early one morning, and saw him take the money out of the small till—he turned it out on a small recess, and examined the sixpences and shillings all minutely, to see if they were marked—he afterward replaced them in the till—he put them all in, as far as I know—I saw him do that on two mornings—on the evening of 23rd July a person named Hodson came to me—I found him at my house about ten—I had never seen him before—I knew Grapes was brother-in-law to a person of that name—Mr. Hodson made a communication to me, and on that I lighted a candle, and took Mr. Hodson and my son, and examined my cellar—I put my band between two joists on a large beam in the bar-cellar, and found a package of silver wrapped in brown paper—I opened it, and counted it—there was exactly 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in different coins—Mr. Hodson and I went <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the station—I got the assistance of two officers—we examined the cellar—I showed them the place where I found the package, and I found another package, which I think I gave to them—I examined more minutely, and there was another package—two of them contained 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-worth of silver, and the other 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I marked the contents of the packages, and delivered them to the policemen—they took down the marks, and wrapped the packages up again—they put the money back—the officers were placed in the cellar about four in the morning of 24th July, and they brought the prisoner to me between eight and nine—he was searched in my presence, and the officers took from his pocket a bag containing 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold—I saw the three packages of silver taken from him, and some loose silver besides—the packages were opened in my presence, but I did not examine them, because they had all marks outside the packages, and they were in the same manner wrapped up—I said to the prisoner, "You have been robbing me this long time, I have found you out at last"—he said, "I have been completely inveigled into it"—I said, "Who inveigled you?"—he said, "That makes no matter"—I had missed money previous to 24th July—I had found my takings were short; and when I and my mistress went out together, which is very seldom, there was invariably from 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. less than what we ought to have.</p>

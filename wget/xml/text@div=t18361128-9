                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoe maker, and live in Field-lane, in the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn. On the 31st of October I had been very ill in bed for some time—I do not know any thing about the fastening of the house—about two o'clock in the morning I was sitting up in bed, and heard a violent knocking at the door—shortly after, my young man, who sleeps below in the shop, came and knocked at my bed-room door, and gave an alarm—I could not get up, but desired him to take the keys of the shop—there was a knocking at the outer door—the keys were in my room—he took and went down, and was down stairs about an hour</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the employ of Mr. Ford. On the 31st of October I was disturbed about two o'clock in the morning by the watchman knocking—I went to master's door, got the keys, and went down and unlocked the door—the watchman showed me where the house had been broken—the shop-door is in two parts, forming a hatch, and is fastened by two bolts which go across it—violence had been used to those bolts, and a person could then enter the shop, which is part of the dwelling-house—I searched to see if there was any body in the house, but found nobody—next morning the policeman produced these boots and shoes—I know them to be master's—I had tried this pair of boots on a gentleman on the evening of the 31st of October, and said to the prisoner, "Look what high boots these are"—he had been a shopman of ours—I knew him before—I know this pair of boys' boots, and this pair of second<lb></lb>hand ones was in the shop at ten o'clock that night—the prisoner had assisted me to shut up the shop that night about ten o'clock, and mistress gave him a supper, and I fastened the two bolts with his assistance—here are two more pairs of shoes which I know—they are always in the window—I missed them in the morning—I know them to be the same—here is another pair, but I cannot swear these were taken out that evening.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You had these boots in your hand on the evening in question? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; they were at the side of the shop, hanging on pegs—I had this one pair of boots in my hand about nine o'clock—the prisoner stopped to supper—I saw him go away—our shop is at the corner of Holborn—he left about a quarter past ten o'clock—I am quite sure the shop was fastened after he left—I had seen him bolt the door in question—I fastened the door after him when he left, that was not the door which was broken—I am sure all the doors were fastened—I was the last person that went to bed—we had no customers in the shop after nine o'clock.</p>

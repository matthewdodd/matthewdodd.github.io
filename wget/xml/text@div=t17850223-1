               <p>Do you recollect what names he mentioned? - He said, Peter was one, and Will was another; I went to the prisoners lodging directly, with a man that called me, to a place called Vine-street, at the bottom of Ropemaker's-field, and when I came to their lodgings there was no admittance, I understood the prosecutor had lodged there, but did not at that time, but the prisoners lodged there then; I knocked at the door, but the mistress of the house was a foreigner, she answered me out of the window, and said I should not come in; then I went away and came back, and she was coming down stairs to the door, and she had opened the street door and I rushed in, and I searched the house and found a man and woman in the house.</p>
               <p>Did you find either of the prisoners there? - No, I went back again to Lime-house corner, between fifty and sixty yards where the affair happened, and went into a public house, and I looked round the taproom and there was the prisoner Peter, but I not knowing him, he passed me as I was drinking a glass at the bar, and he went into the street, and the prosecutor was leaning over the post at the corner of the street, facing the public house, and he called out constable! constable! there is Peter, there he runs; I run after him directly, and he run through a narrow passage out of Fore-street, into Ropemaker's-field; he kept running on, but I lost sight of him, then he went into a little alley, but I took him about ten yards from his lodgings, where I had been to search for him; the prosecutor, and the man who called me to his assistance were leaning on the nossil of a pump, the prosecutor was bleeding: I brought the prisoner Peter to him, and said is this the man you want? he said this is Peter, and that is the man that took me by the throat; and I took him away immediately and put him in the cage, and then ordered the man to make a fire, and let the prosecutor sit by the fire, and the other man that came to my assistance told me where to find this man, the prisoner Will: I sent to the constable of the parish for two more men, and went away directly to the lodgings of this Will, and they would not give us admittance for a great while, till at last I said I would break the door open, after sometime we got admittance, and the prisoner Will that stands here, was in bed, and another man with a woman in the middle of them; and we took him and put him in Shadwell watch-house, I took the prisoner that I had at Limehouse up to Shadwell and they were all three put into the room, and the other little man that was in bed with him; and the prosecutor the next day at the Justices pointed out these two men, he said, he knew the other man, but he was not with them.</p>

               <p>The prisoner Iverson is a lodger of mine, he has lodged in our house for three quarters of a year and better; I never knew any think at all amiss of him of any kind, he has been a very good man so long as I have known him, he goes to sea in general, but he is at home at present, and he was cutting up wood to send to the chandlers shop; we never heard any thing of the robbery, till they came to take him out of his bed, at half past eleven at night; they took another man along with him on suspicion.</p>
               <p>Did they lay together? - I do not know for that, I believe so.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of a woman that was along with them? - Yes, there was a woman along with him, the prisoner's wife.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing whether they were all three in bed together? - I do not know, I believe so.</p>
               <p>Do you know where the prisoner Iverson had been? - He was at home all the afternoon, he was at home from six in the evening till eight.</p>
               <p>Mind what you say, you say that he was at home at your house from six to eight that evening? - Yes, Sir, he was not out from six to eight.</p>
               <p>How do you know that? - I am pretty sure of that.</p>

               <p>The prisoner Iverson was in the house from six till nine, till the watchman went past nine, he lodged in the house nine months, and behaved very honest and just, and went to Greenland in the time.</p>
               <p>Was you in the house when he was taken? - Yes, we were all in bed, I was in my own apartment, it was about half after eleven when they knocked at the door, and I believe he was out of the house by twelve, because they disputed some time.</p>

               <p>I have lodged in this house almost sixteen months, I was in his company at half after six or rather better, and I went to bed and never saw him after; he was chopping up penny bundles of wood when I saw him.</p>
               <p>Is the prisoner Iverson a married man? - I cannot tell, he lived in the back parlour.</p>
               <p>Harvey. This man that came up just now, was the man that went to shew me where Iverson was.</p>
               <p>Jury to Harvey. When you searched them, was any money found upon them? - I searched the first man, and found a large knife and four-pence halfpenny; in the waistcoat pocket of the other man we found a knife, and, I believe, three-pence.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a labouring man: On Thursday, the 25th of February last, I was going to work about three minutes past seven in the morning; I saw the prisoner Bunn come out of Mr. James's premises with a sack, which appeared to me about half full, but of what I could not tell; I did not stop him; I had no suspicion of him; I thought he had been to sweap the chimnies; I told the servants afterwards when I found they had missed the cloaths, that I saw a chimney-sweeper come out of the house with a sack about half full, and that I thought he must have them; I saw them afterwards at Worship-street.</p>
               <p>- BRYAN sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant to Mr. James; I was going to work a little after seven in the morning on the 25th of February; I saw the prisoner Bunn come into the yard; Constable stopped at the gate while he got over, and then Bunn went from Mr. James's publie yard into his private yard, with a sack across his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179604060045"></xptr>shoulder, which appeared to me to be empty; I did not see them go away, nor I did not see him go into the house; he was making towards the house.</p>

               <p>I am an officer belonging to Worship-street: On the 25th of February, I was sent for to apprehend the prisoners; I searched them, but found nothing upon them; I took them to the Office; I afterwards learned where the coat and the two spencers were sold; the next day I found where one of the coats was sold again a second time, at a Mrs. Cannon's, in Field-lane, (produces a great coat.)</p>
               <p>- BLACKITER sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an officer belonging to Worship-street; I went with Peach to apprenhend the prisoners; Constable told me, after he had been there some time, where he had sold the coats, and we found them.</p>
               <p>- STEVENS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a dealer in old cloaths and iron; I bought of the prisoner, Constable, a great coat, half a great coat, and a spencer; I gave him 7s. 4d. for them, about the 24th, or 25th of February, between seven and eight in the morning, at my house in Grub-street; I am sure he is the man, the other prisoner was with him; I paid the money to Constable. This is the coat and this is the spencer.</p>

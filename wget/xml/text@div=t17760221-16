               <p>On the 9th of this month, about a quarter before two in the afternoon, the prisoner came to my house to look at a lodging; my wife desired she would walk into a little room even with the shop; I was down in the cellar chopping wood, I came up to her; she was sitting in the little room; I saw the watch hanging there; my wife was serving in the shop at that time; she was there about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; I missed my watch in about five minutes after the prisoner was gone: she agreed for the room, and desired me to go for her character to the Ship and Baker, a public house in the Borough, which she said her sister kept: I ran to the Ship and Baker, but they did not know any thing of her. She had been before to see the lodging and a man with her: I recollected that the man said he lived at No 2. Windmill-street; I went there; I enquired at the Black Bull, and found the prisoner had lived servant there; I got a direction to a public house in Bear-street, Leicester-fields, where I found the prisoner; I charged her with taking the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177602210016"></xptr> watch, she denied it; I afterwards found the watch at one Wood's, a pawnbroker, at the corner of George-court, Princes-street.</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker; the prisoner pawned a watch with me on the 9th of February, between the hours of one and four in the afternoon, in the name of Mr. Murray; she said it was her husband's property: I lent her a guinea upon it.</p>
               <p>[The watch was produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor.]</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I had been several times to the prosecutor's about the lodging; he said he could not get the people out that had it; but when he got them out I should have the room: while we were in the little room he wanted to lye with me; he said he had no money, and gave me the watch, and bid me keep it till he came and brought me some money; he never came, and so I pawned it.</p>
               <p>SMITH. No such thing passed: we were in a little room adjoining to the shop; my wife was in the shop all the time and the door was open.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave her a very good character.</p>

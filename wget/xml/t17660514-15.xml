I thought to change the indentures were sufficient. I missed only the shifts when I discharged her; then I went to Mr. Gunston's, a pawnbroker, and found a saucepan, a shift, and an apron; before I went there, the father affronted me in the street very much, and said he would take me up for attempting his character; then I took out a warrant against the girl, fearing he should do me an injury. She was taken up and committed; she would not own to any one thing before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. If the father had not abused you as you say, should you have done as you have?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you make her any promise?</p>
               <p>E. Hebbert. I said, if she would confess what she had done with the things, I would not meddle with her; this I said to the father: then she said she had taken the shift and lent it to a girl that was going to be married, and she took my key in order to put it up again.</p>
               <p>Q. Who found her in cloaths?</p>
               <p>E. Hebbert. Her father and mother did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not use to take the girl to plays?</p>
               <p>E. Hebbert. Her father ordered me to go to the play with her as her guardian, as she was young.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid for seeing the plays?</p>
               <p>E. Hebbert. He used to give her money to pay for me and herself, and my cousin when she went. I have been a school-mistress; I brought her up at school; there is but one saucepan mine, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176605140012"></xptr> other is the property of

               <p>Stoakes. She was twelve years of age last April, but we put her a year forward when bound, that she might not be thought too young. I wish she had went to her grave when I bound her to that gentlewoman, she took her to all plays.</p>

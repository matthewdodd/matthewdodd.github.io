                  </hi>. I am a stoker of a steam ship. On 19th Feb. I was with the last witness at the Earl of Chatham public house—I saw the two prisoners there—I recollect the last witness pulling out of his pocket his silver guard, and his discharge, and a call, and so on—he pulled out a sove<lb></lb>reign, some silver, and some halfpence, and placed them on the table—the landlord got possession of them; the prosecutor got them back, and put them in his pocket—he afterwards pulled them all out again, and laid them on the table again—the sovereign was not there, and he said he had lost a sovereign—the sovereign was found that time in his own jacket</p>

I was at the Earl of Chatham on the night of 19th Feb.—I heard the prosecutor say he had lost a sove<lb></lb>reign—it was found in his jacket pocket, and the last witness put it on the table; Dearlove picked it off the table, and also fivepence-halfpenny in coppers—the last witness said to him, "Where is the sovereign, you b—y villain?" and he passed it into Holmes's hand, and in about ten seconds Holmes passed out of the room—the halfpence fell on the floor, and the last witness picked them up.</p>

               <p>What was there so particular that you could know the hides? - By the colour and the mark.</p>
               <p>Was there any mark that you could know them by? - Nothing no more than another cow has.</p>
               <p>I cannot understand how you could know the hide unless there was something particular described on it? - I know them vastly well; in the first piece, the horns were cut both the tips of them off.</p>
               <p>Is not that a common thing? - I believe not; it is with us: the prisoner said these were the two cows that he had sold.</p>
               <p>What coloured cows were they? - The one was black and white, and the other a brindle, he said he bought them, but of whom he did not say, he said he bought them at Ware, and gave six pounds for them, but he did not know the man he bought them off.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before at all? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is he? - A butchering lad at Ware.</p>
               <p>Does he carry on business for himself? - Now and then he kills a sheep.</p>

               <p>I am a butcher, the cows were at our slaughter-house, the prisoner brought them down to us on the second of this month with intent to have them killed, and on the Friday after they were killed, they were to go to Leadenhall, he said they were his own property; we never ask any thing about them.</p>
               <p>Is it customary for the country butchers to bring up cattle to be killed? - In the manner that he came to me, he came to me as if he had been standing in Smithfield market, and could not sell them, and so he brought them to me to be killed; on Sunday morning following he came to me with Dellow the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I bought these two cows of a man at Ware for six pounds, I drove them to Smithfield that night, and they were not sold, and I drove them to Bradbury's to be killed.</p>
               <p>Court. Why did not you take the prosecutor to Bradbury's the first time you came to town? - Because I thought it would be very hard for me to lose my money, nobody at London knows me; the hides were both all over blood, and there were more hides like that.</p>
               <p>Court to Bradbury. What reasons did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140027"></xptr> the prosecutor give you for knowing the hides? - When I came in Dellow said, that is my old cow's hide, and then he went to the others; there were some more hides lay with them, but none like the black and white hide.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any mark on the horns? - No.</p>
               <p>Jury. What were the cows worth? - About ten pounds.</p>
               <p>To Prisoner. Had you any receipt? - No Sir, we never take any receipts; I was bred and born in Ware, I live along with my mother, I have no witnesses, I thought I was to be tried at Hertford.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. Can you be sure they are your cows? - I can indeed, they have been in my yard a dozen or thirteen years.</p>

On the 5th of June, between the hours of four and five, I was sitting in my kitchen eating my dinner, I saw a person stepping into the shop, I immediately ran up stairs, the shop boy followed me, and going towards the shop window I missed a roll of carpet out of the shop window.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you left it - A. In the shop window. I immediately said, there was a roll of carpet gone out of the window. I ran out of doors, went up a passage of a public-house that adjoins our shop, it is a thoroughfare that leads into Castle-street. On coming to the top of the passage I looked to my left, I saw a man with a roll of carpet on his shoulder. I ran after him, and was going to lay hold of his coat; he threw the carpet down in the middle of the street, and ran off. I called out, stop thief; several people followed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you follow him - A. No, I took the property home to my master's shop. I had not been in the shop above three minutes before the prisoner was brought.</p>
               <p>Q. Is yours an open window - A. It is not; he must come into the shop to get at it. I am certain he is the man.</p>

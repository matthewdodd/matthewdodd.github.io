I am barmaid at the Angel Tavern, Warwick Street, Regent Street—on 19th December I served the prisoner with some gin—he gave me a half-crown—I put it to my teeth, bent it, and told him it was bad—I showed it to Mr. Little, the landlord, who is now in Devon<lb></lb>shire—the prisoner was given in custody, remanded, and discharged—the half-crown was dull, and very light; it bent easily.</p>

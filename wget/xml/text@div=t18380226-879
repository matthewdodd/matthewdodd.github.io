My father, James Strother, is owner of four houses in High-street, Woolwich, one of which is untenanted—I saw the windows all fastened the day after Christmas-day—my father lost one glazed sash, and one was found on the prisoner on Tuesday evening, in one of the rooms on the pre<lb></lb>mises—it is here—it is my father's.</p>

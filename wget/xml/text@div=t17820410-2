            . I am a recruiting serjeant, I was at Birmingham when this happened, on the Sunday after I came to town Mrs. Batster was apprehended, they searched but not properly, I believe they were Denmore, Catchpole, and Seasons, I was not present when the others were taken, I was present when they found the petticoat upon Rawlins. Mrs. Batster desired, last Thursday was three weeks, to be admitted an evidence, she asked me if she could be admitted an evidence; a considerable time after Batster was taken I had been down to Birmingham and up again, in that interim of time, it might be three weeks after she was taken up, I told her I would do all I could in my power to save her, but not to send me upon a foolish errand before an alderman of the city of London, without she could bring good grounds for being an evidence. I went to her next day, in Wood-street Compter, and found she was in the same story, and she desired me to go and make application, which I did upon the examination day, she called me again, and said, do you know your wife's clothes,</p>
               <p>I said I do not, if they were my own I should know them, she said do you go to the Poultry Compter, and you will find her petticoat. She was examined when the the officer came, and my wife found her petticoat upon Rawlins's back, according to the directions of Mrs. Batster; out of decency I went into another room; the officer has the petticoat here; I desired my wife to pull off one of her three petticoats she had on, that the officer might have the petticoat to keep.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>

               <p>To Mrs. Vines. What reason did the officers give upon the fast day for not taking Batster into custody? - They said they did not belong to the city, and they could not, I knew no better.</p>

               <p>Court. How long have you known her? - I am a lodger in the house with her these two years we have been lodgers in the house together; as to the character I really cannot say much to it at all, but the night before the fast day I remember she was at home, and eat her supper at home; I really cannot answer the day of the month, I came up about eight at night with a child in my arms,

               <p>Jury to Mrs. Vines. When you heard the old woman's voice, and heard her let in, why did not you cry out? - I was afraid; the reason was they threatened to kill me before; they threatened to cut my head off, here is the knife that was in the room.</p>

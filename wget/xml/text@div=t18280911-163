            . I am a watchman. At half-past two o'clock in the morning, I heard, what sounded to me, like the crack of a door, at Mr. Woolrych's house - I went there and saw the kitchen-window shoved up; I listened two or three minutes and heard the foot of some person in the kitchen - I rang the bell and gave the alarm; we searched the house, but nothing was found - I went there again about half-past five o'clock, and the lady at No.7, gave me information; I went to No. 8, and from there I went through the loft of No. 7, which I found open, and all the back doors were open into the yard; I then went to No. 6, and fould the prisoner in the privy - there is a poplar tree growing close to the wall, between Nos. 6 and 7; I saw the marks of feet in that tree - I had no conversation with the prisoner, but in going to Marlborough-street, I shewed him this chisel, which I had found on the dresser of No. 5, and asked him how he got it - he said he bought it at ten o'clock the night before, and he did not remember leaving it in the kitchen.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was with Lilly when he searched the house, and when he found the prisoner, as he has stated - we asked him if there was any other person with him; he said No - he said he bought the chisel at ten o'clock at night, and entered the premises at half-past eleven; he said he bought the chisel for the purpose of entering the premises - I cannot say whether he said to rob them; he said had Mr. Woolrych been in town, he should have taken something, but not much; but had he known he was out, he should not have taken anything.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you tell this to the Magistrate? A. I made the same statement, and the evidence was read over to me: Mr. Fitzpatrick, the Magistrate's clerk, asked me the questions - the prisoner stated he had been in the house from half-past eleven till half-past two o'clock; he did not tell me he never had a notion of stealing anything, but it was merely to frighten Goodwin; I never heard that expression - he did not say in my hearing that he never meant to rob the house: I did say, when we found him in the privy, that I wondered what brought him there, if he did not mean to rob - I did not know him before; he did not say how he knew that Mr. Woolrych was not at home - the other watchman was with me and heard what passed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The watchman asked me what I intended to do to the house; I told him it was not with an intent of robbing at all, but I did not say a word of Mr. Woolrych's being in the country - I had no intention of robbing; I knew there was nothing in the house.</p>

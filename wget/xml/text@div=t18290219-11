On the 6th of February, about half-past one o'clock in the day, this shawl was on the counter, near the door; the prisoner came into the shop about two, with another young woman, and asked to look at some prints for aprons - I showed her several, and opened them over the shawl; she wished to see more -I opened another piece on the counter, and missed the shawl - she asked for a yard of the last print, which I cut off, it came to 1s.; she put down 2s. to pay for it - I returned her 1s.; I put the print into paper, walked to the middle of the shop, and saw the shawl was gone - I then told her I missed a shawl, and she must have got it - I went round to see if she might have dropped it - I told them both I missed the shawl, and must search them; I took them to the end of the shop, and was taking them into the passage, when the prisoner dropped the shawl from under her gown - she must have taken it off the counter, it fell from under her clothes; I sent a neighbour for an officer - her companion went with her to the watch-house; she was taken before the Lord Mayor and discharged.</p>

            . I am a constable, and took the prisoner; she used very abusive language, and denied having taken the shawl.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was I sober or not? A. She was not sober; I think she could walk very well - I think she could distinguish right from wrong; she was not deprived of her senses - she had got two shawls which appeared new; she had no money, but her companion had 13s. - the prisoner asked me three hours after, what she was taken for.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

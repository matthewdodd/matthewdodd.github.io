                  </hi>. I live at Lawrence Pountney-Lane. On Tues<lb></lb>day morning, the 21st of Feb., I was in the Strand about half-past two or three o'clock—I had been to the theatre—I went into a public-house in the Strand, and saw the prisoner there in company with three or four other women—they asked me to treat them, which I did—one of them named Williams became intoxicated, and the prisoner with others took her away—I remained in the house half an hour or more, and the prisoner returned—I went out, she fol<lb></lb>lowed me, and persuaded me to go home with her—I went with her to New<lb></lb>castle-court, Strand—I saw nearly the whole of the same party there—I asked for the girl that had been taken away drunk—the prisoner took me to her—she was in bed with another girl—I took her into another room, and the prisoner and two other women also came in—they asked me to treat them again—I gave them half-a-crown—the prisoner was then sitting alongside of me on the bedside—after some time she asked me to give her my watch and pin to give to the landlady to take care of—I said I thought there was not the slightest occasion for that—she said "Yes, I think there is, because there are several other girls in the room, and I will not be answerable for them"—on that I gave her the watch and the pin, to give to the landlady to take care of till the morning—it was a watch, chain, key, and pin—I gave them separately—the watch, guard, chain, and key were attached—the pin was separate—I gave them to her, and she left the room—in the course of the night I heard some disturbance outside the room, and in consequence of what Williams, who I was with, said, I left the room, and went with the landlady and Williams to the prisoner, who I found in bed with a man in another room—I asked her for my watch and pin—she said she had not got them, she had left them on the drawers in the landlady's room, and did not know what had become of them—I immediately went down stairs—the land<lb></lb>lady sent for a policeman who came, I followed him up stairs into the prisoner's room, and he found the pin—I asked the prisoner for the watch again—she said if I would give her till the morning she would perhaps get it me—I gave her in charge.</p>

On the 21st of Feb., I was there in bed and asleep, when the prosecutor came—the prisoner asked him for his watch and pin—she said she was the landlady, then she said she was not, but she would give it to the landlady, for there were other women in the room, and they would be safer with the landlady—he refused at first, and then gave it her—he was sitting on the side of the bed—she went up stairs, and he staid with me in the room for about half an hour.</p>

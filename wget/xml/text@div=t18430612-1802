                  </hi>. I am a sailor, and lodge in Mary-street, Poplar. On Saturday, the 14th of June, about ten o'clock, I was coming from the West India Docks, and called on the prisoner, at Red Lion-court, Poplar—I knew her before—I told her I was in a <hi rend="italic">muck sweat</hi>—I had a coat on—I am not used to wear one—I took it off, and laid it on the table—she asked me what I was going to stand—I said I only had a penny—she said she had three half-pence, she would go and get a pint of ale with it—I said, "Bring me in a pipe along with you"—she brought a pipe—I went down stairs to light it, and left her in the room, with the coat—when I came up, in about five minutes, the coat and the prisoner were gone—I went out and spoke to the constable—I did not lend her the handkerchief to put round her neck—I cannot say what she did with it—this is the coat—it belongs to Edward Kitchen, my shipmate, who lent it me—it was in my custody.</p>

I live at Mile-end-gate, and am the wife of Joseph Jones—we keep a fruiterer's shop—somewhere about the 'second or third week in March, the prisoner came into my shop, between 8 and 9 in the evening, and asked for a bottle of ginger-beer—the price was a penny—he first put down a halfpenny for it—I said, "That is not enough;" and he took a shilling out of his mouth, and gave me that—I went to the till to put the shilling in, and found it was bad—Ruth Phil brook was present at that time—I put it on the shelf—about a week after that the prisoner came in again about 10 o'clock, and asked for a bottle of ginger-beer—he threw down a five-shilling piece first, and then said, "I can give you smaller change than that;"—and he put down a two-shilling piece—I looked at it well—I thought I knew the man, but I could not recognise him—I thought the two-shilling piece looked a good one, and I gave him the change, and put it in the till—there was no other there—I examined it again after the prisoner was gone, and found it was a bad one—I took it out, and put it away along with the shilling—I took no other florin from the time I took that till I examined it; it was directly after the prisoner Was gone—on Thursday, 12th May, about 11 o'clock at night, the prisoner came again—I recognized him directly—he asked for a bottle of ginger-beer, and gave me a shilling—I took it up and saw it was a bad one—I went out, called in a policeman, and said to him, in the prisoner's hearing, "This is the third time this man</p>

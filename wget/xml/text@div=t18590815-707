                  </hi>. I came up by the railway to Fenchurch-street on 4th July, about 5 minutes past 10 o'clock in the evening—I was looking for a cab for myself and family—I saw the prisoner and others—the prisoner drew himself up to me, and I could not get along—there were four more about him—he looked me in the face, and I thought something was wrong—I put my hand down, and found my watch was gone—I seized hold of him, and said, "You thief, you have stolen my watch"—I saw him put his hand out, and my watch was in it—he did not get rid of it the first time, and he drew his hand in again, and gave a sign, and put his hand out again, and a party took it—they almost broke my arm—they tried to put my arm down—I was prevented from laying hold of the prisoner's hand that had my watch, but I held him, and gave him in charge—my watch was worth about 10</p>

I was on duty in Railway-place, Fenchurch-street, on the night of 4th July, about 5 minutes past 10 o'clock—I heard a cry of "Police"—went up to the spot, and saw the prosecutor holding the prisoner—he told me he had stolen his watch out of his pocket, and given it to some one else, and he would give him in charge—I took him to the station—he gave me an address, but he said afterwards it was no use my going, it was not his address, it would be a lost journey for me to go over to the Walworth-road, where he had given me the address, but he would not tell me where he did live.</p>

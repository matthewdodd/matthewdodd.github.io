               <p>I lost my watch on the 30th of January, 1780. It was a gold one jewelled; it had to it a gold chain; a seal set in gold; a gold key, and a gold trinket. I was coming from a friend's house at Woodford Wells in Essex, in a post chaise; before I set out it was intimated to me that a number of robberies had been committed on the road a night or two before; therefore when I got into the chaise I hung my watch up by the hook on the lining of the chaise behind me, in order to secure it. I set off about nine o'clock, we came to town over Lea-bridge, through Hackney, and came into town at Shorditch. The chaise broke down in Bishopsgate-street, I suppose then it was near eleven o'clock. There was a gentleman in the chaise with me who is in the West-India trade; he is not here. We got out of the chaise in a hurry and took a Hackney coach to my sister's in Dyers-buildings, Holbourn, where I then resided. As I was going to bed I recollected I had left my watch in the chaise; I was satisfied it was safe as it was at the One Swan, Bishopsgate-street, where I have hired chaises for years. In the morning I went to the counting-house of Mr. Belvedore, in Bishopsgate-street, and sent my servant to enquire after the watch; he came back and said they could not find it. I then went myself, and I then understood that the post boy and the horses I went out of town with and brought me back did not belong to the inn, but were hired. I requested Mr. Sexton, the master of the inn to send for the boy; the prisoner went for him, as I understood; the prisoner was clerk to Mr. Sexton, the master of the One Swan; the post boy came, I threatened to have him taken up; supposing he must have my watch. Mr. Sexton, the post boy, and the prisoner, were in the counting-house when I challenged him with having my watch. He said he had not seen it; that he drove into the yard, took the horses out, and went home with them, as soon as he had told some of the people that there was a glass of the chaise broke, and bid them go down the yard to see that it was broke. I advertised the watch for three months at ten guineas reward, but never heard of it till about the 16th or 20th of December; then a person was taken up on offering it to pawn in the Strand; that was on a Saturday. I was desired to attend at the office in Bow-street on the Tuesday; I went and found the watch in the possession of the pawnbroker, and the chain in the possession of one of the men who attends the office.</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker. On Saturday, I believe it was the 16th of December, the prisoner brought a gold watch to me to pledge; I thought the watch too good for him to wear and stopped him; he said it was his own, and that his name was

He took the chain out of his master's hay loft and gave it me; he said some time afterwards that he found the watch in the chaise.</p>

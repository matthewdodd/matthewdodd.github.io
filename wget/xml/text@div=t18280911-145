               <p>- ATKINSON. I owed Mr. Brown 8s., which I paid the prisoner on the 6th of June, and took this receipt; (read.)</p>
               <p>MR. BROWN. He ought to have accounted to me that day, or the next, for this sum, but never did - I repeatedly asked him if he had received it after that time; he said he had not; he left me on the 16th of June, and on the very day I discharged him, I asked him if he had received Mrs. Bell's money - he said he had not; I said "I had proof of it;" and then he said he had received it, and would pay me - he might receive 3l. or 4l. in a week.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not you and he enter into some agreement about commission? A. Yes; he was to have a commission on all sums received - he introduced me to ten or twelve new customers - I think not more; he was to have ten per cent. on what new customers he obtained.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you put him into a mad-house? A. I did; I assisted in causing him to be put there; he went on the 16th of June, the day he was discharged - I thought him mad; I had not observed any symptons, and indeed at that time I did not know that he was mad, only from the account of his friends - he had said a number of silly and foolish things; I thought it not right to lock a man up as a felon, and consented to his being placed in an asylum - he was discharged from there in three weeks, the surgeons considering there was not a single sympton of madness in him; I believe I was under a mistake regarding his insanity.</p>

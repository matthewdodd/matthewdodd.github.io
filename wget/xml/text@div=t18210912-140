I had known the prisoner three or four years; I met her in Old-street, she asked me to give her a cup of tea - she came up, and had tea with me that afternoon, and came and drank tea with me regularly every day for a fortnight, and on this day fortnight she came up, I was washing - she was backwards and forwards all day, I was busy, I let her do as she liked; she brought a bundle in with her, and said she was going to take it to the washerwoman's in Gee-street, she put it in a chair close by the trunk; I went to the trunk, pulled out the coat and waistcoat, and threw them over my arm - she saw me put them back into the trunk. I turned my back to her, and went on washing; she went out of the room shortly after, and said she would return in half an hour. I looked out of the window, and saw that her bundle looked much larger than when she brought it in; I turned to the trunk, missed these things and my apron. I was never out of the room. She had the apron on when she came to the office. She is an unfortunate girl. My husband keeps me.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a married woman, are you - A. No, my Lord, I am not married.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. How long have you had a husband without being married - A. Since May twelve months. I have been an unfortunate girl. I did not induce her to walk the streets. She tells me she is twenty years of age - I am twenty-seven. I did not walk the streets with her. I never lent her things, nor did I pawn the coat.</p>

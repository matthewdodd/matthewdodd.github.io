                  </hi>. The prisoner did not pay to me those two sums received from Mrs. Cross, or the one received from Mr. Thornton—he takes out a certain number of quarts of milk a day—we have credit-customers and cash-customers, and he is told to give no credit upon his own account at all—if any wish for credit he is to place them on the books; therefore, if any of the customers get into his debt it is at his own risk and his own fault—he must either bring back the milk or the money—that is the understanding as to credit-customers—bills are furnished to him to collect the money—he is never called upon to pay money he has not received—these two bills of Mrs. Cross's are not genuine bills issued from our establishment; our bills are on blue paper, and there is a difference in the type—I am quite sure those two bills were not furnished from our establishment; there is "3, Mitre-street," instead of "3, Mitre-square"—bills are given to him every week.</p>

               <p>he gave him, and got a sovereign and a half in return, which he put into his waistcoat-pocket and lost it, the pocket having a hole in it—he told me the public-house was at the corner of Great Garden-street—I saw his waistcoat; it had a hole in it—I have not inquired about the printer of these bills; he did not tell me—he told me at once that he had them printed for his cash-customers—I have not found any of his cash-customers; I have been after them—I have found no other printed bills—I have inquired for them; I went to Mr. Wilson in the Whitechapel-road; he had none of these forged bills—he kept a running account with the man—that milk was charged to him when he came home, if he did not account for it.</p>

            . On Thursday evening, the 10th of April, about nine o'clock at night, I went up stairs to put my children to bed, it was dark, I left a bit of candle with them as I usually do, and I came down stairs, and having occasion to go up stairs to unlock a room door for a young man that sleeps in the house, I found my room door open.</p>
               <p>Q. What state was the outer door in. - A. When I went up stairs I shut the door, when I came down again I found the front door open.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the street door open, and your chamber door open. - A. Yes, and my two children were laying on the bed with only a sheet over them.</p>
               <p>Q. What age were they. - A. One four and the other two years old: I missed two blankets and a patch work quilt, one sheet was laying at the foot of the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see any of the things again. - A. They are in court now; I never saw the prisoner till I went to Bow-street office.</p>

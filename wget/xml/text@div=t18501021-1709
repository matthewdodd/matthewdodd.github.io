                  </hi>. I am apprentice to James Lane, a draper at Staines. On 19th Aug. the prisoner came to our shop, and gave me this note—he said he had brought it from Mr. Ashby—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Mr. James Lane: please let the bearer have one pair of trowsers, and a cap. S.J. Ashby")—in consequence of his presenting that note, I let him have a pair of cord trowsers and a cloth cap; such as a lad in his position of life would wear—I know Mr. Ashby, he is a coal-merchant at Staines—I was not acquainted with his handwriting—I had known the prisoner before by seeing him about the town—I showed the order to Mr. Lane, and put it on the file—about a month afterwards I took it to Mr. John Ashby, and also to Mr. Skidmore Ashby—Mr. John Ashby did not pay.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coal-merchant, at Staines. There are many persons of the name of Ashby at Staines—Lawrence brought this order to me; it is not written or signed by me—I never gave such an order—the prisoner has occasionally worked for me—I occasionally give an order to one of my regular workmen to go and get goods—I cannot tell whether the prisoner had the means of knowing that—Mr. Skidmore Ashby is my brother; he lives at Staines, I know his handwriting, this order is not his writing, nor the signature.</p>

I saw him again at night, and asked him for the shilling; he said he had sold the goods, but bad not got any money for them; the man's name is <hi rend="italic">Ted</hi> Holmes; he met me on the bridge close to Mr. Lane's, as I was along with a cart of Mr. Saunders's, with a load of bricks; I told sergeant Lee when he took me who the man was, and he knows him.

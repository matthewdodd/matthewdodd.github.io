                  </hi>. I am a ship-joiner, of Wapping. On 27th June, I was on Tower-hill; between twelve and one o'clock in the morning the pri<lb></lb>soner was there with two companions—she left them, came to me, caught my arm, and wished me to go home with her—she put her hand into my waist<lb></lb>coat pocket and extracted a crown—I accused her of taking it—she said she had not done it—her companion came up, and then she said she had got it, and intended to keep it—she went into a public-house—I followed her, she called for brandy, changed the crown, and requested me to drink, I declined—she then called for some gin—she afterwards came out—I gave her in charge.</p>

About half-past twelve o'clock that night the prisoner and Godfrey came together to the bar—the prisoner asked him what he would take to drink—he said he did not care, what she liked—she called for a quartern of brandy, and threw down a crown—bhe poured out a glass of brandy and gave it to him—I did not see him drink it—they sat down and talked—he had a bit of rose-tree in his hand, and was playing with her face with it—he saw the money lay down—he said nothing about taking it.</p>

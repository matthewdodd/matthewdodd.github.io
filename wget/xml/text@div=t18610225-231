               <p>other I cannot swear to positively, but there were two together—they walked straight before me up the Globe-road—Draper looked at me very hard—I thought perhaps he had seen me somewhere, and I stared at him just as well as he did at me—I do not know whether the other looked at me—he then came back and tore my chain off my neck—he had to pull it, because my chain was under my cloak, and he made me a very severe mark in doing it—he succeeded in getting the chain off my neck—he then ran away with it—I ran after him and called, "Thief! stop thief! my chain!"—and a little boy ran after him, and threw a stone at him, and I suppose it made him lame, he did not run so fast, and I saw him throw the chain over his back, and the little boy caught it, and brought it to me—I did not see Draper again till the police-constable fetched me to the station, and I picked him out of six men—that was on the same evening—I am quite sure he is the man—I did not see what the person did, who was with Draper—he was behind me—I did not feel him touch me in any way—I did not see him after he went behind me—I did not see him till at the police-court—a little girl told me he was the man, and I gave him in charge—there was a locket attached to the chain, and two gold keys—4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the value of the chain and locket.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

About 3 o'clock on the afternoon of the 6th I took Elgee into custody, in consequence of what the prosecutrix told me—I received the chain from the prosecutrix—I took Elgee to the station and detained him—I then went to where the robbery was alleged to have been committed, and the locket was handed to me by a woman—it was picked up by a little child between where the chain was picked up and where the robbery was committed—it was not picked up while I was there.</p>

I asked him what was the matter; he told me I was concerned with another man that stole a watch-chain. I said I did not, neither was I the person that was with the person who stole the watch chain. He took me to Arbour-square station. I went with him. When I got there I was inspected by the policemen, and they said, "No, he don't look like him," that is what the youths stated when I got there. I did not have any hand in the robbery at all.</p>

               <p>Thomas Orrel. On the 15th of April I was at Mr. Essex's Ball, in Old Gravel Lane, Wapping, and between 1 and 2 in the Morning I was coming<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173704200016"></xptr> from thence with four Women (and a young Fellow to light us) to my Lodging at Mrs. Wetherden's by Bell-Dock.

He at the Bar clapp'd a Pistol to my Breast, and bid me stand and deliver, or I was a dead Man: This he repeated two or three Times. I am sure the Prisoner is the Man, for we had a Lanthorn before us, with two Candles in it, and I could distinguish his Face very plain. He was at Work but the Day before, scraping the Ship that I belong to; I knew him again, and am positive he was the Man: He took my Watch, and 8 s. in Money from me, and made off directly with his Consort. My Company ran away when they saw I was attacked by two Men.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was a Bed that Night before Ten o'Clock. Pray what Cloaths had I on?</p>
               <p>Orrel. The same dirty Py'd-Jacket that you have on now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. By what other Marks do you know me?</p>
               <p>Orrel. By your one Eye.</p>

Mrs. Wetherden said, I have a Suspicion of the Man that scrapes your Ship, I'll call him in, in the Morning to look at my Birds: Mr. Orrel was not positive to the Man over Night, but next Morning he was, and yet he told the Justice's Clerk afterwards, he could not be sure, whether he was the Man, or not.</p>

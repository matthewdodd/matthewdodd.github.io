               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Yes. He was a master of one of my vessels, employed in taking beer and water to his Majesty's navy and transports. I have known him near two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him near the place about that time - A. Yes, two or three days before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barry. Where did you keep the horse and chaise - A. About two hundred yards from my dwelling.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he ever drive the horse and chaise for you - A. Never that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor have you any reason to believe he knew that to be your horse and chaise - A. I believe he did. When he had occasion to draw stores to the vessel he used the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour was the horse - A. Bay.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your name on the chaise - A. My initials are, and on the harness, J. R. When I had lost my horse and chaise I pursued it. I came up to London, and then went to Bow-street office, and a week after I was sent for to identify the horse and chaise.</p>

Should he have stolen the horse and chaise he would prove that I purchased it of him, as his receipt is now in court. Gosport is the place of my nativity. I did not know that the horse and chaise belonged to my prosecutor. When I arrived at London I slept at the Bull Inn.

             came to the door of the Bull Inn, and entered into conversation with me. On the 5th of July I slept at Fulham, and that morning I purchased the horse, which, unfortunately, sailor-like, flushed with hopes to have a horse and chaise to ride about for a time, thinking I should not lose much when I sold it. The chaise was sold publicly at the cross-roads. I then came to Paddington, the White Lion; and after riding the mare up and down the road, I sold the mare to Mr. Jenkins, for fourteen pounds, and gave him the receipt, that I had just bought the mare. I am deprived of putting my trial off. I had lived with my master from fifteen to eighteen months.</p>

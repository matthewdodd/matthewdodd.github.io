                  </hi>. I live in Broadway, Hammersmith, and am a boot and shoemaker. On the 19th of Sept. Miller came to my shop, and ordered me to make some slippers for him to look at—on a Saturday, two or three days afterwards, ha called again, with a person be called his nephew, a man who is now called Samuel Edge, but who then gave the name of Taylor—they ordered me to make a pair of boots for each of them, and a pair of slippers for Taylor, to correspond with his uncle's, and they were to be sure to come home on the following Thursday, as they wanted to go into the country particularly—on the following Wednesday or Thurs<lb></lb>day Miller came to my shop, and ordered me to take some boots for the ladies to try on—I took a bag<lb></lb>full, and when I got to the house I saw Char<lb></lb>lotte lotte Edge—she asked me in, and I was shown into a nice room, well fur<lb></lb>nished—I thought it looked very respectable—she took the boots up stairs—she said the ladies were not up, or were dressing, I forget which—I gave her the bag full of boots, and she came and said they had selected two pairs—she brought a little girl with her into the parlour, and said, "Now fit this little girl with a pair,"which I did—they had selected two pairs of boots up stairs, and one pair for the child—Edge told me to come at six o'clock, and bring some slippers—I do not think I had told the price of the boots, but I trusted for them till six o'clock.</p>

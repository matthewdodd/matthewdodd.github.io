               <p>I am a baker, I stopped the prisoner with the basket of bread about eleven, in Leicester Fields, I followed him from Cavendish Square; I saw him deliver some bread, he delivered two quartern loaves at the Three Crowns, in Richmond-street, going into Rupert-street; I did not go in there, and whether he was paid I do not know: I saw him deliver a brick too.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you first to take notice of him? - I thought he did not seem to be much like a baker, and when I stopped him, he would not tell me where he had the bread, but said he would take it back where he had it; the master of the Three Crowns said the prisoner had left bread there frequently, and that there was another person always called and took it away: I secured the prisoner.</p>

               <p>I keep a chandler's-shop, and sell wood and coals in Hedge-lane, and the prisoner came into my shop the day of this robbery, and asked for a man named Walker, he said there were two quartern loaves to be left; I told him there was no such person, and advised him to take the bread away.</p>

               <p>I got up in the morning about eight; I have been under Dr. Bossy's hands almost a twelvemonth; I met a man, named Smith, in High-street, Marybone, I said I had but two-pence in the world, he said he wanted me to do a job for him, and he asked me to take the basket of bread, and leave at particular places, which he gave me the names of; says I, am I to take any money; no, says he, tell them I shall call in the evening; then I went to the Three Crowns, and left two loaves there; then he ordered me to go to a chandler's-shop, mentioning the man's name, and if he was not at home, to leave the bread: when I was stopped, I desired them to go with me, and they should see the person. I told the same story then.</p>
               <p>Court to Jack. Did he tell you this story at the time? - Yes; I gave him liberty to go to the man, and he did not go: I could not stop.</p>

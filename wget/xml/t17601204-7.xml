I let the prisoner a lodging ready furnished, the goods mentioned in the indictment were part of the furniture: she came on the 6th of November; about the 12th she staid out all night; I thought it did not look well, and went up stairs, with intent to give her warning. and saw all the bed was torn to pieces. I ask'd her what she had done with my blankets and sheets: then I miss'd a brass candlestick; she said she had pawn'd them, and would put them all in their places again. I ask'd her where she had pawn'd them; she said at Mr. Stiles's, in Castle-street. I went there; the pawnbroker said she had brought things every day, carrying one sheet one day, and another another day. I came back to her: she desired I would let her stay all night, and she'd get them again the next day. In the morning she said she would fetch them, and be in again in three quarters of an hour. She went out, and I never see her from that time, which was Friday, till the Monday after, when I found her in an alehouse. She had the key in her pocket all the time, so that I could not get into the room. (The goods produced in court, and deposed to.)</p>

               <p>I pawned these things for eight shillings; I thought to get them out again the next week: I did not do it with any intent to defraud the gentleman. I am very big with child: I have been in labour two days in Newgate.</p>

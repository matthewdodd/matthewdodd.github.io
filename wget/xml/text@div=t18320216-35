            . I am a Policeman. On the 27th of January I was on duty, between nine and ten o'clock at night, at the back of Mr. Sharp's house, in <placeName id="t18320216-35-crimeloc187">Vittoria-place</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALESBY. Q. She made no objection to give up her key? A. No; I know nothing of the knife myself.</p>

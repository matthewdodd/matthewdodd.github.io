The prisoner slept in the house on the night of the 21st of August; next morning, I went out about half-past eight o'clock, and returned about ten - I had left him in bed, but when I came back he was gone, and I missed the articles from a chair by my bed side. I found him in Harley Mews. I asked if he had not slept at the Black Horse the last night; he said No; he had just come from the country. I said he certainly was the man - he said No, I was mistaken. I took him to the landlord, and asked him if that was not the person - he said it was; he still denied it - the landlord said he would send for a constable; the prisoner then took off his hat and gave the shirt out, and said "Now you have got your property, I hope you will let me go." I said I had lost a pair of stockings - he said he had not got them; he shewed something out of his pockets, and said that was all he had got, but I saw there was something in his breast pocket. I tapped on that pocket, and said, "What is in there;" he then took out a pair of stockings, and said "Now you have got all your property, let me go, I did it through distress."</p>

            . I am landlord of the Black Horse. I went with Stride, and heard him ask the prisoner, if he had not got his shirt, which he denied at first; but when I said he was certainly the man who had slept at the house - he took the shirt out of his hat, and gave it to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150037"></xptr>Stride. He said "That is your shirt, and now you have got it, I hope you will forgive me." Stride then said he had lost a pair of stockings - he denied having them, but afterwards pulled them out of his pocket and gave them to him.</p>

            . I took charge of the prisoner. On searching him I found 2 s. 6 d.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had a shirt which I brought from Woolwich and Greenwich in my hat. I met an old mate, and we had some grog - to the best of my knowledge my own shirt was in my hat when I slept at the house. I do not know of any one having changed the shirt, and I thought it was my own. I had plenty of time to have been miles off, or to have disposed of it in different ways. I had been suffering some months with a rheumatic fever, and the reason I gave up the article was, that rather than be locked up in a prison, or a watch-house, which I never was, I would have given up every thing.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Through an interpreter</hi>). I am an upholsterer—the prisoner is my brother—on 11th April I wrote a letter for him to come to me—he came at half-past 8 in the evening—I heard a knock; went down stairs, and said, "Henry, here you are, you bad fellow; how do you dare to ill-treat your sister so dreadfully; you are a bad fellow"—I saw a poker in his hand; he had it behind him—he took it from behind him and struck me on the forehead with it—it was a large wound, and pained me very much—it bled very much, and I went to a doctor on the Friday following—this occurred on Monday—I had attended to it myself in the meantime—I had never seen the poker before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, of 5 Market-street, Newport Market—on 11th April, at half-past 8 o'clock, I saw the prisoner and his brother talking together in Marshall-street as I was looking out at the window—I saw the prisoner holding a small piece of iron behind him—I cannot say whether this is it—I saw him strike his brother a severe blow with it on the forehead outside the door—I had seen this piece of iron in the prisoner's room when I was working for him about four weeks before.</p>

Q.</hi> Are you sure this is the piece of iron? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Quite certain—the prisoner is a shoe-maker—this was used to poke the fire—the prisoner lives in Back Church-lane, Golden-square, and his brother five miles away in Whitechapel—I did not hear the language—I cannot say whether there was any struggle as it was at the instant I got to the window that I saw the blow—I have known the prisoner since the beginning of September—he appeared a quiet inoffensive man, but he is a little hasty tempered—I was working formerly for the prisoner, but not at that time—I was at the prosecutor's house because I frequently go to see him—I am very friendly with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 13, Golden-square—the prosecutor came to me on Friday, the 15th, with a large lacerated wound on his head—the flesh seemed to have been torn up; it was an inch and a half deep, and down to the bone—this piece of iron would be likely to produce it—it was a very severe wound, but was partly healed—a chemist had put some plaister on it—if it had penetrated the skull it would have been dangerous, because the instrument was used, so, as a dagger; with the pointed part, so that it ploughed up the scalp and slid along the bone—if it had gone into the eye it might have been fatal.</p>

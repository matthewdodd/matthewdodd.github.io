I am not actively engaged in the business; I am not a partner—the constable called on me, and I made an appointment with him—about twenty minutes to ten o'clock Hurcum came and ordered a quarter of oats, a quarter of beans, a sack of bran, six trusses of clover, nine trusses of straw, and one truss of hay—I did not see his van,</p>

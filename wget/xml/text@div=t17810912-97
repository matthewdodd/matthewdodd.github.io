               <p>"concerned for him, the prisoner, as an</p>

               <p>"names of several of his brother's clients,</p>
               <p>"and mentioned a circumstance of the prosecutor's</p>
               <p>"having been in Essex, on a shooting</p>
               <p>"party, with his brother. He said his</p>
               <p>"name was Brown; that he was a farmer</p>
               <p>"and grazier at Bilericay, in Essex; that</p>
               <p>"he had made several enquiries after the</p>
               <p>"prosecutor, wishing to employ him as his</p>
               <p>"attorney; that he was then going to Westminster,</p>
               <p>"to receive 40 l. of a butcher in</p>
               <p>"town, and that if the butcher did not then</p>
               <p>"settle the account, he would get the prosecutor</p>
               <p>"to arrest him the next day, and</p>
               <p>"requested the prosecutor to go with him:</p>
               <p>"- That accordingly he went with the prisoner</p>
               <p>"to a public-house in Westminster;</p>
               <p>"that they went into a back room; that</p>
               <p>"soon after two or three genteel looking</p>
               <p>"people came in, and sat down at a table</p>
               <p>"by themselves: they introduced cards, began</p>
               <p>"playing, and requested the prosecutor</p>
               <p>"and the prisoner to join with them, who</p>
               <p>"both refused so to do: that upon pressing</p>
               <p>"him to play, Mr. Long resented it, rang</p>
               <p>"the bell, and asked what was to pay?</p>
               <p>"That he took out three guineas and an half,</p>
               <p>"and laid them down upon the table, while</p>
               <p>"he felt for some silver: That the prisoner,</p>
               <p>"who was then quarrelling with those men</p>
               <p>"for behaving improperly to the prosecutor,</p>
               <p>"said the prosecutor was an attorney:</p>
               <p>"they said he was no attorney, and made</p>
               <p>"use of very abusive language: The prisoner</p>
               <p>"replied, the prosecutor was an attorney,</p>
               <p>"and he would lay them five or ten</p>
               <p>"guineas that he was so; and immediately</p>
               <p>"took up the three guineas and an half,</p>
               <p>"and ran out of the room. The prosecutor</p>

            . I went to Mr. King's shop at 10 o'clock at night, the 27th of April, the prisoner was there, he had a half-penny worth of cheese ; I saw him take a bundle in a bag and white handkerchief, and put it under his left-arm and go out with it across Holborn. I said to the woman, did he leave a bundle her, she said, no; then I said, he has stole a bundle from off the shelf, for I knew he was not so good as he should be.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known him?</p>
               <p>M. Whittle. I have known him a great while</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Were the breeches woollen or leather?</p>
               <p>M. Whittle. I don't know that, I saw only a bundle in a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Prisoner. How long had the bundle been in the shop?</p>
               <p>M. Whittle. I had been there but a quarter of an hour before for a farthings-worth of small-beer, and saw the bundle lie there then.</p>

            . I serve in Mr. King's shop, the prisoner came in and asked for a halfpennyworth of cheese, I served him, no body was there then but he and I; he gave the halfpenney a shove and it fell behind the counter; I took the candle, but did not look down, then the last evidence came in; he went out, she told me he had took a bundle, and I missed it directly, I did not see him take it, but missed it that instant, for it was lying there just before he came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the same bundle Troward left at your shop?</p>
               <p>R. Chamberlain. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other bundle in a handkerchief left there besides that he left ?</p>

               <p>Q. Where abouts in the shop did it lie ?</p>
               <p>R. Chamberlain. It lay on a shelf just facing me as I was behind the counter.</p>

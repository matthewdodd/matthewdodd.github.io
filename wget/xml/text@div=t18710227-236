                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 861). About 6.15 at night, on 1st January, I saw the two prisoners, in Aldgate, following a man named Day—I had seen the prisoners before that evening, and am quite sure they are the men—Day went into a public-house, and then the two prisoners went in—he was the worse for liquor—the prisoners came out, and waited half an hour till Day came out, and I watched them follow him into Leman Street—Pickett tripped him up with his foot, Butfield put his hand in his pocket, and they both ran away—I pursued them, and caught Butfield—he said "Pray don't lock me up, I will give the man all the money back I took" and he handed me 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; a crown, two half-crowns, a florin, and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper.</p>

I was several yards behind the prisoners, at times, as they followed Day—they were in company with one another—they did not speak to him till they knocked him down—they ran from me, and I ran after them as fast as I could—I first saw them in High Street, Aldgate, about 200 yards from the public-house—Day passed the public-house first, and then turned back and went in, and the prisoners turned back as well.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COLE</hi>. I should say the prisoners remained in the public-house five or ten minutes—they did not go into any public-house before that—I had been watching them about a quarter of an hour—I stood outside the door, when they went in, and looked at them—I don't think they had been drinking much; I did not notice any mark of intoxi<lb></lb>cation—Pickett tripped Day up; he was on Day's left side—Day was locked up the same night, and charged next morning with being drunk, and was fined 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not see who picked him up, I ran after the prisoners.</p>

I was with the last witness on this night, and saw the two prisoners come out of the "Three Tuns" public-house—they waited outside about half an hour, till Day came out—they followed him to the corner of Leman Street; Pickett went on the left, and Butfield on the right of him—Pickett tripped him up, and Butfield put his hand in his trowsers pocket, and they both ran away—I caught Pickett—he said "It is not me, I am running after the thief"—I am quite sure they are the two men I saw waiting for Day.</p>

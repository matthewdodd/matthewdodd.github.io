                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Mr. Pollock, of 130, Queen Victoria Street—prisoner came into our office at 2.30 p.m., and presented this order (<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 28<hi rend="italic">th November</hi>, 1879, <hi rend="italic">for three reams of</hi> 23<hi rend="italic">pink double crown paper</hi>, 487, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., <hi rend="italic">and signed for Charles Morgan and Co., E.

H."—I kept him in con<lb></lb>versation till Mr. Pollock came in, who said it was a forged order, and gave him in charge—I asked him what he had done with the paper, and he said he had made use of it—I asked him if he could get us the paper back or find us the money, and whether he had had paper here before—at first he said "No," but after a minute he said he had that paper, and had done away with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I did not offer to settle the case—I. asked you if you could tell us where to get the paper or the money, and you said no, you could not—I said that if you paid 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I would let you go—I also said my master would stop the money out of my account—finding you had not the money in your pocket, and that you said you could not get it, I said I should detain you till Mr. Pollock came in, and he sent me for a policeman to lock you up—I told you at the time I did not wish to be hard with you under the circumstances.</p>

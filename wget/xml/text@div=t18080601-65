               <p>Q. What part of Bishopgate street - A. About the midway between Sun-street and Union street; about ten minutes before I knew my handkerchief was safe.</p>
               <p>Q. You have got side pockets to your coat - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner - A I did not until I received information from the lady that was with me, that a man was picking my pocket; I turned round immediately; I saw the prisoner close to me, I caught him by the collar and told him unless he instantly gave me the handkerchief that he had taken from my coat pocket I would knock him down; his reply was that he was innocent, how could I charge him with such a thing; as I held him by the collar, the lady said he has dropped your handkerchief, loud enough for him to hear; I looked upon the ground and saw the handkerchief laying by his feet; I picked up the handkerchief and saw it was mine; I took him into a shop and sent for a constable; it was a silk handkerchief worth two shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to be deaf when you spoke to him - A. No; he answered me immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that your handkerchief was in such a situation that it could not be dropped by an accident - A. Yes.</p>

            . I was with Mr. Sadler on the 13th of April, about nine o'clock in the evening, when he lost his handkerchief; I observed the prisoner following of him few paces, which induced me to look round, I saw him in the act of drawing the handkerchief out of the right hand pocket of Mr. Sadler; I made a motion with my elbow to him that there was a man picking his pocket; I never took my eye from the man till he 
               <persName id="t18080601-65-person558">drew</persName>
             the handkerchief out; then he wound the handkerchief round his left hand with his right hand and put it into his bosom; Mr. Sadler turned round immediately and took him by the collar; the prisoner protested innocence; he took the handkerchief from his bosom; he held his hand behind him and dropped it on the street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As you and your spouse was walking along, the handkerchief dropped from one or the other. Does it stand to reason that a man seventy years of age should do so; I never did such a thing in my born days; I picked it up in the street, I meaned to give it to the gentleman; he charged me with an officer.</p>

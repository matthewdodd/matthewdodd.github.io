                  </hi>. I am a printer, and live in St. Luke's—on Saturday night, 7th July, a little after eleven, I was in the "Red Cow" public-house, Long Lane, in company with Bridget Caton—there were others in front of the bar—after a short time the prisoner came in and took up a young man's beer and drank it—the young man asked him what he drank his beer for, and he turned round and jeered and laughed at him—the young man struck him a blow in the mouth, and then he and the prisoner were wrestling together—I and several others parted them—the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186608130027"></xptr>
               <p>prisoner than sat down at one end of the bar, and the young man at the other—I went up to him and said, "If you take my advice you will go home and drop it"—he made no answer—I went up to the bar—in about twenty minutes the prisoner walked deliberately up to me, pretended to mumble something in my ear, and then stabbed me in the thigh, saying, "I don't care a penny for any man when I have got this"—he then made to the door and got out—he appeared to be sober—I halloed out that I was stabbed—a young man named Barrett rushed at him and caught him round the arm, and I heard Barrett call out, "He has stabbed me"—two young women got hold of him—they hustled across the road together, and the policeman came up and took him—I was taken to the station, and then to the hospital, were I was under treatment until the 1st of August.</p>

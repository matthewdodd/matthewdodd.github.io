                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Earl-street, Marylebone, and am a laundress. I have known the prisoner sixteen years. On Tuesday, the 29th of December, at ten o'clock in the morning, I saw her—she said she was very much distressed, and had had nothing to eat since Monday morning—she asked me for employment, and at one o'clock I gave her em<lb></lb>ployment at my house—she washed for me in my wash-house till half past four o'clock, and then I gave her 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to go to her tea—I told her to go to tea, and that I was going into Charles-street, Manchester-square—she was to return after tea and proceed with the washing—she went away—I went to my tea, and went to Charles-street—I returned at half-past six o'clock, and she was not there—she had not done any thing since tea—I missed a half—mourning gown, and two sheets—I had left the gown in the garden, and the two sheets in the washhouse—she could get into the garden from the wash-house—I had seen the things safe at half-past four o'clock, after she was gone to tea—I found her bonnet in the wash-house—I had left a black silk bonnet in the wash-house myself, and that was gone—her's is a straw bonnet—I don't think there is much difference between hers and mine—I saw the gown at Mr. Gideon's, the pawnbroker's, the same evening, and one sheet also—I saw the prisoner that night at the station-house, and told her she was ungrateful to me; she said, "I am, Mrs. Balls"—I did not notice what bonnet she had on, but my black silk bonnet was on her head next day at the office.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Gideon, a pawnbroker, in Stafford-street, Lisson-grove. On the 29th of December the prisoner brought a sheet and gown—she first produced the sheet, and pawned it for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in the name of Sophia Painter, No. I, Charles-street, lodger—she then produced a half—mourning gown—she said she wanted 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it, and hoped I should not make any abatement, as she could not do with lees—she pawned it in the same name—I gave her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it—she asked our fore man if he would take any thing to drink—he said he had rather not—I did not notice whether she was sober—this was at a quarter before seven</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 29th of December, I saw the prisoner cross from Gideon's, the pawnbroker's towards a public-house—she had this sheet over her arm—she came against me—I thought she was rather in liquor—she begged my pardon, and said if I would have any gin or rum to drink, she would bring it out to me—I declined, saying, I thought she had had sufficient—she did not appear to be sober—I took her in a minute or two on suspicion of stealing the sheet, and found six dupli<lb></lb>cates on her, and three keys.</p>

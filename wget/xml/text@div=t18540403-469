The packet in which I engaged a berth you will not be able to go over further than Paris, because, being a minor, you require a passport, countersigned by the Consuls in London, which you will not obtain without giving full information as to who you are; for Paris and Belgium they are not so strict. Therefore, if you leave London on the 14th, you can be in England again on the 18th very comfortably. In the mean time your outfit and all shall be ready on board for you, and you can remain until the last moment. Keep to the story about the doctor; it is very plausible, and will lead them off the scent; but by no means enter near Austria; your father's name will be sufficient to bring you into the hands of the police.

                  </hi>. I am a miller, and live at Stan well Mill, near Staines—the prisoner Lane has been in my employ about pine years. I received an order from Mr. Philp for twenty sacks of flour, which were to be delivered on the 2nd of January—there were to be ten sacks of each sort of flour, and some toppings, which is hog's victuals—they left my premises to go to Mr. Philp, on the 2nd of January—there were tea sacks of household flour, and tea of seconds—each sack contained 200lbs. weight of flour, and we usually allow 5lbs. for the sack—I delivered them to Lane myself to take to Mr. Philp, at Hammersmith, and I gave him this delivery ticket (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) on the morning be started—he was to go there that day, and return to me after delivering what is specified on the ticket—on the same evening, a little after six o'clock, Mr. Philp and a friend came to me—Lane came home afterwards, and in consequence of what I had heard from Mr. Philp, I got into the wagon and found in it seven empty sacks, which had come from Mr. Philp's—I sent for Lane, and said that Mr. Philp had been to complain of one sack of flour being deficient—he said when he left Mr. Philp's there was a sack of stuff in the wagon, which a man on Hounslow-heath had asked him to take up in the morn<lb></lb>ing—I said, "Did you ever see the man before?"—he said, "No"—I said, "What were you to do with it?"—he said, "To leave it at Turn<lb></lb>floor, ham-green"—I went to Mr. Philp's, and saw there ten sacks of household which I believe were correct as I had sent them—I was shewn ten sacks of second flour, and was satisfied that if there had been any wrong delivery I should be able to know it—I came to one sack, and I said, before I touched it, "There is something wrong in this sack"—I took it to a scale and found it was 26lbs. less in weight than when it left my house—I put my hand in it and found something which I was convinced did not leave my mill—I took a tin scoop, and put a scoop full of it into a sieve and sifted it, and these bits came from it (<hi rend="italic">producing them,</hi>) which I am satisfied never left my mill—I had the whole sack sifted, and found a con<lb></lb>siderable portion of doughy particles in it, and the flour in the sack was of a very different quality to what went from my mill—the other sacks were ail right—here is the receipt which Lane gave me for having delivered twenty sacks of flour—it is signed by him and Mr. Philp.</p>

               <p>pocket—he did not tell me the name—I expected he had got the ticket—this rather excited my suspicion, and I went into my bakehouse—I found Miller there—he was just going out with some bakings—I asked him where the flour was which the man had brought in—he said there were four sacks in the shop, two in the bakehouse, and the rest in the ware-house—he pointed them out to me, and I saw, to my mind, that there was the number—I was rather dissatisfied, and in half an hour after<lb></lb>wards I followed Lane to the Coach and Horses, at Turnham-green, kept by the prisoner Buckingham—I saw the wagon drawn close up to the house—there was a sack in the wagon, but no flour in it—when a sack of flour has been emptied, it is the custom of the trade to have the sack turned inside out and well shaken, to get all the flour from it, but the sack had not been shaken nor turned out—perhaps two or three pounds weight of flour will adhere to a sack that has not been shaken—there was flour hanging all about it, and there were empty sacks beside in the wagon—the unshaken sack had the name of Henry Carpenter on it—I went into the public-house, and saw Lane—I asked him what he had done with that sack of flour—he said, "I know nothing about it"—I asked him again to come and look at the sack, empty and unshaken, in the wagon—he said, "I know nothing about it"—he would not come—I asked him, I think, three times—I then went again and looked at the sack—I went home, and the same evening went to Mr. Carpenter, before Lane got home, about six o'clock—I told Mr. Carpenter what I had seen—I was there when Lane came in, about an hour afterwards—I asked what he had done with the sack of flour—he said he knew nothing about it, bat he had had a sack of something given to him on Hounslow-heath to take to Turnham<lb></lb>green, but he did not know the name of the person he was to take it to—that he took it to my house, and then to the public-house, left it there, and did not know what became of it—the next day Mr. Carpenter came to my house, and we examined the flour—there were ten sacks of household flour, and ten of seconds—the household flour was all right, but there were twenty-six and a half pounds weight deficient in one of the sacks of se<lb></lb>conds—on the day the flour was delivered, there was no person on my premises but Miller, and about half an hour would have been a reasonable time to have taken in that quantity—one man could not have filled an empty sack, it must have required two persons, one to hold whilst the other filled—I have a half-bushel measure that I use for the purpose of filling a sack—that would have required more time than delivering twenty sacks—I went to Mrs. Buckingham again the next day—I told her I was come on a very unpleasant business, and asked her if she would give me a sample of flour that was in her pantry—I said I did not like to pay for twenty sacks when I had only nineteen—a great many words passed between us, and, at last, she granted me leave to take a sample—I found in the pantry about a bushel of flour in a sack, or rather more—I took a sample from it—I requested her to come into the pantry, and see me take it, but she would not—I submitted that sample of flour to Mr. Carpenter—on the day before the flour came from Mr. Carpenter, I had examined my stock, and observed one sack of flour which had had a mouse-hole in it—I put my finger in the hole, and felt some dirt in it—on the 3rd of January I missed about three parts of the flour out of that sack—I asked Miller if he had sifted it—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Did you find any thing in it?"—he said "No"—he could not have sifted it without finding this dirt in it—</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live at Hounslow. I went to Mr. Philp's house to meet Mr. Carpenter, on the 4th of January—I saw a sack standing on the machine—it was sifted, by Mrs. Philp and Mr. Carpen<lb></lb>ter, through a fine wire sieve—I have the refuse from it here—it consists of mouse dirt and scraps of dough—I was shown a sample of flour which came from Buckingham's—I compared it with the second flour which had been sent to Philp, and, as far as I could ascertain, they appeared to be the same.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of Queen-square. On the 3rd of January I went to the prisoner Buckingham, and told her I wanted to speak to her privately—she said I must come into her bar—I told her I belonged to Queen-square, and there had been a sack of flour left there the day before, as was supposed, by a miller's man—I asked if she could give me any account of it—she said she knew nothing at all about it, and all she had to do was to mind her in-door work, she had nothing to do with out-door work—I asked if she had any objection to let me look round her place—she said she did not know what authority I had to do so—I said I had no authority, but, as she was a respectable woman, I dared to say she would have no objection—she said she did not know—I then said I must call in a policeman, and get a warrant—she then said, well, I might—I went into the pantry, and saw from a quarter to half a sack of flour on a chair—she said, "I don't buy my flour in small quantities, in pecks and bushels, I buy it in sacks," of Kidd and Alexander, I understood, but I believe it was Andrews—I was going to ask her to show me the papers, but she said, "I am like many foolish women, when the papers come in I lay them down, and they get lost"—the ostler was there—he said, I might look into the stable—on the 16th I went again, and saw Mrs. Buckingham—I told her she would be wanted on Monday, at Queen-square, and if she would have the goodness to bring her witnesses the Ma<lb></lb>gistrate would not trouble her with a warrant, and if she would tell me</p>

               <p>who she had that flour from, it would be better for her—she said she could not say, as she had had it a long while—she said then that she bought it in pecks and quartern pecks, and she had even bought one quartern at Mr. Philp's; she then said again, "I don't know what passes outside the house, I know what passes inside; but if a sack of flour were left at my place, and no one owns it, I shall certainly use it."</p>

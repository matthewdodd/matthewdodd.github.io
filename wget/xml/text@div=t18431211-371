                  </hi>. I live in Amber-place, Queen-street, Chelsea, and am labourer at Mr. Freeman's White-lead Works, at Battersea. The prisoner was a labourer there—on the 30th of Nov., about five, I was in the boiling-room—the prisoner was sitting on the steps of the boiler—I had occasion to go up the steps, and put my hand on the prisoner's shoulder, and said, "<hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>, stop my water?"—which is a cant expression through the factory, a nick-name applied to him—he got off his seat and took the fire-shovel, and attempted to srike me with it—I caught hold of it and prevented him—I turned on one side, went up two steps, came down again, as my basket was not there—I stood by the fire—the prisoner still had the shovel in his hand—he raised it</p>

               <p>and struck me on the top of my head with it—I fell senseless against the wall—I was taken to a surgeon's—I bled all the way there—I recovered in a few minutes—I went to the doctor's three or four times.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman in Freeman's factory. I was in the boiling-room—Nash had occasion to go up the steps of the boiler—the prisoner was sitting on the steps—as he went up he laid his hand on the pri<lb></lb>soner's shoulder, and said, "<hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>, stop my water, "which is a cant word the men use to him—the prisoner said, "I will have none of your games with me"—he took up the shovel, attempted to strike Nash, who caught it with his hand, turned it aside, ran up the steps, came down again, and stood by the fire—the prisoner still having the shovel, raised it, and struck him on the head—it was not a very hard blow—one of the men said "<hi rend="italic">Jemmy</hi>, you ought to have hit him with your hands"—he then said, "I will pay the b—out."</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Dr. Conner, of Battersea. On the evening of the 30th of Nov. Nash was brought to the surgery—I found a trifling wound on the top of his head, it was a simple incised wound—it had not penetrated the pericardium, but merely divided the skin—it might be made by the edge of this shovel—it did not appear to have been a violent blow—it had not gone to the bone—I saw him again the following morning, and not afterwards—he was perfectly sensible when I saw him.</p>

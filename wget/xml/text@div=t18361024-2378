                  </hi>. I am a milkman, and live in Great Harcourt-street, St. Marylebone. On Sunday, the 25th of September, I had a quantity of cows in Hyde Park—on going there early on Monday morning, I found one of them dead—I went to Abbott, a butcher in Newport-market, and gave him directions to fetch the cow away—in consequence of information,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183610240115"></xptr>
               <p>the same morning, I went to the prisoner's residence, near Cow-cross—he is a slaughterman—I saw him standing, in his shirt-sleeves—I asked him if he had a cow come into his slaughter-house that morning—he told me he had—I saw my cow lying in the slaughter-house, stuck and bleeding—I told him it was my property, and cost me nineteen guineas, and should be glad to take it away, that I had Abbott's cart outside, and would take it away—he said I should not have it away, it was not my property—I told him it was, and I would make him remember it—Mr. Legg and him too—he had said it was Mr. Legg's property—he said he would get her hide dressed in about twenty minutes—I stood by while he dressed it—Legg is the gatekeeper at Hyde-park—he keeps cows—I had not given Legg authority to send the cow to any body except Abbott—one of the slaughtermen said, "Halloo, here is something amiss here, look down here"—I looked down, and at the back part of the elbow of the cow there was a very great bruise near the heart—I had not observed any bruise on it when I saw it dead at first, nor when I saw it in the park—I saw the prisoner again, a fortnight afterwards—I asked him to go to Hatton-garden with me, and he said he had some very particular busi<lb></lb>ness, much more particular than mine was—I said, "When will you go"—he said, "Wait till three o'clock, and I will go with you"—I went down about ten minutes before three o'clock, and said, "Will you go now to Hatton-garden with me?"—he told me no, he would not go with me any where—he told me I might go, that he had paid Mr. Legg for the cow, and the skin was marked in Mr. Legg's own name—he then said, "Go away, I don't care for you; why will you not keep the law on me?—I had put it into an attorney's hands, but he did not care for the attorneys nor me either—I saw him afterwards, at Marylebone-street—the Magistrate issued a summons, and he said he would not attend to it.</p>

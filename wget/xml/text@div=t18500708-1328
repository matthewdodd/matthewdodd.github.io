On the evening of 23rd June, Smith was given into my custody by Mr. Smith, the landlord of the King's Arms, at Barnsbury-road, Islington, for turning on his brandy tap and wasting his spirits—the prisoners were all three in the house—Cheswell said if I took Smith into custody he would take it up—I got outside with Smith in custody, and saw Ball—Smith struck me and knocked my hat off—I drew my truncheon, and Cheswell seized it, snatched it out of my hand, and struck me a violent blow on the head with it—the blow cut my head open, and Smith and Ball assaulted me—Cheswell ran away; I ran after him, and took him—Ball came, when he saw I was resolute in taking Cheswell, and struck me three violent blows on the nose with his fist, and then Cheswell struck me again with the truncheon on my naked head—I kept hold of Cheswell till some gentlemen came up.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Fetter-lane. On the evening of 23rd June I was in the King's Arms—I saw Smith given into custody by the landlord, for turning the brandy tap—Cheswell said to the officer, "If you take him I shall take it up"—the officer drew his truncheon, and took Smith out of the house—Cheswell and Ball followed, and began punching the officer—Ches<lb></lb>well began first; he laid hold of the officer's staff; the other two in the mean-time were punching him about the head with their fists—Cheswell got the truncheon out of the officer's hand, and struck him on the head with it—his hand was naked—his hat had been knocked off by the other's fists—I saw the blood running down all over his clothes—Cheswell ran away with the staff, and the officer followed him—they all struck the officer several times.</p>

                  </hi>. On the night of 14th July, I was with the prisoner, going towards a field near Chase-gate, Hadley—I had been working with him all day and supping with him—I was quite sober—I expect we were both so—my brothers had been with us at supper, but they were not with us when this happened—after supper the prisoner and I turned back to the field at the Chase-gate and lay down—the prisoner said I should not lie there, if I did he would cut my head off with a scythe—there had been very few words between us; only what he said himself—I had given him no blackguarding—he said this without any provocation—I did not lie down—the prisoner started with the intention, as I supposed, to fetch the scythe, and I went to stop him and he threw me down, kicked me in the body, and cut me with a knife on the left arm—I did not strike him at all before he struck me—I struck him with my open hand, but not before he cut me with the knife in the arm, here is the mark; I bled very much—I went for a policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Barnet—the prosecutor was brought to my surgery about 1 in the morning of 15th July; he was very much exhausted from loss of blood, and was then bleeding profusely from the left arm—there were four or five deep jagged wounds, one almost reaching to the bone, which I was obliged to sew up and dress—I consider he was in danger from such severe wounds—erysipelas might have followed, but they healed up very well.</p>

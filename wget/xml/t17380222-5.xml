On the 31st of Jan. my Servant told me, about 7 o'Clock at Night when he was shutting up Shop, that 2 Fellows had been in the Vault about three quarters of an Hour. I thought they might be Thieves, so I took a Candle, and my Servant following me, I bolted (went hastily) into the Place, and found Taylor sitting, not upon the open Seat, but upon the close Part of it, and Berry sitting in his Lap; both their Breeches being down. I call'd them Names, and left them; but a Mob rose upon them, and would have knock'd them on the Head, had not a Constable in the Neighbourhood seiz'd them to carry them before a Magistrate. When they were carried away, some Gentlemen came to me, and told me, it would be a Shame such Rascals should escape, and perswaded me to go to the Justices, When I came there, (to Mr. Justice Hilder's) the 2 Prisoners were each of them endeavouring to make a Confession before the other. Berry made his Confession first, and sign'd it; but Taylor confessed the whole Matter too.</p>

               <p>Mr. Windham. Taylor confessed it full as plain, or plainer than Berry; he said (several Times) he was guilty of the same Crime with Berry, but would not allow that he had enticed him to it. He own'd he had lain with Berry twice, and made use of the Word Sodomy. After Berry had made his Confession, Taylor said he had acted Sodomy with him. Their Breeches were not put up when they were before the Justice.</p>

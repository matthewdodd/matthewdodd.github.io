            </rs>. He was also indicted a second Time upon the Coroner's Inquest for the same. Several Evidences, who had been in Company with the deceased, deposed, That themselves and the deceased had been drinking at the House of one Mr. Brown, in Little Windmill-Street. That they all being pretty much in Liquor, would have had more, which the Landlord refus'd them; that at last being Merry they went to trying their Strength by Wrestling, and two or three of them were thrown down under the Fire Grate; that Mr. Brown call'd the Prisoner, who was a <rs id="t17230116-35-deflabel187" type="occupation">Watchman</rs>

One of them depos'd, That the deceased was two or three Times push'd on the Breast by the Prisoner with his Staff, and afterwards knock'd down, and attempted two or three Times to rise, but could not; and that he set him with his Back against a Wall, but did not see any Provocation given by the deceased. Two Surgeons depos'd That the deceased was cut, or wounded, on the Side of the Head, above the Ear, the Length of Six or seven Inches, so that the Skull lay bare, and the Skin and Flesh hung over his Ear; and that, tho' there was no Depresssion of the Skull visible outwardly, yet opening the Head after his decease, they found two Fractures of the Skull, one upon the Temple Bone, and another upon the Bregma, several Inches long, with extravasated Blood, and a Pressure upon the Meninges of the Brain; and, that the Wounds were the cause of his Death. Other Evidences depos'd, That the deceased did charge his Death upon the Prisoner, saying He was murthered by him. The Evidences for the Prisoner depos'd much the same as those for the King had done, as to their being drinking at Mr. Brown's House, and the Occasion of their being sent to the Round House, but with this Difference, That they refus'd to pay the Reckoning, and began to quarrel among themselves, and were very troublesome, and that their Wrestling and Throwing one another down, seem'd rather in earnest than jest; and that the deceased was thrown under the Grate, and two more upon him (tho' one of the Evidences for the King said he was the Person that was undermost, and did not know that the deceased was thrown down there at all) The Landlord added, That in their Quarrelling they had broken a Table, a Mug, and the Windows, and refusing to pay their Reckoning, thereupon he call'd the Watchman.

            ; the Servant Maid, depos'd That when they were carried out of the House she went a little way after them, and perceiving a Scuffle among them, ran back to her Master's Door, calling out to him, saying, They would beat the Watch; and then ran to them, and saw the deceased have hold of the Watchman's staff, endeavouring to wrest it out of his Hand; and that one of the Watchmen's Hit and Wig was on the Ground, which she took up. That where the deceased fell there was a Bench, and he might probably fall with his Head against that Bench.

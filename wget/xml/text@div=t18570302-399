                  </hi>. I live at No. 6, Pelham-street, Spitalfields. On the morning of 17th Feb., about 2 o'clock, I was in High—street, Whitechapel—I saw the two prisoners, another man, and a woman—Sadlier spoke to me, and asked me what I had been insulting his girl for; I said I had not seen her or him before—he then said he would punch my b—eye out;</p>

               <p>with that I stepped back about a yard, and Lee seized me by the throat, and nearly strangled me, holding me in a bending position, while Sadliexr tore my waistcoat open, and put his hand into one of my waistcoat pockets; there was nothing in it—he then made a snatch at my watch guard, but fortunately the police came up at the time, and he threw me on the ground, and they ran away, one one way, and one another; I called out, "Police!"—the officer brought back Sadlier to me—I knew him as one of the persons directly.</p>

Mr. Walker and I had been drinking together at a house in Hatfield Street, on the 10th of September, 1756. He followed me out of the house into the street, at ten or eleven o'clock at night; says he, '' What, are you going?'' Says I, I do not know. '' By G - d says he but you are,'' and snatched my cane out of my hand by main force; it had a gold head to it.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was this from the house?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175709140012"></xptr>Barnard. It was about ten yards from the house; there was nobody along with me. He went back to the house from whence he came. I went and ask'd him for the cane. He wrap'd the string round his hand, and told me my wife had given it to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your wife there?</p>
               <p>Barnard. My wife was in the house, and another woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he use any words or threatenings?</p>
               <p>Barnard. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the landlord of the house there?</p>
               <p>Barnard. The landlord was not there, nor his wife, nor his servants.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you had any quarrel before you went out of the house?</p>
               <p>Barnard. He defrauded me of a 20 l. bank note just before. I sat myself down and ask'd him for the cane, but he would not give it me. Mr. Walker went out, my wife went out, and I followed them, and missed him. I never saw the cane after. I ask'd him for it afterwards, and he said he would make me amends, and that he would give me another cane. He did not deny but what he had the cane.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he intended to steal it?</p>
               <p>Barnard. He took it by force in the street.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. About the time that this happen'd you had an inclination to marry, did he not lend you some money to get a licence?</p>
               <p>Barnard. Yes, he did; two 36 s. pieces and a guinea, and he went and arrested me for 42 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you settle accounts together?</p>
               <p>Barnard. We never had any accounts to settle.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you not married the day after this robbery, as you call it?</p>
               <p>Barnard. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray who gave your wife to you?</p>
               <p>Barnard. The prisoner stood father.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure this was the day after he took your cane, by force as you say.</p>
               <p>Barnard. I am sure it was.</p>

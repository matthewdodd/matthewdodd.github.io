                  </hi>. I am wife of Thomas Wood, a cow-keeper, in Gray's-inn-lane. The prisoner was in my service four or five months—I employed him to carry out milk and receive money from customers—I call over the score to him every morning and afternoon when he returns—when he gets money he ought to pay it to me—he generally pays it to me—it would not be wrong if he paid it to my husband—only I and my husband receive money—he did not pay me any money on the 29th of May, which he had received from Mr. Hannay, Mr. Revolter, or Mr. Todd—he did not pay me any which he re-ceived from them on the 10th of June, and never accounted to me for them—he never gave me any reason why he did not pay me—I spoke to him about it several times, he said they had not paid.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a warder at the House of Correction in Coldbath-fields. The prisoner was a prisoner there under my charge—he had been under my charge fox about a fortnight—on 24th Jane, he com<lb></lb>plained to me of his bread being light; he said his loaf of bread was small—I told him I could not help its being small, if he thought proper he could have it weighed—he said he did not wish to have it weighed, provided I gave it to him the same as I did to other prisoners; he said that I picked out the small bread for him—I told him that I would not allow him to accuse me with that, he might see the Governor upon it if he thought proper—he said he would do so—he then asked me to put the loaf in the cupboard for the Governor to see it; I did so—previous to that I weighed it—the prisoner could see me do it—it weighed six ounces—the prisoners get twenty ounces a-day, divided into three parts, then there is ten pounds allowed the contractor in every hundred for the allowance, so that the prisoners shall not have less bread than is allowed them—they do get twenty ounces a-day, taking one loaf with the other—this was about half past 5 o'clock in the evening—the prisoner slept in the dormitory that night—there we other prisoners there, the room sleeps one hundred—on the next morning, about twenty minutes to 11 o'clock, the prisoner was taken before the Governor with regard to this charge of the light loaf—I took the bread with</p>

               <p>me—I told the Governor in the prisoner's presence what had occurred the over night, as I have stated now—on that, the prisoner said that the officers had an antipathy against him—the Governor said he should not allow the prisoner to make the assertion he had done the night previous, if he had anything to say he could see him and make his complaint; and he should stop part of his dinner—I took the prisoner back to the yard, and put the loaf in the cupboard in the day room, where the men get their meals—the prisoner was by the side of me at the time—he said he bad intended to ask the Governor for the loaf—I said he might have done it if he had thought proper—nothing more passed—I took him to his work—it was in the dormitory, it was his work that day to clean and sweep the dormitory and put it to rights—it was about 10 minutes to 11 o'clock when I took him there—there was nobody else working there—I locked the door of the dormitory and left him there—about 20 minutes to 1 o'clock I went to the dormitory again—I unlocked the door, and on opening it the prisoner stood on the step of the door; there are steps leading up to the dormitory, and there is one step inside the doorway—the prisoner stood on that step—not a word passed between us—as soon as I opened the door the prisoner struck me just by the corner of the right eye; he struck me in this way (<hi rend="italic">raising his Jtand and striking downwards</hi>) as hard as he could force it; he struck me with all his might and gave a grunt at the same time—I was going to shut the door, and he gave me a second blow across the hand and cut me across the knuckles; I could not see what he had in his hand, it was so momentary—I locked the door; he <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> against it, but I had sufficient strength to push against him and lock it—I hastened down to the hall and there I saw the doctor—I had this cap on when I went to the dormitory (<hi rend="italic">producing some pieces of a cap</hi>)—at the time he delivered the blow at my head, this fell into the dormitory, and afterwards he cut it up and threw it out of the window.</p>

On the night of 13th August, I was awake the whole night, and at a little past 4 o'clock in the morning, I heard the noise of a window being lifted up—I can state that it had been closed the night before, I had looked round the house—I heard footsteps in the passage—I opened the window and called out my son's name—I heard some persons going down stairs, more than one person—they were tumbling over each other—I awoke my husband—we went down stairs and the policeman had got the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi> I am a greengrocer at 22, Watling Street, Commercial Road—on Saturday night, the 10th of this month, about half-past twelve, I was shutting up my shop, when the prisoner ran against me—I asked him where he was coming, and he hit me in the mouth—I do not know him—I hit him again in defence, and he struck me with his knife—it was all done in a short time.</p>

                  </hi> I assist the last witness—on the Saturday night, as we were shutting up the shop, prisoner ran against Mr. Boon, who told him to mind where he was running—I turned away to serve a customer, and when I looked again I saw them struggling—I saw prisoner draw his knife, and I said, "Look, he's got a knife"—I saw prisoner strike Mr. Boon with the knife—John Mariner then came to our assistance, and we secured the prisoner and took his knife, when a constable came up.</p>

                  </hi> I also assist Mr. Boon—on Saturday night, as I was taking the things off the board, I saw a crowd, and heard the last witness say, "Jack, he's got a knife "—we threw prisoner on the ground, and got the knife out of his pocket—he had had drink, but he knew what he was doing.</p>

I took prisoner into custody—the prosecutor was bleeding at the mouth—he charged the prisoner with stabbing him—prisoner said he was coming along Charles Street, and, having a drop to drink, accidentally knocked against the prosecutor, who asked him where he was running, and turned round and hit him in the face—prisoner also said, as there were two others upon him, he drew out his knife to defend himself—he did not say he used it.</p>

                  </hi> I am a surgeon—I was called in on Suuday, the 11th instant, to see the prosecutor, and found him bleeding from three pun<lb></lb>ctured wounds; one in the centre of the upper lip completely divided it—the second was on the left side of the upper lip, and of a more superficial character—the third was an oblique wound on the right cheek—the one on the lip was the most serious—the two on the lip might be the result of one blow—it was not impossible for the knife to pass out of the cheek—it was not a dangerous wound—the knife may have produced those wounds.</p>

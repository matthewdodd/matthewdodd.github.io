               <p>JOHN GRIFFITHS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I am a constable belonging to Lambeth-street Office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time go to the prisoner's house? - A. Yes; on Saturday the 29th of October, about three o'clock in the afternoon; I went in company with another officer, to No. 3, Lemon-street, Lemon-row, Goodman's-fields, the prisoner's house; we knocked at the door and were let in by a woman who was in the house, we asked for Mr. Wilson, she said he was not at home, but she called Mrs. Wilson, who was below stairs; Mr. Wilson came up stairs, we told her we had a warrant to search that person's house, and asked her for the keys of the doors, the parlour door was locked, she said, her husband had the keys, she had got no keys of either of the doors, for she lived in the kitchen, and that was all the part of the house that Mr. Wilson allowed her; I went into the back yard, finding the parlour door was locked; I saw a quantity of casks in the parlour, through the window; I then listed up the window and went in, there I found fourteen casks all empty; I asked Mrs. Wilson what she did with those casks there, or something of that sort, and she said, Mr. Wilson bought them for fire-wood; I then came out at the window again, we asked her to shew us up stairs, we went up one pair of stairs, and in that room we saw a quantity of large tilts.</p>
               <p>Q. What are they? - A. They are things to make tents with; we asked Mrs. Wilson who they belonged to, she replied, to a Quaker, an old gentleman who slept in the room; we then asked her to shew us up two pair of stairs, she said she had not got the key, it was locked; I went up to the door, and saw the padlock upon the door, I tried to open it but could not; I desired my fellow officer to go down stairs, and bring up a poker to break it open, he brought a poker up, I wrenched out the staples, and went in, there I saw 101 woollen rugs, or coverlids, 66 blankets, 295 pair of stockings, 189 sheets, two drum cases, and 31 tilts; we just looked over them and came down stairs again; some little time after, Mr. Wilson knocked at the door, and was let in; Mrs. Wilson informed him, that we had been searching the house, we walked down stairs into the kitchen all of us; I asked Mr. Wilson if he knew any thing of that property that was in his house, or where he had it; he said, yes, they were his property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention to him the articles? - A. No; I don't know that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you describe it to him? - A. No; I mentioned it as the property up stairs; he said they were his, that he had bought them; I told him I hoped he could bring the person forward whom he had bought them of; I asked him if he had bought them of a shop-keeper who dealt in them; he answered me, no; he had bought them of a person at the Camel, in the Minories; he said, he believed he could bring him forward, if he went out, he should be back and bring the person in half an hour; we told him, we could not let him go, and we got a cart and took these goods to the Public-office, Lambeth-street, Whitechapel, before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. How many casks were there? - A. Fourteen, empty.</p>
               <p>Q. The goods were found up stairs? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I am a constable; I went with Griffiths to the prisoner's house; I saw in the parlour fourteen casks, all empty, and up stairs we found the things he has mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present at the conversation between the prisoner and the other constable? - A. Yes; we asked him how he came by them; he said, he honestly bought them, and paid for them, at the sign of the Camel, in the Minories; he believed the man came from Yorkshire that he bought them of, he lived there; these are the things produced here;(the articles mentioned in the indictment were produced;) I asked him if he had a bill and receipt for them; he said, no, he had not.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know whether the prisoner at the bar hired a cart of you? - A. No, I cannot swear positively whether it was him or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the man that hired the cart of you? - A. I do not; a gentleman came to me in Thames-street, about four o'clock, on a Friday, about six weeks ago, it was a holiday at the Custom-house, and asked me if I had a cart to spare; I told him, yes; I had just sent one home, and went after it;

             drove the cart; when I got the cart back, he told me to drive it into the Tower; I went with my man up as far as the White Tower, the further end; these goods laid on the pavement, and he told me to turn the cart round where the casks lay.</p>
               <p>Q. How many casks were there? - A. Fourteen; I got up into the cart, and the man likewise.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was this man there at that time that hired the cart? - A. I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. You told us just now, Sir, that the gentleman told you to drive the cart to the Tower; where was he when he told you that; did he go with you to the Tower? - A. He walked before the cart into the Tower.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How far did he walk with the cart into the Tower; as far as the casks? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. How dared you, Sir, not to give me a plain answer before; then he ordered you to set the cart round and load them there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. How many casks were there? - A. Fourteen.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they marked? - A. I don't know; I am sure I should not know them again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cover them? - A. Yes, with a tilt, for fear it should rain a little.</p>
               <p>Q. Who ordered that tilt to be brought? - A. I don't recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Who stood by and ordered them to be covered? - A. The man said, spread it; I said, there was no occasion for it to be spread.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you carry these casks when you had got them? - A. They were ordered to Lemon-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Who ordered them? - A. My man told me they were going there, that they were ordered there.</p>
               <p>Q. By whom? - A. I cannot positively say; my man went, and I told him to take five shillings for the cartage.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you left them? - A. I told them not to go the same way out, because the way was too steep for the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did you go with them? - A. I went a little way and turned back; I heard no more till I went home at night.</p>
               <p>WILLIAH GOULD sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I am servant to the last witness.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember on the 28th of October going to the Tower? - A. Yes, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon; the prisoner at the bar came to my master, and said he wanted a cart to go into the Tower, upon which my master told me to go.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he sell you where you were to go? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body else? - A. The prisoner at the bar told me to follow him, which I did up into the White Tower, as it is called; when I came up to the top of the White Tower, the gentleman that hired the cart told me to turn the cart round, which I did; a pulley was put in the cart, and fourteen casks were rolled into the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were these casks when you first saw them? - A. Upon the white pavement in the White Tower.</p>
               <p>Court. You say the fourteen casks were rolled into the cart; by whose order? - A. The prisoner's order; my master and I were going to tell the casks, thinking there were more than fourteen; the prisoner made answer and said, there were but fourteen of them, which my master and I loaded too much forward, and were obliged to put them backward, because they should not bear too hard upon the horse going down the hill; then the prisoner told me to drive to Chambers-street; then he afterwards said, drive to Lemon-street, and then he said to one of the men that had to unload the cart, you will go along with him, which he did, to Lemon-row, Lemon-street, Whitechapel, at the corner of Whitelion-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you see there? - A. When I untied the cart, the man who followed me took the first cask in; I took the next into a small new house lately built.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose house was that? - A. I don't know; the prisoner was there and received the goods from me, and helped them down from off my back; the prisoner said, at the time when I let one down, not to let them down so hard, that I should have the heads out of them; after they were taken in, I took the tilt in that was over them, and then I asked the prisoner for my cartage; he asked me how much it was? I told him five shillings; he made answer, that he thought it too much; he then gave me five shillings; then I left him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt whether that is the man that called the cart, and loaded the things? - A. I am sure it is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. This was in the day-time, was it? - A. Between four and five o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say these goods were on the pavement, you mean in the open air, not in a room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In the common way, where every body walk? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. This pavement is in the Tower; it is not in the common way? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This tent-room is the place where these things are brought from the different manufacturies? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day is the tent-room left? - A. There is no particular time of the day.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons are to be in the tent-room? - A. Myself and four labourers to do the general duty.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Were these things put in the tent-room? - A. They are not always in the same part, they are put in different parts.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What is the tent-room, is it a common room, or is it like a tent? - A. It takes the name, I believe, from having tents in formerly, it is like any other warehouse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. How long time in the day is it your duty to be in the tent-room? - A. From ten in the morning till two are the regular hours.</p>
               <p>Q. And when after? - A. From four to six.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Gould). Q. What time was it you went into the Tower with the cart? - A. Between four and five o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Crisp). Q. If I understand you right, from ten till two, and from four to six, is the usual time for somebody to be in the warehouse? - A. So I understood it, I never had any notice, it is the general practice.</p>
               <p>Q. In those hours is any thing left without any body being there? - A. Not without labourers.</p>
               <p>Q. At other times they are left, and then locked up? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. Was the 28th of October a holiday at the Tower? - A. There are no holidays.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How far is the tent-room from the White Tower? - A. About thirty yards, I cannot speak positively, they go immediately from the broad walk to the tent-room.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. I know him from being clerk to Mess. Hodgson and Hayters, packers.</p>
               <p>Q. You are cooper, and furnish them with casks? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have seen the fourteen casks that were found in the prisoner's house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are those the casks you furnished to Messrs. Hodgson and Hayters? - A. Yes; they are the same identical casks.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. My Lord, I don't mean to call the accomplice, as I submit to your Lordship, the case is sufficiently made out against the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This, I believe, is the first in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179611300064"></xptr>stance where the Crown has received any person as an informer (from whom the case originated), and made that person a witness for the purpose of prosecution, and withheld on the trial, the examination of that witness.</p>
               <p>Court. I don't know whether it ever has been so before, but I always dread to hear the evidence of an accomplice, for he comes in such a suspicious situation, generally shifting the guilt off his own shoulders upon another; and I never find fault with any Counsel for the prosecution, when an accomplice is not called; for his evidence is worth nothing of itself, nor is it to be taken into consideration, unless it is corroborated by other evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. That evidence upon his examination, which they have made use of to six the guilt upon the man, I assert, would prove the case to be of a different description to that now given; as he is upon the back of the bill, I would make use of him; and I think it not candid to withhold him.</p>

               <p>Court. I will call him, and any body shall examine him, as the man is upon the back of the bill; I make it a rule to call every body, for I have known instances in which a single witness has said that which has acquitted the prisoner; but when there are Counsel they know best whether there case is proved, and I leave it to them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. It is a novel doctrine indeed, that the Counsel for the prisoner shall say in what manner the Counsel for the prosecution shall conduct his case, it is entirely unprecedented; he being a suspicious person and concerned in the robbery, I determined not to call him, as I found the fact proved without him; and if I thought I had conducted myself uncandidly, I should be very sorry, but when I have a case, full, complete and convincing, I am not obliged to call a witness to contradict the witnesses already produced, under the idea of promoting justice; and therefore I am to use my discretion whether I shall call a witness or not, whom I am suspicious of, when I have called those upon whom I can depend.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This being the case, it comes entirely upon us; he has been made their witness, and has been thought proper to contribute to the purposes of justice, and having made him their witness, now an idea has occurred to them, that he will after the case, that witness is withheld; I would therefore call him on the part of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. Let him be called.</p>

               <p>Mr. Const. Q. Was you there? - A. Yes; Wilson went for a cart at the time, he knew they were lowering out of the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Were he present when any thing was done? - A. He came into the warehouse before Spencer and I had finished packing the goods into these casks.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he at all present assisting in packing these things in the casks, or lowering them down? - A. He was not assisting either in packing the goods or lowering them down, he only brought the cart to carry them away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell all this story to the Magistrate? - A. Yes; and a great deal more.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Then you and Wilson agreed that these things should be carried away by this cart, and in consequence of that agreement, the cart was brought and the things put in? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Wilson know who they belonged to? - A. Yes; he knew they belonged to the Board of Ordnance.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. Wilson was there when you began to lower them? - A. Yes; before we finished packing them.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys My Lord, the facts are different to what I supposed, I thought his evidence would have made Wilson out to be only a receiver.</p>

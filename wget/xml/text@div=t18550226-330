                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Harriss and Son, of London. On 19th Aug., we received seven hampers from the railway by Pickford and Co., one of which contained braces—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the invoice we received from Leicester by post, on the same morning as we received the hampers—the number of the hamper was 139; 1 counted the number of packages in that hamper, and there were 119 packages of dozens, there ought to have been 120; number 77 was missing—I made a small cross in pencil against it at the time, which is here now.</p>

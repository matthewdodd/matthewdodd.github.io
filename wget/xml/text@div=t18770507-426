I am a wharfinger, and part owner of Dowgate Dock—there are collars there for warehousing wines and spirits—the prisoner was in my employ as head cooper, and was generally in charge of the cellars—a boy named Carr was in a subordinate position to him—I took possession on 1st July, 1875, and found the prisoner there, he had been with the previous tenant—I had no wine of my own there—the Customs have their locks on the warehouse at a fixed time in the evening, and it is opened in the morning; there are guagers there who guage every cask when a delivery</p>

Breffit and Co.—it was my duty to receive goods that are landed at Dowgate Wharf, and I keep a book showing when they arrive for landing—that is a copy of the lighter book—I check the landing of the goods on the quay, a record of which is kept—refreshing my memory by this book, I can say that on 15th December, nine casks of brandy were brought alongside and landed at Dowgate Wharf—I checked the entry of the arrival and of the landing—we do not check the marks of the casks—they were placed in bond on the quay—while on the quay they are partly in my charge, and partly in Doherty's—the casks were not on the quay, they were rolled into bond for the night—I saw them on the 16th, they were then rolled out into the archway for guaging—I will not say: whether I or Doherty ordered them to be rolled out.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 21, Ltston Road, Grafton Square, Clapham, and am assistant inspector of guages for the Customs—on 16th December I was at Dowgate Dock, overlooking the guager Millard—it was his duty to have the casks placed out for him—I saw John Carr that morning by the arch where the guaging is occasionally done, and I went up and found a tin can of about 2 1/4 gallons, partly full of brandy—I asked Carr a question and sent for Millard—I had not observed Doherty, but he was on the spot in a moment, and said "We are only regulating the casks"—I said "You have no right to do anything of the sort, I don't believe you"—he said "Allow me to return the brandy to the casks again"—I said "<hi rend="italic">No</hi>"—Carr then came back with Millard—the can was then measured in my office in the presence of Doherty and myself; I don't think Carr was there; there were 7 pints of brandy in it—Carr pointed out four casks in Doherty's presence, who merely repeated his request to allow him to return the brandy to the casks—I communicated with the Custom House authorities, and in consequence of instructions from them I commenced going through the Stock ton the 20th, and it lasted a month; I went into the inner vault where the wine was kept, and saw a butt of sherry in which was a pump, and a hogshead with a funnel in it—the butt was guaged, and it was 13 gallons short—the hogshead was then dipped; it contained about 4 1/4 gallons of water, with a very small mixture of spirit—Doherty was on the spot and I said to him "What have you here?" he made no reply; Mr. Hebb said "What is it?" I replied You had better ask the man himself; he will tell you"—he asked Doherty, who said "It is only a little spirit and water"—I said "How did you get this water down in the vault; did you bring it in a cask or in a can?"—he said "I brought it down in the cask"—he had no authority to bring water into the vaults for any purpose of that sort—about</p>

               <p>I gallon per annum per cask is allowed for deficiency from evaporation, and also a gallon for sampling; there would be a sampling order, and it would be allowed for—that is credited to a cask—we should allow a gallon for a month and the same for a year—in the course of taking stock, with Air. Mil<lb></lb>lard's assistance I found four casks which I could not account for—I could not trace them in the stock in any way; one contained some Madeira one 44 gallons of port, another 11 gallons of braudy, and another some strong spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Strong spirit is plain spirit without any special character; it may be 60 or 70 degrees over proof; it is no doubt made into brandy and rum—it is delivered to distillers, but what they do with it I do not know—I do not know whether those casks were on the premises when Mr. Graves left—"regulating the casks" is an expression which I do not understand officially, but it is putting from one cask into another, equalising the quanti<lb></lb>ties, because there is not the same quantity in each cask—I never heard of that being done on wharfs—it is ipped after it is made up—making up is making the casks level, not as to quantity; but the two ends of the wood-work should be level with one another; that has nothing to do with regu<lb></lb>lating—the guaging marks are first put down on the head of the cask—the can with the 7 pints of brandy was put at the back of the cask—I saw it—it was 11 o'clock or 11.15, and it was standing there in broad daylight, but it was partly hidden by an empty package—my eyes saw it; I went up to it and looked into it, and then I spoke to Carr, who was standing there—no steps were taken against the prisoner till February—he was ad<lb></lb>mitted to bail, and has surrendered to take his trial.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. When casks come from a barge they are placed along the wharf in a row, so that the guager can guage them—it is contray to regula<lb></lb>tions to transfer liquor from one cask to another—the result of the stock<lb></lb>taking was about 450 or 460 gallons deficiency—that appears in the official report—that is after making the proper allowance.</p>

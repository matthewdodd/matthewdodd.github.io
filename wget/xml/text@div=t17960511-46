               <p>JOHN OWEN sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant to the keeper of Newgate, Mr. Kirby; I remember the prisoner at the bar being tried in this Court, in April sessions, 1794, on the Middlesex side, (produces the certificate of his conviction); I saw Mr. Shelton sign it. (It is read).</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that he is the man? - A. None; he was sent on board the hulks at Woolwich; after being there near a twelvemonth, he was brought back, and had a pardon on condition of serving in the 60th of regiment of foot, in the West-Indies; I delivered him, with others, at Southampton, according to the order that was given me on the 30th of October last; after that, I saw nothing of him till I was sent for to the Magistrates, when he was committed. During my conveying him from here to Southampton, he behaved remarkably well, very decent and civil.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him delivered on board a ship? - A. No; he was delivered to a military officer directed to receive him, and I had a receipt of him; I left him under guard of forty or fifty people, the same as I left others who had been convicted here; I received a receipt which I brought back to Mr. Kirby.</p>

            , apprehended the prisoner in a street leading from Gravel-lane, in the Borough of Southwark, towards Black friar's-bridge.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he, at that time, at large, or in custody? - A. At large; he ran away from his own house, and we followed him, and took him to the office, and he was committed; he was coming out of his own house, and when he saw us he struck back, went through his house, and over the pales, at the back of the house; it was on Wednesday the 20th of last month.</p>
               <p>Q. What parish did you take him in? - A. St. George's, Southwark.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. When Mr. Owen left me at Southampton, it was on a Saturday; we were not over-burdened with money, and we had no pay; the next day we were put on board the ships at Southampton, and it was not till the afternoon, that we had any provisions; there was a great deal of ill usage, and the sailors said, if I did not like the usage, they would bring me on shore, and so they brought me in the boat and put me on shore at Portsmouth, and they told me to go on board of a man of war if I could; I was willing to go to serve his Majesty, but I was really afraid to go, for fear I should be taken and sent back to where I came from; I am very willing to serve his Majesty, but I was very much ill used in not having provision, and no pay for almost two days.</p>

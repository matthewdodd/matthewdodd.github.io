                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer N</hi>). On the night, 25th November, I was in plain clothes, about 11 o'clock, near the Angel, Islington—a gentle<lb></lb>man named Govey came up, and we walked on towards Claremont Chapel, Pentonville—it was rather dark at that place—as we were walking along the prisoners came tumbling against me, apparently intoxicated—they had hold of each other's arms—I said "Hold up, gentlemen, don't roll about"—I could scarcely get the words out of my mouth when Henderson caught hold of my chain with his left hand, and struck me id the face with the other—it was a severe blow, and blackened my left eye—I put my hand to my waistcoat pocket, and called out "I have lost my watch"—Henderson struck me again as I held my watch with my hand—I said "You have made a mistake, I am a policeman"—I still kept hold of Henderson till the officers in uniform came up, and took him into custody—my watch chain was broken by the pull—I had it round my neck, through my button-hole into my waistcoat pocket—I never left go of Henderson—Miles was at the side of him—I had severe hits from some person—I could not tell who it was—I had black eyes for a week afterwards, and my forehead was much swollen.</p>

This happened at 11 o'clock at night—I had been out about five hours on duty—I came out about 6 o'clock—I had been in the neighbourhood of the Upper Street and Pentonville Road about two hours—it was not a very cold night—I had no great coat on—I had a mackintosh and leggings on, but not during that two hours</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187112110005"></xptr>
               <p>—I had seen Govey before on several occasions, in different parts of the Upper Street—I have spoken to him on several occasions, said "Good morning," and so on—I believe he was a clerk—I can't say that he was at that time—he had been with me three or four minutes that night—there are a great many persons about that place—another officer, named Dudley, was walking behind me—I can't say that he was visible to Hen<lb></lb>derson and Miles—I did not see anyone else with the prisoners—I did not say to either of the prisoners, when they came up, "You have trod on my toe"—Govey did not say so—I did not hear any such remark—I did not hear Miles or Henderson say "It is very odd we should both tread on your toes at the same time"—I did not say "I will give you a b——punch in the eye,"Or anything of that kind—Miles did not say "You had bettor do if—I did not strike him in the face—it was two or three minutes before I said I was a policeman; as soon as I received the second blow in the eye—I have been in the police about seven year—I went into the mud, and so did Govey—his coat was entirely spoiled—Henderson went down—I don't know whether he went in the mud—he went down with me because he wanted to get away from me—I can't say whether Henderson was muddy—I did not examine him much—I had to keep hold of him—my left eye was <hi rend="italic">bunged</hi> up, and I could not see much out of the other—as soon as I found Henderson's hand on my watch I called out "I have lost my watch"—that was before I said I was a policeman—I should think I was twenty yards from a lamp—I could see who struck me, and whose hand was on my chain—I could see pretty well.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 256, St. Paul's Road, Highbury—I am a clerk—on the night of Saturday, 25th November, I was going to see a friend—I got to the Angel about 11 o'clock—I saw two officers there—I walked on with Tew—when we got as far as Claremont Chapel the two prisoners rolled up against us—Henderson snatched at Tew's watch chain with one hand, and struck him with the other—Tew called out "I have lost my watch"—I went to catch hold of Miles when he knocked me down—I got up again, and saw that Dudley had hold of Miles, and Henderson was slipping into Tew; striking him, and struggling with him—I went to his assistance, and caught hold of Henderson—he struggled very violently, and threw us both down, himself going down also—we held him till some men came up in uniform, and he was taken to the station—I should not think Dudley was very far behind when Miles knocked me down, because he got hold of him directly I got up—he was in plain clothes—I fell into the mud when I fell, and so did Tew and Henderson.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was rather a cold night—I had known Tew before by seeing him—I always said "Good morning," and "Good evening" to him—I had been with him five or six minutes that night—I was not in employment at that time—I had been out of employment about three months—I was doing nothing for a living at that time—I was not in the habit of walking about with the police—I was living with my father—Tew had no great coat on, and had not got one on his arm—I am quite sure of that—he said "I have lost my watch"—that was the first thing I heard</p>

               <p>Tew say—I was walking close by his side—he did not address the prisoners before that—I did not hear him say "Hold up, gentlemen"—Henderson fell; we all three went down together—I did not notice Henderson's coat when we got to the station—I saw Dudley at the Angel, and said "Good evening"—he was with Tew—I did not know whether he was behind as I was walking along with Tew—the first time I discovered it was when he caught hold of Miles—it was a dark place there—there was a lamp a few yards off—I have lived at Highbury about three years—I know that road very well, but I have not counted the lamps—there are no shops there—it is a much frequented road—I can't say how long it was before the officers came up—it was all over in about three minutes—Tew and I were walking singly, not arm in arm—I did not hear anything said when the two prisoners tumbled up against Tew.</p>

I did not rush in and knock Miles down—I tried to catch hold of him, and he knocked me down—I did not get hold of him—he was about 3ft. from me when I rushed at him—I did not strike him before he knocked me down—Miles did not fall—I fell on my back—when I got up Dudley had hold of Miles—I rushed towards Miles because I thought he was concerned—both of them had hold of each other's arms, and rolling about, and directly I heard Tew say "I have lost my watch" I tried to seize him.</p>

I don't know who it was took Henderson—I can't say whether Tew did—neither of the four constables who came up are here to-day—I was about four yards behind Tew and Govey—there might have been things said that I did not hear—the first thing I heard said by Tew was something about his watch—after the assault I was near enough to hear anything—Govey passed me at the Angel, and said "Good evening"—I knew him before—I have seen him a great many times in Islington—I have not had much conversation with him, we merely passed the word "Good morning," and "Good evening"—I believe he is a clerk—his father is a gentleman—I believe he was out of employment at that time—he and Tew started from the Angel, and I was close behind—it was rather a cold night—Tew had not got a great coat on, and he had not got a mackintosh with him—I had been with him from about 6.30—he had a mackintosh the first part of the evening—I saw it at the Islington police-station about 6.30—he was with me after that time till the assault took place—I did not notice his mackintosh during that time—we were on duty together—I did not notice any mackintosh, except at the police-station—it is a very small mackintosh, and can be put in the pocket—there was a lamp about three yards from where the assault took place—I had no difficulty in seeing—there</p>

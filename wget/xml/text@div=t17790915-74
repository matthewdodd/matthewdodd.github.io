            . It becomes my duty, as counsel for the prosecution, to state to you as faithfully as I can the circumstances attending the death of that unhappy man.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, it seems that the man, touching whose death you are now about to enquire, was a kind of <rs id="t17790915-74-viclabel385" type="occupation">assistant at the Publick-office in Bow-street</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17790915-74-victim730 t17790915-74-viclabel385"></join>. The prisoner, who is charged with having murdered him, it seems cohabited with a man of the name of Farmello, lodged with him, and lived with him as his wife, (though not really married to him). On the morning of the 31st of July it seems there had been a quarrel in the house<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150080"></xptr> where the prisoner lodged, between the prisoner at the bar and another woman, who lodged in the same house; from words they proceeded to blows, the consequence of which was, that the other woman went before a magistrate for the purpose of procuring a warrant to take up the prisoner and her husband for the assault committed upon her; when they came to enquire at the office in Bow-street, it was about three in the afternoon, they found then that there was no magistrate there, and that they could not have a warrant till six or seven o'clock in the evening; upon which the woman who came for the warrant begged to know whether there was any constable there that would go with her to take up the man of the name of Farmello, as an idle and disorderly person, and being a person within the description of the law that has lately passed for the recruiting of his majesty's forces; upon that a man of the name of Prothero, who is a constable of that parish, and who had a warrant authorising him to seise persons within that description, said he would go, and he spoke to Barnet who was there and desired him to go with him, they went together in company with the woman, to the house in Castle-street, where the prisoner at the bar and the man lodged; upon going up to his room-door they found it fastened, and I think Prothero knocked at the door and demanded to be admitted; that was refused to him; one of the people of the house said, there is no occasion to go in through that door, there is another room that communicates with this, I can unbolt that door for you; the person went and unbolted it, and Prothero the constable, together with William Barnet, entered the room; in the room there were no persons but the prisoner at the bar and Farmello, who was a journeyman shoemaker, and followed that business in his lodgings. When Prothero came in he said to the man you must come along with us; Farmello made no answer, but the constable repeated it again; the man made no kind of resistance or show of resistance, for I think he had a rasp in his hand at the time, which he put out of his hand and had no weapon of offence about him, nor did he seem to meditate any kind of injury to any body; but the prisoner at the bar, who had in her hand a long knife, without a word having been said to her, without any kind of provocation having been given to her, ran at Barnet and plunged the knife into his breast, of which wound he languished till four o'clock the next day and then died.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, this will be the nature of the evidence that will be submitted to your consideration, and it being a clear fact upon which nobody can doubt that this man's death was occasioned by the wound given him by the prisoner; it will then remain for your consideration, under the direction of his lordship, whether there are to be found any circumstances in this case which will extenuate the offence to manslaughter.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I shall take leave shortly to state to you what I conceive to be the law upon this subject, which I do the more readily, because I have the honour to speak before judges of known and consummate abilities.</p>
               <p>I take it to be a settled principle of criminal law, that wherever there is a voluntary felonious homicide, without provocation, it will amount to murder. If it turns out in fact that the constable and his assistant were strictly in the execution of their duty and their office, there then could be no question at all made, but what this must necessarily amount to the offence of murder. But I own I doubt, myself, whether the constable was in the due execution of his office, for though he was possessed of a warrant which authorised him to search for people of a certain description, I confess it does not appear to me that the man who was the object of that search was a person who fell within the description of that law, and though the constable received that kind of information, yet I conceive a constable is always acting at his peril in that respect; and I doubt extremely whether he can be said to be in the execution of his office. But supposing that he was not in the execution of his office, then the constable and this man who was his assistant can only be considered in the light of trespassers,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150081"></xptr> that is, they are persons who without any legal authority, got into the room of another, and in so doing have barely committed a trespass; for you will observe that at this time there was no arrest of the person nor any attempt of that kind made before the blow was given, they had proceeded no farther than a menace of taking up the man, by that expression,</p>
               <p>"you must go along with me;" so they were, as I said, barely trespassers. Now I take it to be one of the decided cases, that where a trespasser is found upon the land of another, and the other with a dangerous weapon, likely from its nature to kill, gives him a blow which occasions his death, the law says it is such an indication of that brutal conduct which implies malice, that such offence in the eye of the law amounts to murder. Now considering this case in that point of view, and considering these men as barely trespassers in the room of Farmello, without doing any thing more, I should conceive that the conduct of that unfortunate woman such as it was, subjects her to the extent of the charge against her, namely that of wilful murder.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, there seems another way in which this matter may be considered also, which is this, supposing they were not in the legal execution of their office, but the constable and his assistant had actually attempted to apprehend the man, I conceive then if the man himself, whose liberty was so attempted to be invaded, had resisted and killed the constable or his assistant, that would clearly amount to no more than manslaughter. But I think it a matter of great doubt and worthy of consideration, whether the law gives that favour to any other persons except the person whose liberty was actually attempted to be invaded. Here there was no menace or threat against the prisoner; she was not the object of their warrant or search, nor was meant to be apprehended; she was merely a person standing by upon whom no attack was made. It seems to me therefore, considered in either point of view, with respect to her, the offence of murder imputed to her cannot possibly be lowered. I have taken the liberty to state my opinion upon the subject, under the correction of the learned judges upon the bench, from whom I have no doubt you will receive proper instructions upon the subject, and I have no doubt but you will discharge the duty imposed on you as you ought to do.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable of the parish of St. Martin in the Fields. At about half after four o'clock in the afternoon of the 31st of July, I was at home at my own house, which is in Castle-street. Barnet the deceased came to my house and asked me if I would go with him to impress a man who had been beating a woman, and had almost murdered her; he said he was a loose, idle, disorderly man, and came within the meaning of the act to be pressed; I asked him how he knew that; he said the two women were at the door and would inform me of the nature of it; I came to the door; the two women were there; one was terribly beat; I enquired further into the matter; they said he was a loose, drunken, noisy man, and lived with a woman who was not his wife. Barnet and I went with them.</p>
               <p>Had you any warrant or authority under which you acted? - I had this (producing it). I went to the house, it is a publick-house in Castle-street, Long-acre; it was within 150 yards of my house. When I went into the passage of the house, I saw three men standing on the stairs. One said here is the constable coming up stairs to take him; I told them not to be in a hurry, but show me the door; they showed it me; I tapped at it with my hand; I had nothing in my hand; a question was asked from within by Farmello, as I imagine, as it was a man's voice, who is there? I said it is me, open the door. A servant maid in a room adjoining, said you need not go in that way, you may go in this way; that was a door in the middle of the wainscot which was a communication from one room to the other. Mr. Stephens and Mr. Ellis, who were in the room, went and unbolted the door, as the bolt was on their side. When they unbolted the door I went in.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150082"></xptr> Were Stephens and Ellis of your company? - Yes. When I went in I saw Farmello standing in the middle of the room straight before me.</p>
               <p>Did you know Farmello before? - I did not. The prisoner stood on my left hand; when I went into the room I just waved my finger, I had nothing in my hand; and I said to Farmello, come my friend, you must go along with me; the answer he made me was what for? Barnet, the deceased stood on the right hand side of me and said, before I could make an answer to his question, come, come, you must go. Upon that the prisoner stepped by me in front of me, and I saw her strike Barnet, and she said, I think it was, d - n you, he shan't; I think that was the word; I know it was an oath. When her hand quitted him, I saw the knife was left sticking in his body, upon that he turned out of the room and said Lord have mercy upon me, I am killed, I turned round with a view of securing the man; I observed then that he had in his hand a long rasp (a kind of coarse file) about fourteen inches long; I had not observed the rasp before. I ran up to him and said what you villain do you intend to murder me; I struck him as hard as I could with my hand, and he either threw it out of his hand or dropped it, I cannot tell which; I catched him by the collar, and got hold of the woman; I begged Mr. Stephens and Mr. Ellis to assist me, which they did, and we secured them.</p>
               <p>How long did the deceased live? - Twenty-four hours within a few minutes.</p>
               <p>What became of Farmello then? - He is out upon bail for the assault upon Stephens.</p>
               <p>But he has never been sent any where under this impress act? - No.</p>
               <p>I understand he was a journeyman shoemaker? - I was told so.</p>

               <p>I lodged in the same house the prisoner and Farmello lodged in. I went on Saturday the 31st of July to the office in Bow-street to get a warrant for their abusing me. Mr. Barnet was over the way in Bow-street; I went to him, and told him I wanted a warrant for Mrs. Farmello (as they called her) for abusing me; he said I could not have one till six o'clock. I asked him if I could not get one elsewhere; he said he did not know. He asked what sort of people they were, and who they were. I said there was a man lived with her that had a wife of his own that he did not live with, and that he did not mind his business. He asked me if I was sure of that; my husband made answer that he did not.</p>
               <p>Had you any complaint against Farmello? - No; they never affronted me till that day. My husband said they always worked on a Sunday, Mr. Barnett said, if he lives with another woman, not his wife, he is under the act, and liable to be pressed; he said he would get Mr. Prothero to go along with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150083"></xptr> us; he went with us to Mr. Prothero's house, and then we went to the house; what happened up stairs I do not know. I sat in the passage a few minutes; as I went up stairs I met Barnett coming out of the room with a knife in his left side. He said O dear! O dear! three times, and asked me to take it out. I turned my back on him, and said nothing more.</p>

               <p>How long had these people lodged at this house? - Six weeks.</p>

               <p>Since I began to sum up, an observation that has struck my brother Gould has made it unnecessary for me to state to you what my sentiments are upon the law of this question; it is sufficient for me now to say, that there is a doubt entertained in the court upon this question, whether under all the circumstances of the case it amounts to murder or no; and as the opinion of the judges will be taken hereafter upon this question, the proper course will be, if you too have your doubts that you should find a special verdict; that is find all the circumstances of the case, and leave the conclusion to the court. The minutes therefore of the special verdict are now drawing up by the counsel on each side, and will afterwards be read to you for your approbation.</p>

             proceeded thus.)</p>
               <p>Gentlemen,</p>
               <p>The counsel for the prisoner has just now very properly suggested to us that he thinks the jury ought to exercise their discretion upon the matter, if they think fit to take it upon themselves to say whether it is murder or manslaughter, because if you should be of opinion, upon what I shall state to you, and what I hope my brothers will, that it is only manslaughter, then there is no occasion to debate the matter more solemnly, and it is sit that the prisoner should have that chance. But if you should be of opinion that it is too much to take upon yourselves, you may be relieved from it by finding a special verdict. It is my duty, therefore, to tell you, which I shall do in a very few words, what I conceive this crime to be, and I should be exceedingly happy if I could in my conscience look upon it as amounting only to manslaughter, but am sorry to say that I cannot, as I see her act in a very different light from that in which I should have considered the act of the man himself. If Farmello, when the constables entered the room as they did with an insufficient warrant, or perhaps with a sufficient one, but not disclosing the business upon which they came, if he had immediately, in his own defence, rather than suffer himself to be impressed, done the deed that unfortunately ended in the man's death, I should have thought that would have amounted only to manslaughter; but I consider this woman in the light of an absolute stranger, a mere stander-by, a woman who had no right to be concerned in any degree whatever for him; she was not his wife, if she had been so it might have been a very different consideration; but standing in the light she does, notwithstanding her cohabitation with him, she is in the eye of the law a mere stranger to him to all intents and purposes; that stranger, (when the officers came in, whether they had a warrant or no, whether it was legal or no) before he made any resistance, when he only asked why am I to go? at that instant she stabbed the deceased; she took no method whatever to prevent his arrest; she did not argue with them; she did not struggle with them; she did not supplicate them; she said not a word, but in the instant before any answer could come out of any of their mouths, she stabbed the deceased. I fairly confess that I think this can amount in point of law to nothing less than murder. I know there have been cases where this doctrine has been considered heretofore, and there have been some doubts entertained upon the subject how far a mere stranger, a stander-by, is at liberty to interpose; when that interposition is justifiable, or when it is officious. In one of those cases, where a person was taken up by a constable who was out of his jurisdiction, and had not therefore a proper authority, a person interposing occasioned the death of another, and the majority of the judges held that a justifiable interposition, but without giving any opinion upon that determination at present, there were very different circumstances attending that case, because in that there was a general scuffle; a struggle and conflict between the parties; the blood might be supposed to be heated on both sides; that blow was not given in the cool manner in which. this murder was perpetrated, in the instant before any blood could be heated, or any sort of provocation given beyond that which you have heard. I am therefore clearly of opinion that this does, upon the whole of the case, amount to murder. I wished to have avoided giving you my opinion upon the point; however I have done it as it strikes me, but I hope my brothers will give you their sense of the matter, that you may have the assistance of much fuller and abler directions.</p>
               <p>Mr. JUSTICE GOULD.</p>
               <p>I am very far from differing in opinion with my brother Hotham; but I think in every case where the life of a fellow-subject is at stake, it becomes the judges, if they see any difficulty in the way, to proceed with the utmost-caution; to remember that maxim of the law, that no delay is too long<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150085"></xptr> where the life of a man is at stake. The reason of my suggesting what I have done to my brothers was the recollection of a principle that is laid down in two authorities, one of them was alluded to in a most candid manner by the counsel for the prosecution, Hugget's case, which was in the time of L. C. J. Hale; the other was in the time of Queen Anne. The case of the queen and Tooley, both of which cases, as I recollect, were upon special verdicts, and the principle that is laid down in each of them, and which makes me wish to have this case, undergo a future consideration is, that where an attempt against law is made, with force and violence, to deprive an Englishman of his liberty, it is a provocation to every fellow-subject in the kingdom, because every man is called upon to preserve the constitutional liberty of his fellow-subject, when he is attempted illegally to be deprived of it. Now, in this case, there can be no question upon the fact upon Prothero's evidence, but that he and Barnet, the deceased, did attempt illegally to deprive Farmello of his liberty, and most emphatically I may apply it to Barnet the unfortunate deceased, because when Farmello asked</p>
               <p>"what for?" by no means implying that he was willing to go, Barnet says,</p>
               <p>"come, come, you must go;" that in plain English necessarily implies I will force you to go. Now a material observation has been made by my brother, that there was no resistance offered by Farmello, in truth, his person was not touched, there was no affray began, but the prisoner seeing that Farmello would be taken away in an illegal manner, she, in this rash way, occasions death. The doubt which I have, is, upon the principle which is laid down in these two authorities, which I do wish to have a further consideration of, at the same time desiring it to be understood, that I do not, in my present sentiments, at all differ from the idea and opinion delivered by my learned brother.</p>
               <p>Mr. JUSTICE ASHHURST.</p>
               <p>There is no doubt, but that in a case of this kind, where a person is indicted for murder, the jury have a right, if they think fit, to give a general verdict; in doing of which they necessarily must take upon themselves the determination of the law upon the subject. If the case appears to them to be doubtful, they may rather choose to relieve their own minds from the difficulty of deciding upon the law, and giving a general verdict ( either murder or manslaughter) and may find the facts specially, in order that the question of law may ultimately be determined (upon argument) by the judges. It was the desire of the prisoner's counsel, that this option might be given to the jury, whether they choose to take upon themselves the decision of the law, and to give a general verdict, or whether they choose to have the facts found specially. You have not signified your inclination whether you choose to exercise that option or not. But supposing you should be inclined to exercise it, in that case it is fit and proper that we should inform you what are our opinions as to the law arising from the facts before you. Now I own, as to that I do not myself at present entertain much doubt with respect to those two cases that have been alluded to of Huggets and Tooley. I own, if the same facts had now been before me (sitting here) that are mentioned in those cases, I do not know that I should perfectly have coincided with the opinion which the majority of the judges gave in those cases, or at least not with the reasons upon which their opinions were founded; but however allowing these cases their full weight, I think in the present case there are circumstances appearing, that makes this case distinguishable from either of those two cases. With regard to the case of the King and Toddy, the facts there seem not to be reported quite so fully as they might have been, but as it is reported it appears, that the constable having taken a woman to the watch-house (and as far as appears, illegally; he having acted out of his jurisdiction) some soldiers afterwards, feeling a compassion for the case of the woman, came to the watch-house, and attempted a rescue; now from that circumstance, their having actually attempted a rescue, it is plain there was some act done by them, and some affray probably<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150086"></xptr> happened before the time the mortal wound was given; and if, in the prosecuting that act, and meeting with opposition, their blood became warm, and they gave one of the parties, opposing them, a mortal wound; that might be deemed manslaughter; not upon the ground</p>
               <p>"that it is a sufficient provocation, where any of the king's subjects sees the liberty of another subject invaded, immediately to give a mortal blow to the person so invading it;" but upon this ground, that having lawfully interposed, in order to prevent the invasion of his liberty, and, meeting with opposition, his blood might be heated by the contest, and the wound being given in that heat of blood, it shall extenuate the case to manslaughter; so far I go with that determination, taking it upon that ground; but in this case there is no such circumstance appearing; all that appears in this case is, that these constables, endeavouring to restrain Farmello of his liberty (and that illegally, he not being a proper object of the impress laws) the prisoner standing by (without any previous attempt to rescue, without any scuffle between her and the constables, which might have warmed her blood, the man himself standing quietly, and not making any resistance) draws out a knife, and stabs the deceased in a vital part. I own it does not appear to me that that can be considered in any other light than as murder. These are my sentiments upon the subject, which I thought it my duty to give you, that if you do choose to exercise that right you have of finding a general verdict, and to say it is either murder or manslaughter, you may have the best assistance we can give you respecting the law of the case, but if you choose to relieve your minds from that difficulty you may find the facts specially, and refer it to the decision of the judges.</p>

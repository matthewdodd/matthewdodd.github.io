It appeared that the Prisoners came to the Prosecutor's Shop to cheapen Silk, and while Simpson was buying, Jones took the piece mention'd in the Indictment and put it under her Riding Hood; that they went out together, and turning back again the Goods were found on Jones, which she dropt at the Door. Jones denyed the Fact, saying they came back to buy more Silk, and the piece mention'd was found in the Prosecutor's Shop, and call'd several to her Reputation. Simpson pleaded, that Jones came to her House for a Petticoat she was quilting for her; that she ask'd Jones to go along with her to buy a Furbelow Scarf; that they went into several Shops but could meet with none to fit her, being a short Woman; whereupon they went into the Prosecutor's to buy Silk to make one; that she bought Silk for one and paid for it, and going Home, bethought her self that her Hood, which was old and rusty, would not look well with a new Scarf, they went back to buy more Silk for a Hood, and were charged by the Prosecutor with stealing the Silk aforesaid, which she declared she knew nothing of, <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="171901150002"></xptr> and called several to her Reputation, who gave her a very good Character.

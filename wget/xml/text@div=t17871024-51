               <p>All the reason you have to say that he broke out was, that you do not know how he could get out otherways? - I saw no marks of violence, but the yard door unbolted and half open, and near to it a pair of step-ladders placed against a wall in my yard; I bolted the door myself before I went to bed, I do every night of my life.</p>
               <p>Then you saw a person searching your coat and waistcoat, and he dropped the coat and waistcoat and went away? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How soon afterwards did you see him? - I suppose it might be in the course of a minute or two.</p>
               <p>You saw a person in a neighbouring yard that you supposed to be the same, and apprehended him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You do not know that it was him? - No.</p>
               <p>Was the ladder against the wall that parted your yard and the neighbouring yard? - It was.</p>
               <p>Did that ladder always stand against the wall? - The prisoner knows better than me, it might be there at times without doubt.</p>
               <p>What did he say when you apprehended him? - I expressed some feelings that I was sorry to find him there; and he said, I do<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178710240058"></xptr>not care, you can only transport me, or send me abroad.</p>
               <p>Had he any thing about him when you found him in the necessary? - We did not search him till afterwards.</p>
               <p>He did not take any thing from you? - I do not know that he did.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father, at Finchley. On 30th or 31st May I saw this brooch in a small Indian in laid box on the drawing-room table—the box did not belong to me—I don't know how the brooch came in it; it was usually kept in my own box, in my bedroom—it was produced to me on 24th June—it was the prisoner's duty to clean the drawing-room—she had been in my father's service about five months.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, S.</hi> 144.) On 18th June, I made a search in Mr. Westmacott's house—I had just shut up a box in the prisoner's room, and I saw her go behind the door where a gown was hanging—she put her hand to the gown, took out a piece of paper—I turned, and she tried to toss it down—I said, "Halloo, Jane, what is that?"—I took it up; this brooch was in it—she said, "That is the brooch I picked up in the drawing-room."</p>

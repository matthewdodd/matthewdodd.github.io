I am a tailor, of 30, Camomile Street—about 12 o'clock on 31st July, I was in Duke Street—the prisoner and another man followed me—the prisoner snatched my watch and chain from my waistcoat pocket—I followed him, and never lost sight of him till he was caught by a policeman—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a portion of my chain—the value of the watch and chain was thirty guineas.</p>

I Jive at 5, Rutland Street, Whitechapel—about 11.30 o'clock, on 31st July, I was standing at the corner of the Minories, talking to a friend—I saw the prisoner and another man, following the prosecutor—they followed him into Duke Street—I afterwards heard cries of "Stop thief!" and saw him running after the prisoner.</p>

Phillips, Master, a Passenger from Holland, and brought on board the said Ship a Bag marked S. J. with 150 lb. of Human Hair in it, and left it on board the said Ship; that he going to fetch this Bag on shore could not find it. The other Evidences, who were Passengers likewise, deposed, that they saw such a Bag on board, and the Prisoner and one Jebone carried it towards the Cook-Room in the middle of the Day, and that they afterwards went on Shore; but they could not tell what became of it afterwards. The Prisoner denied the Fact, and called several to his Reputation, who gave him a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="171709110007"></xptr> good Character. Mr. Philips, the Master of the Ship, deposed he had sailed with him for six Months, and that he never knew him guilty of the least Dishonesty; that he had served an Apprenticeship to his Father, and he had known him all the time, and as an honest Fellow had employ'd him. He deposed likewise, that he did not believe there were any such Goods brought on board; that he nor any of his Ships Crew had never seen any such Bag; that the Prosecutor had never given an account of any such Goods to him, or to his Mate, or to his Steward; and added, that the Prosecutor pleaded so much Poverty, that he would have begged his Passage. Another Person deposed, that the Prosecutor came to him to go with him to the Ship to fetch a Bag and a Basket; that he asked him what was in it, and he answer'd, nothing but his old Clothes; and pleaded so great Poverty, that he told him he had not Six-pence in the World. The Tide-Surveyor deposed, that when he went on board the said Ship he saw no such Parcel there; that if he had he should have taken an account of it, it being Merchandize, and such as pays 20 l. per Cent. Duty; and that there was no such Goods enter'd at the Custom house; and added, that he thought it was impossible that a parcel of that Bulk and Weight could be carried out of the Ship at Noon Day, as had been deposed, when there were several Tide-Waiters on board.

                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker of Thomas-street, Woolwich—on Tuesday night, 29th January, between 8 and 9 o'clock, the prisoner came to my shop and asked me if I had any rings—I said, "No, only plain ones"—he said they would not do—he asked if I had got any lever watches—I said, "Yes"—I showed him one that did not suit him—I showed him another—he agreed to give me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he then asked if I had got an Albert chain—he selected one—I attached it to the watch—he put the watch to his ear two or three times, and I took it out of his hand and put the number of it down in a book—I was waiting for the money—he opened his pocket</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186102250067"></xptr>
               <p>and pulled out his porte-monnaie, shut it up and put it in his pocket again, then put his hand in his left hand pocket, and ail of a sudden he threw with his left hand some stuff into my eyes, and then broke the glass-case in the shop and stole from it a gold hunting lever watch, a gold guard, a gold Albert chain, and a gold brooch—they were quite safe on the counter while he was in the shop—I missed them all from the glass case, and also a piece of velvet—he did not take the watch and chain that he had bargained for, but he snatched at it—I am quite certain the prisoner is the man—I identified him at Colches<lb></lb>ter—when he was in my shop he was dressed in the undress of a line soldier—he had "86" on his cap—after he had broken the glass and taken the things, he slammed the door and ran out of the shop—I ran after him as well as I could—a person named Penn also ran after him—I have not seen my watches or anything since.</p>

I am a master painter of Sandys Hill, Woolwich—on Tuesday evening, 29th January, between half-past 8 and 9 o'clock, I was near the prosecutor's shop when Mr. Barrell was chasing the prisoner—I followed the prisoner round William-street, into Wellington-street, where I overtook him—as soon as he saw me approach he threw some powder into my face—it very nearly blinded me, and it went into my mouth as well—he got away—I am quite certain he is the man—I picked him out of six others at Woolwich police-station.</p>

I took the prisoner into custody at col<lb></lb>chester, on 12th of the present month—I was not present when Mr. Barrell identified him—I was present when Penn identified him, at the police-station at Woolwich—there were six others placed with him, and Penn selected him from among the six—he was detained as a deserter from the 67th at Colchester, and from information we received, also from several other regiments—he was not in the 86th at any time to my knowledge—the "86" on his cap was supposed to be done by reversing the figures.</p>

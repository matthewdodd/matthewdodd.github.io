                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer C</hi>). On Saturday evening, 15th March, I was at the Alhambra, and saw a crowd going in at the gallery entrance—the prisoners, went in together, and when they had got up eight or ten steps Romain turned round, meeting the crowd, and I saw him put his hand into the dress of a female, and take it out closed—he came down to the door and opened a purse, and was about to take something out but I took hold of his hand and said "I shall take you in custody for stealing that purse"—he said "It is my purse, there is only a shilling in it and you want to steal it"—we had a struggle, and I took him to the station, and found Abrams there—Romain said that he had never seen Abrams before—I took two loose sixpences and two small knives from Romain's waistcoat pocket, one of which was open—he said "That is not my knife, that belongs to the other man"—I saw them both together at the Alhambra, and in conversation.</p>

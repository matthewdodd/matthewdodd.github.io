            . I am a policeman. I apprehended the prisoner Wright on Monday afternoon, about four o'clock, (the afternoon of the robbery) in Wentworth-street, Whitechapel, in a house of ill-fame where he lodged; he was up reading the newspaper - I waited about twenty minutes for more of my brother officers to come up - I told him I wanted him for the watch in Rose-lane, and he said he thought I wanted him by my hanging about so - I then took him to the station-house, and then looked for the direction of the prosecutor; and as I came out of the back-office, Wright said to me,"It is a pity the innocent should suffer for the guilty, ar'nt you going to apprehend Cakey," (which is a nickname of Reynolds) - I said I should as soon as I could see him; and after I had been to Houndsditch I was coming along with the prosecutor - I received some information and went to a house in Rose-lane, and found Reynolds laying on the bed without his coat, in liquor - this was about four yards from where the robbery was committed as I understood - I said, "Cakey, I want you;" he said, "I will go with you, I will not run away;" I said, "I will take care of that;" he went with me to the station-house - I then had a third person in custody<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050012"></xptr>who was suspected - I produced all the three to Leventhall, and as soon as he got inside the station-house, he said to the third man, "That man I do not know, these two(the prisoners) are the men that robbed me" - I do not know that they said anything to it at the time - I was present at the examination when Kent attended and was tipsy; I saw he was not fit to go in, and tried to persuade him to go home, but he would go in - he was examined, and said Wright was not one of the men who committed the robbery, but I consider myself that he was not capable of speaking about it; he said nothing about Reynolds - he was not capable of judging correctly, or of speaking about it.</p>

            . On the 9th of May, 1832, I apprehended Wright in the Old Jewry for stealing a coat; he was convicted in this Court at the following Sessions - I have the certificate of his conviction, (read) the prisoner is the person who was tried and convicted.</p>
               <p>Wright's Defence (written). On the 15th of last July, I came to town from Woolwich, where I was residing with my mother, in consequence of being out of employ; about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, I was proceeding down Essex-street, Whitechapel; I saw two young men pass me in great haste; within about fifty yards of thent, I saw a person making an uncouth noise, and was running after the young men; when he came towards me some one came behind him and knocked him down; when he got up, I saw a watch and appendages lying in the kennel; I stepped off the pavement, with the intention of picking it up, to give it to the prosecutor, when two men (to all appearance labourers) procured it and gave it him; when he had it, he proceeded towards Whitechapel, in the direction after the young men who ran away. I did not know at the time exactly what had happened, and followed him to ascertain; when he stopped a mob collected round him, I joined them and inquired of him what had happened, when he replied, the two young men he was following had robbed him of a watch; I then told him I did not think he had lost a watch, as two men had picked one up, and gave it him; he then stated he had two watches in the same pocket and had lost one; I conversed with him, persuading him what to do, nearly twenty minutes; during the time two policemen came up, and inquired into it; he never at the time accused me of being a party concerned: he then went with them to the station-house, and gave information of the robbery; about two hours after three policemen, with the prosecutor, came down the street where I was residing with my sister; I was standing at the door, they all looked at me; the policeman put some question to him, to which he shook his head, and passed on; afterwards I had my tea, and cleaned myself, with the intention of returning to Woolwich. I was sitting in the front parlour, when the policeman Conolly called, and said he wanted me; I asked him what he wanted; he replied, on suspicion of highway robbery; I stated I was entirely innocent of the charge; he asked me several questions going to the station-house; I told him, I knew nothing of the transaction, and for him not to bother me with questions; I added, it was a pity that the innocent should suffer for the guilty. There was a person whom I did not know taken at the same time with me; when locked up in the station-house the aforesaid person said to me, "Young man you are entirely innocent of the charge, and should we go before a magistrate, I will tell him so;" he called the policeman, and made a communication, which I did not hear; the policeman replied, "He'll be here by and by," but to whom he alluded I did not know; about eight o'clock in the evening the prisoner Reynolds was brought in; we were then placed together for the prosecutor to recognize us; he then swore to the prisoner Reynolds as the person who robbed him, and me as the person who shoved against him, we were then locked up in the station-house cell, with some other prisoners, when a person (which afterwards proved to be the witness, Kent) came with two policemen and said he could identify the persons who committed the robbery; at eleven o'clock at night we were taken out for him to view us, when he positively stated that we were not the persons who committed the robbery; next morning we were examined before Mr. Broughton, at Worship-street, when the prosecutor swore to the statement he made above; the policeman Conolly begged for our being remanded, as he stated he could prove our being the parties; we where then remanded till the 20th of July, when the witness Kent (being on oath) swore positively I was not one of the party, of which there is proof in the depositions. We were again remanded till the 27th, when the magistrate was going to commit us, but being reminded of the depositions of the witness Kent, he again remanded us till the 30th, when he took the witness Kent's depositions down again, in which he flatly contradicted his former statement, swearing to me as the person who took the watch, and Reynolds as the person who shoved against the prosecutor: when they told him to beware of what he stated, as he had stated quite different on a previous examination, we were then remanded till the 3rd of August, when we were fully committed to Newgate. Mr. Broughton, the magistrate, remarked, he should be most happy to discharge us, as he believed us to be innocent, but under the peculiar circumstances he deemed it his duty to send it before a Jury. I beg most solemnly to assure you, I am entirely innocent of the charge laid against me, and beg to call your attention to the fact of the prosecutor seeing me several times, and not recognizing me as a party concerned; the witness Kent twice positively stating I was not one of the party. Were I guilty it is not probable I should have remained about the spot where the robbery was committed, but would naturally have endeavoured to conceal myself, or have left the quarter where I was residing. I now humbly leave my case to your serious consideration, trusting the importance of the case will induce you to ponder well 'ere you return your verdict. Solemnly asserting my innocence, I appeal to the well-known justice and humanity of a British Jury.</p>

             re-examined. I was not there when Kent was first brought to the station-house.</p>
               <p>Reynolds' Defence (written). On the 15th of July, the day that the robbery was committed, I was at work until five o'clock in the afternoon; about seven o'clock the same evening I went to see a friend of mine, and after I had been there about half an hour, a policeman knocked at the door of the room that I was in, and said that I was his prisoner; I was surprised and asked him upon what charge? he, the policeman said, for stealing a watch; I denied the charge, but he took me to the station-house. When I arrived at the station-house, I saw two other men which I learned were there for the same robbery that I was charged with. The next morning, the 16th instant, I was taken to Worship-street office, the prosecutor came and said that I was the man that robbed him, I was then remanded. On Saturday, the 20th instant, I was again placed at the office, and was again remanded until the 27th instant; I was taken to the office, and a man came and swore that neither me nor my fellow-prisoner were the men who had robbed him, meaning the prosecutor. He, the witness, said that he should know the men, if he was to see them: we were again remanded until the following Tuesday, the 30th instant, I again was placed at the bar, and the witness swore that my fellow-prisoner Wright was the man that robbed him; at the same time the prosecutor swore that I was the man.</p>

               <p>Reynolds. That gentleman was not present before three examinations passed - he came down to the cell, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050013"></xptr>said that for 3l. 10s. he would put the prosecution on one side, and Conelly said he was quite angry with him for talking to the prisoners - he came to us several times; he said he was a man of the world, and had a son and daughter transported himself, and knew the business perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Wright. I only had the use of one hand, and was not able to attack anybody.</p>

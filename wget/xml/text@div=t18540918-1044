The prisoner lived in the same house, in the back room on the second floor—I and my husband lived in the front room—about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, on 7th Sept, I was coming in from market; Mrs. Rich's door was open, and I saw her tuck up her sleeves, and take off her cap; she said to her husband, "Now, you b—r, come and fight"—I heard the prisoner's voice, but I did not see him—I went into my own room, and in a little time the prisoner and his wife were both on my landing—I opened my door, and got his wife into my room—she asked for a drink of water; I gave her the water, and she went out again—when</p>

On the afternoon of 7th Sept, the prisoner's little girl came up to me, and asked me to come down and see her mother—they live at No. 8, in the same court—I went, and saw the prisoner's wife standing by her own room door, with her bonnet in her hand—the prisoner was in the room; he could hear—I said to his wife, "What is the matter?" she said, "O, Mrs. Smale, I'm done!" she spoke thick, and I said, "You had better come to the hospital"—I brought her down, and was taking her there, when the doctor from the workhouse overtook us, and told me to take her to the workhouse—I saw; her spit one drop of blood.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon of St. Giles's Workhouse. I think I must have seen the woman within an hour of her admission; there was evidence of a blow on the back of the head, and considerable swelling about the throat—her breathing was exceedingly difficult, and when she spoke she spoke with a hissing whistle; she appeared to be labouring under pain from: the bruise—I think I last saw her alive about midnight on the Saturday,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185409180104"></xptr>
               <p>and she died on Sunday morning—the injury had taken place on Thursday—I afterwards made an examination of the body—there were several unim<lb></lb>portant bruises about the body—the mischief was altogether in the throat; that was the cause of death—on removing the integuments there was evidence of external violence, and considerable extravasation of blood—there was a great deal of inflammation of the windpipe, which occasioned contrac<lb></lb>tion in the upper part of the throat—the thyroid cartilage was fractured, which must have been by violence—she died in consequence of congestion of the lungs, produced by the injury in the throat—it must have been a blow—I think pressing would not have caused it—I think a kick would account for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you open the head? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; there was a bruise on the back of the head, but not of any consequence—the cause of death was congestion of the lungs, occasioned by the blow—I think the injury could not be occasioned by mere pressure of the hand; if he did that in trying to rescue himself from her, because the parts there so easily yield to pressure—the cartilage was actually fractured, as you would find a piece of pasteboard broken—I think that could not have been effected by the prisoner grasping the neck of his assailant—I had some conversation with the deceased; I asked her, in the presence of a medical friend, how she came by the injury, and her answer was, she did not know whether she had fallen and hurt herself but she said, "Somehow or other, I got the blow."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing she had fallen, and her throat had come in contact with any hard substance, might not that likewise have occasioned a fracture of the cartilage? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, such a thing as a fender might—I believe it to have been occasioned by some sudden violence.</p>

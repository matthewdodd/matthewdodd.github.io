I am a constable, Mr Warring came to me, and said, he had a room, but the prisoner had lost the key; we wrenched the lock, the sheets were missing, the prisoner said, he had made away with them; I asked him, if he had no friend to lend him the money to get them out of pawn? he said, he had not. I sent for the man he worked for, but he would not pay the money: I took him to New Prison.</p>

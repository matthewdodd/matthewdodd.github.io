            . Chapter 4. Section 3. is made imprisonment for life, or at the pleasure of the King.</p>
               <p>Capt. Samuel Hall. We have a club of officers who meet at Mr. Walker's at the Griffin in York Buildings. On the 4th of March, about a eleven o'clock, Mr. Walker came up and said, Capt. Hall, there are some of the neighbours below stairs, who have informed me, there is a Romish Priest in the house. I said, Who is it? He said, his name is Morris. Said I, I know Morris, he is reputed to be a Romish Priest; said I, go down, and give my service to him, and tell him, it is not a proper time for him, who is a popish Priest, to be here, and to desire him to go about his business. He came and told me Mr. Morris returned me thanks; but said, it was more than I or any body else could prove. Mr. Morris then went away, but he was pursued and taken.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I desire to know whether that witness can prove that I said, he could not prove that I was a Popish Priest. I speak this to shew that I would not send such an abrupt message to any Gentleman.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prisoner. Can you prove that he is a Popish Priest?</p>
               <p>Council for the Crown. Yes, we can; and that he owned himself to be a Popish Priest.</p>

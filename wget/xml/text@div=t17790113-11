I said you have taken my rings off; she said, you dog; I take your rings off! I said, yes, d - n you, and if you don't give them me I will take you into custody immediately. The other woman asked what was the matter; she said the dog says I have taken his rings. The other woman said, d - n him, down with him! and they both fell upon me and knocked me down on my knee, and pulled my hat and wig off. I secured the prisoner, and charged a constable with her.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; the prosecutor brought the prisoner to the watch-house, and said, she had robbed him of two rings; I searched her, and found a ring upon her. She was putting something under her stays; I took hold of her, and shook her, and the ring dropped from under her clothes. She at that time escaped, and was not taken till very lately.</p>

               <p>Last Michaelmas was twelve-month I met a gentleman in Fleet-street, and he asked me to drink a glass of wine; I don't know whether it was the prosecutor. I went with him to the Sun Tavern; we drank together; he said he would make me a present of half a guinea to be agreeable; he put his hand in his pocket, and said, upon my word, my dear, I have no money about me, give me a direction where you live, and I will leave something in pledge with you till to-morrow; I will then call upon you at eleven o'clock. I gave him a direction to Gray's-Inn-lane, where I live, and he gave me the ring. We went away together till we came to a passage; we went up the passage, and then he said, as I have your direction, give me my ring again, and I will call to morrow and make you a present. I said, sir, you will excuse me. He said he must have the ring, he durst not go home without it. I told him as he had made use of me, I did not choose to deliver it; then he said he must have it, and charged the constable with me. I believe the prosecutor is the gentleman; he is very much like him; he had very weak eyes at that time.</p>

We took eight pair of stockings off the currant bushes; then we went round the coach-house, and saw a small muslin frock hanging upon the Bush, we took that; then we came back to the coach-house, and James opened the coach-house door.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he open it? - A. By lifting the latch.</p>

We went in and found a boat-cloak, I handed it down, and gave it to James; and when we came out of the coach-house, James gave it to Connor. Then we were coming away towards Mr. Wright's gardener's house; we were going into the house, when some man called out, holloa! he was inside the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he at the window? - A. No, I think he was bed. James answered, holloa! and then we made our escape.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was the gardener's house in the garden? - A. Yes, it joins the garden. When the man fung out, we jumped over the wall into the fields.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the cloak? - A. We carried it with us for about a mile across the fields; then we saw some linen hanging up in a yard, we were going into the yard, when there was a man at the window sung out; then we ran away, and

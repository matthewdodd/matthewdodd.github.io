I am the proprietor ef the Duke of York public-house, in Union-street—Foskett, the prosecutor, was in my employ as barman—I know the prisoner as frequenting my house—on Saturday, 25th January, about 11 o'clock, she came into the house and asked me to give her something to drink—we refused to serve her, because she is such a desperate character—I had forbidden her coming to my house—I threatened to turn her out—she said, "If you do, it shall be a b—bad job for you, for I have something for you in my pocket"—Foskett was then in the taproom about his business—I said I would turn her out if she was not quiet, as she interrupted my customers coming in with their jugs—is a minute or two after that she came and wished to speak to me quietly—I refused—she asked several times, but I refused—after that she went into the taproom, and in about two minutes Foskett came out stabbed—I said, "Foskett is stabbed"—the prisoner said, "Yes; I have done it, I meant to do it, but I meant this for you," and she threw a knife on to the counter she said, "When I came out I will do it for you then"—she was taken into custody, and Foskett was taken to the hospital.</p>

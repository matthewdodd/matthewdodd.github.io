One night in February I went down to Sadler's-wells, and saw the prisoner there; I had lived with her mother, when her husband was alive I was in his employ; the prisoner showed me these brooches and rings in her glove, in St. John-street-road; I asked where she got them - she said she had them given to her; I said she had better let me have them, and I got them, partly by force, from her - I took them home to my wife to take care of, while I made inquiry about them; I heard some account the next morning, and I sent word to my wife to give them up to the lady - I left the same brooches and rings with my wife that I got from the prisoner.</p>

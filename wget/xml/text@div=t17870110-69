               <p>Did you give it him, or did he snatch it out of your hand without your consent? - He snatched it without my consent.</p>
               <p>And he kept it I believe? - I believe he did.</p>
               <p>How much was the receipt for? - It was for two hundred and fifty pounds for a diamond ring.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner is the man? - Why he knows me; and I have seen him before in Hartshorn-street, Golden-lane, at an ale-house; I am sure he is the man; I had an hundred hand-bills printed; there was five guineas for taking, and five guineas on conviction.</p>
               <p>Did you describe his person? - Yes, in the papers; he was not taken till lately.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Now, old gentleman, you will consider this man's life is at stake, and do not treat it ludicrously; I think, first of all, upon some person's picking up a ring, you agreed to take half, and cheat the right owner? - I never mentioned the half at all.</p>
               <p>Did not you consent that it should not be advertised, and you would take half the money to keep it from the right owner? - No, I consented to have it advertised.</p>
               <p>That was the first proposal? - Aye, and the last too.</p>
               <p>Did not you go home to fetch money to purchase your part of the ring, now? - That is upon the account; because he said, I will give you an hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Then you consented to receive the hundred pounds as half the share of this ring, which you knew did not belong to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Nor to the man that made the proposal to you? - No.</p>
               <p>You state this to be above a year ago? - Yes, a year and four or five months.</p>
               <p>Then from last August was a twelvemonth, to pretty nearly this time, you never saw that man again, whoever he was, that brought the ring to you? - No, nor never till he was taken.</p>
               <p>That makes sixteen or seventeen months? - Yes.</p>
               <p>To read this writing and the receipt it was necessary you should put on your spectacles? - To be sure it was, my eye sight is not so quick to read small print; but I can see pretty well.</p>
               <p>I ask you, Sir, upon your oath, whether you have always been as sure of that man as you are now? - I have been.</p>
               <p>Who was the constable that took him up first? - Ward and Smith took the man together, and brought him to me; I saw him there.</p>
               <p>I ask you, upon your oath, Sir, whether you did not say, that was not the man that had done you the injury? - No, no such a word.</p>
               <p>Will you stick to that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178701100087"></xptr>When he was taken before the Magistrate did you swear positively to him then? - I did.</p>
               <p>Without hesitation as you have done now? - Yes, I swore to him then as I have done now.</p>
               <p>How many conversations have you had about this man with Smith before you went to the Magistrate? - Why he had my papers to take him whenever he found him.</p>
               <p>Has Smith never told you that it would be a good thing to swear to this man, that something would come of it? - I do not care for that at all; I have been acquainted with Smith a good many years.</p>
               <p>What office does he attend? - Oh, God Almighty knows.</p>

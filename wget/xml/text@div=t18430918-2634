I did so, and brought the 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and duplicate to her; she said she had not then got enough.

I was not to go to the bankers', as it is dated the 29th, and they would not pay it till it was due. I was taken into custody on the 29th, so I could not go. Immediately I was taken into custody I sent to her to justify me; they would not let me go; "they Brought word that she was out; the Magistrate, Mr. Coombe, sent a summons 'down to lock her up. Next day the landlord where she resided, in Great Ormond-street, came up, and said she did not sleep there that night, that she had left the two watches, and run away without paying her rent. I did not know the cheques were forged. I have received a good many cheques since I have been here. I was commissioned from various merchants in Paris, and had various kinds of cheques. I am the loser. I gave her the balance. I believe she and Henry Bush made it up between them to say that they had better give it to me, because they knew I was a foreigner, and easily deceived. I brought them their money directly. (<hi rend="italic">See the case of E. A. Taylor, page</hi> 873.)</p>

When I had cooked the dinner, I went into the bar, and laid the cloth, and I asked him to have a bit of dinner with us; accordingly he did: he asked me if I thought Mrs. Harrison could make him up a bed, as he had come down with a view of stopping there all night; I told him the house was very small, but I had no doubt but Mrs. Harrison would make him up a bed; he said he did not care where he laid, as he must lay there that night; with that, after the dinner was over, he stopped a good bit, and I went into the tap-room, and the young man sat down; I went out, and went across the way, and come back again, and the young man was gone; I do not know when he went, I never missed him; about half past three in the afternoon, a person came and called for some gin and water; I desired the girl to bring in a little warm water, which she did, and going to the till I missed the spoons; there was one table-spoon, two tea-spoons, and a pair of sugar-tongs missing.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you seen them before? - A. I saw them when I sat down to dinner; after I missed them I was very much frightened, and began to ask when the young man went out; finding him gone, and not paying for the pint of beer, and never saying he was going away, and knowing nobody had been in the bar but him and ourselves, I knew it must be him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the spoons ever found afterwards? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you saw them when you were at dinner? - A. I am positive they were there when I went to dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that nobody came in there afterwards? - A. Not any body before I missed them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know this man before? - A. Yes, I have seen him once or twice before, when they lived at Westminster.</p>

I was in the bar, and you and I went into the bar together, when we returned back from the opposite side of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. After conversing with each other, the girl said she was deficient by twopence halfpenny; you were at the till, why not miss the plate, you were in the bar after that? - A. You were in the bar after that; I did not know when you went away; you and I and the girl were in the bar together.</p>

            , when he went into the public-house, called the Harp, was rejoiced to hear that his old friend kept the public-house, whom he had lived with at the sign of the Mitre at Westminster, and as Mr. and Mrs. Harrison were not at home, his sister pressed him to dine with them in the bar; after that, the niece and sister went out to the opposite side of the way, where a pig was being killed, and after remaining conversing with Mrs. Harrison's sister some time, she told him Mr. Harrison was at Hampstead, and would be returning home; he told her he should make that in his way home, on purpose that he should meet him; when he returned back again with the sister, he found the girl had been treating with a man, and she asked for some change to pay the man; I then departed in expectation of meeting my friend, but did not recollect to pay for the pint of beer; I was sorry any thing should be said by Mrs. Harrison's sister of a man with whom he had had several peculiar transactions, and never had any mistake before; still I thought the value of a pint of beer would make no great deal of odds, as I would soon have gone and paid it; I went on to town, in hopes of seeing my employer, and between eight and nine o'clock, as I was returning, I was accosted by Mrs. Harrison; she said, what Troy, is that you; she called the watch; I said, you need not call the watch, I will go any where with you; she said, no, and called the watch, and he came, and she charged the watchman with me, and I was taken to St. Andrew's watch-house; he begs leave to observe, on his return from the opposite side of the way with Mrs. Harrison's sister, the bar was open, and laid open to every one that came in; but Mrs. Harrison's sister was at the till, and even if he had been so inclined, he could not have had an opportunity; and when he went to lodge with Mr. Harrison, he deposited one hundred and twenty-five pounds with him. He humbly implores that this honourable Court will grant him that mercy and humanity, which makes them so conspicuous.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Harrison.) Did Mrs. Harrison come to town after the prisoner? - A. When I came home, my wife's sister told her what had happened; she said to me, my dear, I must tell you I have been robbed; that man that went away from you at Westminster, has been here; with that my wife went to town on Saturday, and said, I will not leave town till I find him, or meet him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

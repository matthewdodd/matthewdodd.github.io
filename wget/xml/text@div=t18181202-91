            . I am servant to Mr. Murray, a pawnbroker. On the 19th of November the prosecutor pledged the things with me for 1 l. Next day, about twelve o'clock, the prisoner redeemed them. He said he redeemed them for his brother. The prosecutor came in the evening, I told him a soldier had redeemed them. The prisoner afterward came and pledged the hat again. He came to redeem it, and the prosecutor came in, who gave him in charge.</p>

               Murder, and upon the Coroner's Inquest for murdering her Female Bastard Child
            </rs>, on the 5th instant. The Evidence was her Mistress, a Midwife, who depos'd, That on the Dry aforesaid Nichols being up earlier than usual, she coming into the Kitchen, saw an Alteration in her face, and having a Suspicion, felt her Breasts, and told her she was sure she had been newly deliver'd of a Child; which the Prisoner immediately confess'd, and said the Child was in a Box in her Chamber, where it was found. The Child was at its full growth; but her Mistress, with another Midwife who was Evidence, gave some Reasons why in their Judgment the Child was stillborn; nor did there appear any Marks of Violence. The Prisoner said, When her Pains came upon her, she got out of Bed, but fell into a Swoon, and was not able to call for Help; and it appearing she had made some Provision for her Bying-in, the Jury <rs id="t17120111-9-verdict37" type="verdictDescription">

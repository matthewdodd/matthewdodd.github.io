            . As I was coming home on Sunday last, between twelve and one in the day, I heard an alarm. I rode up to a gentleman, and asked what was the matter; I was told a man had committed a robbery, and that he had crossed the road and took down a grass plat. I rode very hard in pursuit till I came to Bethnal-Green; there I saw a man on a slow run upon the Green. I galloped and overtook him. I asked him where he was going; he said, Not far. I put my horse round a post, and met him: I held the but end of my whip up to him, and desired him to stop till the man he had offended came up. Soon a man came up, and said there were others behind. I sent him back to hasten the person that had been robbed. The prosecutor soon came up, and, That is the person that robbed me. I will swear to him. Then a constable took charge of him. I left them, after I saw him searched in regard to arms, but none were found upon him as I saw.</p>

            . As I came up the field I heard somebody hollow Stop thief! I got upon a bank, and saw the prisoner coming as fast as he could. I made an attempt to stop him. He said, God bless you matter do not stop me, it is for a bastard childs this was as he was going over Bow-road. Just as I came to the corner of Bethnal-Green I lost him. Mr. Hodges came up immediately on horseback: said he, Which way is the man gone? I shewed him. He rode one way, and I ran another. He came up with the prisoner. I believe I was about three hundred yards off at the time. When I came up. I asked the prisoner what he had done. He said, he had done nothing that he knew of. I said, You certainly have, or you would not have ran so when the people hollowed Stop thief! Mr. Hodges wanted somebody to go and, fetch the man up that was robbed. I told him, If he would take care of the prisoner, I would go. The prosecutor, I found, had lost him, I found him, and brought him to the prisoner; he said, That was the man that robbed him, and gave the officer charge of him. I went up into the room with him. When he was searched. I saw half a guinea, 2 s. and 6 d. and three halfpence taken out of his left hand breeches pocket. He went across the room and flung himself down with his right hand in his pocket. The officer asked what he had there; he went and took out a knife. We asked him where he had that money? He said he received it the week before at Dartford, in Kent. Some time after he cried, and said it was the first thing of that sort that ever he did in his life.</p>

             I was at Bethnal-Green that day, about one o'clock. A young fellow came running, and said, Somebody must come and take a thief for robbing a person on the highway. I went, and there was Mr. Hodges standing with his horse's head before the prisoner. I asked what was the matter; he said that man had robbed a person in a lane. Said I, Where is the man that has been robbed? Presently the last evidence and the prosecutor came. The prosecutor said, That is the man that robbed me (meaning the prisoner.) Then I said, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176910180052"></xptr> will take charge of him. I took him into a public house and up stairs, and said, Let us see what you have about you. I searched him, and found 2 s. 6 d. and three halfpence, and a half guinea. (Produced in court.) I took also a knife from him. At first he said he took the money at Dartford, in Kent, the week before; and soon after he said it was the first fact that ever he did, and said he was very sorry for it now it was done. We took him before Justice Wilmot. He ordered us to take him to New Prison.</p>

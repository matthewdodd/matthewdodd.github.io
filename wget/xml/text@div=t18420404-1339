I have employed Starr to carry it down for the last two years—in consequence of suspicion I enter<lb></lb>tained before, I on this occasion mixed with my corn some pieces of pa<lb></lb>per, to enable me to identify it—on Tuesday, the 5th of April, ten sacks of corn were delivered to Starr, he was to take seven to Waltham-cross, and leave three at Wade's-mill—I have since seen some corn found by the police<lb></lb>man—it is a portion of what was in the seven sacks for Waltham-cross—I had torn the pieces of paper and put them in myself—I had observed my horses were thinner than they ought to be, and was obliged to have extra horses to do the work.</p>

In consequence of informa<lb></lb>tion I received, I stationed myself near Mr. Dyson's stable, at Waltham-cross on Wednesday, the 6th of April, and between seven and eight o'clock in the morning I saw Starr draw his cart into Mr. Dyson's stable, were Mr. Mountain's horses stand—he got into the cart, and gave Hall out two full sacks, which he took into the stable—he then gave him out a</p>

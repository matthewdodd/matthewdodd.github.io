                  </hi>. I was barmaid at the Red Lion public-house, Covent-garden—the prisoner had been courting me for some years prior to this transaction—the courtship ceased three weeks before this occurred; I broke it off—on the evening of 12th October I was in company with the witness White, coming towards my home—when within a short distance of it, I saw the prisoner—he came up to me, and said he wanted to speak to me—he said, "Have you been to my cousin's?"—I said no—he then said, "You must go now"—I said, "I will not go"—he said, "You will"—I said, "I won't"—with that he pulled a razor out of his pocket and shewed it to me—I said, "Miss White, for God's sake fetch your uncle"—while she ran to fetch her uncle, Mr. Loder, the prisoner took hold of me and dragged me across the road and threw me down, and then taking the razor out of his pocket, he commenced cutting me across my face, and said he would do for me—I said nothing to him, but I tried to hit him with my umbrella when he threw me—before he commenced cutting me, I said, "For God's sake, <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>, don't kill me, for the sake of my poor mother"—I was taken to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Red Lion public-house, Covent-garden—I recollect going towards home on the evening of 12th October with the last witness—when we were near home I saw the prisoner, he came up to the prosecutrix and caught hold of her, and said, "I want to speak to you"—he tried to pull her away from me, and he asked her if she had been to his cousin's—she said No—he said, "You shall go with me now"—she said "I</p>

               <p>will not"—he caught hold of her again, and then he drew what looked to me like a sharp-bladed knife from his pocket and said, "If you don't go with me I will cut my throat"—he then put it back in his pocket again, and caught hold of her again, and tried to drag her away. She said, "You will let me go in first, and I will go" (meaning to his cousins)—he said, "You shall not go in"—he pulled the knife, as I thought, out of his pocket again, and put it back a second time—he then caught bold of her, and pulled her away from me, from the Bedford Hotel up to the corner of the piazza—where he first spoke to her was just opposite the Bedford Hotel, about a stone's throw from the Red Lion—we were coming from St. Martin's-lane, towards Russell-street—he dragged her about two or three yards—he did not appear to be at all excited, not when he first spoke to her, or afterwards; he seemed very cool indeed—I ran for assistance, and did not see what happened after<lb></lb>wards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barman at the Red Lion public-house—I recollect Miss White running into the Bed Lion on the night in question—from what she said to me, I ran up to the piazza—I saw the prisoner knock Miss Jennings down—when I got to him be had got his left arm round her neck, and the razor in his right hand—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he was sawing at her throat—I knocked him on the muscle of the right arm, in which he held the razor, and knocked the razor out of his hand—he got up, and looked at me in the face, and said, "D—n and blast you"—I afterwards picked the razor up, and took it to Bow-street.</p>

Jennings lying down, and the prisoner apparently, to me, trying to strangle her—I could not say exactly what he was doing—she was lying down, and ho was at her head in a stooping attitude, as he might be on his knees—I took him by the back of the collar and pulled him up in an instant—I saw this razor lying at his feet to his left—I handed him over in a second or so to Sergeant Rogers—I saw a pool of blood near where the razor was, apparently from Miss Jennings's throat—I had known the prisoner for about a month before this, by seeing him there smoking his pipe and having a glass in the Red Lion, and at different times I have seen him talking to Miss Jennings as I passed there.</p>

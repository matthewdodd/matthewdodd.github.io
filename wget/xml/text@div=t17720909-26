(producing the forged draught) I paid it myself; I asked his name; he said it was Berg; I asked him who he received it for; he said for Mr. Westport or Westforth; I put it down thus, for Westport per Berg; I paid it in bank-notes, two single hundreds, two thirties, and one twenty pounds, and the rest in money; I entered the bank-notes immediately.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know whether that account has been settled between Sir Robert and Mr Alexander?</p>
               <p>Murphey. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alexander. This is my cash-book, in which the account is kept between the banker and me ( producing it); I generally send it to be settled about once in two months.</p>
               <p>Q. to Murphey. How long was it after the payment, before Mr. Alexander left his book to be settled?</p>
               <p>Murphey. I believe he left his book about the 25th of July, it might lie two or three days before delivered back again; it was returned back on the 27th of July.</p>
               <p>Q Had you at that time charged Mr. Alexander with this 300 l. as paid for his use?</p>
               <p>Murphey. Yes; when we settled the book, we delivered up the vouchers in the pocket of the book; this draught was with the others; on the 27th of July, an hour or two after Mr. Alexander had received his book, he brought it back; he did not recollect that he had drawn such a draught, upon inspection it appeared to be a forgery. (The draught read.) We distinguished a cross upon the name, Alexander, had been erased, we perceived that the 1 of 1771, had been altered to a 2, to make it 1772.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember ever after this seeing the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Murphey. Yes; he came to our shop with Mr. Alexander's son; on the 29th of July, in the evening, between four and five o'clock; I sent over to the Bank to know if Mr. Larchen, the cashier, was there, in order that he might see him, I had been informed that one of the banknotes of 30 l. had been paid at the Bank on the 27th; Mr. Larchen was not at the Bank, an appointment was made for this prisoner to come next day at twelve o'clock; he promised to come, but did not; about a week after we heard he was going down to Gloucester by Mr. Alexander's son; we had notice, on the 10th of August, of the other 30 l. note, having been paid at the Bank; we were informed that he had negotiated this bill at Gloucester; I went down on the 10th of August at night to Gloucester, and we took the prisoner into custody on the 13th; he was taken in the house of Mr. Chamberlayne, at Colthorpe, within four miles<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177209090037"></xptr> of Gloucester, the constable called me in as soon as he was taken. I asked him if he knew Mr. Alexander; he stammered or hesitated a good deal, and said he did not; I repeated the name several times; I then said you certainly must know Mr. Alexander, you have been a clerk there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told him the occasion for which he was taken up by the officer before that?</p>
               <p>Murphey. No; he then said he had been clerk, and knew Mr. Alexander; I then asked him if he recollected having any bank-notes in his custody lately; he said he did not; I then asked him if he recollected his having changed one with Mr. Everett of Gloucester; he made no reply.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he appear when you asked him that question?</p>
               <p>Murphey. He turned aside and made no reply; I said, you promised to come to Sir

               <p>Q. Upon this discovery, and after Rogers was taken in custody, what has been done since? where did the loss fall?</p>
               <p>Murphey. Upon Sir Robert, and Co. we have replaced the money to Mr. Alexander, and Sir Robert and Co. have charged themselves with the loss; the entry is in our cash book, that is the same book wherein he had been made debtor. (reads)</p>
               <p>"J. Alexander, his draught paid a second time, 300 l. that is, creditor; in Mr. Alexander's book, it is passed to his credit, his draught paid a second time, and placed to his credit." It was placed to his credit the 19th of August.</p>
               <p>Q. Has there been a balance struck since that?</p>
               <p>Murphey. Yes; the book was balanced, and his account settled; he is totally discharged from that payment; the book is looked upon as a receipt.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said, Mr. Alexander has kept cash since the 16th of April 1771, at your house, has he not often draughts for payment?</p>
               <p>Murphey. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever recollect to have seen the prisoner at your house?</p>
               <p>Murphey. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor you cannot say that draught was paid to him of 300 l.?</p>
               <p>Murphey. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him when you went down to Gloucester who you was?</p>
               <p>Murphey. No; I believe he recollected me; I fancy so.</p>
               <p>Q. When you asked him, do you know a Mr. Alexander, then not knowing who you was, do you think he might not have imagined it a Mr. Alexander in that part of the world?</p>
               <p>Murphey. I cannot tell; I thought it unnecessary to say Alexander of Grocer's Hall.</p>
               <p>Q. You said he seemed to turn aside when you mentioned charging the note with Mr. Everett, might not that be by the common manner of turning himself?</p>
               <p>Murphey. He appeared to be a good deal confused and made no reply.</p>
               <p>Q. It did not seem a confusion arising from guilt?</p>
               <p>Murphey. I imagine it was from guilt.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Prisoner. As you frequently paid several considerable sums for Mr. Alexander to me by the name of Rogers, how came you to pay it to me then as by the name of Berg?</p>
               <p>Murphey. I do not recollect to have seen him till the 27th.</p>

I took him into my service, January 1769; he continued with me to about the middle of July 1771; I gave him a guinea a week.</p>

It is always my custom to put the draught in a drawer among other loose papers, which all my servants know of; it was put amongst waste paper, clerks or servants might take them as they thought proper when they wanted waste paper; in July last, about the 27th, I had left my book to be settled; I called for it a few days afterwards,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177209090038"></xptr> and had my book with the vouchers returned; seeing that draught returned, I was surprized.

Upon inspecting it, the figure seemed to be altered; Mr. Porkor was of that opinion.

               <p>Alexander. Here is a difference in the s in Westport; he seldom made a long s, which that is; he wrote an indifferent hand: the writing upon that bank-note, Geo. is like the handwriting of the prisoner, and the first part of the sirname, West.; I do believe it to be his handwriting.

                  </hi>. I am captain of the <hi rend="italic">Fame</hi>, a merchant vessel, which was in the Thames. On the 18th of October I was in Ratcliff-highway about two o'clock in the morning, and fell in with the prisoner—I was a little tipsy, and did not know exactly what happened—I wanted to go to bed, and went home to the house where the prisoner lived—I do not know where it was—I gave the lady of the house a shilling, and went up stairs with the prisoner—I then had eight sovereigns, three half-crowns, and nine shillings and sixpence in a purse—I think I was in the room about half an hour—I fell down on the bed as soon as I got into the room, and went to sleep—I was to have staid there all night—I had put my purse into my trowsers' pocket—when I awoke, my purse was gone, and so was the prisoner—she had gone out of the room while I was asleep—I acquainted the police—they took the prisoner, and my purse was found on her—it then contained one sovereign and 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the rest of the money is lost—this is my purse—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>.)</p>

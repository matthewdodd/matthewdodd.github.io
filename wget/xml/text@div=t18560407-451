               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185604070039"></xptr>
               <p>and the prisoner took the money to the bank—this 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the cash book on 9th Feb. is in the prisoner's writing—I do not, of my own know<lb></lb>ledge, know how much of that was paid into the bank—on 14th Feb. here is 39<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. paid—on 20th Feb. the amount made up is 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—that is the day that he left—he brought me a packet of money that even<lb></lb>ing, the envelope of which was either lost or destroyed—I did not think it of any consequence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Are you an assistant to your mother? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the bills are not all made out in my name—the bill heads are "Kenneth" only—they are receipted "Jas. Kenneth," when received by me, and are in your name when you received them—I do not know that I instructed you to put "Jeremiah Bees pro J. Kenneth"—you were John Bees with me, and not Jeremiah—I dare say you did put "J. Rees"—my mother and myself used to tell you to take money to the bank—the first thing you had to do was to put the money down—I was not always in the counting house, I was sometimes in the shop and sometimes in the street—I did not open the packets, to see what amounts they contained—the bank pass book should tally with the cash book, but it does not—I entered the amounts in a private book of my own—I have not got that book here—I did not always ask you for the pass book when you returned, to compare it with my own—I was very careless about it, and that was the cause of your robbing us—you used to deliver the pass book to me when the shop was full of cus<lb></lb>tomers—I used not, when you said that the pass book was at the bank, to say that I was very glad of it; not even when my uncle (my father's brother) wished to examine the accounts, but he was always grumbling at the amount of petty cash which was paid out—I frequently borrowed money from the till, and put tickets in for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you let it run over several days? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays—money would have to be taken to the bank on Thursdays, and any amount I had exchanged was made up of cash from the bowl, and the cheques put into the bowl—I cannot say whether any part of this 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. entered in the cash book consisted of cheques, but if it did, it was the prisoner's duty to put the cheques in the bowl, and draw money from the bowl to supply them—there was on each occasion three sums in hard money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you ever know me to steal anything? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I knew you to steal paper—the money sometimes went to the bank at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, we generally waited till there was money enough in the bowl to supply the tickets—this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced by the prisoner</hi>) is in my writing—I am aware that on Jan. 15th and 19th, a less sum went to the bank than appeared—I did not swear before the Magistrate that that was not the case, certainly not—(<hi rend="italic">The witness a deposition being read, stated</hi>: "I did not take any of the 64<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. at least no large amount; the memo<lb></lb>randum produced is my writing")—I was so confused, but I acknowledge now that I took the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. stated in that paper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When the cash did not go to the bank at the time it was handed to me, you not having sufficient money in the till, or in your own pocket, did you not invariably request me to tell your mother that the cash had gone to the bank? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I do not remember having the cash in my desk two or three days at a time before it went to the bank—I have no papers of yours, you took them all, and some of mine into the bargain—I never told you that if Mr. Robert Kenneth asked me for the bank book to say that it was the bankers'—I did frequently express anxiety to you lest my uncle</p>

               <p>should break into the packets and see the tickets, because he objected to it being carried on in that way—there was not a single ticket that I know of on 20th Feb.—I pretty generally knew the amount; I paid all the tickets off at the end of Jan.—I paid about 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I threw the money into the bowl—I did not have the tickets given up to me before—I have not charged you since you left with having robbed me of about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I have said 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I have not said 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have said that I am very sorry that I took you, that was because you ruined me and my mother—my income is 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and my mother makes it up to 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she gets the money by saving it out of her housekeeping—I confess that in my ignorance of the law, I did go to your friends and endeavour to get 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. not to appear against you—I was very much distressed, and thought if I could get a little money out of the fire it would be better—I told your friends that if they could make up the money, I would not prosecute—I visited you in the House of Deten<lb></lb>tion; that was because when you lost your presence of mind when you were taken to the station, you would not give the place where you lodged last night, and I thought you had some money secreted somewhere which we might recover—the inspector told me that I had no right to question you—I asked you at the House of Detention, where the money was, and you said that you had been travelling all over England and Ireland, and that money fire in travelling—I said that the loss of the money was very serious, and appre<lb></lb>hending and offering a reward for you, was so much out of the business, that if your friends could make up the money I would rather not prosecute you—I received this letter, which is in your writing—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "Feb. 21, 1856. Mr. J. Kenneth; New Bond-street: Dear Sir. Long ere you receive this I shall be on my way to a distant land. Whatever my extraordinary conduct may have been, be charitable; you may rely on receiving every penny re<lb></lb>turned in a very short time, but I involved myself through the very errone<lb></lb>ous manner your business was carried on. I consequently risked some money to regain my position, but failed; now you know the consequence. A friend has promised to pay you at his earliest opportunity, until which I cannot but be a self-expatriated prisoner from my native land, and may fortune smile on you more highly than it has upon the poor miserable wretch, your late clerk. For your own interest, I beseech you not to make bad worse; for on the quiet you observe, you will be repaid the sooner, for if you shot other feelings there will be no inducement for my friend to procure my speedy return to home and happiness. Your most unfortunate, J. Beat P. S. Another letter shall follow this with more information of a different character.")</p>

I took the prisoner on 15th March, it the Seymour Arms, Seymour-street, Euston-square—I found on him a purse, containing three sovereigns, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 3 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, some tobacco, and a knife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I entered into the service of Mr. Kenneth; I never knew that Mrs. Kenneth was the proprietor of the business, only by name; it was principally conducted by Mr. Robert Kenneth, he overlooked the books, and so on; a fishmonger's business is one of the most complicated that I know of, but Mr. Kenneth used to sit there receiving money and reading a French novel, or Italian spelling book; he used to apply to me for the loan of money from the takings of the day, and gave me tickets for it, so that when the cash went to the bank the right amount could not go, and I used to open the packets to see whether the amounts tallied, and found that they did not; the tickets represented cash, but how was I to get them con<lb></lb>verted into cash; we never spent any money till the afternoon, and some<lb></lb>times we took none at all, as it is entirely a credit trade, except, per<lb></lb>haps 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—he has said, "There is such and such a bill coming doe, and the cash must go, whether correct or not," and if he produces the books from the commencement, it will be seen very clearly that there were fre<lb></lb>quent and numerous deficiencies; when there was no cash to supply the tickets, he said, "Mr. Reece, I wish you could borrow 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from some of your friends, and then we will send the cash to the bank;" I used to do that sometimes, but sometimes I could not, and then the cash would go minus; I had particular instructions never to read the bank book without his leave; he always used to look at it when I brought it back, to see that it was correct; there were various mistakes in the cash book, over which 1 had no control; was it fair that he should take cash from the till whenever he thought proper, and then I was to go and make it correct? I frequently found even 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. deficient in the bowl, and used to lament it invari<lb></lb>ably to him; I have been seriously out of pocket by it; he hopes to lodge upon my back the whole of these defalcations, to get himself out of the serape; he spent his nights out, and tried to get me to go to casinos with him, and to introduce me to women; and how he could, out of 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year support women, and go out till 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning, I do not know; the foreman is a man of similar character, keeping two or three</p>

               <p>women, and they go out together; this paper which I have produced was brought to me by my wife, who discovered it among some waste paper; I recollect it coming well, and Mr. J. Kenneth gave it to me, and said, "You hear what uncle says?" I made up the tickets in the usual way, but there were so many tickets that I said, "Perhaps in the afternoon we can send the cash to the bank;" I was in a mist about my position, and had to pay 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. defalcations, which were not mine, and I wrote him a note, say<lb></lb>ing that I was very unwell, and could not come to business, and very much doubted whether I could return again; and on the following day I wrote him a notice to quit, and borrowed all the money I could and went into the country; my wife has been working hard to borrow money for Mr. John Kenneth, and we have only had 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. back; I wished to leave an impression that I was gone to America; instead of my appropri<lb></lb>ating money, the business is considerably indebted to me; there is not single thing in the house that Mr. Kenneth has not pledged unknown to his mother; I am a young man, and have been ruined by these pro<lb></lb>ceedings.</p>

The prisoner had once been in my employ - he called for a job about December, but there was nothing for him, and he went away; about a week after he was gone I missed this pick-axe - I had not seen it safe for about a week before; it might have been taken before, but on the 24th of January my shed was broken open in the night - I went to look for the tools, and found the pick-axe at Weaver's shop.</p>

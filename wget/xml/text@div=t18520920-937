I am a linendraper, at 103, Bishopsgate-street; about 23rd June, I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it purports to be signed by the prisoner, and states that his son is going to Australia, and is in want of goods, 100 yards flannel, 338 yards linen, 150 pairs of stockings, and a variety of articles, amounting to 58<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in consequence of that I went to West Ham next morning, and saw the prisoner—I told him I had come down in consc<lb></lb>quence</p>

               <p>of receiving the order, and the transaction of course would be for ready money—he said it would be the same as ready money, and entered into the nature of his arrangements with the Board of Ordnance—he said he should want the things shipped on 1st or 2nd of July—he said he was contractor of the supply of gun sponges for the artillery at Woolwich, to a large amount, and that he had to receive 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the Board of Ordnance on 7th of July, or soon after that day, the 7th was the day they began paying, and he showed me the sponges—I agreed to let him have the goods on that representation, the credit being only for so short a time—I supplied goods amounting to 58<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 22nd July I received this letter, which is signed by the prisoner (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Pall Mall, Thursday morning. Dear Sir,—I have just called at the office, and find that I shall not be paid until the 28th, and as I am now on my way for Plymouth, with my son, I will call and settle your account on that or the following day, but I expect to be paid sufficiently early to pay you on that day, positively. I remain, Dear Sir, yours respectfully, William Ingram")—the 28th passed over and I did not see him, and on 29th I went down to West Ham and saw him, and he made an appointment to go with me that afternoon, at half past 2 o'clock, to the Board of Ordnance, to receive the money then and there—I was to receive it myself from the Board—he was to call on me, and I was to go with him—he said he had an order for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more, to execute for the Board of Ordnance, and went to look for his pocket book to show me, but did not find it—I remained at home and was ready to go with him, but he never came—on 30th July I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is in the prisoner's writing—(<hi rend="italic">read, directed</hi>, "A. Lloyd, Esq., Milk-street, Cheapside, West Ham, July 30th 1852. Sir,—Are you the <hi rend="italic">gent</hi> that came down to my house with Mr. Hall? if so, I will not treat with you under any circumstances; but, if on the contrary, I will wait on you at your office, on Tuesday, about 2 o'clock the 2nd of Aug. Please to send me word. Mr. Hall would have been paid yesterday if he had not have brought a lawyer to <hi rend="italic">bulley</hi> me, and make me out a <hi rend="italic">Roge</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">cald</hi> me a swindler, and he may thank is <hi rend="italic">lucy stars</hi> that I did not bundle <hi rend="italic">im</hi> down the steps; if he <hi rend="italic">Ever Comes</hi> into my house again with the cause that he came the other day, I will <hi rend="italic">Brake</hi> is neck down the steps, or he shall <hi rend="italic">Mine</hi>; or, so I would have im beware, I am neither <hi rend="italic">roge</hi>, swindler or <hi rend="italic">theef</hi>, and so I will let <hi rend="italic">im no</hi> if ever he <hi rend="italic">coms</hi> into my house again. I am Yours, W. Ingram senior.") At the interview there was no <hi rend="italic">bullying</hi> by Mr. Lloyd, nothing of the kind—the prisoner admitted having received the goods—on 2nd July he said he had received them, and was very much pleased with them—he said he might not get his money on 7th, as the Board commenced paying on that day, and paid alphabetically—they sometimes began at <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> and sometimes began at <hi rend="italic">Z</hi>; but, he was sure to be paid by the 12th, his name being in the middle.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Are you going to say you trusted me with these goods on the faith of my being a contractor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the first thing you stated to me was, that you were a sponge maker—I did not entrust you with the goods on your references—I am not aware that you gave me thirteen references—I did not after that come and say I was perfectly satisfied, and invite you and your wife to come and make the order three times as much—you only gave me four references—I do not believe I ever saw you before I went down to West Ham—I had an interest in a business at Cheshunt, and there was a person of your name there; I do not know whether you are the person—you may have been a customer there, but I had nothing to do with the business myself, and it has been closed many years—I would not have trusted you one</p>

               <p>penny in consequence of anything arising from the Cheshunt connection—Mr. Lloyd did not say you were a swindler and scoundrel, and bow could you rob an bonest man and his family; nor did you say I should be paid in seven days, and lay three sovereigns on the table—Mr. Lloyd did not then tell me to take them up, nor did I do so, nothing of the sort—Mr. Lloyd said there was a judgment out against you, and you got in a great rage, and offered to bet Mr. Lloyd 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. there was no judgment, and bet two sovereigns, and I thought two sovereigns from 58<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was better than nothing at all, and I took them, and I saw a third in your hand.</p>

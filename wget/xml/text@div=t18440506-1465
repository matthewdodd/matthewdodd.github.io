                  </hi>. I am in partnership with two other persons; we are silk manufacturers, and live in Fort-street, Spitalfields. The prisoner was our workman—on the 19th of April he brought home a piece of velvet—I com<lb></lb>plained to him that it was not cleaned—on the 22nd he called again for some fresh work—I said I was not certain whether we should give him more, as his last piece did not give satisfaction—he said, if I liked he would take it, and try to improve it, and afterwards he said he could get the assistance of a man named Bagley, who had worked for us previously, and was a skilful work-man—I trusted the prisoner with the velvet on the Monday, which was worth about 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he ought to have brought it home the next day—I have never seen it since—it was in a saleable state.</p>

I am foreman to Thomas Robinson and others—I asked the prisoner, when he was taken, what he had done with the piece of velvet—he said, "What piece?"—I said, "You make yourself ridiculous in asking that question"—he said no more then, but afterwards said the conduct of his master was vexatious, and enough to drive a man to desperation.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> On the Friday I took home the piece, and Mr. Ro<lb></lb>binson found fault; I said it was the fault of the dye; he would not pay me; I went on the Saturday, and was in and out six times before he would speak to me, and at last he said to Mr. Perrins, "Pay him, and we will see about it on Monday." On the Monday he said, "Take this to Bagley, and if you don't get it done, I will make you pay for it." I did not like to let Mr. Bagley know that I was found fault with, as it would be injurious to him and me; I thought I would take it to another man; he said he would take me to a man who would do it for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; we had some gin; I got drunk, and fell asleep, and lost the property; I got the money found on me from a person I had worked for in Spital-square; Mr. Robinson is receiving 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from each hand for the loss he has sustained; the hands are compelled to sign a book to that effect, or else they will not be employed by him.</p>

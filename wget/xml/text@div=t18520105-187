                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and live in Salmon-lane, Limehouse; I knew the prisoner. On 29th Dec. he came to my place, and agreed to purchase a coffee-roaster of me for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he would either pay for it in goods or I could have the money—I said, "Well, as you profess to roast coffee so much higher, and turn it out so much better than any one else, you shall roast it out, and I will send you the roaster to-morrow morning, and some coffee"—the next morning I sent him 51lbs. of coffee in a bag, with the coffee-roaster, by my son James, in a truck—shortly after I followed the truck, having to go into the City, and found it at the prisoner's door—I saw the prisoner take a portion of the coffee, about half the coffee is my bag, put it into the cylinder, and commence roasting it—I stead till that first portion was roasted—I saw it taken out and put into a cooler—by that time my lad had come back from taking the took home—I saw the prisoner put the other portion of my coffee into the cylinder, and saw the lad commence roasting it—I saw the portion that had been roasted put into the bag—during the time it was cooling, the prisoner was standing against the cooler, and he said it was a good coffee, a splendid coffee; Rudelhorf could not turn out such a coffee (he is another roaster)—it was said, "This is rather a pale roast"—the prisoner said, "Yes, but perhaps the other might not be the same"—he said, "I will manage that for you by tying a string in the middle of the bag"—that would separate the first portion that was roasted from the second portion—as soon as I had seen the second portion put in I said, "I atn rather tied to time; I must be in the City at a certain time"—the pri<lb></lb>soner said, "It is all right; your lad will be here"—I left my son for fear of something being intended, by what the prisoner himself had told me before; he had told me that when the coffee was out in the cooler it would be</p>

                  </hi>. My husband is a commercial traveller; I live at the prisoner's house, No. 6, Stepney-causeway, with my husband. On the 30th of Dec. I was going from the front parlour to the passage—I met Mr. Gatenby in the passage, and the little boy with a sack on his shoulder—I think this is the same boy (<hi rend="italic">looking at James Lengthy, jun.</hi>) but I could not swear it—they were coming from the yard—I heard Mr. Gatenby ask the little boy if he would have a bit of plum-pudding—he said, no he had plenty at home—and Mrs. Gatenby said, "As many plum-puddings as you taste so many happy months you will have in the year"—I was in the yard I should think about two or three minutes—as I came back, Mr. Gatenby was letting the little boy out at the street door—I am quite sure the boy did not return after he had the pudding, if he had he must have passed me—I think the yard is as long as from here to the further window.</p>

               <p>a perfumer in the City—I was scarcely three minutes absent—I merely went to throw some water out in the yard—I should say the boy left about half-past one o'clock—all I went for was to throw some water from a basin into the sink, which is about as far as from me to the bench—I never talked to the little boy (<hi rend="italic">Gatenby</hi>) about this—I told him this morning to mind and speak the truth—both his mother and I asked him on the Friday, the day his father was taken—there has never been any conversation between me and the boy from the time of this transaction, except when we asked him on the night the prisoner was taken whether he recollected anything about it—I do not remem<lb></lb>ber the words his mother asked him—I remember she said the little boy was in the yard turning the roaster—that was said in his presence—the boy Gatenby said he was in the yard, and he said he knew the boy would not return after he had the pudding, for he thought it was talked about—that was before the con<lb></lb>versation with the boy that I have been speaking of—I believe the boy was present—it was all in one room—the child was asked on the Friday if he knew about a little boy having any pudding, he said no he did not—the little boy never returned to the yard after he had the pudding—the boy said at the police court, that Mr. Gatenby brought his own little boy a piece of pudding, and then dragged him in to have some, and he said, "What a story"—I will swear that I have not had any conversation with this child in par<lb></lb>ticular—it has been talked about in his presence—his mother has talked about it—I have not heard her speak to the boy—I have lived in the house since March—I have never said that I was related to these persons.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WOOLLETT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you quite sure that when you went into the yard, you saw the boy with the sack, and heard the conversation about the pudding? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, as I came out of my room—at that time the sack was on the boy's shoulder—I ran up against the boy—the passage is rather dark—the little boy was examined before the Magistrate—these conversations were before he was examined—he was asked if he remembered the little boy being in the yard, and he told his mother the same story he has to-day.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 1, Fox's-lane, Ratcliffe-highway. My husband is steward of a ship—I was at Mrs. Sicklemore's on 30th Dec., dress-making for her—I was at work in the front parlour—I heard some conversation between Mr. Gatenby and the boy—I should say it was between 1 and 2 o'clock—I heard Mr. Gatenby ask the boy if he would have some plum-pudding—the boy's reply was, "I have got some at home"—from two minutes and a half to three minutes after that conversation, I heard the street door go—I cannot say whether the boy ever returned into the yard after that conversation: I could not see.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coffee-dealer. I saw some damaged coffee in the prisoner's possession—this sample (<hi rend="italic">the sample produced from the prisoner's house</hi>) corresponds with the coffee shown me at his house; I believe it to be a portion of the same coffee—this other sample is quite different from the other.</p>

I do not recollect, on 30th Dec, receiving any coffee from the prisoner—he has been roasting for me ever since he has been in business—I never sent any coffee to him, and received a different sample back—I do not know any particular day that I received coffee from him—I have sent coffee to him, and received the same back—I have known him ten years—his character has been upright, honest, and industrious—I have had hundreds of pound's worth of property pass through his hands.</p>

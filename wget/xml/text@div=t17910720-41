               <p>The indictment opened by Mr. Garrow, and the Case by Mr. Fielding, as follows:</p>
               <p>May it please your Lordship: Gentlemen of the Jury; the charge which is now brought forward against the prisoner at the bar, my learned friend has stated to you to be that of having obstructed an <rs id="t17910720-41-viclabel233" type="occupation">excise officer</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17910720-41-victim467 t17910720-41-viclabel233"></join> in the execution of his duty. When I look at Gentlemen of your appearance, I am convinced it cannot be necessary to enlarge on the necessity there is of executing those laws which are made for the preservation of those people concerned in the collection of the revenue: indeed, at this time of day, wherever we turn our eyes, and attend to that information we receive daily, we have great reason to be content with the happy constitution and government of this country, and with the administration of its laws, as that administration takes place in this country; but, Gentlemen, there could be no support of the constitution, there could be no support of the government, if, after the establishment of taxes, which we all know are necessary to be imposed, when those taxes are imposed, there must be people employed to collect them, and that those officers require protection. It is unnecessary for me to enlarge on this; you will at once feel it: Gentlemen, no prosecutions of this sort, and indeed no prosecutions instituted by any of the public boards, ever can come before a jury without the approbation of the crown officer; the Attorney-General is immediately consulted; he judges of the propriety of submitting that complaint before a jury, before any such complaint can be submitted; and I believe I may say it is known to the learned Judge, and many others, that there has not been any one person ever prosecuted by him, but on the strictest necessity, and even then with the utmost lenity. The conduct he would have prescribed to himself I shall endeavour<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179107200058"></xptr>to follow, it devolving upon me to discharge his duty; and at present I think it my duty especially to follow that plan, not at all to inflame your minds on any accusation that shall come before you, but rather to require you deliberately to examine the evidence, and if upon that evidence there should be any doubt, he will be best satisfied, the public will be best satisfied, and you will be best satisfied, in giving a prisoner at that time the advantage of that doubt. In the present instance, the witnesses you have to hear will not be many: the state of the case is this; on the 17th of April, 1790,

            , being on his duty, and surveying some of the people in his neighbourhood, he observed the prisoner at the bar, in company with three others, all on horseback, and their horses loaded with tubs, as they call them; they are the little tubs in which they smuggle brandy; one of the parties were leading horses, and these horses were loaded with tubs; Andrews, as his duty was, went to the foremost man, and attempted to take hold of that foremost horse; when the prisoner, and two other persons not in custody, came towards him, and made use of the most opprobrious language; not contented with that, they immediately struck him with a large weapon, and which might by possibility have subjected them to a higher indictment: they then meditated more severe usage to him; but, recovering immediately from his blow, he crept through a hedge, and endeavoured to make his escape through a garden; the prisoner and another, on horseback, leaped the hedge, and pursued him; there was a little cottage near there, into which Mr. Andrews luckily escaped; if not, probably it was, from the pursuit that was made by those men, that they would have gone on to some greater violence that might have hazarded this man's life: therefore, gentlemen, you see it is for this offence, which as soon as communicated to the commissioners, which was the duty of Andrews to do, they put it into a state of inquiry: Andrews was examined; the nature of his character, and the usage he had received, called for a public inquiry, it called for public punishment; the evidence therefore can only be, as to the main fact, from Andrews himself: now, gentlemen, it happens with us in this country, that as we are satisfied with the testimony of one man, so it frequently will happen, that that testimony, if aided by the corroborating testimony of three or four others, is sufficiently convincing; and if the evidence you shall receive from one man, namely, Andrews, when aided by the conduct of the man himself, his demeanour and behaviour; and if that man, so standing before you, and so demeaning himself, appears to deserve your credit, you will give the same credit to one as you would give to the testimony of four; particularly when there can be but one witness, you will think it your duty to attend to those circumstances from whence your opinion of him is to be founded; and it is my desire, that if, from any thing about the man, you see there is any thing suspicious, or doubt that his story is not founded in truth, of course you will immediately discharge your duty by rejecting such testimony altogether: on the contrary, if his behaviour be such as to demand your credit properly, you will be as much satisfied with that evidence coming from a single witness, as if from more: but on the present occasion there will be a corroboration of the testimony of Andrews, namely, the testimony of a woman to whose house he luckily escaped, and who was witness of his treatment; she will tell you the situation of this Cooper being with his people, but she will not affect at all to identify the persons of these prisoners.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, this offence was committed in Sussex, but it is tried here; it so happens that, from the operation of a very beneficial act of parliament, and which was found to be essentially necessary in the revenue laws, that many offences committed and prosecuted in those counties where smuggling was carried on, it was found over and over again, that prosecutions instituted, properly supported by the most indubitable testimony, yet there was unaccountable partiality, and conviction was almost impossible;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179107200059"></xptr>therefore it was that the legislature thought fit, on proper inquiry, that the proper officers should have it in their power to bring the trial on in another county; no man will be dissatisfied, when they consider all these prosecutions are generally brought in this Court, where I may say, without any flattery to you, gentlemen, I always see the most respectable jury that this country can afford, so far that prisoners have the benefit of it: there is a little inconvenience now and then attending persons being brought up from far counties to make their defence here, as they cannot so readily come at their witnesses that may be necessary for their defence; it is far to bring them; and therefore, in cases where there may by possibility be evidence that would resist the accusation, I do acknowledge that observation should have its full weight with the jury; but in the present case, according to the circumstances I am stating to you, it is impossible, in the nature of things, if you believe Andrews, that there could be any witness on the present occasion that would not be equally offenders with the prisoner; therefore, on the present occasion, that observation does not apply with him; for, however I have already stated to you the nature of this offence, I have already stated to you the necessity there is of protecting the officers of the revenue; to gentlemen of your description it is impertinent to make any comment on that; the officer must be protected, the taxes must be collected, and these laws are alone made for the protection of those gentlemen who are fair traders; for certain it is, that smuggling very much indeed interrupts that class of traders. Gentlemen, there is another circumstance, which always will lead a jury with considerable satisfaction to the discharge of their duty on an accusation of this sort; if they are satisfied with the evidence before them that the accused is guilty, I think they will in general be satisfied with their verdict of Guilty, inasmuch as the example of punishment will certainly promise a very considerable public advantage, not only to the revenue, not only to the officers, not only to the fair trader, but to that very class of men that are induced to that sort of traffic which is called smuggling: certain it is, that, by means of the efficacy of the law, of late years that class of men have been very considerably diminished, and in proportion labour and agriculture considerably increased, so that their families enjoy the benefit of these salutary provisions. Gentlemen, I will not trouble you any more on a case like the present; you will hear Andrews; if you are satisfied with his evidence, although but one witness, you will with equal satisfaction say the prisoner is Guilty; if you are dissatisfied, either with his story, or appearance, or any thing in the world, of course you will reject his testimony, and acquit the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Was you out on your survey that day? - I was.</p>
               <p>Did you fall in with any smugglers? - I fell in with some smugglers, that is, four men, having in their possession seven horses, all loaded with tubs, small casks, that contain about four gallons.</p>
               <p>What do you call them? - Half anchors.</p>
               <p>Were they slung? - They were slung in the same manner as smugglers usually carry them, and thrown across their horses. The men were all on horseback, they were leading the other horses.</p>
               <p>Did you know any of them? - I knew three of them.</p>
               <p>Look at the man at the bar, was he one of them? - He was one of them.</p>

               <p>You have no doubt? - Not the least; I was crossing a lane, and I saw these four men coming up, having seven horses, and the first man was leading two horses, and I attempted to seize these horses, to stop them; he kept going on the lane, and I found I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179107200060"></xptr>could not secure them; then the prisoner at the bar and the other men came up, swearing in a terrible manner, with oaths and imprecations, they seemed determined they would murder me.

            , the master of the gang, then calls out to them, d - n his eyes level him, give it him, level him, several times; he then struck me with the head of his whip; then the prisoner and Milton came up, and struck me several blows with their bludgeons, they had each a bludgeon; I attempted to keep off the blows with my stick, but however they presently knocked me down, and cut a very large wound in my head, and beat me very much in different parts of my back and body as I was down, I received many blows after I was down, but I do not know who gave them me; as soon as I could recover myself a little, I got over into a field, and from thence into a garden, cross that garden into another field. I looked back, saw the prisoner, and Milton, coming after me, full speed on their horses; I had just time to reach the fence; they were threatning and swearing terribly at me; at the same time I got over the fence, and they came up to the fence, and there they swore very much indeed, and swore they would give it to me the very next opportunity.</p>
               <p>How often before this had you seen the prisoner? - I had seen him many times, the very Saturday before I met him at Milton's, loaded with tubs; I attempted to take him then; I know him to be Milton's <rs id="t17910720-41-deflabel234" type="occupation">servant</rs>

               <p>You say you knew this man before? - I did.</p>

               <p>The usual dress of these people? - Yes, as to his person I am satisfied.</p>
               <p>You was not alarmed when this man first came up to you? - No, I was not alarmed.</p>
               <p>How many minutes was it after Milton came up to you first that he was followed by the other two men? - It was not Milton that came up first, it was a man whose name I never could find out.</p>

               <p>Had you been struck by the first man? - I had not, he gave me no abusive language. After Milton called out d - n his eyes, level him, give it him, then they struck me with their whips.</p>

Gentlemen of the Jury, it falls to my lot on this occasion to defend the present prisoner at your bar; and, gentlemen, it happens very unfortunately indeed for the prisoner at the bar, that he has such very poor assistance, but as he has called for that assistance, he is entitled to the best exertions I can give him on this occasion. With respect to the general principles that Mr. Fielding, the Counsel for the Crown, has laid down in the beginning of his speech, I perfectly coincide with every one of them; I agree that if taxes are imposed the collectors ought to be protected; I also perfectly coincide with him in the character which he has thought proper to point out of our present worthy Attorney General; I am sure that I can agree with him to the full extent of that description; I am perfectly convinced, and very ready to declare, that a more honourable man in the situation which he now fills, never was placed in that situation. But having got rid of that, we are again necessarily driven to the question which you are to decide, and the question that my learned friend, Mr. Fielding, stated to you certainly does lay in a very small compass indeed; and, gentlemen, the real question on this record is, whether the prisoner was one of those who assaulted, hindered, opposed and obstructed Mr. Andrews, who states himself to be a collector of excise, in the execution of his duty, and while he was in that execution? Now, gentlemen, in order for you to judge on this case, it will be necessary to advert to the evidence, as I think Andrews has stated to you, and I am under the correction of his Lordship if I am wrong, that he does not recollect which of the persons, either Cooper or whether the other person knocked him down, certainly I am right, though corrected by Mr. Garrow; he did not knock him down. Now we will see whether I am correct and right; that he did not strike him at all, I believe, I am in the recollection of every body that hears me; that when he was first asked he did say he did not know that the prisoner ever struck him; but when he was pressed a little, he does say he was the person that struck him several blows on the arm and head; so that by the exertion of that ingenuity, which you have often had opportunities<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179107200062"></xptr>to admire, he is brought to say at last that he did strike him; it would be very material for them to have produced this woman, if she could possibly have identified the person brought to her to be Andrews; instead of that in the way in which Andrews himself stated it first, and then altered his tone; and when you come to the woman, who says she does not know a single feature in Andrews's face; will you presume against the defendant, who comes here upon his own surrender, that which neither of the witnesses have dared to state; this is the single question you have to try, under circumstances that certainly on their own testimony have made it doubtful; but thank God it is for you to decide, and not for any one individual in this Court. My learned friend, Mr. Fielding, has alluded to the inconvenience of being tried here; at the same time he talks of the very great benefits to be derived from this act of parliament. Mr. Fielding certainly on this occasion blows a little hot and cold; it is necessary for the justice of the country that the act of parliament should protect the officers in the collection of the revenues, it is necessary that the trial should be had where they shall have a fair and impartial one; but surely it is of equal service to individuals that they should have opportunity, poor and destitute as they are, particularly in these countries bordering on the sea, that they might have the means of procuring some witnesses, and in order to speak in their behalf farther, they might have witnesses if the act of parliament had given them means; and I am sure you will presume it so to have stated some facts which might have been necessary to have led you to the discussion of the present subject; instead of that, here is a man brought, at a very great distance indeed, poor, without a farthing, save what his miserable friends have been able to pay his Solicitor and Advocate on this occasion; he has not a farthing for witnesses. Where are his benefits? I cannot conceive how they accrue to him; therefore I say when you have a doubtful case before you, when the prosecutor has contradicted himself, at least mended his evidence; and God forbid you should encourage witnesses to mend their cases; when you have a woman coming before you, whom they mean to prove a fact, which, if it had been proved, certainly would have been a great corroboration of the prosecutor himself; instead of that she comes here, and says she does not know a single feature in his face; for God's sake take into consideration the situation of the defendant, that how little able he is to make that defence, feeling the common feelings of humanity, you must presume that he might have had witnesses to have proved his case, which would have left no doubt. Gentlemen, I shall set down with a perfect confidence on this subject, knowing, as I do, that you have given perfect attention to this case, as you do to every other case; and knowing, as I do, the prisoner will have every advantage from a compassionate jury he ought to have, and which, by the law of this country entrusted in your hands, he will receive.</p>

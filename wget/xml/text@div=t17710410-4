I was alarmed about half past seven in the morning. The cook went down stairs. In a few minutes she came up stairs, crying very much, and said the house was broke open. I went down. The kitchen window was broke open, the sash thrown up, a wooden bar that went from side to side was broke in two, one of the shutters was very much damaged, the bar was broke in two in the middle, and splintered very much. I fastened the window up, myself, over night. There is an iron gate to the area, that gate was left wide open; I locked it myself over night. The things mentioned in the indictment were taken away. I never saw the prisoner before, to my knowledge. We never found any thing again.</p>

            . I am a chimney-sweeper. The prisoner and I, and one Llewellyn, went out a-robbing one night, rather in the morning. The robbery was committed between four and five o'clock. They came to my lodgings and called me up, I lodge in Aldersgate-street. We went together with an intention to rob. There was no particular place mentioned. We went up to St. George's, Hanover-square. We made one attempt, but we declined it. Then we went to Mr. Carter's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any notice of that?</p>
               <p>Murray. No. I opened the area gate with a chissel; Llewellyn and I went down; Murphy staid in the street. I lifted up the window sash, and Llewellyn helped me to force open the shutters, I believe with our hands. I went in and struck a light: Llewellyn came in, and we first found a silver bowl, then a pair of candlesticks, then seven tea spoons; then we forced open the back kitchen, and took some things out of a cupboard. We went home. When we came up the prisoner was standing five or six doors off. Llewellyn took the things away, and the next morning brought me my money. He said he had paid the prisoner his share. I had four guineas, or four pounds, I can't say which. I think he said he sold it to one

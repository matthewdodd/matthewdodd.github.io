I left it; this was on a Saturday. My husband desired me to go on the Monday and bring it home without paying what was lent upon it, it being the second time I had found stolen goods there; I went, but the pawnbroker said, several times, he would not let me have it till I found the thief and paid for it; then my husband went to justice Withers and got a search warrant and a constable, and executed the warrant, but he had put the gown out of the way; he said, if we had not brought a search warrant he would have produced it: I got from him a description of the girl that brought it, and found her at her mother's, and I brought her to Pain's house.

               <p>Q. Was your house robbed on the night of the 27th or the morning of the 28th of November - A. Yes. On the night of the 27th, I went to bed at twelve o'clock; we were all in bed by twelve o'clock. My servant lad saw the house properly secured. My sister went to bed last.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you yourself see that the house was properly secured - A. I did not. I was up first the next morning; it was day-light then. That was Sunday morning. On my going down stairs the first thing I found was this closet broken open where this property was.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was this closet - A. Adjoining the shop, in the centre of the house. The door had been fastened with a lock. The door was wide open; the wood work had given way.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen that door locked the night before - A. I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say when you went to bed it was safe - A. My sister kept the key.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what was in the closet - A. Not exactly. It was the place that we usually kept our copper money; and the boiling house was broken open. There is a range of buildings from my dwelling-house to my boiling-house. We go into a yard out of the house, into a washhouse. We cannot go into the boiling-house without going into the wash-house in the yard; that yard is enclosed by a brick wall all round. The boiling-house appeared to have been wrenched open by a crow, or some such instrument. There were no fastenings to the closet in the boiling-house. There are two doors to go through before you get out of the boiling-house to that closet. The back door of the house was upon the latch; it was not locked. They could not get into the yard without getting over the wall, or getting into the boiling-house. A pair of large gates were forced open; they go into a back street; these gates were forced open; they were shut the over night. There were some silver spoons missed out of the cupboard; they have not been recovered. I saw an instrument fitted to the place by the officers.</p>

               <p>Q. I mean out of the house into the yard - A. All the doors of the house were shut; there is a pully, to it, no fastening at all. The boiling-house door that opens into the yard that was shut with a bolt; I saw it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the closet adjoining the shop - A. I kept the key of that; that closet is in the middle of the house; I know it was locked.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what was in that closet - A. Copper tied up in five-shilling papers, and a few half-crown papers.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of halfpence do you suppose them to be - A. About fifty pound. I tied up all the money myself. On Sunday morning I was up first; I came down stairs about half past eight o'clock, and when I came down all the papers of halfpence were gone out of that closet. Me and my brother, a servant maid, and a servant lad, slept in the house that night. I know nothing of the prisoner; I never recollect seeing him before.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on Sunday morning last, the 28th of November, about eight o'clock in the morning. Freeman and Dalton were with me. We went to Weatherhead's garden, Virginia-row, Bethnal-green. We had information that the prisoner lived in that house. He was not at home then. We wanted until nine o'clock; the prisoner came home. I opened the door to him when he knocked; I seized him immediately. I had found these halfpence in the sitting-room; they were all found before he came home. We secured him after a little resistance. I asked him whose halfpence these were; he said he knew nothing about them; some person must have brought them; he asked who it was.</p>
               <p>Q. You found his wife there did you - A. Yes, and she said some woman in a blue and white gown.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181312010018"></xptr>There are more halfpence than a man can carry at once; I then took the prisoner to the office. On Monday morning I went with Dalton to the prisoner's house, and found this crow.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find at his house at Bethnall-green, before the prisoner came there - A. I found this quantity of halfpence, which is five pounds, or thereabouts; they are in paper parcels, tied up in this apron; my fellow officers found the other things. A clock hung up in the room, I asked him whose that was; he said that was his, but the halfpence were not. His wife and three children were in the house, nobody else; there were only two rooms. The oldest of his children is ten or eleven years of age.</p>

I took the crow and the claw hammer to Mr. Elliston's house; Miller was with me. It appeared the door had been broken open by this crow, the marks on the wood work appeared to fit, and the boiling-house door appeared to have been broken open by this claw hammer; the great gates were broken open; the locks was forced off; I have no doubt it was done with this crow.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Sunday morning, a quarter before seven, I awoke. I got up, dressed myself, and went on purpose to get something to drink; there was a man I had spoken to in the week, I asked him to dine with me on Sunday; I went to where he lodged, in Black Horse yard; I enquired of the niece whether he was in; the girl went up stairs, and asked him if he was willing to get up, because William was below. I went up stairs and the man that was with me; we had a drop of something to drink, and when we came down stairs I went directly to my own place, and directly I came to my own door, them gentlemen catched hold of me; I said gentlemen, what do you mean by this; they said, you know. They took the other man in custody as well as me; he has been liberated.</p>

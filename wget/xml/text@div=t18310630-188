            . I am a Police-constable. On the night of the 20th of June, I saw the prisoner going down Phillips'-buildings; in about an hour I saw him coming up Phillips'-buildings, following my brother officer up his beat - he went on as far as Isaac's-place, and as soon as he saw my brother officer off his beat, another person came out of Isaac's-place to the prisoner, and they went down together; I followed them down, and when I got to the second corner I met the prisoner with this sack upon his back, containing this harness, which the prosecutor claims - I took hold of him by the collar; his companion then came up, and knocked me down - the blow I received left me insensible, and they both got away; the prisoner had dropped this bag off his shoulder when I took hold of him, and I found it there when I came to myself - I had frequently seen the prisoner before about the fields, gambling and playing at skittles; I took him about half-past eight o'clock the same evening - he denied that he was the man, but said he recollected meeting me in Phillips'-buildings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.When he met you did he not bid you good night? A. No one bid me good night - I swear they did not; I was near my brother officer - there is a boy like the prisoner who carries baked potatoes about; he wears a light coat - I do not know any others like him; I know the person who knocked me down.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to the theatre that night, and then straight home - I was in bed by twelve o'clock.</p>

            . I live at No. 18, Weston-street, Somers'-town, and am a basket-maker. I have brought up the prisoner from his infancy - his father and mother left him with us to nurse, and they have deserted him - we believe they are dead; we Christened him by our name - there are several boys like him in the neighbourhood; I have been deceived myself several times - I have even raced a boy when I thought the prisoner was not gone on his errand, and have then found my mistake: the prisoner lodged with me, and had a key to let himself in - he was never in prison; he was once taken for tossing, that is all.</p>

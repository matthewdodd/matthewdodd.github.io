I took a fare up at the door, for they said they had got every thing out of the coach; when I had got two or three miles off, I had six people in the coach and two or three outside, a man followed me up and said, are you the coachman? I said yes; he said, there is a box in your coach. I bid him look into the coach and see; he looked in, the gentlemen said there was nothing there, he bid me go on, I came on to London. I set these people down at Bishopsgate Church, and one gentleman at Temple-bar; I carried four or five fares after that, I put my hand under the seat of the coach to feel for my hammer to knock the pole of my coach up, then I found this bundle in the coach; I took it to my own home, my mother-in law took care of this bundle in case it should be enquired after or advertised, as it must then be given back to the people; I kept it a whole week, it was never advertised, I did not know where to carry these things; I thought I had them safe when the people came for them, I asked my mother where they were, she said she had pawned them; I did not know that she had; I did not deny them, I told them they should have them again; I have lived twenty-six years in Whitechapel; I never did a misbehaviour thing in the world; I never did any fault in the days of my breath.

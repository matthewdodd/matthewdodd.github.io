               <p>I am a live poulterer in Brick-lane; the prisoner, on the 18th of August, brought me eight pigeons; I bought them in two lots, for five shillings and two-pence: then a man came, and owned them; I believe I have seen him before; I had a slight knowledge of him; he was the man that brought them; the prosecutor came to my house, and picked out these out of a number of others; he said, they where his; he did not say why; he said, he had lost another; I said, if you look in that place, I believe that is the other, and he said, yes, it was; it is a very hard matter to swear to pigeons, without there is a nail off; one of these pigeons that is in the basket was with another, and I took them down to Mr. Kemp, and he chose the wrong from the right, and the prosecutor mistook one yesterday.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to prosecutor. How did you come by the pigeon that you cut the nail off? - I bought it of Mr. Kemp, about two years ago.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I bred that pigeon two years ago, and better; I sold that pigeon a dozen times, and it has come home to me.</p>
               <p>SOLOMON SHEPHERD sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a headborough; I apprehended the prisoner, on Thursday, the 19th of August; the prisoner said, I hope you will speak to the prosecutor as well as you can; I said, I would speak to him; I asked him what became of the rest of the pigeons; he said, he had only these thirteen pigeons; the gentleman declared then that he had fifteen; I understood him fifteen; I am not positive either fifteen or fourteen; but I am pretty sure he said about thirteen; and if the prosecutor would let him go, he would be bound to fetch the other three; but he would suffer death if he would otherwise.</p>

               <p>On Wednesday morning my wife was taken very ill; she was with child; I wanted to make a little money; I sold some pigeons; I went to work; in the evening, when I came home, they said Mr. Merryman and a constable had been at my house two or three times, enquiring for me; I said, if he wanted me, he must come to me in the morning; I went and fetched some peppermint for my wife; I came home again, and cut my allowance of victuals, and went to go to work, and this constable took me.</p>

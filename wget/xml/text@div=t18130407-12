            . Q. Did you lose a watch and seals - A. Yes. On the 9th of February, I was returning home to Piccadilly, from Lord Townshend's house. About half past ten o'clock in the evening, I was crossing the end of <placeName id="t18130407-12-crimeloc65">Shepherd's-market</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18130407-12-crimeloc65" type="placeName" value="Shepherd's-market"></interp>

I said, no, it was too late to go any where but my own home. They pressed me very much to go with them. I stopped with the tall one, and spoke to her. She pressed me to go with her. I said, it is time for you and me to go home, and when I was talking to her, she said to Featherstone, Sall, come here. When the other prisoner came up they both instantly started, and when I had crossed the market I put my hand to feel for my watch; it was gone; I pursued them. I did not see them from that time until Saturday the 28th of February. We found Featherstone in a street behind Sloane-street, and as soon as she saw me she was very much alarmed. She said, there is a gentleman coming after me. I did not see Stevens until the 1st of March, at the watchhouse in Mount-street. I have never seen my watch again. I lost it entirely.</p>

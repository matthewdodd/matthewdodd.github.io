In August, while she was with me, I missed a gold ring; I suppose it was taken from my bed-room, but am not certain where it was - I inquired about it, but could hear nothing of it till the day after she had left; I then had information, and found it in Beer's possession.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe you had an excellent character with her? A. Yes; since I have discovered this, the prisoner informs me another ring was missing, and had been stolen by another servant, but we have since found that.</p>
               <p>EDWARD BEER. I keep a tripe-shop, in Duke's-row, Pimlico. I have known the prisoner two or three years - she gave me this ring last summer, and told me she had just picked it up near Blenheim-steps.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.You knew her well? A. Yes - she bore a good character.</p>
               <p>MARY SMITH. I am the prosecutor's servant. The prisoner was there before me - I have seen this ring on my master's finger; I saw it in the prisoner's hand, on Sunday, the 29th of August; she took it out of the drawer in master's bed-room - she afterwards told me she had given it to Beer, who came to the house to visit her sometimes - my master spoke about the ring on the Sunday evening, before I knew about it - I did not tell him when I saw her with it; I was afraid it would cause words in the house, and I should lose my place.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.She tells me you gave her the ring to sell? A.It is false; she said she was going to give it away - I did not tell of it, because I have been in the habit of speaking to the young men in master's shop, and I was afraid she would tell mistress of it, and that would cause words - I have lived there ten months; there had been no words about another ring - I did not take any ring; she mentioned about that, because she knew it was lost.</p>
               <p>MR. CLAPP. I was in the habit of wearing this ring I often put it on the drawers and dressing-table; both the servants would be in the habit of seeing it from day to day- it was the prisoner's duty to make the beds; the other servant is nurse-maid.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe you accused Smith with having men into your house? A. No, the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It was not on Sunday; she came down to me on Wednesday morning, and said, "Charlotte, I have had a ring in my pocket three or four days, and you might sell it for me;" I said, "I dare not, as I might be taken on suspicion," and when I went out I gave it to Beer - she said I went out on Sunday, but I never saw him on Sunday - she took the ring out of the drawer herself.</p>
               <p>EDWARD BEER. She gave it to me in the middle of the week.</p>
               <p>GUILTY Aged 23.</p>
               <p>Recommended to Mercy by the Jury and Prosecutor, on account of her character.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Hand and Flower public-house, in King's-road, Fulham—the prisoner keeps the Cadogan Arms, in the King's-road, Chelsea. On the 12th of Jan. last, I went to his house at about a quarter past twelve o'clock in the morning—I was going to Brighton—I asked him for a card of the regulations of the Brighton railroad—I took some drink, and offered some to the prisoner—he would not take any at first—a man came in with some fowls, a rabbit, and a goose, which was pur<lb></lb>chased, and a supper was arranged for the evening—it was raining very hard from twelve to half-past twelve at night—that induced me not to go to Brighton—we sat down to supper about six, or ten minutes before—I had not left the house from twelve till that time—I had been drinking there—a man, named Fry, was there at supper—I told him I was told by a person named Humphries, that he had drunk some punch the night before in my absence, which he had not paid for—he denied it (I had been there the night before, and had 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of punch between five of us) I called for some wine and water—it was served to me—I cannot say whether the prisoner gave it me—I ordered it of him—I drank part of it—I fancied it was not genuine—I felt queer after, and went out of the room three times—as I was going down into the yard, the prisoner was in the passage, laughing—the door of the water-closet was barricaded—I remained there I dare say half<lb></lb>an-hour, I felt so ill—I came into the room again—Davis was laughing with the people in the room—he asked where I got that coat which I had on, that it was a very handsome one, and if it was paid for—I told him it was, I was not in the habit of wearing my clothes before they were paid for, I always paid my way—he said he did not think I did—I told him perhaps he might be alluding to a former transaction, where he was concerned with another person, in trying to extort 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from me—he said if I said so again, he would smash me—he got up—I told him he was, and 1 had got two letters to prove it in black and white—he said if I repeated the words again he would smash my brains—he took hold of the poker—I was sitting down—my hat was off—I turned my head on one side, and received a blow with the poker, and I turned on my left—I have no recollection of anything that took place after the blow, till I found myself outside the door, recovering—it was then raining very hard—I was about a yard from the door, in the street—I felt my head was injured—I put my hand up, and found it had been strapped—it must have been about twelve o'clock—there are shutters to the house—I could see</p>

                  </hi>. I am a painter, living in King's-road, Chelsea. Between seven and eight o'clock on the evening of the 12th of January, I went to the Cadogan Arms—I saw the prosecutor there—when I went in he was in the passage that forms part of the bar, close to the bar, walking about—he appeared rather intoxicated—in the course of the evening, he said I had partaken of five glasses of punch, which he had paid for the evening before, which I denied—he repeated it a number of times, till it became quite offensive—he did it in the early part of the evening—he accused me of it as soon as I came into the house—but as soon as supper was over, in conse<lb></lb>quence of his repeating this, I applied to Mr. Davis, and he applied to Mrs. Davis—he asked her, in M'Carthy's hearing, if I had partaken of any punch anywhere, and where the punch was when I had left the house—she answered, I bad left the house previous to her sending the punch into the room—on that Davis came back into the room, and asked M'Carthy if he was satisfied now—M'Carthy said, "Of course, Mrs. Davis will say anything for Fry, she is as big a wh——as you are a liar"—on this, Davis sprang from where he was standing, caught him by the collar, and in one moment they were both on the ground, Davis rather undermost—it was so suddenly, I cannot deci<lb></lb>dedly say whether it was the fire-place or fender struck his head—he fell in a direction towards the fire-place—they separated—Davis got up first—I helped M'Carthy up—Davis went out of the room immediately, rather shaking—it was a severe sudden tumble—M'Carthy's head was hurt—I looked at it and cut the hair off, it was bleeding a little—he said nothing about how it happened—I washed it and put a little white plaister on—the servant of the house brought the water—Davis was at the door—he did not assist in dressing the wound—he sent the servants to me—M'Carthy was perfectly sensible at that time—when I placed him in a chair, I said, "You are not hurt, are you?"—he said, "Ain't I though"—the first I knew of his having wounded himself was, his placing his hand to his head, and when I removed it I saw blood on it—I said I am sorry for what has occurred—I asked to look at his head—he said no, at first—he would not allow me—at last he did allow me—I saw an injury—he said, "What have I done that I should be struck with a poker"—I said, "You have not been struck with any poker here"—he did not say anything more—he remained there about an hour after the occurrence—I do not know whether he drank anything after it—some brandy was brought into the room—I do not know whether he partook of it, it was not used for any<lb></lb>thing that I know of—at the time he received the hurt, the persons in the room were Mr. Davis, M'Carthy, and myself—I am perfectly sure that, during the time I was there, Davis used no poker to M'Carthy—he did not touch one—he struck him with nothing—there was no blow of any kind struck, either with hand or poker, with the exception of snatching him by the collar—after he had been an hour in the house, he went away—I asked him if I should assist him home—he said, "No, he was quite capable of conducting himself," with some show of indignation—I then asked him if the potman should see him home—he refused—he walked away very fast out of the house by himself—from the time he fell till he was picked up, there might be two minutes elapse—after he was picked up till he left the house he was not insensible one moment—I should say he left the house between twelve and</p>

               <p>one o'clock—I cannot say positively—his conduct to the customers in the coffee-room, that evening, was insulting in the extreme—Mr. Davis remon<lb></lb>strated with him, several times, on his conduct, and desired him to leave the house two or three times—his answer was, he should go when he liked—there was a cast-iron fender to the fire-place, with a very sharp edge and sharp points at the corner.</p>

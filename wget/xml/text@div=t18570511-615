                  </hi>. I am a baker, and am in the service of Mr. Klein, of Pennington Street, Marylebone—I had seen Nicholas Klein once or twice—I never saw Christian Klein before. On Saturday evening, 28th March, I had been having a pint of beer by myself in Homer Street, and about half past 12 o'clock at night I was in Seymour Place, Bryanstone Square—I had left the beer shop by myself—I had seen Nicholas Klein there—I do not recollect seeing Christian Klein—nothing happened in the beer shop—when I got to Bryanstone Square, I heard some one following me—I took no notice, but when I was about twenty yards from the gate, some one came behind me and hit me on the head—I saw, when he left off, that he had something in his hand—I cannot tell what it was; it was something sharp—I had two or three cute through my cap—Nicholas Klein came up, but he did nothing to me—when I turned round, Christian Klein went away—I caught hold of Nicholas, and he said, "What has he done to you?"—I told him I had got hit by him; he said, "Come along with me, and I will see you home"—when I turned round I spoke to Christian Klein, and asked him what he hit me with, and what he had in his hand—he said he had nothing in his hand—he ran away—I did not see him any more till I got to the station—Nicholas Klein saw me home—my waistcoat and shirt were bloody—I am quite sure the wounds must have been inflicted by something sharp.</p>

On the night of 28th March I saw a great number of persons running towards Seymour Place—the prosecutor and the prisoners were there—I did not see any one but them—they were running through the gates towards Bryanstone Square; I followed them—I was ten or fifteen yards behind them—when I got through the gates I saw Christian Klein rather before his brother, and Graef was before them—Christian fell down in running; Nicholas got before him—Christian got up again, and ran and struck Graef on the head three or four times—Nicholas held Graef at the time that Christian struck him, and Nicholas held his hand up to guard the wounded man—that was as soon at he noticed the blow being struck—I went up Shouldham Street after Christian, and gave him into custody—I saw a knife taken from his pocket by the constable—I saw that he had something in his hand at the time the blows were struck, but I could not see what it was.</p>

I live in Homer Street I was in Bryanstone Square with the last witness on 28th March, about half past 12 o'clock at night—I came out of my house, No. 5, Homer Street, and there was a row, and a lot of Germans were running—I ran to Bryanstone Square, and saw the prisoners together, and the wounded man was ahead of them—I then saw that Nicholas Klein had hold of Graef, and Christian Klein went to the back of him and stabbed him five or six times on the head—I then saw Christian Klein shut the knife up and put it into his pocket—Graef said Something in German, and he opened his hand and held it out, to show that</p>

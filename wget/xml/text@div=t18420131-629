                  </hi>. I am a labourer in the employ of Mr. John Hull, a coal-merchant at Uxbridge. On Thursday, the 20th of January, about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw his fowls alive and safe, and the hen-house locked—it stands in my master's premises, and is enclosed within the same fence as the dwelling-house—Mr. Hull's foreman, Richard Strut, lives there—he himself lives at Hillingdon—I traced some blood and feathers across a field, about sixty yards, to a barge lying at the Grand Junction Canal.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I received information on Friday morning, in consequence of which, I in company with Inspector Otway, followed a barge to Hayes bridge—Markham was driving the horse which towed the barge, and Harris was on board steering it—I found five dead fowls underneath the bed in the cabin—Harris asked what I wanted—I told him a hen-house had been broken open at Uxbridge, and I had sus<lb></lb>picion he had the fowls on board—he said if there was any stolen property on board he did not know any thing about it—Harris's wife was in the cabin at the time the fowls were found.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-inspector.

                  <hi rend="italic">Markham's Defence.</hi> About half-past seven o'clock on Thursday night, Harris went to a public-house to have a pint of beer, and ordered me to go for some hay for the horse's supper. When I returned to the barge I found the dog barking and making a strange <hi rend="italic">row.</hi> I let him loose, and he ran barking into the fields after two men, who were running across the field. I followed, and found the dog under a hedge with five fowls, one not dead. I took them on board, and put them away in the nose-bag as quick as possible, for fear my master should kick up a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> about it. There was no one but me on board.</p>

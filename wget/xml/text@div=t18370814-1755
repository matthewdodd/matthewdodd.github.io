On the 18th of July, I had one sovereign, two half-sovereigns, one shilling, and one sixpence, in a purse in my pocket—I got a little in liquor, and went into Mr. Racine's settle in Barnett, and I was inclined to be sick—they were going to carry me out, and they saw my pocket was empty, my purse and discharge were gone—this is my purse and discharge—(looking at them.)</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a public-house. I saw the prosecutor come in and lay down—I found him asleep in the tap-room—the prisoner was rifling his pockets, and I told him to let the man alone and let him sleep—I went away, when I came back in two or three minutes he was at it again—I told him to let it be—I saw the discharge, and he appeared to be putting it into the soldier's pocket—I told him to give it me, and he said he had put his money into his pocket all right—I sent two men to take prosecutor up into the loft, I then went into the tap-room and the prisoner was gone—I went and overtook him, and gave him to the officer—this money was found on him, and the purse was found in the yard—the discharge the prisoner gave me when I asked him for it.</p>

In consequence of something that occured, about two months before January last, I went to Simmonds' house with Hillmore; I cautioned Simmonds, in Hillmore's presence, against buying any thing of Hillmore, as I told him he had no property of his own, and he was in my master's employ; there is an apothecary's shop in Whitecross-street, and I went there on Friday, the 14th of January, about nine o'clock in the evening - I saw Hillmore go by there with this sash; he went on to Simmonds', in <placeName id="t18310217-136-crimeloc815">Playhouse-yard</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was Hillmore present when you cautioned Simmonds? A. Yes; I took him with me from our own premises - we were both sober- I had suspicion of a sash that I cautioned him about before, but I could not swear to that; I have sent Hillmore to Mr. Gough on several occasions - Simmonds buys and sells sashes; the sash Hillmore then had he said he bought of Simmonds - that was three weeks before this; nothing more passed at that time; my master is not here - I prosecute for him, and know this property; it came from Mr. Panton's, in Smithfield; I never remember purchasing a pine plank from Mr. Gough, in the Curtain-road - I have bought some hundreds of other things there; I did not accompany Hillmore there about six months ago, and purchase a pine plank to make a frieze of - I do not remember unloading it; I never gave Hillmore money to fetch away goods which I had purchased there - I have often sent him to fetch away goods from there, but never to fetch a pine plank; he never brought me any money back; I never sent him with a farthing - he never brought me any money from Mr. Gough; I remember a great many truck loads of fire-wood coming from a yard in Goswell-street - I sent some of them to my house - undoubtedly Mr. Holgate knew it; I had the selling of it myself - I am only a lodger there; Mr. Holgate knew that I received a truck load -I told him of it, that I swear; I did tell Hillmore at the time not to tell his master, but it was not because I was taking it in an unfair way, but that he was other ways employed - the lady where I lodge may have wood at any time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was that your reason? A. Yes; I was always authorized to send her any quantity, but he was very busy at that time, and I said, "You have no occasion to mention to Mr. Holgate that you took this truck."</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is Mr. Holgate so good as to let your landlady have any wood? A. Yes - she holds the lease, I believe, of his premises; the wood was for her - I never made a fire in the house; the only reason I told Hillmore not to tell his master was because we were very busy, and he wanted the man - the man wished to go with it, as she generally gave him a pint of beer; it was merely that Mr. Holgate should not know that the time of his servant was wasted, that I told him not to mention it - I remember sending Hillmore to Holloway with a load of timber; I did not see what he brought back - I did not tell him to tell his master he had brought nothing back; I did not see him on that day, that I know of; I did not, on any occasion, tell him not to tell his master what he had brought back - it is the first I have heard of it. I know nothing of five paving-stones being left in Rahere-street, Goswell-street-road - I never heard of it. I live in President-street - I know half a dozen people who live in Rahere-street, but I know nothing of that transaction; I was not doing any private job there for myself - I was doing a job for Mr. Holgate at Mr. Anderson's, in Rahere-street - that is two or three months ago; of course Mr. Holgate knew of it - I never told Hillmore, when he went to Mr. Gough's, to tell Gough to charge an extra shilling; he never brought me back a shilling in his life.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Upon what occasion did Mr. Holgate tell you to take wood to your landlady? A. He has given me orders many times to take wood there.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did your employer purchase the business of your landlady? A. Yes, and I believe she holds the lease of the premises.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you been acquainted with Simmonds before this? A. Never before I went to caution him - he was not under my control; he said he was in the habit of buying and selling, and he was not in the habit of noticing every person who came into his shop - he gave me such a dissatisfactory answer, that I went and fetched Hillmore, and said, "Is this the man you sold a sash to?" he said, "I believe it is;" he gave me the right direction of the man he bought this sash of, I believe - he keeps a general shop; I have seen his name up at the shop about nine months; I am not acquainted with him, and he is not in any way acquainted with the prosecutor - there is nothing on the sash by which a stranger could know it was Mr. Holgate's, but I knew it, having had it in my hand two hours before it was stolen.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He never denied the sash all through? A. No, he told me at once what he paid for it - Mr. Stothard was with me; I know Simmonds has lived there some time, and he has a wife and some children - I am sure he said he bought it.</p>

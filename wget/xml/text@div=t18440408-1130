                  </hi>. I keep a coffee-shop in High-street, Shoreditch. On the 15th or 16th of Jan. the prisoner came to my house—he asked me whe<lb></lb>ther he could be accommodated with a bed—I said yes—he sat down and had some cold meat and a pint of porter—he retired to bed about eleven—there was a pair of sheets on the bed—next morning he came down at half-past nine—he said, "I have laid it out this morning, but my profession or business does not require my rising very early; I have been accustomed to take my drops of a morning; get me a beef-steak, I will be back in a few minutes"—he went out, and never returned.</p>

                  </hi>. I recollect the prisoner sleeping at the house—I went up directly after he left—the sheet was turned over the "bed—I went down, and said it was all right—two or three hours after I went to make the bed, and the top sheet had been taken off, and the bottom one turned over the top—no one had been in the room that night but the prisoner—he came down the last—no other person went into the room after be went that morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Farrell. On the 26th of July I was sitting at my stall, in High-street, Shad well—the two prisoners came and spoke to me—Daniels asked me for three pence—I told her I had not three pence to lend her—she said she would soon go home and raise sixpence—she said to Oakes, "Come on, Mrs., Oakes, I will soon raise a <hi rend="italic">tanner</hi>" which means sixpence—they both went away together—they were not with me above four or five minutes—I went home, and missed my gown, which was hanging in "my room a quarter of an hour before—this now produced is it—Daniels lives in the same house, and Oakes next door.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in the same room as Farrell—Daniels lived in the house. On the day this gown was lost I saw the prisoners come into the passage together—they went out together—Daniels then had something in her apron—shortly after Mrs. Farrell came home, and made a complaint—when the prisoners came into the house, they told Mrs. Farrell's boy to mind her child—the boy and child went into the yard—I did not see either of them go to Mrs. Farrell's apartments.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Waterloo-terrace, Commercial-road. This gown was pawned on the 26th of July, by Oakes, in the name of Smith—I am sure of her—I did not know her before—it was applied for on the following morning—Daniels was not with her.</p>

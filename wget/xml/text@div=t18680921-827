I am a compositor, and live at 141, Fetter Lane—on 22nd August I was in Fetter Lane, about 1.30 in the morning—I saw the prisoner there—I passed her, and then heard her coming after me—she rushed up to me and threw her arms round me—I pushed her away—she followed me—when I got a few yards from my house she threw her arms round me again, and asked me to go with her—I had a purse in the breast pocket of my coat—I pushed her off me again, and then missed my purse, containing a sovereign, a half-sovereign, and 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—I turned round and saw her running away—I ran after her and caught her—I told her if she would give me my purse and money I would not give her in charge, but if not I should give her in custody—she then dropped 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the road—I let go one of her hands to pick it up, and she thrust the purse into my pocket again—the elastic band was broken, it was all right when I had it before—a constable came up and I gave her in custody—she then said if the constable would take her to some address the money should be made good.</p>

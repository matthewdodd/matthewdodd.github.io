                  </hi>. I am an iron merchant of Curzon-lane, Upper Thames-street—I have partners—the prisoner was our clerk and cashier there for three or four years—it was his duty to bring daily to our counting-house in the Borough the money he received the day before; he generally brought it to me—on 31st January he brought me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as received of a customer named Webb, on account—Mr. Webb owed us 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—the prisoner never paid me the 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the residue of that account—he was not authorized to disburse any money he received on our account—a separate account was kept for that, for which he had money given him—previous to July, 1858, he had authority to disburse money he received for us, but we had taken that authority from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do not you know that he has done so since? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—he generally came over on Monday morning, and received 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay wages with, and on the following Monday that 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was accounted for—he might pay more than £10 during the week, and pay away money he had received for us; I do not know that he did; I would not swear that he did not—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my petty cash-book—here is one instance in it, in September, 1858, where his payments amount to 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., he having received 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I should pay him the one 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. when he brought me the book; I set my initials to it here—it never happened in any one instance that the balance due to him went over two or three weeks—that is not the only instance in which he has paid more than he received; here is another here of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the following week, and another in October, of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; in November a balance of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was over paid by him; he received 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and expended more than 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this book shows that I actually paid him the balance; he would not tick it unless I had—1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of it was for his own wages—no; I find I have made a mistake, the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was the other way; he handed me the balance—I know that he paid it me, or I should not have put my initials—I do not see any occasions where he has overpaid more than 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the outside; here is 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in January—I do not remember the date that I gave him in custody—this is the only cash-book that he kept—I believe I invariably paid him the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Monday myself; there were not some weeks in which it was not convenient to give it to him; he would have it next day—it is possible that I may have said that it was inconvenient, and that he used the money in his hands for the purpose—the wages were paid day by day—if I had not money to pay him on Monday, and he used money in his hands, he would come on Tuesday—it would be a week before I finally settled, but he would have money on the fol<lb></lb>lowing day—I say that he has received 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and has only paid me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was on 31'st January—I have no recollection of the day or the amount without the</p>

            . I am a constable of Islington. On the 27th of May, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoners in company together, in Middle-row, Holborn. I watched them down Holborn, and saw them look at several gentlemens' pockets - They went down Field-lane, and I lost them. I then met Thompson; he and I went together, and met all four in <placeName id="t18180617-77-crimeloc420">Fleet-street</placeName>

I was by the Bolt in Tun, they were on the other side of the way, and so was Thompson. I saw Glover follow a gentleman in black, and take a yellow handkerchief out of his right-hand coat pocket-the other three were close to him, covering him, to prevent anybody from seeing what he was doing - I do not know the gentleman. They all four turned round, and went up Johnson's-court together. I immediately went over to Thompson, and found he had seized all four of them. I lost the gentleman, and do not know his name. Thompson found the handkerchief on Holland. I am positive it is the same I saw taken from the gentleman. Holland said he would give him the fogle (meaning the handkerchief) to let him go. I had been watching them for an hour.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Sepulchre's. I met Owen, and we went to look for the prisoners. I went on one side of Fleet-street, and he on the other, and saw all the four prisoners coming together towards Fleet-market. After following them a little way, I saw them all four dart into Johnson's-court together-Holland was a little behind the others. I ran up the court, and saw one of them push a handkerchief into Holland's hand - I took it out of his hand. Owen came over - I desired them all to stop, which they did for about a minute, and then Feathers made his escape, but was brought back by a man who stopped him. Owen then came up, and told me what he had seen. I searched and found another silk handkerchief in Holland's pocket. I said to Holland, "I thought you told me you would leave this off." He said, "Thompson, take the fogle, and let us go."</p>

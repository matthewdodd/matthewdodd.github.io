                  </hi> I am the wife of William Digweed, a grocer, of High-street, Lambeth. On Saturday night, the 10th of July, about half-past ten, I was behind the counter—the prisoner came in very tipsy, and staggering—he asked how I did, then turned round from me to the boy Blake, who was sitting on a sugar-tub by the door, and began pulling him about, roughing up his hair on each side, and saying, "You are the chap that serves out the coffee"—he pulled him off the tub, and pushed him against the street-door, he then dragged him back to the counter, then took him round the head with his arm, and the boy being shorter than himself, he had that power over him that he reeled him round and round, and I thought both would have fallen into the street—he took the boy off his feet—they both went out into the street together, and as they went out, they met an old lady, who was stepping on the edge of the path with her supper-beer in her hand, and with one blow they went against her, and knocked her backwards—they were both together at the time the blow was struck—the prisoner had the boy round as he went out of the shop, and went against the old lady—it is a small shop, and the counter is near the door—I could see pretty plainly, there was a lamp alight at a public-house opposite—the old lady turned out to be Mrs. Allsworth, who I knew very well as living four doors off—I saw her fall, with her jug in her hand, as if she had fallen from some high place, she fell direct on the back of her head—I ran out to her, and heard her say, "Oh my head; this will be my death-blow"—I lifted her up, and she was taken home—the pri<lb></lb>soner</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184708160244"></xptr>
               <p>went away as far as William-street, which is one door from us, he was afterwards brought back by the boy—Blake said to him, "Come back, and see what you have done; you have knocked the old woman down"—his reply was, "What am I to do? am I to pay for 1/2 oz. of coffee? if I have hurt you, mother, God bless you!" and away he went—he was quite drunk—thinking she was not much hurt, I let him go—I went home with the de<lb></lb>ceased, and saw her bonnet taken off, it was very much dented in at the back—there was no blood—she was still groaning, "Oh, my head"—her daughter laid her on the bed—she died next morning.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you know the prisoner before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I had never seen him before—when he was roughing up Blake's hair he said, "A little whiting and blue would make you a good colour"—he seemed very foolish, and full of frolic and fun—the prisoner is much taller than Blake—he took hold of him and took him off his feet—when he knocked his head against the door, Blake said, "Now, then," and that was every word he spoke—he appeared to be quite in the prisoner's power when he was whirling round—they appeared to go round and round as if <hi rend="italic">shifted</hi> by some machine—when he came back, and said what I have stated, he was mumbling about the boy, and appeared to be saying something about his getting the best of him—I did not hear him say to Blake, "Oh, it is you that rolled me out of the shop?"—Blake was not intoxicated, he was sitting as quiet as a child—the deceased had a bottle in one hand and a jug in the other, I cannot say whether she was sober—the street had been dug up, to repair the water-pipe, a place had been left lower than the other part of the road, and the deceased appeared to fall in that place.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The deceased was near that spot? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, she must have had her foot on the edge of the path, for she spilt some of the beer on the edge of the path, directly opposite—her feet appeared to go just down by the door, and her head into this place that was not repaired—I do not think she stepped from the spot after she was struck.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You state that the prisoner was drunk, and that what he was doing was in the nature of fun? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it would appear like it—what he was doing to the boy was like what a foolish drunken man would intend as fun—it did not appear like an assault or ill-usage, but more in the nature of play—the boy was unusually quiet, according to his character in general—he let him go on, I think, on account of the things in the window, for I called out, "Mind the boxes, do not go through the glass, "</p>

                  </hi> I am twenty years old, and live with Mr. Digweed. I was in the shop on Saturday night, the 10th of July, when the prisoner came in—he first spoke to my mistress, then turned to me, pulled my hair, pulled me off the tub I was sitting on, and pulled me from the door to the counter, and from the counter to the door; he then let go my hair, put his left-hand round my neck, and pulled me outside the door, and when he got me outside, be put both hands on my hair, gave me a pull towards him, and a shove from him—we both went out together round about—he did this against my will—I could not help myself, but I took it in the light of a joke.</p>

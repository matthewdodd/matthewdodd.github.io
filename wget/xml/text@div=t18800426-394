I am verger of Clapham Parish Church—on 20th June, 1876, a marriage took place between the prisoner and a woman whom I pointed out at the police-court on the 25th March last—I saw them both sign the register, of which this is a copy (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—one is described as a bachelor, and the other as a spinster.</p>

I live at Harefield, Middlesex, with my father and mother—I made the prisoner's acquaintance at the beginning of October, 1878—I had some private property at that time—he offered me marriage, said he was a traveller, that he had a family and had been a widower for nearly six years—on 13th February, 1879, I went through the ceremony of marriage with him at St. Peter's, Eaton Square—Mr. James Barker and his daughter were the witnesses of the marriage—I obtained from the vestry clerk this copy of the register (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

About 8 o'clock on the 24th March, from instructions I received, I went to the Peckham Police-station and found the prisoner there—I told him I should take him into custody for committing bigamy by marrying Emma Wheeler, his former wife being then" alive—he said, "I am innocent."</p>

               <p>Mr. Lambe, was my solicitor at the time, and has got all my papers. At the time of the trial at the Old Bailey the husband was in Court, and for want of a witness that her husband was living at the time she was not prosecuted: I mean not convicted, and I was free to marry whom I liked. It is a son of mine who is doing all this; he had been bound over twice; he is in Court now, one of the biggest vagabonds that ever lived."</p>

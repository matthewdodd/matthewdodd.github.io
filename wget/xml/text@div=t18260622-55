Yes; Stiggle put it into the cart; he is my porter, and went to see me safe out of town; I was not intoxicated - I am not in the habit of drinking; I was in the fore part of the cart, not inside - the box was in the bottom of the cart, and things on the top of it; I did not see it taken; there were foot-marks behind the cart where they had got in; they could get it by undoing the pins of the tail-board - there is no till to the cart; I sat in front on the near side, and the trunk was on the off side; it was a very dark night. I sat on the box - it filled the bottom of the cart.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. At what time did you receive it? A About four o'clock; we got to the Wellington about eight - the trunk was found about eleven miles from the Wellington; they could undo the tail-board behind, and get it out; it was fastened by two iron pins. The things on the box were linen, which I also lost - it all belonged to Mr. Pepys.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. You say there were foot-marks upon the cart? A. Yes; the tail-board was dirty - it was a dirty night. I did not find the board down - they could put it up again; they might put their feet on the tail-board to get up, and take out the pin.</p>

            . I am a musical instrument maker, and live in Golden-lane. On Saturday, the 25th of March, I went to a friend's house, Mr. Johnson, No. 23, Thomas-street, Hackney; I was there from five to eight o'clock, and Walker came in there; I left him there about eight; I did not know him before. A conversation took place about the purchase of a horse.</p>
               <p>Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you a housekeeper or a lodger? A. A lodger. I had never seen Walker before or since; a friend of Johnson's was there; Johnson appeared to have been intimate with the prisoner some time; the other person appeared a stranger; Johnson is not here. Walker came in about six o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. How can you recollect that this was on Saturday, the 25th of March - it is a long time ago? A. It was Easter-eve. I have been backwards and forwards to Johnson since, and the conversation turned on Walker's situation; my attention was called to this six weeks or two months ago. I was at Johnson's about a week ago - I was subpoenaed here on Monday; I have seen Johnson since, and told him I was subpoenaed, and he said he supposed he should be also - he is a working-jeweller, and works for the shops. I only recollect Walker from his being there that night; Johnson introduced him as Mr. Walker - we had some spirits and water and some porter; I have not seen him since.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they find you out to subpoena you? A. Johnson knew where I lived; I did not ask him if he had given them my address, but I suppose he did. I have lived in Golden-lane two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did nobody but the prisoner come in that night? - A. A person came in who was to buy the horse; I understood his name was Little - he came from Barking; I only recollect the night by its being Easter-eve and quarter-day; I have met strangers there at other times. I mentioned to several friends that I could speak to this day. I do not know Walker's friends.</p>
               <p>Mr. ANDREWS. Q. Did you go to Johnson on business or pleasure? A. Business. I left Walker and Little there when I came away; I did not know he was in trouble for two months after; Johnson told me so, and asked if I remembered his being there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long ago is it that Johnson told you Walker was in trouble? A. I think it is about a month or five weeks; he asked if I remembered seeing him there - I immediately said it was on quarter day; I went to Johnson the next morning, after I was subpoenaed, and told him - it was last Tuesday or Wednesday; I did not ask if he was subpoenaed as I naturally supposed he was. I went to tell him I was subpoenaed, as much as any thing; he lives a mile and a half from me; I went on business - I had some violin bows to make for him - they were in hand, but not quite finished - I had only got the order a few days before.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had no occasion to go to him about the bows? A. Not particularly; I did not go to Newgate to see if Walker was the same man.</p>

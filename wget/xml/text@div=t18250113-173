            . I am a headborough. I was sent for last Wednesday morning to take the prisoner - when I got him to the watch-house, he told me the coats were at an old clothes-shop, in Chick-lane; he went with me, and we found them there - he had sold them for old rags, but the man stopped him, and did not pay him for them.</p>

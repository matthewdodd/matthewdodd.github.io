               <p>I recollect coming home the 14th of March: and I sent for the constable, and desired him to break open the prisoner's door; I did not go up the second pair of stairs; I missed my money: the constable brought the prisoner down to the one pair of stairs, where I was; the prisoner, and me, and the constable went into the bedroom; the constable went out; and as soon as he went out, the prisoner said he was the man that had robbed me; he asked me not to hurt him? I told him I did not wish to hurt him; I thought it very odd I should be robbed, and he in the house; he said, he had been asleep on the bed: I discovered before I went for the constable, that I had been robbed, by opening the drawer, where I had put my money in the morning, and missing it: when we went into the room the constable left me and the prisoner together; and he took hold of my left hand, says he, Mrs. Maxwell, I am the man that has robbed you, and do send the people away, and do not hurt me; and I came out of the room, to endeavour to send the people away; and I said, have you got Charles's buckles? (which was a young lad I had the care of); and the prisoner said, he had; then I sent for a neighbour, who is not here; nothing else material passed that I remember; there was seven guineas and a half, and twenty shillings and six pence in silver; I saw it there that morning; I counted it, and put it into the drawer; I cannot say whether I locked the drawer; but my keys hung up in the room; I was going to walk, and I thought they would be heavy.</p>

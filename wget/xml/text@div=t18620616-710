                  </hi>. I am the wife of Walter Sprankett, of 2, Herbert's-buildings, Waterloo-road, Southwark—on the 27th of May, I locked up all the house early in the evening, and closed the shutters—they were not fastened, but the window was down—I am positive I closed the door—I and my husband sleep upstairs, and an apprentice sleeps in the parlour—I was awoke about 4 o'clock in the morning by my apprentice, and saw the window wide open; the shutters were shut—I missed a clock off the sideboard, a box with six eggs, two pictures, a jug, and plate—these articles (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are mine—I value them at a sovereign, but my husband gave a sovereign for the clock alone, last winter—I saw the prisoner in custody at the door—I never saw the prisoner before—I did not allow her to take these things away—the prisoner said to the policeman, in, my presence, that another person took them and gave them to her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> When you came down you saw me with the police? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I looked and saw what I had lost—I said, "Will you show me where the things were taken?"—you said, "Yes, all I know of; I will show you where they are"—the policeman urged you to tell where the things were—you directed him at once to 16, Tower-street, the woman you mentioned did not reside there; but when you told where she really did live, we went there and found the things—I said that I could not miss all I had lost—we found a chair in your place after we came from the Magistrate—I have it now; the policeman fetched it from there—it was you that took the things; not another woman—you told me that the woman had slept with you on the Sunday night—you did not say that her husband had left her and was living with another woman, and that you had known her</p>

                  </hi>. I am an apprenticed shoemaker, and lodge at Mr. Sprankett's—about 3 or half-past on the morning of the 27th I was in bed, in the parlour—I heard the prisoner moving some glasses off the sideboard, and packing the clock up, and saw her just going out at the door with it—I am sure it was the prisoner—it was not light enough to see her features, but I knew her when she came back; she had the same shawl over her head—I saw her putting the clock under her shawl; I heard it ticking—she was gone about twenty minutes.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> You told the Magistrate you saw me take out the box? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I did not say I saw you take the chair or the box—I said I saw you take the clock and two pictures—you had to move all the glasses, and that awoke me—I did not speak, because I was frightened and did not know what to do; I was only half awake—you did not say, when I stopped you, "They do not belong to you; they belong to the woman who is gone on"—I said, "Where are the things?" you said, "What things?" I said, "The things you took out of our house;" you said, "What house?" I said, "The pictures;" and then you pushed me away, put the things in the gutter, and ran away—I did not say, "You had better bring the pictures back"—you did not say, "The woman is gone on; I will go and bring her back"—you said that we should miss a chair, and we did miss it when we got home again.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, P</hi> 249). On the morning of the 27th, about a quarter-past 4 o'clock, I heard a cry of "Stop thief!" at Waterloo-road, Lambeth, and saw the prisoner running towards me from the direction of Herbert's-buildings to the Westminster-road—I stopped her, and the other witness came up to me, and from what he told me I took the prisoner back to Herbert's-buildings—I did not see any pictures drop—I saw them at the station—the prisoner said some woman had employed her to take the things away—after I charged her with stealing she said, "If you go with me, I will show you where the property is"—I went with her to 4, Wells-court, Blackfriars-road, and there found these things; she gave them up—that was her lodging—she said two other women had helped take the things—we found one in the house at the time—she went before the Magistrate, but denied all knowledge of it, and was discharged.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186206160111"></xptr>
               <p>—the prosecutrix had not missed it at the time; we found it at the lodging afterwards.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I have never been accused in any situation before; I deny that I ever brought any articles out; the woman was coming along the Blackfriars-road with another woman, and she had the chair, the box, and the plate; she said that she was coming to my place, and that these were some things that she had, got from where her husband was with another woman; I went with her to this house; she went in and brought out the clock and two pictures; I came as far as the middle of the next street, and then said, "I don't like having anything to do with it, I shall get into trouble;" she said, "You will get into no trouble; they are my own;" she took the clock, and left me with the two pictures in my hand; the boy came up and said, "You have two pictures;" I said, "Yes; they do not belong to you;" he said, "Yes; they belong to the woman where I am living; bring them back; there is a clock, is there not?" I said, "Yes, and several other things;" he said, "You had better bring her back;" a man at the corner said, "The woman has turned up this turning;" I ran to over<lb></lb>take her, and then the policeman came up; I told where the things were, and gave them up; I need not have told where they were; the woman said she would have got rid of the things, and I was a fool to tell where they were; she was in the yard at the time the policeman brought the things out;" had I known it at the time I would have had her taken: I wish to get my living in an honest way; I have two children totally unprovided for; the woman has got out of the way.</p>

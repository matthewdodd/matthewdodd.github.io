I told him I wanted to speak with him; he told me to sit down. I told him I wanted to ask him a question in consequence of my wife having left me some time; I should be glad to know his opinion whether she would ever return.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, in order to induce him to give answers did you give him any thing - A. He answered first; I gave him two shillings and sixpence after the answers, I paid him. He then took a slate, and drew some figures on the slate, and when he had drawed the figures, he signified I might possibly see my wife on the 1st of November; if I did not see her on that day, he thought I should see her at the latter end of that month: and if I did not see her at the latter end of that month, he thought I never should see her again. When he had answered me them questions, I gave him two shillings and sixpence; he gave me a hand bill to recommend him customers. This is the hand bill.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to apprehend this man at 64, Queen-street. I found in his apartments two slates, and these books, I now produce for casting nativities; these are the two slates, and the books. I also found a number of letters with questions in them to be answered; this frame I now produce he called a perpetual motion at the office; it appears to be for the purpose of drawing lines on a slate. Plank and Jeffereys were with me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord and gentleman of the jury, this is a very unjust prosecution. I had for many years dropped the business of astrology; by no means answering any thing, when I did, it was down right distress made me do it, and for want of bread for my family. I have now a wife out of her mind, and a child only nine years old; a twelvemonth ago two children were left upon me by a relation that died, and left his wife in great distress, now they are all in distress together. My poor child came yesterday evening to me, and told me every thing was gone, and yesterday she had only a pennyworth of bread to exist on. As to this man, he came in and asked some questions about his wife, and I told him my opinion. He first scraped some acquaintance with me some years ago, and on account of old acqtaintance, he asked me some questions about his wife; I told him I did not pretend to predict any thing. He laid on the ground two shillings and sixpence. I told him I did not look for any money; he would leave it; he said, it was all the money he had. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181411300065"></xptr>insisted upon his taking back a shilling; no said he, as you are so generous to give me back a shilling, I s will do it in your lottery. I told him that was a thing I by no means did do now, I had suffered before. I asked for no money; it was a thing I by no means wished to do for any body.</p>

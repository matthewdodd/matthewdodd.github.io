                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Attree, and live in New-street, New Kent-road. The prisoner lived almost opposite me, in the front room down stairs—Mary Castle lived with him, and passed as his wife—she went by the name of Mrs. Lovett—the prisoner is a coster<lb></lb>monger, and she went out with cat's meat—on the 14th of March, about half-past five o'clock in the evening, I was standing at my door, at needle<lb></lb>work, and saw Mrs. Lovett come up the street with her dog's-meat barrow from her work—I saw her go into her own passage, and directly I heard the prisoner ask a woman if she would meet him at seven o'clock—I am sure it was his voice, I have known him ever since he was a little boy—I cannot tell who he addressed—it was a woman in the house, but I could not hear the woman reply—I heard Mrs. Lovett say to him, "Can't I meet you at seven o'clock? I think I am the fittest person to meet you"—the prisoner made use of very bad expressions, and said, "No"—he ran down stairs—I cannot say whether Mrs. Lovett caught hold of him, but I heard her say to him, "Stop, I want to speak to you"—the prisoner answered, "I don't want to speak to you, nor neither will I be with you"—I then heard a struggle ensue, and in about a minute I heard Mrs. Lovett call out, "Help, help, for God's sake, for he has kicked my eye out;" and then she said, "Oh, help, pray open my eye"—I went opposite the door, and looked into the passage, with other neighbours, and saw her down on the floor, and the prisoner standing over her in the passage down stairs, but not ill-treating her—he was trying to get loose from her, but she was holding him by the coat, and in the struggle to get away from her, he pulled her up on her feet—they struggled till he came to the door, and then he pulled himself out of her band, and went up the street as fast as he could go—I saw no more of him—I saw no blows struck by either of them—when he was gone Mrs. Lovett would have fallen, but I caught her in my arms, took her into the room, and sat her down on a chair—her eye was very much swollen and closed, and the lower part of her face, on the left side, very much bruised—there was a little blood, but that proceeded from her mouth and nose—I washed her face and eye, but it was impossible to open her eye—she appeared perfectly sober, but they were both very much ad<lb></lb>dicted to drinking—he appeared very sober—they were very bad friends, on account of a woman she had taken in out of compassion—I did not attend the deceased further than going and asking how she did—Dean, who came to lodge in the house about a fortnight afterwards, attended her—the surgeon was not called in for some time—I frequently saw her—she kept her bed—she was not able to get up the next day, and she was scarcely able to get up on Saturday—the prisoner did not come back again—I saw him at Union-hall on the Monday when she got a warrant for him, and they went to Union-hall on the Thursday following—I had seen him go down the street in the mean time, but not into the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I live opposite the prisoner. I was at my bed<lb></lb>room window on the 14th of March—it looks on the back of the prisoner's premises—about half-past five or six o'clock that evening I looked out, and heard the prisoner say to the woman up stairs, "I will meet yon at seven o'clock"—Mrs. Lovett answered, "Don't meet her, meet me, I am the most right to be met"—the prisoner rushed down stairs, and struck her—she was standing at the back door in the yard—I could hear him fly down stairs—he struck her somewhere about the face, and she fell—I saw him go to kick her—I could see him in the posture going to kick her, and I heard him use a very bad expression, and say, "I will do for you"—she rose herself up by him, as well as she could, and dragged herself into the passage, and I did not see any more—I heard her cry out, "For God's sake, help me"—when I first saw him he was close to her—I saw him strike her—I did not see her strike him—she did not—they were both in a passion—I did not hear her say any thing about another woman—I saw the other woman come out afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I was called in to see Mrs. Lovett on the 25th of March, about a fortnight after the transaction—I found her suffering under erysipelas, chiefly about the face and head—the face was very much distended, and swollen dreadfully—she was unable to see from the erysipelas—there was a bruise about the eye—my attention was called to the right eye, but the bruise had then ceased to make any appearance, in consequence of the enlarged state of the head from the erysipelas—I applied all the remedies I conceived to be necessary, poultices, fomentation, and such things, and she became convalescent, I almost thought; but four or five days afterwards another attack of erysipelas came on on the right arm, and then on her left leg, where there had been evidently a very violent blow given—in the left ancle—these symptoms continued increasing, sometimes disappearing and forming again, till at last it brought on an affection of the brain, of which she died—the leg became gangrenous—it brought on an effusion on the brain—there was gangrene, independent of an abscess, just below the tumour formed on the ancle—she died on the 80th of April—I opened the body—the brain was extremely congested and inflamed, and a great quantity of water effused on the brain—that was the immediate cause of death—that was the result of irritation from erysipelas—the erysipelas was no doubt caused by the injuries inflicted—there was severe injury on the face, on one shoulder and on one leg bruises or contusions—I should say all of them together were the cause, none of them in particular causing it—under a constitution like hers, erysipelas would be likely to follow injury—the erysipelas I first discovered was on the face—I saw the injury on the leg at that time, but under all attacks of erysipelas the face is the part first affected—I should think erysipelas would not arise from her drunken habits independent of the injury, but it is possible—I could not tell how long the injury on the leg had existed—I should judge from the appear<lb></lb>ances that the erysipelas had existed about four or five days, certainly not longer—I think naturally she was a very healthy woman, but from drunken habits her constitution was broken down—I should say erysipelas would be four or five days, or a week, coming on after the injury.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Having heard the injuries were sustained on the 14th of March, can you be certain they were the cause of the erysipelas? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have no doubt in my own mind that the erysipelas was the result of the injury, not the least—I speak of the appearances of erysipelas in all parts of the body, all arising from the external injury—when it once begins it travels about from place to place—it very frequently arises without any external injury——drunken habits would no doubt cause it, but there being external injury, I have no doubt that was the cause—had she been more temperate those injuries would have produced any thing but erysipelas—they would have produced a sort of healthy inflammation.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I should not think it was a very recent wound—it was muchl onger than a fortnight—I should think it was not so recent as the wound on the head—the one on the ancle was the most serious part of the injury—it had penetrated through the whole of the joint, which must have produced very great irritation in the system—erysipelas would be most likely to attack the part which had been previously injured—that wound itself would not have produced erysipelas, it must have been the result of more recent in<lb></lb>jury—the erysipelas first commenced in the head—erysipelas in the leg did not make its appearance for two or three weeks after I saw her—the wound in the leg could not have caused the erysipelas in the face.</p>

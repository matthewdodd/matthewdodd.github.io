                  </hi>I am proprietor of the Victoria ale and stout stores, St. James's-street, Lower Marsh-street, Lambeth—at 8 o'clock on Tuesday night, April 3d, I was in St. James's-street—I was going home and was within five doors of my own house—the prisoner came up to me and asked me which was Somerset-street—I said, "I don't know, go away"—at this time I saw two other men standing on the other side of the road—I turned to go into my house, when the prisoner tripped me up, put his arm round me and said, "I've got you now; come on, come on"—I couldn't get up</p>

               <p>till two neighbours came to my assistance—the prisoner took my watch—a policeman came up when he heard me call "Police!"—I have not recovered my watch—I was not much hurt, but a little shaken—I called out, "Police," and "Stop thief!"—my head was hurt against the wall in failing; my hand was also a little hurt, I have a mark on it—I saw the prisoner running—I afterwards saw him in custody at the station—I know him to be the same man; I have no doubt at all about it.</p>

I am a widow, and live at 25, Princes-street, Lower Marsh, Lambeth—a little after eight o'clock on April 3d I was sitting in my front room, and heard cries of "Police!"—I came out and saw the prose<lb></lb>cutor lying on the payment and three young ruffians scampering away from him—another neighbour came up and helped to pick him up—he said that his watch was gone—the boys went in different directions—they separated from the prisoner—I don't know the prisoner, it was too dark to see his face.</p>

About eight o'clock on the night of April 3d I was on duty in Lower Marsh, and heard cries of "Police!" in St. James's-street—I saw the prosecutor down upon his back and the prisoner kneeling on him—as soon as they saw me, which was when I was about ten yards from them, they all started off in different directions—I pursued the prisoner—he ran up the street and into the Olive Branch—as he ran in at one door I ran to the other and caught him at the door as he was coming out—whilst securing him he passed something to another man and said, "Take that"—that man then turned round and ran away immediately—I took the prisoner to the station—Mr. Ball came there and identified him—I didn't lose sight of the prisoner, except when he was in at one door and I ran to the other.</p>

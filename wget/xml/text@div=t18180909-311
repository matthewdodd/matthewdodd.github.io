               <p>SECOND COUNT, the same, only stating her intent to be to deprive one Hannah Hall, a person having the lawful care and charge of the said child, of the possession of it.</p>
               <p>HANNAH HALL. I live at Mr. Fairfax's. in Hosier-lane, and <rs id="t18180909-311-viclabel1713" type="occupation">sell fruit in the street</rs>

The prisoner came up to me with a little girl about seven years old - She asked the price of my fruit, and then asked if my name was Lindsay; I said, No. She said she knew a poor woman of that name whom she wished to employ, and asked if I went out to work. I said I was glad to do any thing; my child was in my arms, his name is Thomas - He was then nine months old. She then took me to a cook-shop, and treated me with a dinner; she and the little girl eat with me. While we were in the shop, she asked me to fetch her a bundle from Mr. Smith's, No. 35, Oakley-street, Lambeth; she gave me 1s. to go, and said she would take care of my child while I was gone. I left my child with her in the cook-shop, which was near the Horse Guards. I went to No. 35, Oakley-street - I could find no such person, nor could I hear any thing of the prisoner. I returned to the cook-shop, the prisoner and my child were both gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the girl, who was with the prisoner, appear sensible - A. Yes; I had bills printed, describing my child and the prisoner, and made my loss as public as possible. I heard nothing of it till about two months after; when Mr. Betts took me to Aylesbury prison, where I saw the prisoner with three others; I immediately knew her to be the woman. I afterwards saw my child with six more children, about the same age, and knew my own immediately. Mr. Betts brought the girl to town with him, who was with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not find your child better dressed and better fed, than when it was with you - A. Yes; I found by the neighbours that she had behaved very well to it-this is the child which I have in my arms.</p>
               <p>JOHN LEGATE. I am a waiter at a cook-shop at Charing-cross. I remember the prosecutrix being there with a woman and little a girl, she had the child in her arms. She afterwards returned and complained of losing her child - I cannot swear to the woman.</p>

            . I am overseer of the parish of Wootton; the prisoner lived there with her husband, who is a bricklayer - They never had a child. In July last, she came to Wootton with a child about eight or nine months old; in consequence of an advertisement, I went to her about the child. She said it was her's, and that she was delivered of it on the 7th of July; she said she was taken unwell in her journey to town, and when she got to town, she was delivered of it. I knew her before, and understood that she was pregnant before she left. I took the little girl, who lived with her, to Mrs. Hall, in town; I then took Mrs. Hall to Wootton, and showed her the child in Aylesbury gaol. I showed her the child with six others, and she immediately knew her own.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been married twenty-three years, and have a good character. I did not take the child with intent to steal it; I treated it very kind, and meant to return it to its mother.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I slept in London on 18th March. I took a lodging at King's Cross, and about April I bought this ticket for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and got the watch out from Brown's, in Cranbourne Court. I pledged it again in September, at Mr. Vaughan's. I used to use Mr. Hopkins' house, and I thought he was still in the public line. I was quite surprised when this charge was brought against me. I left the Military Train with a good character.</p>

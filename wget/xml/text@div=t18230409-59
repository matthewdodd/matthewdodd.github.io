On some night in March last, about nine o'clock at night, I was down in the kitchen; I heard the street door bang; I ran up and missed the clock out of the front parlour; I had been there about half an hour before, but did not notice it. The front door was fast when I left the parlour; nobody had been out for three or four hours before. I immediately went down to the watch-house and found the clock - a small red trunk, a tea pot, and cream jug. The trunk contained the other articles as stated in the indictment. I had seen them all safe about two o'clock that afternoon. The trunk was in the bed-room on the same floor as the parlour. The cream jug and tea pot were in the front parlour, the window of which was open, there is a palisade before the door.</p>

            . On the night of the 26th of March, I was in Spring-street, about nine o'clock and saw two men standing on the middle of the street. At that moment a man came out of Mrs. Johnson's door with something, (I do not know what it was.) The men ran across to him, and with an oath told him to make haste. They joined him and went down Spring-street, and down York-place. The servant came out calling watch; I directed the watchman which way they were gone; they had passed close me, and to the best of my belief the prisoner is the man who came out of the house, he had a long dark blue coat, but I can not speak to his face. It was dark.</p>

            . I am the watchman of Spring-street. On the 26th of March, about nine o'clock in the evening, when I was in York-street, I heard the call of watch; I went into Paddington-street, and saw a hackney-coach moving on; and just as I overtook it, it stopped, as one of the springs gave way. Another coach was close by the side of it; I went between the two coaches with my lanthorn; both the doors were open. There were four men in the coach which had broken down; two of them got into the other coach, the third man went off, and the fourth was the prisoner; he had a clock in his hand. I was holding my lanthorn up, he said,</p>
               <p>"Watchman I don't want a light, thank you." He was going to hand the clock to the coachman of the coach which had been called, I said,</p>
               <p>"I will hand that in myself if you please." I took it from his hand and kept it, and when he got out himself and was getting into the other coach, I collared him; he asked why I did that. I said, I had information that a clock was stolen, and suspected him; he said it was his own, and that he was a clock-maker by trade. I put the clock into the coach and sprang my rattle; but on taking him towards the pavement he struggled; gave a turn and both his coats came off. I dropped them and seized him round the body and sprang my rattle; the watchman came; one of the other men were taken, and both taken to the watch-house. I searched the prisoner and found a small red trunk in his pocket, and also a tea pot and cream jug, fourpence halfpenny and two duplicates. The other man was not detained. I gave the property up at the watch-house, the prosecutrix claimed it before it was out of my sight, I know that produced to be the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Why was the other discharged - A. I do not know; there was a mistake about it. The prisoner said they were his own property; not that they were given him to take care of.</p>

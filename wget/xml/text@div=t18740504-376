I am a tailor, living at Great Stanmore—on Easter Monday, 6th April, between 4 and 5 o'clock I was at the Vine public-house—I went into the parlour and saw several men there—the deceased was among them—there were twenty or thirty persons—the deceased appeared to be sober—he might have had something to drink, being holiday time—as I was coming out of the parlour door into the passage I turned round and saw the prisoner and Aldridge behind me—they made use of bad language to each other—I saw them go out of the passage into the front of the house, between the trough and the front door; they commenced fight<lb></lb>ing—I can't say who gave the first blow—they had a round, I believe, and hugged each other, and they parted, or some one parted them—and Aldridge walked towards the door that leads into the Vine, and Poole stood down by the trough—I did not see any fall before they parted; they got each other over the horse-trough, the back over the trough—Aldridge, I believe, was under, and Poole at the top—when Aldridge walked to wards, the Vine he got as far as the front of the door, and some one spoke to him—I don't know who, and the prisoner made a rush at Aldridge and struck him in the right side of the face, on the jaw—it was a heavy-blow—Aldridge fell down, and the back of his head fell on the doorstep—I saw him lifted up, and he seemed insensible.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 194, Blackfriars Road—I was called in to attend the deceased, at 40, Hatfield Street, on 8th August, virtually it was on the 7th, it was half-an-hour after midnight—he was in bed, partly unconscious, very restless, scarcely able to answer any questions—I concluded that he was suffering from inflammation of the brain, we treated him for that—I saw him again next day in company with Dr. Payne,. a physician—he was then very much worse—he died on Thursday, the 9th—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—there were no marks of external injury—the whole of the organs of the body were perfectly healthy, he did not die from any disease of the organs—on removing the scalp, we found a large quantity of <hi rend="italic">pus</hi> effused between the membranes of the brain, and the brain itself, quite sufficient to account for the death—a severe fall on a hard substance would produce the indications I saw—there was no injury to the, skull itself—it was the shock and the inflammation it excited—there was no depression of the bone, no fracture of the skull, merely a violent inflammation set up in the membranes covering the brain—a blow would cause some depression at the moment, and that would cause the inflammation.</p>

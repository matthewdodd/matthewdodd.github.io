            . I am a wheelwright, I live in Pump-court, Perkins's-rents. I was employed to make a cart for Mr. Hibbert, Mr. Hibbert was to find the springs for his cart. Bureau came to my shop, and told me he had a pair of springs to dispose off. I told Mr. Hibbert; he went to Bureau, and gave three pounds ten shillings for the springs, and they were put on Mr. Hibbert's cart. My apprentice brought them to my shop; he is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of these springs that you applied to Mr. Hibbert's cart - A. I was ordered to take them off. I took them off, and they were taken to Queen-square office. I have no doubt they are the same springs that came from Bureau; I cannot swear it.</p>

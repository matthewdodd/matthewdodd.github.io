                  </hi>. I live at 6, East-street, Chelsea, and am a mason's labourer—on Saturday, 28th December, about 3 o'clock, I was in Mr. Crowther's kitchen—the prisoner was there, and my brother-in-law, Pratt, and Mr. Francis—my brother-in-law was going to strike the prisoner—Gibbs said, "He has insulted me before," and made a hit at him—they then went into the yard, and Mr. Crowther came in and told the prisoner to put the horse in the cart—we stood at the gate, and Mr. Crowther asked me if I would have something to drink—we went to a public-house; he stood a quartern of rum—I said in the public-house, "I will go and take my brother-in-law away; I did so—I got him out, and we went into Bond-street, and met the prisoner and Francis—Pratt said, "That is the man that insulted me;" that was Gibbs—Gibbs took him by the shoulders, and began shaking him—I got up to them, and Gibbs let go—I passed between them, and Gibbs came before me and hit my brother-in-law on the mouth, and knocked him down—I did not see him struck, but I heard the blow, and looked round and saw my brother-in-law lying down in the road—a man helped me to pick him up and set him on the kerb—his head dropped down, and he was bleeding from the nose and mouth—the prisoner and Francis walked away—I took the deoeased home to my place, which was about half a dozen yards off, and sent for Mr. Daniels, the doctor, who came in about three-quarters of an hour—the deceased lay on the sofa in my back parlour—he never spoke afterwards—he died on the following Sunday afternoon, between 3 and 4.</p>

                  </hi>. I have retired from business, and live at 70, King's-road, Chelsea—on this day I was coming along Bond-street, with my wife, about 4 o'clock, and heard a little bit of a wrangling; very little—I saw the prisoner knock the deceased down with his fist into the road—he fell back<lb></lb>wards, and his head sounded as if his skull was smashed—it was like the smashing of a large flower-pot—two men picked him up; he was bleeding at the mouth and side of the head—he was senseless—I followed the prisoner to see if I could see a policeman to give him in charge, but could not find one.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>together—the quarrel was about a pipe—the prisoner said to the deceased, "That pipe don't belong to you"—he said, "No, nor to you; when they want it let them fetch it"—they had a few words, and the prisoner caught hold of the deceased—he said, "Don't handle me, and I will let go"—I was talking to the deceased's brother-in-law when the prisoner struck him—I helped to pick him up—the deceased was intoxicated; it was as much as he could do to walk before he was struck—the pavement was not slippery from frost—I saw the blow; it was on the mouth—it was not particularly heavy—I did not stop to see whether it was bleeding.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

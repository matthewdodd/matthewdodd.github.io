On Wednesday, 31st Oct., the prisoner came to our shop, between 7 and 8 o'clock, nearer 7 than 8—she wished to look at a mantle—I showed her several—she selected one at 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and presented a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in payment—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I passed it to Miss Payne to be handed to Mr. Bick<lb></lb>ley, who was at the desk—he called me to him, and in consequence of what he said, I went to the prisoner and asked if she had any smaller change—she said she had not—I then asked her name and address—she gave me "Mary Ann Cox, No. 5, Union-street, Borough-road," which I wrote on the back of the note in her presence—I find that on this note there is also the name of Pawson and Co.—I saw that at the time—they are persons carrying on a large business in St. Paul's churchyard—finding that the pri<lb></lb>soner had no change, I again sent the note to Mr. Bickley by Miss Payne—she returned with the change, and gave it to the prisoner—I packed up the mantle in brown paper, and the prisoner left with it—the note was brought back, stamped "forged," on the Monday following—it is customary for persons in business to put their names upon notes in their possession—seeing Pawson and Co. upon this note led me to suppose it had passed through their hands.</p>

On Thurs<lb></lb>day, 1st Nov., about 9 o'clock in the morning, when I got to business, I saw a parcel on the counter directed to Mrs. Cox, Union-street—I took the parcel there—I inquired for Mrs. Cox, and the prisoner came into the pas<lb></lb>sage, and then showed me into a small room—I said I had brought the parcel that she had purchased the previous evening—she then gave me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I examined it, and saw W. Bowman, of Woolwich, on the back, and I think the name of Pawson and Co.—this is the note—I had not been in the shop on the previous evening when the prisoner tendered the note—I said. I had not change with me, but if she would allow me, I would send her change in about half an hour—I was about to return with the parcel and the note, when the prisoner said, "Oh! no, you are not going to take the parcel as well as the note"—I said that she might depend upon having the change, as ours was a respectable house, and I gave her one of our cards—after some little hesitation, she allowed me to take both the note and the parcel—she told me she had received the note from a sailor who had been sleeping with her for three nights, and that he had sailed for the Crimea—I returned to the shop with the note and the parcel, and sent it to the Bank by the apprentice; it was returned, marked "forged"—I am sure this is the note, the apprentice's writing is on the back—about an hour after this, the prisoner came to Mr. Baker's shop—she said she bad come for the change of the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note that she had given me—I presented the note to her, saying it was a forged one—she said she believed it was a good one, and it was given to her by a sailor—I said as she doubted it being a bad one, she had better go with me to the inspector, and he would prove that the note was a forged one—she said, "You had better send for the inspector; let him come here"—I then went to the police station, a sergeant came back with me, and the prisoner and I went with him to the station—I left the prisoner there, and the note—I did not give her in charge—she informed the inspector where she obtained the note.</p>

I know the prisoner, she lodged with me from five to six weeks, and left on 31st Oct., between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening, to the best of my knowledge—she packed up her things to go, she had very trifling to pack up—she did not pay me what was owing—I told her previously to leave, and she said she would go in the evening—I told her to go, because I did not like her conduct—she did not go out that day until she left in the evening—she in an unfortunate woman—she had no key, she had to knock at the door to get in—she had no means of letting herself in—she slept in the house the three nights previous to the 31st Oct.—I do not know whether any sailor kept her company those three nights—there was a person there, I do not know whe<lb></lb>ther he was a sailor or not—there was a person with her two nights to my knowledge—he might have been there the third night—I have no servant—two other young women lodged in the house besides the prisoner—I used to open the door at night, no one opened it in the day time—when there was nobody there they went out by themselves.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you asked by either of these gentlemen (<hi rend="italic">the solicitors for the prosecution</hi>) about anybody having slept in the house for</p>

               <p>one, two, or three nights before the prisoner left you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I was not—I remember the prisoner coming to me on the morning of 1st Nov.—she had not slept in my house on the night of 31st Oct.—I met her in Union-street on the Thursday morning about 10 o'clock—she told me that she was com<lb></lb>ing down to my house to meet a gentleman who was going to take her on the water—I gave her permission to do so, and she came home and waited in the kitchen with me—after she had been there some time, a gentleman came, I think it was Mr. Scott, the witness—he asked for Mrs. Cox—I called her, and she came to him—I did not remain in the room with them, I did not know their business—Mr. Scott left first, the prisoner only staid a very little while after him, about a quarter of an hour—she then went away, and I saw no more of her until she was in custody—I do not know a man named Charlton—I never heard of him—on the Thursday morning, when the prisoner came, she showed me a note, she told me her friend had given it to her—I looked at it, I did not know but that it was a good one—I am no judge of notes—I saw that it was a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—she never said anything to me about a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, except that once—she never at any time, spoke to a second 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was lodging with Mrs. Cooper about six weeks; she charged me 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and if I sent for any refreshment she charged me double for it; the gentleman that gave me the note, Mr. Charlton, I met three weeks previous to his coming to my place, and went with him to the Victoria theatre; he had another sailor with him; he asked me for my address, and said he would call and see me, and asked if there were any more young ladies in the house; this was on Wednesday night; on Sunday he called while I was out, and a friend with him; he asked Mrs. Cooper where I was; she said I was out for a walk; she asked them into the kitchen, and they sent for a pot of beer and half a pint of gin, and they and the man that was living with Mrs. Cooper, drank it together; he left a message that he would call on me again on Monday morning, and before I was up on Monday morn<lb></lb>ing, Mrs. Cooper came up to my room, and asked if I knew a gentleman pitted with the small pox; I had rather forgotten him, and it being night when I saw him, I did not know whether he was marked with the small pox or not, but the man was close at her heels. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> A man did call for her on the Sunday, I let him in, and had some drink with him when she was out for a walk—I took the man up to her room on the Monday, and left him there with her—I cannot tell whether it was the same man that came on the Monday and Tuesday—he called again after the Monday, and asked if the was in; I said no, but she was sure to be in the Westminster-road—he said he would call again the next night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He said he would be a friend to me while he was in town, but he did not act as he ought, because he did not give me sufficient money, and I was obliged to pawn my things; he said he would make it up before he went to the Crimea; he gave me his name as Charlton.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is all that she has put to you true? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> About leaving the lodging, do you mean to say that nothing more passed than, in the morning, you said you wished she would go? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and then in the afternoon she went—the Wednesday was not the end of her week—I did not expect her to come back again—I told her not to come back any more—she did not pay me what was due to me—nothing was said about payment—I told her to leave—that was not at all in conse<lb></lb>quence of anything suspicious that I saw about the man who had been there for the two nights—she was in the habit of coming home very tipsy, and</p>

CHARLTON</hi>, he gave his name as such, was conti<lb></lb>nually coming to see me; he told me he would make me a present of a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note before he went to sea; on Wednesday evening he said, "I shall make you a present of a dress; I shall not leave you more than a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, because I am short of money;" his friend said, "If you find a dress I will find a cloak; I have no small money; you must change a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note;" I first went with the note to buy the dress; they both went with me to Ludgate-hill, and stood outside while I bought it; I brought it out, and he asked me for the change, and I gave him the change of the first 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note; both the gen<lb></lb>tlemen had called at Mrs. Cooper's on the previous evening, and I went out with them, and we went and had some tea together; they waited outside where I bought the cloak, and when I came outside he asked me for the change, and I gave him the change; he said he would give it me all, but he was going to get a suit of clothes that he had been paying off; he asked me where I should meet him in about an hour's time, and we appointed to meet at the Cross Keys, at the bottom of Blackfriars-bridge; he said, "You may as well go and get your dress, as you are on this side of the water," and he handed me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and said, "I shall want this changed; the other one said, "You will get me some flannel to make some flannel shirts;" I selected six yards of flannel, and a yard of body linen for the dress; the young man asked me if I had no smaller change; I had not one farthing and I said, "I must trouble you for change;" he said, "I will send it you in the morning;" I said, "That will do;" I can assure you that my landlady and I had had no words whatever about leaving the lodging, or anything of the kind, and I only owed her 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; I went to the shop, and selected the dress, and it was to come next morning at 11 o'clock; when I went home at night I met this party, and went to the Canterbury Hall with him; he had a parcel of new clothes; I went home about half past 12 o'clock; Mrs. Cooper, being very tipsy, never answered me; she had served me the same trick before; I went to the Westminster-road, and took a bed at a coffee shop; I went next morning to Mrs. Cooper's, and met her in Union-street; she said, "You never came home last night;" I said, "I did, but you would not open the door;" she said, "I had too much with your friends last night;" I said, "Has any one called for me this morning?" she said, "No, child, there has not;" that was the way she generally spoke to the lodgers; I went into the kitchen; the sailor went along with me, and Mrs. Cooper and the man that lives with her were there also; the sailor was there when the parcel came, and Mrs. Cooper knows the same; he left me that day, and I have never seen him since; he told me he was going to the Crimea; Mrs. Cooper never told me anything about leaving, or I should not have had my dress sent there; I had told her about a week before, that if she could not let me have the back room, I should leave; I had told her when I first went that 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week was more than I could pay, but I had no idea of leaving.</p>

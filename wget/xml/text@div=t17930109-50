               <p>I am a soldier in the third regiment of foot guards, a private; I saw the prisoner at my quarters with the pots, on Saturday the 15th of December, at the Horse shoe and Magpye, Middle-row, Holborn; I never saw him before in my life till that time; I suppose he came about seven o'clock, or there abouts; he was in the tap room; he began to be obstreperous in the house, and he dropped some pots; I went with him to Mr. Smith, and there was one pint pot and a quart pot produced to Mr. Smith; but I cannot tell who produced them; he said, they were his property; but I cannot say that he said the prisoner stole them; I know nothing more except there was a scuffle ensued in bringing him along, and there was a pint pot found at my landlord's, it was found after I was escorting the man home to Mr. Smith's; how that pint pot came there at his side I don't know.</p>

               <p>I am a painter by trade; the prisoner came into the house with a view to have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179301090078"></xptr>something to drink, it was at the Horse shoe, Middle-row; but whether he had or had not I know not; I heard somebody call for a pint, but whether it was him or no I cannot say; he moved himself from the place where he first seated himself down, to an upper box, and afterwards he seated himself at the lower end; by moving himself this quart pot fell out of his apron, the pot fell down, I catched it on the road; I took it up and asked him how that pot came there? he damned my eyes, and said, it was one of my pots, thinking I was the landlord of the house; I told him it was a mistake, and he threatened to strike me; now, says I, if I find you are a pot stealer I will not let you go; the soldier came up and asked what was the matter; says I, this man is a pot stealer; says the soldier, he shall not affront you; we took him away to where the pot directed, and in the scuffle the pint pot dropped from him afterward.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the pot go with him? - I took neither him nor the pot, the young woman picked it up afterward, and the quart pot the soldier took to Mr. Smith's house.</p>
               <p>Court to Ewer. Did you carry a quart pot there? - I did not carry the quart pot there; but I was along with the people that did; who did carry it I cannot say, for there was a good many of us.</p>
               <p>Court to Cadwell. Did you deliver the pot to the soldier? - I did.</p>
               <p>Court to Ewer. Did you receive the pot of Mr. Cadwell? - I did not; I saw another man receive it, and I saw it carried to Mr. Smith, and it was the same pot.</p>
               <p>Court to Cadwell. What was the name on the pot? - Smith.</p>

            What was the sign? - The sign of the cook.</p>
               <p>Court to Smith. Was you at home when these people came? - I was at home when the prisoner first came.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was the prisoner at your house that day? - He had been about three quarters of an hour from the time they brought him back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see a pot at that time? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now when the pot was brought back how do you know that quart pot was your's? - I know it by my own name, and I know it by my own sign.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been a publican? - Many years; the man confessed to myself in Gaol; when I took him to the compter he cried and said, it was the first time he ever did such a thing in his life; I desired him to confess it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never saw the pot, it was taken from under the table, I kicked my foot rather against it, this gentleman took it up and looked at it and said, it did not belong to the house, I must have brought it in; I never saw the pot till it was taken from under the table; I work with my father at carpentering.</p>

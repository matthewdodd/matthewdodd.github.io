                  </hi>. I am a clothes salesman, and live in Monmouth-street I had three tame fowls on the 31st of May, which I saw safe in my back kitchen, about eleven o'clock at night—I missed them at half-past five o'clock next morning, and found them at a bird shop, kept by Carr, in the next street, in a cupboard at the top of the house, between two rooms—I have had them twelve months, and know them to be mine—I do not know the prisoner—he is a stranger to me—the back kitchen was left open that night—the back of Carr's premises is about five houses off mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father in James-street, New Cut. Between five and six o'clock in the morning, I was coming down St. An<lb></lb>drew-street, and heard a noise in the passage of No. 29—I looked into the passage and saw the prisoner—I had seen him about before—he had three fowls in his hand by the legs—they were alive, and one was hallooing—I waited at the door till he came down, and asked what he was doing—he said they had got away from him, and he went over the wall after them—he spoke of them as his own fowls—he asked me to lend him 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. till he sold them—I would not—I saw the fowls afterwards at the office, and they appeared to be the same.</p>

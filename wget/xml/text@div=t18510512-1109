                  </hi>. I am a widow. On Saturday, 5th April, between one and two o'clock, I left the service of Mr. Skurry, of 7, Denbigh-place, Pimlico, and received half a sovereign, three shillings, and fourpence in halfpence, for my wages, which were 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I received them monthly—I removed my two trunks the same day, and took them to 1, Ann-place, Kensington-mews, Knightsbridge, where I had a friend living—she was not at home—I left my boxes there, and pro<lb></lb>ceeded across the Park to see a friend in Lisson-grove; but I altered my mind, as I had not seen them a long time, and thought I might be dis<lb></lb>appointed, and find them out—I turned back, and sat down in the Park some time; but as I was going through Knightsbridge, between seven and eight in the evening, I went up to the female prisoner, who was selling things there, and asked her if she could be kind enough to tell me of any respectable person where I could lodge for one night, as I did not wish to be out late—she called a woman, named Mrs. Jewell, and told her to take me home, and provide for me, and make me comfortable, as I could sleep with her—I went with Mrs. Jewell to 2, Exeter-place, which is near Sloane-street—I had my tea there with Mrs. Jewell and the male prisoner; after that, I sat conversing with Mrs. Jewell—after some little time, the man left the room—after that, I asked Mrs. Jewell to allow me to go to bed, as I felt very sleepy and tired—she told me I could go, and I laid down on the bed in my clothes—there was a little boy in the bed—it was then half-past eleven, as near as possible</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185105120046"></xptr>
               <p>—there was only Mrs. Jewell and the child in the room; Mrs. Jewell remained in the room while I was awake—it was the kitchen, and there was a fire—when I was between asleep and awake, I felt a hand feeling me—I felt irritated and frightened, and looked up, and saw it was the male prisoner—I was going to give an alarm, and he told me if I gave any alarm, or showed any resistance, he would smash my b—brains out—my purse was in ray pocket when I went to bed—I did not observe Mrs. Jewell standing in the room at the instant, for I was irritated, and very much frightened—there was a candle in the room—the male prisoner took the purse from my pocket, and concealed it in his bosom; I saw it in his hand—he then went and stood behind the door—the female prisoner then came to the door—she could not exactly get in, as he was standing behind it—he said, "Halloo!" and she instantly burst the door open, threw in her basket before her, flew at me, and struck me violently in the face, gave me two black eyes, and she called me all the b—w—she could possibly name—she was coming to strike me again—I put up my left hand to defend myself—she found she could not do exactly as she wished, and she turned round and seized Mrs. Jewell, who was close behind her, by the hair of her head, and jammed her backwards and forwards—she stood almost exactly between the two door-posts—she shoved her down on the floor, and pushed her knees into the pit of her stomach—her left hand was still entangled in her hair—she dragged her up from the floor again by main force, and her left hand seemed <hi rend="italic">dislocated</hi> from her hair, and she threw her down with full force on the back of her head—her head made a dreadful noise against the floor—I never saw her move afterwards—the female prisoner was beating her two or three minutes—the male prisoner was standing close to her all the while—he stood still, he did not say anything, and never offered to prevent the female doing it—the female prisoner used low language to Mrs. Jewell, the same as she used to me—I gave an alarm, and the landlord and two other persons came in—as soon as footsteps were heard coming, the male prisoner commenced beating his wife—I walked out as quick as possible into the street, and made a complaint to two young men, who were standing outside—I left my bonnet and cap behind me—at seven o'clock I went to Mrs. Miller's, where I had left my boxes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I examined the body of Caroline Jewell, on the Wednesday or Thursday after the death—compres<lb></lb>sion of the brain was the cause of death—there was lesion of one of the vessels of the brain—castiog on the floor, or beating and struggling, and a blow of the head struck on the floor, would be likely to produce that injury—the body in other respects presented a healthy appearance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were there any external marks of violence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was a slight wound on the bridge of the nose; that had nothing to do with her death; she died of concussion of the brain, and compression after<lb></lb>wards—concussion would bring the blood to bear too heavily on particular vessels—there was extravasation of blood at the back of the head—there was no external violence that accounted for the lesion of the vessel—I found nothing to denote she was of intemperate habits—she was well formed and healthy, not attenuated in the slightest degree—there was no appearance of ill-usage except the injury in question.</p>

                  </hi>. Susannah Blanchfield was in my service, and left on 5th April, between one and two o'clock, when I paid her 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a months' wages—she had been in my service since 22nd Dec., and twice before, about twelve months altogether.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 1, Ann's-place, Kensington-mews, and am a widow. I have known Blanchfield about five years—on this Saturday even<lb></lb>ing I was out at work, and when I returned I found some boxes, which were afterwards claimed by Mrs. Blanchfield—she came on the Sunday morning, about seven o'clock—she seemed to have been very much knocked about, and in a state of stupefaction from the ill-usage—she complained to me of ill-usage—she had no bonnet or cap.</p>

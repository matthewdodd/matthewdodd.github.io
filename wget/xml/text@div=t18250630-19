            . The prisoner was brought to the watch-house; I asked if he had got the money which Mrs. Clarke said he had taken - he said he had not received it - that he had taken the receipt and note to Mr. Frazier, but he said he was busy, and he must call again. Next morning I found the prisoner crying, and I asked him what he was crying for - he then said he had received the money, and another boy persuaded him to take it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never had the money. I met Mr. Frazier coming out of his house, and he said he could not stop then to give me the money - I must come next day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an Hanoverian—my Christian name is Wilhelm in German, and William-in English—I am of a noble family in Hanover, that making it necessary to put Vonder before the surname—I have served five years in the first German hussars, and twenty-six years in the sixteenth dragoons—I was at Waterloo, and was wounded there—until Monday the 6th of this month I never saw the prisoner, to my recollection—I live at No. 12, Dover-street, Piccadilly—between two and three o'clock that day, I was engaged writing in my room—the prisoner entered, he was announced, but followed immediately himself—my servant left the room—the prisoner had a large ebony stick with him when he came in—this is it now produced—I will swear to it—he swaggered up to me, stamping the stick violently on the ground, and addressed me in these words. as near as I can recollect, "Baron Osten, I presume?"—I answered, "Yes, sir, that is my name, pray what may yours be, and what is the object of your visit?" or something to that effect—instead of giving a direct answer, he said, "Do you recollect Dr. Pridham?"—I said, "Yes, I do, but you are not Dr. Pridham"—he said, "No," stamping again the stick with violence to the ground, "but I am his friend, 'here is my card," <hi rend="italic">chucking</hi> one on the table, "I come to ask you whether you uttered language derogatory to Dr. Pridham'g character at Pratt's billiard club, and if you have said that he was a marker?"—I answered, I did not recollect that I ever actually said he was a marker, but that those reports existed, adding, I was not the only one that had circulated those reports, naming a gentleman who had done so publicly on several occasions—he then asked me, "To whom did you make that statement?"—I answered, "That is immaterial, sir; I decline answering any questions, likewise decline holding any further communication with you, and desire you will leave my room"—I then rang the bell for my servant, and on his entrance, desired him to be in attendance at the door—my servant shut the door—he had hardly left it when the prisoner said, "Were you not convinced that these reports," I think he said, "on former occasions, were groundless"—I answered, "No, sir, I never could arrive at that conviction"—the moment I gave that answer, he gave me a violent blow on the chest and throat with this stick—I then rang the bell which was near me, and the prisoner sprang forwards, placed himself before the sofa, on which there laid two Turkish sabres, and immediately inflicted a violent blow on my head, which caused the blood to flow, and stunned me a good deal—tried to grapple with him, but I was stunned and so weak that I tried ineffectually—I was reeling about, and in this state he inflicted several more blows with the thick end of this stick on my head, till at last I sunk nearly exhausted and hardly conscious on the sofa.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Compton, a police-con<lb></lb>stable—we live in Prince's-street, Lisson-grove, Paddington. The pri<lb></lb>soner came on the 28th of February, and borrowed a child's chaise of me for two hours—he was to pay 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an hour—he had had it before—in about four hours I began to be uneasy—I travelled about thirty milles, and found it at Berkhamstead—the constable had it, and the prisoner was in custody—I know the chaise to be mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am constable of Berkhamstead. The witness came to me—I made some inquiries, but could not find the chaise—I directed her to another place, and the next morning the prisoner and another sweep called on me—they asked if my chimney wanted sweeping—I said no; but I would take them to a place where the chimneys wanted sweep<lb></lb>ing—that was the Bridewell—I took them there, and the chaise which they had with them, they were locked up, and taken before the Ma<lb></lb>gistrate—the prisoner then said to the other, "Why did not you say that you had it? that would have <hi rend="italic">done</hi> her"—he had before said that he gave 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. Mr. Compton knows that it was not me that had the chaise; he looked at the other lad very hard, and then said the other one took it—I was never in the shop in my life—the other young man was working with me—he went round and brought the chaise to me at Maida-hill, and we went into the country together.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am assistant elder in the India Company's warehouses: In consequence of information that I had received, on Monday the 10th of March, I went down into the privy, where I found marks of tea spilt upon the floor; the prisoner was a labourer in the warehouses; I summoned all the labourers together, the prisoner was among them; he produced to me a quantity of tea from his breeches, secreted in a small bag; he took it out himself upon my challenging the labourers, he came forward and said he was guilty, and produced the tea; it is impossible to say whose tea it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make use of any promise, or threat, to induce him to confess? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am a young hand in the warehouses, I acknowledged that I had taken some waste tea, I did not know it was of any consequence; it was not tea answerable to the sample that was found in the privy; I have a wife and four children; I took it as waste tea; I leave it to your Lordship and the Jury.</p>

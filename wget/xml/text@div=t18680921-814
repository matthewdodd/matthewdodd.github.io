I was on duty at Harrow Wheel on the morning of 7th September, about 4 o'clock—I saw the prisoner and two other men coming from the direction of Mrs. Cross's house—the prisoner asked me for a light—he spoke in English—instead of giving him a light I detained him—the other two men ran away—I gave directions to my brother constable, and he followed them—I felt about the prisoner's clothes, and while I was doing so, he pulled out this purse, and gave it to me—there was no money in it, and I returned it to him—he said he was going to Edgeware—on the way to the station, he dropped this half crown—I picked it up and gave it to him—I searched him at the station, and found this half-crown, a sovereign, 41/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers, and some matches—I did not find any purse—I am sure this is the same purse he handed to me; I took par<lb></lb>ticular notice of it—I had obtained information that there had been a bur<lb></lb>glary committed, and I charged him with being concerned in breaking into the house of Mrs. Cross—he made no answer—I found this shawl in the directions the prisoner's companions ran, about six hours afterwards.</p>

On 6th September, I was taking care of Mrs. Cross's house, at Harrow—I fastened up the house about 9.30, before going to bed—I came down about 5.30 in the morning—I went into the sitting room, and found that the window was more than half-way open—I had a box in the room when I went to bed, containing a purse and some money—I looked at the box, and missed my purse—it contained an old guinea, and two foreign coins, and some needles—I also missed from my box half-a-sovereign,</p>

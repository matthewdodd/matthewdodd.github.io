I had twenty-five sheep on the 25th of August; I saw them on Saturday morning, the 24th of August, they were in my field, at the bottom of Harrow Town. On the Sunday morning one was gone; it was a fat sheep; I had paid three pounds for it. From ten until one o'clock, I looked all about the fields, and at last I went into a little field adjoining that of mine, there I saw a hole in the hedge, where one had been driven there, and I saw the blood where one had been killed, and I traced the dropping of the blood across another field about and hundred yards; there I traced it up a lane about a quarter of a mile, by the blood into a field where it was stripped; then I traced it by the blood from stile to stile, where it had been rested, to within a hundred yards of the prisoner Martin's house. I went to his house, he was up stairs, I said, Martin come down, I went to speak to you; he did come down, and I asked him if he had any mutton in the house, and he said, no master, I have not, and then I told the beadle to come forward with his warrant, and search, and he looked into a cupboard, and brought out a pan of fat, Martin was then going to go away; but I told him to stay where he was. Then the constable proceeded with a search, and found the heart, the liver, and the lights, and then he went up stairs and brought down a hinder quarter of mutton, a shoulder, and a whole neck, and part of a breast. Then I said to Martin, well Daniel, have you not been robbing me now? he said, master, I did not know it was your sheep, if I did, I would not have touched it on any account; and I said, Daniel, you must have had some confederate with you beside yourself, or else you never could have done it? he said, he had none. The wife said, Daniel, if you won't split, I will; the wife said, Sears was his partner. Then she said, Daniel, when you come home with the mutton, I told you you would be found out, and she fell in a fit. Then Martin said, if you go to Sears's, you will find the remainder of your sheep there. Then

Then he said, master, this is a bad job, but I must go through it, now I am in it; and then he said, come along with me, and then I will give you the mutton; he took us up stairs, and took us into the bed-room; he unlocked a door on the left hand side of his bed-room, and Martin, the beadle, went into the room, and took out a leg, loin, breast, and shoulder of mutton; that is just half the sheep. I said, Daniel, how came you to do so. I then took that mutton to Martin's, the prisoner, and then I compared that found at Sears's to that at Martin's, and I found that they both belonged to the same carcase; it was slaughtered pretly fair. I examined the fat; the trotters were not left on the carcase. One man could not have caught that sheep, and so slanghtered, and carried it that distance; it was impossible, for I am sure it weighed better than twelve stone. These men lived within two hundred yards of each other.</p>

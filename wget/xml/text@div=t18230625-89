            . I live at Bermondsey. On the 31st of May, I had been to the Royalty, and at eleven o'clock, I saw the prisoner at the corner of Rosemary-lane; he is a <rs id="t18230625-89-deflabel513" type="occupation">watchman</rs>

I said I was going to my aunt's on Tower-hill, to sleep; he said I could stop in his box if I liked, and did so. I was not drunk, but wanted to be up at four o'clock, and about half past three in the morning, we went to the Crooked Billet, public-house, and stopped there till six o'clock, for I got rather intoxicated and wanted to go home, but he took me to his house. I went to bed there, his wife awoke me about twelve o'clock, and I missed my hat - she said that somebody had taken and pawned it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not tell me to pawn it - A. Never.</p>

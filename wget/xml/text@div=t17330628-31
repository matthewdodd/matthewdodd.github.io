The fourth riffled my Pockets of a Gold Ring, a pair of Bath-metal Studs, and two Guineas It was so dark I could not see their Faces so as to know them, and therefore cannot swear to the Prisoners.

            . The Prisoner and I lodged together with Sam Quan +, who was hang'd in the Country for a Robbery about three Months ago. Sm Goodman was with us at Quan's, and about 11 at Night we went to see him home. We met the Prosecutor in one of the Streets in Covent Garden, where the Mercers live; Goodman hit him on the Shoulder, and bid him stand, and Kelly took two Guineas out of his Pocket, and drop'd them both on the Stones, I stoop'd and found one, but we lost t'other, for another Gentleman was coming by, and some Chairmen stood over the way, and saw us rob, so that we were forced to make off - Sam Goodman took a Gold Wire Ring off the Prosecutor's Finger.</p>
               <p>* Quan and Conway were try'd in London, for Robbing Job Nutton, in January 1731-2, but were acquitted. See the SESSIONS-PAPER for last Year, Numb. II. Part II. pag. 58.</p>
               <p>Court. Off his Finger, are you sure?</p>
               <p>Baker. We all reckon'd so, because it was a Ring, but we did not see where he took it from. He took a pair of Brass Studs to; as we were going away Kelly cut the Gentleman over the Eye, with the butt End of a Whip.</p>
               <p>Kelly. What time o' Night did we come into your Company?</p>
               <p>Baker. We all three lay at Quan's, and eat and drank together, and about 7 or 8 at Night, we went to

               <p>Kelly. You swore before Alderman Brocas, that the Gentleman was robb'd of 2 Guineas and a Watch, but now you know nothing of the Watch.</p>
               <p>Baker. No, I said I believ'd Goodman took his Watch, and we three said so that Night at Quan's House, and you your self spoke of it first, but next Day we heard it was no such thing. We thought so because Goodman pick'd the Gentleman's Pocket.</p>
               <p>Kelly. You said just now, that it was I that pick'd his Pocket.</p>
               <p>Baker Yes, you was fumbling about it, but Goodman push'd you away, and did it himself, and as he went to Sea the next Day, we thought he had snk the Watch.</p>
               <p>Kelly. But you swore that he took a Watch ?</p>
               <p>Court. Did you swear it positively?</p>
               <p>Baker. No, I said as I say now, that I believ'd he took a Watch.</p>
               <p>Kelly. Can you tell your Story over again?</p>
               <p>Baker. Yes, Goodman took the Gentleman by the Shoulder, and bid him stand, then Kelly put his Hand in his Pocket, and riffled him, and drop'd the Gold, and I pick'd up one Guinea.</p>
               <p>Kelly. Just now you said Goodman pick'd his Pocket.</p>
               <p>Baker. You and Goodman both riffl'd him, after we all four had push'd him up against a Door, and kept him fast, and when he was robb'd, Kelly struck him with a Whip, and made the Blood run down his Cheek.</p>

             they had riffled me they drew me from the Door, toward the Kennel, and one of them gave me a stroke over the the right Eye, I thought it was done with a Stick. I was laid up for 6 Weeks, and had two Surgeons to attend me here's the Scar to be seen.</p>
               <p>Kelly. How long was it after the Robbery before you saw the Gentleman again?</p>
               <p>Baker. He was out of Town last Sessions, and I did not see him till this Sessions.</p>
               <p>Kelly. It's strange when you saw him but once by Night that you should know him again, half a Year afterwards ?</p>

               <p>Mr. Owen. It was dark where I stood; but the Moon was up.</p>
               <p>Kelly. What Clothes had the Gentleman on?</p>

I think they were dark Colour, but I can't tell justly, because we were all in a Surprize; for we were pursu'd in a Minute by the Chairmen and Watchmen, and I ran across Covent Garden, and so directly to Quan's; and Kelly and I had 2 or 3 Words, and he said, You Dog I have a good mind to hang you, and so I went and surrender'd myself, and inform'd against him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Owen. I called the Watch, but whether it was before or after the Blow, I cannot tell, and immediately the Street was full of People - My Cloaths were a Chocolate Colour. - I saw Baker one Day this Week at Hicks's-Hall, and he said he knew me.</p>
               <p>Cath. Walker. The Prisoners and Baker have used my Shop, but it was but seldom; I remember they were there in February last, and had two half Pints of Gin, and Baker said, I must take his Buckles or go without my Money.</p>
               <p>Court. Was Goodman with them then?</p>
               <p>Cath. Walker. He might be there, but I don't know him by Name.</p>
               <p>L. Grace. Baker swore positively to the Watch before Alderman Brocas, and we were taken up last Sessions, but nothing appearing against us, we were acquitted and turn'd out of Court, and Baker and one of the Thief-Catchers stood by at the same Time; but the Thief-Catchers had been 6 l. out of Pocket, and so they got us taken up again the next Day.</p>

Baker would sometimes come and sit upon my Stall, and so we grew acquainted. - He has been in Bridewell, and cast for Transportation - Grace and I met him in St. Giles's a few Days before we were taken up. He had a Woman with him, but what she is for her Body I don't know. He asked us to drink a Quartern of Gin; and two Days afterwards this Woman came to a House in St. John's-street, where Grace and I were together, and she called him out, and he went with her. I would have fetch'd him away, but he said he would stay with her all Night, and so he did; and I staid in the same House, and the next Morning I made the best of my Offence home to my 'Biding; and the Day after I met him again in St. Giles's, and going into Drury-Lane, we were both taken by Baker, and the Thief-catchers Atkins, and Adley. Atkins has made it his whole Business for 4 or 5 Years to take Mens Lives away.</p>

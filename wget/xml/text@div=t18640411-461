                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Hanley—on Monday, 22d February, I went into Mr. Hart's shop, a stationer, of Lewisham—the prisoner followed me in, and asked for a penny valentine—Mr. Hart told him he had not one and he left—I changed 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and put my purse in my pocket—I went out of the shop and passed the prisoner—he repassed me, and followed me closely into Mr. Coleman's, the butcher's—he stood close to my right side, and I thought he stepped on my dress—I turned to tell him not to do so, and he was leaving the shop in great haste—I missed my puree, made it known to the butcher, and we went after him—about ten minutes elapsed before we got sight of him—I found him in the hands of the police, and gave him in custody—I asked him if he would give it up—he denied taking it, and said that he had not seen it—Mrs. Coleman asked him what he came into the shop for—he said, "For half a pound of steak"—she said, "Why did not you ask for it?"—he did not answer—there was a five pound note in my purse, six sovereigns, a half-sovereign, some silver, several little memorandums, and I think a florin—there had not been a creature near me from the time I put my purse into my pocket—I held my dress round me, it being a dirty morn<lb></lb>ing, and it could not have been taken until I let my dress down in Mr. Coleman's shop.</p>

On 22d February, about 2 o'clock, I saw a number of persons collected, and the prisoner in the hands of Mr. Swift, who said, "This boy has been picking a lady's pocket, in Mr. Covelle, the butcher's shop"—he said, "I have not had the purse"—Mrs. Hanley</p>

                  </hi>. I was in Mr. Covelle's shop weighing some meat, and saw the prisoner close to Mrs. Hanley, on her right side—I did not see him leave, but she made a statement to me, and we went out different ways to search for the prisoner—I found him not above 200 yards off, he had turned round, and was coming back—I stopped him, and asked him what he came into the shop for—he said, "Half a pound of steak"—I asked him why he did not ask for it—he said he did not know, and that he had 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10 <hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in his pocket belong to his master, Mr. Neo—I asked him where he lived—he said he should not tell.</p>

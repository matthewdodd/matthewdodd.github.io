               <p>A Witness. On the 21st of January I saw the prisoner and a woman in the house of Mr. Davis, in <placeName id="t17750426-4-crimeloc18">Chamber's Street, Goodman's-fields</placeName>

Soon after that I saw the woman come out with something under her cloak; I took hold of her arm, and asked her what she had got; she said, nothing at all. I told her, she was a thief, and then she dropped the lead. When I saw the prisoner in the house, he seemed very busy, and had his shirt sleeves tucked up above his elbows, and his hair tied behind.</p>

            . On the 21st of January, between the hours of six and eight at night, returning from the city, passing by this house I observed a light; I looked through the keyhole, and saw the prisoner with his shirt sleeves up above his elbows cutting lead up in the kitchen: the woman, who is admitted evidence, was standing with a candle in her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177504260004"></xptr> hand by the dresser. I got some neighbours to watch the house, and soon after the woman opened the door, and came out with the lead in her apron: we stopped her, she dropped the lead: being asked how she came by it, she said, the prisoner gave it her: the prisoner was taken as he was endeavouring to escape out at the back of the house.</p>

            . On the 21st of January Mr. Davis sent for me. Before I got to the house the woman was in custody. I was desired to go round to the back of the house to prevent the prisoner escaping that way. I found him there; he

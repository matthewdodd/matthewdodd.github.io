                  </hi>. I reside at 22 Soho-square—about Christmas last the prisoner called at my house—the servant came in and said that Dr. Arnott wanted to speak to me—I went out to speak to him—he said that his name was Arnott; that he was <hi rend="italic">hard up;</hi> that he had spent more money than his capital, and he wanted me to advance him some money to pay it for him—I said he was a stranger to me, and asked if he had a card, to show me who he was—he said unfortunately he had not got one; but he</p>

               <p>was at the St. Katherine docks, that he had spent the whole of his money, and was at a loss to know how to return to Lowmore, in York<lb></lb>shire, where he resided—I told him that I had so often been imposed upon, that I felt bound to be cautious; that I felt some delicacy in doubting his Word, as he had the appearance and conversation of a gentleman—he then stated that he was Dr. Phoenix Arnott Wilson, and he resided at Carr-lane, Lowmore—I wrote it down at the time—I asked him if he knew any of the parties residing there—he said he knew the Rev. Mr. Forsett, the clergyman, and Mr. Wickham, the member for Bradford—that if Mr. Wickham had been in town he should not have had occasion to apply to me—I knew both those gentlemen, and knew that Mr. Wickham was not in town—I have very large iron works at Lowmore—he spoke of those, and of the appearance of the tremendous fires burning at night, and the large cinder heaps; and he spoke of a Miss Dawson as a very benevolent lady residing there, who I knew very well—I asked him what he would require to take him to the works—he said a sovereign—he said, "I cannot walk into a pawnbroker's shop, being a gentleman, to leave my watch; but if you will allow me to leave it in your possession, I shall feel a pleasure in doing so"—I said I could not listen to that for a moment—I said, "A sovereign cannot take you down to Lowmore"—he said, "Yes, it can, in a third-class carriage"—I then said, "Believing your tale to be true, I should not think of your being content with a sovereign; I shall give you two: if I do the thing at all, I will do it liberally"—he bowed and thanked me, and said he was a man of honour and a Christian, and he would return it me by post-office order next day—I have never received the money—I parted with the two sovereigns believing the tale to be true—I made in<lb></lb>quiries, and found it to be false—I then gave information to the detective police.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> If I understand you correctly, you rather offered him the money on his making the statement to you of the position in which he was? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The second sovereign, undoubtedly—he offered to leave his watch with me, which I declined, as a gentleman I could not hold another man's watch—it was the general statement of being in pecuniary difficulties which operated upon my mind, and his representing himself to reside in the place where I was deeply interested, that decidedly created a credit in my mind, representing himself as living in a locality in which my name is known probably to every person in the place—the promise of repayment did not operate on my mind; that was after I had given him the money—he offered me the watch before I parted with my money—he gave me to understand that he was a medical doctor.</p>

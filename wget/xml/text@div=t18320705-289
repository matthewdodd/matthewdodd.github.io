I went to bed about eleven o'clock at night - the prisoner slept in another bed in the same room; I slept alone - when I went to bed, I had 15s. in shillings, and two sixpences in my pocket; I took it out, put it into a bit of paper, and put it into my right-hand breeches pocket, and a letter with it - I put my clothes in a chair by my bed-side - I awoke between seven and eight o'clock in the morning; the prisoner was then getting up - he seemed in a great hurry to dress; when he had left the room, I got out of bed, and found my clothes, which I had left in the chair, on the prisoner's bed - I felt in my breeches pocket, and my money and letter were gone; I could not tell the money, but I know the paper it was in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not take a hand-bill in Oxford-street? A. No, it was given to me in Holborn - it was the only paper I had; I did not put my clothes on yours when I went to bed - I put them on the chair - there was nothing else there; I awoke while you were dressing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you find the letter or the money? A. I apprehended the prisoner myself, in about a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes, and a Police-officer, who is not here, searched him in my room; he found on him this paper, in which my money had been, and 13s. 6d. - I found this letter, which had been in my pocket, in his bed; he afterwards said he gave 2s. 6d. for this new waistcoat - he made some resistance when the officer searched him.</p>

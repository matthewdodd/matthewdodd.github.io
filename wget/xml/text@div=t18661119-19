                  </hi>. I live at No. 39, Radnor Street, St. Luke's, and am principally employed by the authorities of the Mint in carrying out their inquiries—I am also agent to the Inspector of Reformatories—on the 2nd of November I went with Fife and other officers to No. 5, George Street, Spitalfields, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon—on entering the street an alarm was given, and John Barrett's head, which was out of the window, disappeared—we proceeded with all speed to the second floor front room, which was found open by Inspector Fife—at the time we entered Cornelius Barrett was standing close to John at the table, and he swept off the table with his hand a quantity of crowns, some of</p>

               <p>which dropped on the floor, and some he threw out at the open window—he was seized and secured—he resisted very violently—John Barrett sat down on a chair by the window, and I then saw Elizabeth Barrett take from a table a black bag—it is a very small room—she took up a packet from the table wrapped up in a rag, and threw it out of the window—I had stationed Inspector Broad at the door outside in the street—I seized the female prisoner's hand, having seen her take a crown off the mantel-piece, and endeavoured to get it—she said, "May God strike me b—dead if it is not a good one, Mr. Brannan"—I said, "I quite imagine it is, and the pattern piece from which the mould is taken"—I got it from her hand with some difficulty, and soon afterwards Inspector Broad brought in a parcel with nine crowns in it, which she threw out, and two half-crowns which Cornelius threw out—I found that some of them corresponded in date and marks with the one I took from Elizabeth—she resisted very violently—I saw the officers pick up off the floor a quantity of coin which was strewed about—there was a clear bright fire in the fireplace, and I found this ladle (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) with a small portion of white metal in it, hot, but not melted—Inspector Broad found a file with white metal hang<lb></lb>ing to the teeth of it, as if it had been recently used—I recovered this packet, containing the fragments of a plaster of Paris mould for casting crowns, and which Broad said that he saw thrown out at the window—the prisoners heard that, but made no answer.</p>

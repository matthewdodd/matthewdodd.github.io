                  </hi>. I live at 4, Mercy-terrace, Shadwell—on the night of 16th June, I was in High-street, Shadwell, coming from my house—I had been making some rye bread, which I am obliged to make at night, and that was why I was out so late—I had drunk a pot of half-and-half, no more—I was not so drunk as I am now—I saw the two prisoners and another one together—they insulted me, and Winn took me by the throat and threw me down—then the policeman came up and they went away—the third one had a knife, and when the policeman was gone he said, "Keep the beggar down; if he don't give the money he has in his pocket, I shall cut his throat"—Patterson kept me down also—I was kept down about five or ten minutes perhaps, I cannot say—I hallooed for the police and they stopped my mouth—there were lamps in the street—I cannot tell how far it was from a lamp<lb></lb>post—it was light enough for me to see the persons who were holding me down—I am quite sure that the prisoners are two of the three—I afterwards went to the station-house.</p>

I was on duty in Shadwell on the night of 17th June, about a quarter past 12 o'clock—my attention was attracted by cries of "Police!" and "Murder!"—I went to the spot where there was a crowd, and found the two prisoners in custody of another constable and a sergeant—we could not find the prosecutor at that time; he had run away, frightened—we took the names and address of the prisoners, and they were let go—we afterwards went to the addresses and found them both in bed, and took them—that was after I had been to the prosecutor's house, and had seen him.</p>

I am a carman in Mr. Higgins' employment, Ratcliff-highway—I was in Shadwell on the night of 17th June—I saw the last wit<lb></lb>ness and prosecutor there—there was not a crowd of persons there—I saw the prisoners standing in a doorway—after I had gone by about ten or fifteen yards, I heard something like a horse falling, and heard a man say, "Oh," and I went back and saw the prisoners on the top of the prosecutor—I said, "My good fellows, that is unfair play; let the man get up"—Winn jumped up and came on to the pavement where I stood; they were in the middle of the road—he said, "If you say anything, I will knock your b—head off" by that time Patterson got up and came to the pavement—the prosecutor then got up and sat on his backside and sung out, "Police!"—the police<lb></lb>man came, and I said, "Here is some unfair play here"—the prosecutor got up and said, "They have been trying to rob me"—Patterson turned round and said, "Do you mean to say I am a thief"—I said, "No, I don't say any<lb></lb>thing of the kind"—after a little while we walked along the street, and the policeman and another man brought the other man hack—I said directly, "That is the other man."</p>

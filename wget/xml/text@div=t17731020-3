               <p>Methusalem Davis. I met the prisoner on the 12th of September in St. James's Park, about nine in the evening; she asked me where I was going; I said home; she asked me if I would go with her; I asked her where she lived; she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177310200004"></xptr> said in Duck-lane, Westminster. I took it for granted she was a woman of the town; I said what must I do with you; she said to be with me all night; I asked her what I must give her.</p>
               <p>Q. You asked the price?</p>
               <p>Davis. Yes; she told me some extravagant price. I have forgot what; I said won't less do; at last she consented for 1 s. She prevailed on me to go with her; when we got near the place where she said she lodged, she desired me to stay there while she informed a woman she lodged with of it, and get her to leave the room for that night; after that she came out and conducted me into the room; she was in a great hurry to go to bed; we undressed ourselves and went to bed very soon; she left the fire burning; she enquired very often if the fire was out; I told her I thought it would do no harm. After being about twenty minutes or half an hour in bed, she pretended that she was very thirsty; she got out of bed and said she would get some half-pence to buy some small beer; she got tumbling things about where my clothes lay, which was upon some drawers by the bedside; my coat and waistcoat fell down; I heard the noise of some keys in my waistcoat pocket. She went out of the room; in about five minutes after came five or six people into the room; 
               <persName id="t17731020-3-person73">
                  Samuel
                   Ward

            , the person that cohabited with the prisoner, came in; they pretended to know nothing of this young woman. I asked Ward to shew me the way to a constable; he shewed me to a public house; I discovered my loss; when those people came into the room; my breeches were thrown to me out of the passage by somebody, I do not know who; the prisoner was gone at that time. My watch and three shillings were taken out of the pockets.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure your watch was in your pocket when you went to bed?</p>
               <p>Davis. I wound up the watch in the room before I went to bed. Ward shewed me to a public house; he gave his name, Williams. I could not find the prisoner for some time as she quitted that lodging next day. I have never seen my watch since.</p>
               <p>Q. Who threw your breeches to you?</p>
               <p>Davis. They were thrown to me from the passage before the other people had been in the room.</p>

               <p>I am not the woman; I know nothing at all of the man.</p>

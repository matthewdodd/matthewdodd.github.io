               <p>Q. Did you see either of the prisoners there on the 18th - A. Yes; they came there about five o'clock. On the 18th of March, I went to my father's house. My father had met with an accident; he requested me to go into his cellar and to do some work, and at the time I went down the prisoner's were in the tap-room, and apparently very much intoxicated. Previous to my going into the cellar, I pulled off my coat and laid it in the bar, in the pocket of which was the pocket-book, and in the pocket were three one-pound notes, and sundry memorandums. When I came up from the cellar, the prisoners were gone and my coat also. My suspicion fell on the prisoners. I and Captain Christie went in pursuit of them. We overtook them on Cock-hill, Shadwell. The woman had the coat concealed under her cloak. We took them into Mr. Roger's, a grocer's shop. I then went in search of an officer. When I returned the pocket-book was discovered. The coat was in the possession of Mr. Rogers.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took the coat from the woman - A. Captain Christie, in my presence.</p>
               <p>JOHN ROGERS. I am a grocer, and a constable of the Thames police. On the 18th of March, about half past seven in the evening, the female prisoner came into my shop and asked me whether I could tell her of a pawnbroker in the neighbourhood. I told her there were two lower down. She said, she did not wish to go lower down. She wanted to know whether there were any further up. I told her there were several further up. As she turned out, Mr. Fisk came up. He said, this is the woman, and put her into my shop again. I saw Mr. Christie take the coat from her. I believe it was wrapped in her apron. Mr. Fisk said, there is the man that was with her. I took him and brought him in the shop and searched him. In his hat I found a pocketbook, containing three one-pound bank notes, and sundry memorandums, and a pair of gloves. This is the pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is my pocket-book. I had three one-pound notes in my pocket-book, and no other money. This is my coat; I had it in November last.</p>
               <p>Bourne's Defence. This woman is innocent.</p>
               <p>Ball's Defence. This man brought me the coat, and asked me to pledge it. I did not know but what it was his own.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer in the Victoria Docks, at West Ham—on the evening of 13th August, about 7 o'clock I saw the prisoner on the jetty of the Victoria Dook—he was not employed, and had no business there; he had been denied being there—I saw him go in between some iron tanks and take out the remainder of a copper pump; he had nothing to do but to lift up a tarpaulin to get it—he took it on his shoulder and carried it to the end of the jetty, looked round, and seeing one of the Custom's officers he turned back and put it down again, and went to the top of the jetty and had some conversation with the police—I followed him to the top—he then turned back to the same spot again, took the pump again on his shoulder and carried it away to the top of the jetty, where he placed it down by the wall—I passed him and asked if he knew what it was o'clock—he said he did not—about ten minutes afterwards he took it up again and carried it about 300 yards, towards the bottom of the dock—I was watch<lb></lb>ing him all the time—he then put it down in a shed, before a stack of guano; I suppose hearing me—I then told him he must go with me for having the pump in his possession—he said he was employed by some other man to carry it—the policeman came up and took him into custody—some man did come up and speak to him while he was at the bottom of the jetty; he then had the pump on his shoulder.</p>

I live at 18, Green-street, Paddington—my husband keeps a beer-shop—on 9th January, the prisoner's wife came into my bar<lb></lb>parlour somewhere about 9 o'clock, I could not say to a minute—she was alone—she was not sober—the prisoner came in between 9 and 10—he sat down in a chair, not far from his wife—I do not know that he said anything particular to her—they appeared very good friends—she sang a song, and the prisoner joined in the last verse—after that the prisoner began telling a lodger of mine that he had taken a contract that day in Mortimer-street—when the prisoner came in, his wife was sitting by the door, and he went and sat at</p>

If I have done a rash act, in a moment of passion, for God's sake help me; don't all desert me"—I asked him what he had done—he drew his hand a little on one side from the wound, and I saw what it was—he said, "For God's sake, Mr. Stephens, run for a doctor for your life; fetch a doctor at any price, I will pay"—I went and fetched Mr. Hammond—the prisoner appeared very agitated and distressed—I have known him for nine or twelve months—he lived on very friendly terms with his wife, but now and then she was the worse for drink—I never knew the prisoner the worse for drink; he is as steady and sober a man as you would find in London—I had seen them an hour and a half previously to this.</p>

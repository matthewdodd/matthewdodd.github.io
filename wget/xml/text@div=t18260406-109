The box was found, and I received it from Sir Richard Birnie.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Can you say how long it was after you had had it? A. No, I had left home about twenty minutes. I do not know the prisoner, and do not remember seeing him near me. I might have pulled it out with my handkerchief, though I think I should have beard it.</p>

            . I was coming up Charing-cross on the 6th of March, and heard the cry of Stop thief! I saw the prisoner running, and stopped him; he said "For God's sake don't stop me;" I saw him put his hand into his pocket, and then put something into the flap of his breeches; I took him into a public-house, and he got the box out somehow, and put it behind him; I took it up and took him to Bow-street. I believe this to be the box- I wrote my name inside of it - Sir Richard Birnie gave it up to Mr. Dickinson.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see him near Mr. Dickinson? A. No; I saw him near St. Martin's-lane - it was about half-past ten o'clock when I took him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). On this morning on entering master's shop to work, he discharged me for being seen on Sunday in company with two girls of the town; I was standing opposite the Horse Guards, looking at the soldiers, and saw something shining close at my feet - I picked it up, and, feeling pleased with my good luck, I ran off, and was stopped by a cry of Stop thief! - I declare my innocence.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

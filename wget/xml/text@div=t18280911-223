On the 8th of August, between four and five o'clock, I was superintending the landing of some goods on the wharf; Driscol told me there was a boy in the warehouse taking some rope - I went there, and saw the prisoner with it; I asked what he was going to do with it; he said to take it to his master - I asked who his master was; he said William John Brown, a rigger, at Wapping; he had moved the rope five or six yards.</p>

            . I am a labourer. I saw the prisoner take a piece of rope from the inside of the warehouse - he was bringing it out towards the gate; this is the rope- I saw him on the premises five or six days before, and I turned him off.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I thought I saw a ship, which I expected to go on board of; a man asked me to carry this to Narrow-street, Wapping, and said he would give me 6d. I took it up, and this man came and asked where I was going; I said to my employer's, a man of the name of Brown, the foreman then came, and said I should not go off the premises till he saw my employer - I was going to find him, and he called me back.</p>

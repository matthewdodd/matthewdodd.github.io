                  </hi>. I live in Park-terrace, Regent's-park, and am a watch<lb></lb>maker. I know the prisoner—I had known him before be came for this—he had called for a watch, it might be six weeks before—he then lived with Mr. Griffin, in Baker-street—he came to my shop on 10th March, between 1 and 2 o'clock—he brought this letter (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"March 10th, 1852—Please to let the bearer have a watch for me, as mine is out of order; let it be a good one. If I should not like it, would you change it for another?—let it be a hunter; and send it by the lad. I. J. Griffin, Esq.")—Mr. Griffin had been a customer of mine—I asked the prisoner if it was Mr. Griffin himself that gave it him—I could get no answer, but the third time I asked him he said it was a boy like himself, and I thought it might be one of Mr. Griffin's sons—I thought it was rather curious to send for one watch, and I said I would take five or six, and go with him—I did so, and he walked with me some distance—he then took out a little book, and I asked him if he was learning—he said, "Oh no, it is songs"—I then went on towards Baker-street, and when I looked round I could not find him—he had been once at my shop before, for a watch that I had from Mr. Griffin—I let him take it that time because my man knew him, and he had brought the watch.</p>

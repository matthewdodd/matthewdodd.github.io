On the 6th of September I was returning home between nine and ten o'clock, when a man passed me very close - it was near the church - it was not moonlight; but sufficiently light for me to see his face - there was a lamp by the church where he first passed me; he passed me and turned round and looked at me - he was going the road I was going to take up to Old Brompton - he crossed to the public-house, but did not enter the house - he went up the Old Brompton road, on the left hand side of the way by the wall - I walked to the public-house - and I did not like to stop<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170011"></xptr>there, but passed to the other side of the road, not liking his appearance, when I saw two persons going down the road, and I followed down the road - I had not gone many yards down the road, when he came from the right hand side of the road before me - it was the same man I had seen before - I am sure - it was dark at the entrance, but there was a light lower down - he came across towards me and began to speak, but what he said, I cannot say, but he snatched my reticule, it was not fastened to my hand - it was round my wrist, and round my fingers - he got it away; he snatched it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it require force to pull it from you? A. Yes, he broke the string - he took my shawl off, and parasol and knocked me down on the ground, and ran off - he took them altogether - he did not knock me down first - when he took the shawl he pushed me down, and ran off towards town. I saw him again directly after - my shawl and parasol were returned to me by somebody, and I saw my reticule at Queen-square, next morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. This "knock down" was a push, was it not? A. I don't know what you call a push - he threw me down with his hand - he did not give me a blow - the reticule, shawl, and parasol all went from me - somebody picked up the shawl, and parasol, and gave them to me - my shawl was pinned.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him at the police-office, did you not at first refuse to swear to him? A. I hesitated to swear on account of the disagreeableness of going through this unpleasantness, not that I doubted whether he was the man - I did not tell the magistrate I doubted whether he was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the magistrate give you a quarter of an hour to make up your mind? A. No - I hesitated, but not so long as a quarter of an hour - perhaps it was ten minutes - nobody but my own relatives whispered to me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did they whisper? A. If I was certain he was the man to say so, and I was certain of him - I did not say to the best of my belief - I said he was the man - I am certain he is the man.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not say in the hearing of a gentleman, "I say it is now to the best of my belief?" A. I am certain he is the man - what I swore at the office was not read over to me - I signed some paper - that signature is mine (looking at it), I was not asked if it was corect it was read over at the prisoner's desire and I heard it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What sort of a lamp was there in the place where the attack was made on you? A. It was at the entrance of the Old Brompton-road - there was a gas lamp on the right hand side - there was a lamp on Brompton Chapel, and one just beyond the Grammar School - the lamp was about ten feet from where I and the prisoner were together.</p>

            . I live close to Brompton-square. On the 6th of September, about ten o'clock at night - I was at my own house, and heard a very loud talking of several people across the road - I went across the road to see what was the matter, and heard something like a scuffling; I went up and heard a cry of "Stop thief" - I saw the prisoner struggling with a tall gentleman - I laid hold of him - Mrs. Sugden was thirty or forty yards off - the prisoner caught hold of me and threw me down, but I kept my hold till a policeman came up, and I delivered him to him; somebody said in his hearing "Lay hold of him - he has been knocking a lady down, and robbing her"- I did not see him searched; Fuller was the constable.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you been drinking that night? A. No, I was quite sober; I was not abusing him on the road - I did not use any expression to him which the policeman checked.</p>

             (policeman). I went up on the night in question, when the last witness was knocked down by the prisoner about ten o'clock at night - Copeland was doing nothing wrong; the prisoner was struggling with him, and he said, "I give this fellow in charge for knocking a lady down and robbing her" - the prisoner protested his innocence - I took him to Mrs. Sugden, and asked her if she could identify him as the man who knocked her down, and robbed her - she pointed to him, and said, "That is the man; you know you villain, you did it?" I took him to the watch-house, searched him, and found on him three half-crowns, and a piece of green ribbon, a tailor's thimble and a small box of snuff which he said was thirty-six - I went to the spot where Mrs. Sugden was robbed, to look about, but it was too dark as the lamp did not afford light enough to discover anything on the ground, there were marks of scuffling on that spot, but the dirt had covered over anything which might be there - I went in the morning as soon as it was light, which was near five o'clock, and found a steel purse, two half-crowns, one shilling, a piece of black ribbon, for a reticule apparently, and a pair of gloves.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is that the reticule you produced in the last case? A. Yes; it belongs to this case - the constable who found the black reticule which I have is sick, but I saw him find it over in a garden - his name is

             - I went to the spot, but found nothing that night - I did not look for any thing that night, but I saw footmarks of scuffling which must have covered the things over - the dust was kicked up, and had gone over the purse - the lamp gave a very good light - it was about twenty yards from the spot - it was a dark night.</p>

On Monday the 13th of January I was standing at my master's window, and the prisoner was passing by, and he put his arm in and took the shoes out; I saw him do it, he put his arm in round the door, and drawed them out at the door; he carried them by the window, and he chucked them up the Three Nuns inn-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him chuck them up? - I did not, I had him then in custody, in my hands; I immediately pursued as I saw him take them, I stopped him the next door but one from our house, he had not the shoes on him then, he had chucked them out from his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he run or walk away? - He walked.</p>
               <p>Q. When you stopped him had he past the gateway of the Three Nuns? - Yes, just got over the gateway, I asked him what he had got from my master's shop? he said nothing; another young man picked up the shoes, and took them in next door, and they brought them into our house.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon were they produced to you? - In the course of a minute, as soon as I took the prisoner. We call them shoes, but the proper name is channel pumps.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with them? - The constable had them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When he came up to me and asked me what I had about me? I said nothing, and he went up the gateway and picked up the shoes, and I went on a matter of two hundred yards.</p>

               <p>I am a porter to the Three Nuns, Aldgate, I saw a man chuck a pair of pumps up the yard, I cannot say it was the prisoner, I think it was by his back, I did not see his face at all; they were chucked up the gateway of the Three Nuns, Aldgate, I took them up and gave them to the woman at the corner, that keeps the poulterer's shop.</p>

               <p>Court to Short. Do you know these pumps? - I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your master any pumps in the shop but what belonged to him? - I saw them come home, and the bill came with them, they were pumps that were bought wholesale; I put them on the window, it is what we make a shew of in the window, they might be there a month for what I know.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Ask him how he could see my person if he was looking down, how could he see me through the glass? ask him whether I did not get above an hundred yards while he went up the passage to get the shoes, and then cried out stop thief, and I went back to his master's shop? - I never went up the passage at all, the young man Soare called to me and said here are the shoes, but I did not stop to pick them up, I pursued him.</p>

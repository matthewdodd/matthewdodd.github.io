                  </hi>. I was manager to Mr. Charles Woolley, carman and contractor, in Aldgate—the prisoner Grafton was in his employ on 27th February—I gave him an order to collect some tittlers of sugar and to call on his way to Paddington far some sacks—he was to collect the sugar at Whitechapel, about 10.30—from there he was to go to Maryborough Street, and then to Paddington—I had occasion to go to Monument Yard, and coming out of Eastcheap I saw Grafton with the van going down King William Street, altogether out of his way—I went to Guildhall about 11.45, and when I came out of the Court Grafton was waiting outside—he said "I have given my horse and van up to a man that you sent, and I was to come back to drive some other horse, did you send anyone to take the hone and van away"—I said "Certainly not"—he said "A man came to me in Holborn and said that Mr. Bryant had sent him, and I was to come to the yard and drive another horse"—I said "You must have been very foolish, you knew there was no horse in the stable, and I should not send a man to do the work after I had sent you out"—I took him into the trap and drove to Marlborough Street where the sugar was to go to, and found it was not there—I went to Marlborough Street Police Court and Bow Street, but could find out nothing about the van or sugar—the next morning I received this Post Card from Mr. Simms, of Greenwich—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>): "It is now nearly 7 o'clock, and one of your horses and waggons have been standing at my door since noon, the horse with nosebag on. Samuel Simms"—I imme<lb></lb>diately sent one of the men to Greenwich to get the horse and van—it was brought back, but there was no sugar in it—I asked the prisoner what he was doing in King William Street—he said that Ludgate Hill was blocked and he had gone down Fenchurch Street and Cannon Street as being the next way to go—he had the pony and trap for about five hours on the Monday night to see if he could find anything of the horse and van—he did not say that he had ever seen the man before who had taken it from him—the horse and van and sugar were worth 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think the value of the sugar was about 67<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

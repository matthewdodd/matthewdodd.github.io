            . The prisoner was in my employ. In consequence of information I had two officers on my premises on the 31st of August, between six and seven o'clock, when the servants leave work - the prisoner had no authority to take away skins; I had given her sixty foreign hare-skins, about a quarter-past five, to work upon, and told Nathan to count them - Roberts was placed a few yards outside the warehouse; he afterwards produced four skins to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Was the prisoner in the habit of working for you for any time? A. I believe for five or six years - I had a good opinion of her; I never allowed her to take skins home, unless I gave them to her to work upon - I have, at times, given her English rabbit-skins to work upon at home, but never foreign skins - I never suffer them to be taken home, and do not allow work to be done on the premises in our new year, but August was not a time of that kind.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 31st of August I stopped the prisoner about a hundred yards from the prosecutor's door, about seven o'clock in the evening, with a basket in her hand - I asked her if she did not work for Mr. Lialter; she said she did - I told her he suspected things were not all right, and that he missed his skins - she immediately said she had four in her basket; I asked what she was going to do with them - she said to cut the wool off, and return it in the morning; I asked if Mr. Lialter knew of it - she said he knew nothing of it - I took her to the watch-house; three of the skins were in a paper, and one in a handkerchief.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I did not mean to wrong Mr. Lialter of them - I took them home to forward me an hour the next day; he often gave me leave to take work home, as I was obliged to go home early in the evening.</p>

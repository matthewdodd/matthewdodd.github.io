               <p>Court. Have you the Book here?</p>
               <p>Hodgkins. No, the Attorney has it, I expect he will bring it immediately.</p>

You, that for the Lucre of 3 half Crowns, would wickedly make a false Entry, and bring false Evidence to charge a Man with the Cost of maintaining this Woman and her two Children; and now you come to swear against her, when you yourself did the Fact.</p>
               <p>Hodgkins. I am very sorry, my Lord, for what I have done, I humbly ask Pardon, and hope you'll excuse this one Fault. I never did any such Thing in my Life before, and never will again. And indeed I had not done it now, but that she said it would keep her poor Children from perishing, and I did not know there was any Sin in it.</p>

On the morning of the 7th of May, I went out for some bread, to New-street, Covent-garden, about half-past seven o'clock; before I went out I put a sovereign and two shillings into a glove in a handkerchief - I put it into my box, and left the prisoner, (who had slept with me) in the room, dressing herself; I told her to take care of my child - her husband was in the next room; I was coming back in about a quarter of an hour, and met the prisoner in the street - I said, "How is this, have you left my children?" she said, "Yes, Mr. Barry and I quarrelled;" I asked her to come back, which, with some hesitation, she did - I then went to the box for the key of my caddy, and missed the handkerchief and money; I said, "Mrs. Barry, I have lost so and so;" she said,"Look about, perhaps you will find it;" I said, "Will you help me?" she said,"No, for if you find it any where, you will say I put it there;" I shook her bonnet, which laid on the table, and found my handkerchief in it - I have not found the money; she urged me to go and stop a duplicate, which had been with the money in the box - I went out for an officer, but could not get one just then; when I got the officer the prisoner was gone - I took her husband into custody; the prisoner returned at ten o'clock at night, when I had her taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Is your name Jones? A. Yes; I was married to Mr. Jones - I am quite sure of that; I had been out on the 6th with a woman named Lynch, who slept with me that night - she was a servant out of place, but went to a place on the morning of the 7th, before I put the money away; neither the prisoner nor her husband told me to send for an officer - I did find the handkerchief on the ground when I shook the bonnet.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As I am in the presence of that Almighty Being, who is to judge, she did not take the handkerchief out of my bonnet, and I never took the bonnet in my hand; when I was going to half a day's work, I told her in the morning not to go and get drunk as she did the day before - I told the person, who slept with her, not to take her out and give her any thing to drink, as if she did I would not stop and mind the children; she said she would not - at one o'clock I took my bonnet off the nail, as I was going out; she was at the door - I never had her handkerchief nor her money, nor do I believe she ever lost it; I had told her I was going to work at No. 22, Carburton-street, and I said if she had any suspicion of me she should make the matter clear before I went out, and she went to a fortune-teller about it - she never was married, her name is Joan Murphy; she lived with Captain Wallis some years.</p>

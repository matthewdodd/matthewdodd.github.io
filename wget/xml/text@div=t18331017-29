             I am beadle of St. Mary-le-Strand - I was called into the shop; I took the prisoner and found 9s. on him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not give it up as soon as you asked me? Witness. A. No, I had some trouble to get it from you; you would not open your hand till I pressed it, then you dropped 7s. and the other two remained in your hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I entered the shop of Mr. Cameron, pawnbroker, in the Strand, with 9s. in my hand, having not a minute before changed a half-sovereign at a liquor-shop; I went into the shop with the intention of pledging the waistcoat; I was stopped with the property of Mr. Ager. On entering the shop I hesitated in pawning the waistcoat; I had nine shillings in my left hand, and was considering whether I could not manage to do without pledging it - when the shopman turning round, said he had seen my hand in the till, and jumping over the counter immediately stopped me, and sent for a policeman to take me into custody. How is it possible I could have taken this money from the till when the shopman declares he caught my right hand in the till and the money was found in my left hand? besides it is not to be supposed that he seeing me would allow me to take 9s. without stopping me the moment I commenced. I again declare, so help me God, that I never had my hand in the till, and that the money found in my possession actually belonged to me; my intention on first entering the shop was to pledge the article I had with me, but on second thoughts I altered my mind.</p>

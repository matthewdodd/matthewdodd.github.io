            . I am a Police-constable. I received the prisoner in charge on the 24th of October; I asked how she came to rob her mistress - she said she did not know; she was a very ungrateful girl, and her mistress had been very kind to her, but she did it on purpose, and she said "Don't hurt my father, he is to meet me to night at Spitalfields church"- I took her to the office, and went back to the church, and from her description I took her father, but found nothing on him.</p>
               <p>HANNAH WEBB re-examined. Q. Had you employed her to pawn any property?" A. Yes, a week or two before - a pair of boots for 1s. 6d.; and on the 24th of October I went to the drawer to take out the duplicate, and missed it; I told her to go to the pawnbroker and get an affidavit of them - she went, returned, and said, they were quite safe, and if I wanted them, the pawnbroker would let me have them without an affidavit; I then gave her 1s. 6 1/2d., which was what they were in for - she went and brought them; while she was gone I missed another duplicate of some articles which were pledged for 5s. - I desired her to go and get an affidavit for them; I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010087"></xptr>to make my children's bed, and missed a blanket - I closed the door, and asked the prisoner what she had done with it; she said there never were but two - I said, "Yes, there were three, what have you done with it? if you have pawned it tell me the truth;" she then said her father came for sixpence and she had not got it - that he then asked for a slice of bread, and there was none out, and then she took the blanket and gave him the sixpence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I said I took the blanket, but I did not say for my father.</p>

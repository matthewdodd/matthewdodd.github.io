Rodgers"—William Rodgers is the secretary—on the faith of that I cashed the cheque, and handed the money, 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to the prisoner—I was not in the service of the association while the prisoner was there—I called Davis's attention to the circumstance.</p>

I am secretary to the Civil Service Supply Associa-tion—the prisoner was in the Society's employ from July, 1869, to March 1872, except for a short period, when he was ill—about the 9th of December I received this cheque back from the bank—this "W. Rodgers" is my signature—all cheques which are payable to <hi rend="italic">my</hi> order come to me before they go into the bank—this cheque came from the chief cashier with a batch of other cheques, and it was returned on the 10th by our bankers, Robarts &amp; Co., marked "No account"—the cashier ought not to cash a cheque without authority from me; if he did so the chief cashier would report it to me—this signature, "W. Rodgers," in two places in this book is not my writing—I have seen the prisoner write, but I can scarcely say who is the writer of this cheque.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in Mr. Wilson's employment On Thursday night, 15th Nov., I was outside the shop from 7 to 8 o'clock, and saw Lock and Hill come through White Rose-court—Hustwaite went and spoke to them in Mason's-alley—Hustwaite then returned to the shop, and they passed and went to the Butler's Head public house—Hustwaite followed them and went in also—I saw no more of them that night—on the Friday night, I saw them again, between 7 and 8 o'clock—they came through White Rose-court, and Hustwaite went and spoke to them in the court, and then returned to the shop in the same way as before—they came through Mason's alley this time—I took off the bell on the Thursday afternoon—we went up to clean ourselves, and we generally used to smoke there, and I took off the bell that we should not be disturbed, and I forgot to put it back.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoners' statements before the Magistrate being read, Hustwaits and Header said nothing—Lock said</hi>, "I deny receiving the meat knowing it to be stolen property. I left my home this morning at half-past 5 o'clock with the intention of visiting Leadenhall-market; when I was going down Coleman-street, this person (Hustwaite) stopped me, and asked me if I ould give him a lift as far as Leadenball-market. I said yes; he said, 'I have some meat to take, will you take me up at the end of Mason's-alley?' I accordingly went there, and they put the meat into the cart I never said, 'Is it all right?' or, 'Are you ready?' then the officer came and took charge of the meat, and likewise of me. I deny knowing it to be stolen." <hi rend="italic">Hill said</hi>, "I have been staying with this young man (Lock) about two or three days, and he asked me if I would go down to the market this morning, and ride with him. I was in the cart at the time that the young man asked Lock to give him a lift with the meat; we then came round to the corner of Mason's-alley, Basinghall-street, when the other young man put the meat into the cart, and I deny anything at all of knowing of its being stolen."</p>

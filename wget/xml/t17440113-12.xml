               <p>Lyon. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you hold it to be lawful to give evidence on your Sabbath?</p>
               <p>Lyon. Yes, we are at liberty to attend to tell the truth upon the Lord's day, as well as any day. I arrived at Amsterdam the 1st or 2d of Oct. and saw the Prisoner there - he was there before me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with him?</p>
               <p>Lyon. Not long - I have known him by seeing him in England about three years ago - in Duke's Place.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the Prisoner's business.</p>
               <p>Lyon. I don't very well know; I know he had some leather breeches to sell in Holland - I came home with him from the Hague; we had a passport from the Ambassador to come in the packet boat.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you arrive here from the Hague ?</p>
               <p>Lyon. To the best of my knowledge it was the 14th of November at night - I cannot say to a day.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you speak of Old Stile or New Stile?</p>
               <p>Lyon. It is the English reckoning.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the Old Stile from the New?</p>
               <p>Lyon. I know there is 11 days difference - we came from the Hague the 4th of Nov. we were 10 days in coming from Holland to England; the Prisoner was sea-sick; I carried him to one Mr. Simpson's to lodge, and he lodged there, and being sick I lent him 8 s. - if I was to meet any body upon the road that was in distress I would do the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you visit him when he was sick?</p>
               <p>Lyon . I never visited him there, Mr. Simpson told me he paid him.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to know the day?</p>
               <p>Simpson. Because I deal in money, and I happened to have a good bargain that day, and therefore I remember the day.</p>

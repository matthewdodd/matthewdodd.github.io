                  </hi>. I live at 14, Hyde Park Terrace—I advertised in the Times for a butler in September, and received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Dated September 12, 1879, and signed Edward Upshall., applying for the situation, and slating that he had been four years in the service of Mr. H. Sly, in Somer<lb></lb>setshire, who was going to the United States.</hi>) My secretary answered that letter, and Up shall called at my office in Great George Street, Westminster—he said that he was leaving Mr. Sly with great regret, and he believed Mr. Sly was parting with him with a similar feeling, but had lost money, and was obliged to go abroad; that he had been there four years, and his wife with him—he left me to arrange an appointment with Mr. Sly, and called a few days afterwards and said that Mr. Sly had gone to the Isle of Wight, and suggested my going there to see him—I said that I could not do so, but would write to Mr. Sly, and he gave me his address at the Crab and Lobster Hotel, Ventnor—I wrote there to Mr. Sly, and received this letter in four or live days: "Mr. Sly presents his compliments to Mr. Aird, and in reply to his letter has to state that Up shall was in his service as butler and valet for nearly four years, during which time he found him perfectly honest, sober, and clean, and up to his duties. He is obliging and willing to work, and leaves me, as I am going abroad. Crab and Lobster, Ventnor, 23rd September, 1879. Up shall left me on 6th September last." On the faith of that letter I engaged him, about 30th September,. as butler at 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. year—I paid his wages quarterly, and his book for petty cash once a fortnight—tradesmen's bills were always paid by cheque sent by post—on 12th October I paid him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and on 15th October there was about 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. due to him—he remained in my service till 24th December, when I discharged him, with a month's wages, telling him that I should remain in the house till he left—I have never dealt with Aplin and Co. for wine, or authorised him to order any there—I never heard of it till some time after he left.</p>

I am a jeweller, of 69, South Audley Street—on 14th October Upshall came there and saw my assistant, and next day I took some watches and chains, which he had selected, to 14, Hyde Park Terrace, and showed them to Upshall—he selected a watch and chain at 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and asked me the lowest cash price—I said that I would take 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said that he was butler to Mr. Aird, whom he had been with 17 months, and who owed him 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which would be settled immediately he sent in his book—I believed his statement, and left the chain with him, taking the watch to put it in repair—I saw him by appointment the next Friday evening, when he excused himself by saying that he was very busy, as Mr. Aird was at dinner, but if I would call next morning he would pay me 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when Mr. Aird had settled his book—on the faith of that I left the watch—I called again two or three times, but he always said that he had not had time to send in his book to Mr. Aird—I have never been paid anything—this is the watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Green Dragon-court, Southwark. The pri<lb></lb>soner was my apprentice for four years—last Tuesday morning, about seven o'clock, he was gone, and I missed these articles—I went to his lodging in two hourse and a half, and found him and all these things—he said he did not know how they came there—he had broken open a box and taken his indentures away.</p>

               <p>but it was of no use to me, and he said, "I should like to have this glass, how much will you take for it?"—I said the sum I gave for it—he said, "Harper would like to have it"—he had it for fourpence—I sold him a toasting-fork for the same person, and four pictures, for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he paid me for them—there was a watch of his that he took away—I pawned that three different times to raise money on it for myself, by his permission—I pawned it for an execution that was lived on me—I did not sell him the jigger, or coat, not any article in the bundle—I never charged him with stealing the watch—he never complained of my ill-treating him, but his frineds did—I was not taken before a Magistrate on that account—I never told him to go away because I had nothing for him to do—I got him a situation in a steam-boat—he was there four or five months—I received no part of his wages for those months—I said I would claim them but I never did in any way—I received 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. premium with him—he was bound by the trustees of some charith at Windsor—I did not know where he was gone to—I went to Mrs. Harper, his sister, first—I have been married two years and a half—I was married before that—I believe my wife is dead—she did not leave me from ill-treatment—I do not know whether she died at my house.</p>

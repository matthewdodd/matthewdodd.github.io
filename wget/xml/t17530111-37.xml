            . I have known the prisoner from about the middle of last October in Wood-street compter. One Matthews, who said he was an acquaintance of his, came and told me one Smithson in Wood Street compter wanted earnestly to speak with me; I heard of his character, and declined going ; after that he sent me a line, and desired me to come to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it brought by?</p>
               <p>Milton. It was brought by a porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go?</p>
               <p>Milton. I did, and went down into a cellar there with him, he wanted to be very secret ; he told me about these actions to be brought against these gentlemen, and said his business, with me was to make out a writ against the four defendants, Sharp, Smith, Ward, and Weymore.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you their christian names ?</p>
               <p>Milton. He did, and I took them down in writing.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the action brought for?</p>
               <p>Milton. Three of them were for detaining deeds and writings; and Sharp for detaining wearing apparel, deeds, and writings ; this he said was to hold them to bail upon an affidavit. When he had said this, I represented the displeasure he might get from a court, to hold four men for just two thousand pounds each; that he said was to make up eight thousand pounds. I thought that looked monstrovs odd, that there should be just two thousand pounds<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175301110038"></xptr> each in the hands of different men. I told him it would look very odd in the lace of a court; said he, it must be that sum. Soon after he said, let it be separated, one, two thousand five hundred; another, one thousand six hundred; another, nineteen hundred; and another, two thousand; so to make up the sum eight thousand pounds.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he stile himself Barrister ?</p>
               <p>Milton. He did, and said it was to serve a man who was under misfortunes ; he said farther, that it was to save a man's life, to keep them out of the way that they should not give evidence; then I declined it, and told him it was dirty work, and said, I'll not trouble myself, nor come near you any more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you any thing for your trouble?</p>
               <p>Milton. He did, and I never saw him afterwards till this time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention the man's name whom it was to serve ?</p>
               <p>Milton. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he say it was ?</p>
               <p>Milton. He said it was Montgomery; Montgomery was with him at the time, he had the money of Montgomery to pay me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body else in company at the time ?</p>
               <p>Milton. The prisoner and I conversed together, but there were other people in the cellar at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he give you?</p>
               <p>Milton. He gave me 7 s. 6 d.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Where did you first see me that time ?</p>
               <p>Milton. The prisoner met me in the court-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Who went down with us?</p>
               <p>Milton. There were none went down with us but one Matthews, though there were others in the cellar at the time.</p>

            . I remember Smithson, (the prisoner) being in the Compter in October last, and we had Montgomery there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they used to converse together?</p>
               <p>Crumpton. The used to converse together as the other prisoners did.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was Montgomery put in there by?</p>
               <p>Crumpton. It was at the instance of Mr. Ward, Mr. Weymore, Mr. Sharp, and Mr. Smith.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he committed upon their oatas ?</p>
               <p>Crumpton. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Smithson a copy of his commitment ?</p>
               <p>Crumpton. I believe he had, he came from thence to Newgate a week before the sessions began.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Mr. Davenport coming ?</p>
               <p>Crumpton. I do, it was on a Saturday, there was a talk of Smithson's entering an action against Mr. Sharp, and I was surprised at it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to hear of it?</p>
               <p>Crumpton. I went in, and the people were talking that Smithson had swore an affidavit of a hundred pounds against him ; when I went, I saw Mr. Davenport and Mr. Smithson come out of a little room together, I heard Smithson ask him, what he was; and he answered, he was a deputy filazer to my lord chief justice Ayre's son; he asked him how much was his due, and I think he said 11 s 11 d. Smithson said 11 s. was due, and turned about to Montgomery and said he must have 11 d. more, upon which Montgomery said, you have had 11 s. of me already, and Smithson told him he must have it. I remember Smithson said to the gentleman, be very cautious how you take more than is your due.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear what use the affidavit was to be made of?</p>
               <p>Crumpton. No, I did not</p>

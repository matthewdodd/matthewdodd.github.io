Somebody was talking of searching, and at the same time, somebody said there was a watch on the ground, and a watch was found on the ground, just at his feet; and I believe the watch was picked up by the same person; I then said it was proper to take the prisoner to the watch-house, and I assisted to take him there.</p>
               <p>Then Strickland was the only person that you took up? - I did not hear that any body else was concerned till after.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Strickland. He said, he would do me, and bring an assault against me; I said, if you think I have any thing, search me? - I said, in case you get through this, for your treatment to me, I will bring an action against you for an assault; because he did not only strike, but kicked me; I did not wish to mention that circumstance.</p>
               <p>Did he say to you, if you think I have any thing about me, search me? - I do not remember any thing of the kind.</p>

               <p>About eleven o'clock the 24th evening, coming through Cranbourn-passage, at the end of Castle-street, I saw the prosecutor, and heard a cry, I have lost my watch; Strickland ran away; I came up immediately and laid hold of the prisoner's arm, and conveyed him to the corner of Cranbourn Alley, when he put his hand to his pocket as I had hold of him, and dropped the watch, I saw him drop it. I never saw him before, that I know of.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. What distance was that place where you was first hustled from the place where you lost your watch? - About as far as from here to that window.</p>
               <p>PRISONER STRICKLAND's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I work for one Mr. Smith in the Alley; I had two pair of shoes in my pocket; there was a mob of people; this gentleman was quite in liquor; and between Mr. Young's shop door and the corner, there was a watch; there were ten people trying to get hold of the watch; I might stoop to pick the watch up, I do not doubt but I did. I did not get hold of it, somebody kicked me over the hands; they searched me in Cranbourn Alley, and the watch was found in Castle-street.</p>
               <p>Who searched you? - This gentleman here in the white coat, and this gentleman in the blue coat.</p>
               <p>To Ravenhill; did you search him? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He felt every where; the watchman had a person in custody for taking the watch from him at the same time, and the watchman then said he would swear to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Although your Lordship does not call on the other prisoner, John M'Intosh, for his defence, I think it necessary to state to the court, that he is an apprentice to a reputable tradesman, and has many persons of great consideration to appear to his character; it is a shameful thing they should have brought him here.</p>
               <p>Court. There is not the least imputation upon him.</p>
               <p>Ravenhill. I delivered the watch to the constable of the night; I do not know his name.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Have you the watch? - I have not seen it since that night at Mr. Hyde's office, it was shewn me, but they durst not let me have it.</p>
               <p>Did you see it after it had been pickt up, and before you went to the Justice? - Yes, I did; and at the watch-house.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100011"></xptr>Can you swear it was your watch? - Yes, I can.</p>
               <p>What is the constable's name? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Newman. It appears by the commitment, that his name is David Chrichton.</p>
               <p>Where is he?</p>

               <p>Mr. Peatt. My Lord, if a man will bring an innocent man here, at the risk of his reputation, he ought to be punished.

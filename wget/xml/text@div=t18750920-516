I live at Leytonstone—I have known the prisoner upwards of fifteen years—on the 12th May I was with him and a gentleman named Miller—at that time I was acquainted with Mr. Newport, who keeps the Duke of Edinburgh public-house in Fairfoot Road, Bromley—on 12th May the prisoner handed me this cheque.

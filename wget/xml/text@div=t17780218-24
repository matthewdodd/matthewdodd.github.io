I answered, matter enough; then he flew to the fore-part of the cart, and said, stop this minute, or I will blow your brains out; he clapped a cutlass to my breast.</p>
               <p>Was it light enough to see the cutlass? - Yes; he was close to me; his hand partly touched my breast; he said, blast your bloody eyes, if you offer to turn your head, I will cut it off; I said I had a large family, and begged he would spare my life; then he holoa'd out two or three time, come on, come on; upon which two other persons came up; one came on the off-side of my cart, and the other got into the cart. The prisoner stood over me with a cutlass, with his back to the horse, and his face to me, about a foot and half from me; he held the cutlass</p>
               <p>to my breast; he again blasted my bloody eyes, and said, if you offer to move your head, I will cut it off; I kept begging he would save my life; he made use of such wicked expressions, that I was afraid he would kill me. They took the hempen bag that contained the tea and sugar; the prisoner helped it down out of the cart; the man in the cart took the leather trunk, and gave it to the man on the off-side. The deal box was taken out by the same person. The basket with the earthen-ware was taken out by the same man; the prisoner stood over me all the time with the cutlass; he only helped to take the sack out; they likewise took an empty sack which was found in the prisoner's stable; when they had taken the things out, the prisoner called to one of them, come here, and take this pistol; and, if he stirs, blow his brains out, and I will go and see if all is got off. The man came and stood at the horse's head, and the prisoner went away, and returned again, and said, they were all off, all clear. The man he placed at the horse's head replied, now you may go on; the prisoner replied, No; d - n his eyes, he shall not go on yet; we will cut his reins, otherwise people will think he has not been robbed; the prisoner cut the near horse's rein, and the man who was at the horse's head cut off the horses reins close to their heads. I asked them to let me get down, and tie the horses together; they did, and I tied my horses together, and went home.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner is one of the three persons? - Yes; it was a dark night; I know him by his make, being a square thick made man, and bigger than the other.</p>
               <p>You had never seen him before? - I had not to my knowledge; I was robbed on the Saturday night; on the Sunday morning, I tracked a cart from the end of a lane just by where I was robbed; as I was going home, after I was robbed, I stopped, at a gentleman's, to deliver a message, a little cart went by me in the morning; I enquired if any body had seen a cart; I heard nothing of it till I came to Kingsland.</p>
               <p>When did you hear of the cart? - On Tuesday the man at the Basing-house informed me of the prisoner and the cart. I had before given a description of him; upon<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177802180033"></xptr> this information; I got a search warrant from Mr. Wilmot, and went to Cock-lane with Lee and another, and in the house of the prisoner we found an hempen sack; he said he did not know how the sack came there.</p>
               <p>[The sack was produced in court by Lee, and deposed to by the prosecutor.]</p>
               <p>Was there any body in the house besides the prisoner? - I did not see the prisoner in the house when we made the search; he was taken up on the Thursday. There were two women in the house; I was ordered to go to Mr. Wilmot's, and look at the prisoner; I did, and I said he was one of the men that robbed me.</p>
               <p>How many people were in the room at the Justice's when you went in? - Six or seven. I knew him immediately.</p>
               <p>You got none of your things again but the sack? - No; there were some earthen plates at the Justice's, which the prisoner said came out of my cart; he wanted to be admitted an evidence.</p>
               <p>From the Jury. How long was you detained on the road before they let you go? - I believe a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Did no carriages pass you? - No; it was out of the main road beyond the church.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Did Lee say any thing to you about there being 40 l. reward? - No; he said nothing to me about it.</p>
               <p>Had the prisoner a round hat on when he robbed you? - I cannot say; I could not distinguish his cloaths, only the make of the man; he was stouter than the other two.</p>
               <p>And that is all the reason you have to know him? - By the glimpse of his face, and his changing so many words with me.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect one Wale or Wade, or any body pointing this man out to you? - Nobody pointed him out; I found him out myself.</p>

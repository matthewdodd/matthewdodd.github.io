            . I am a watchman of Hampstead. On the first of January last, at half past four o'clock in the morning, I stopped a cart with a quantity of hay, which the prisoner was driving; I asked him where he brought it from so early in the morning, he told me Edgeware, I asked him how he came there with it, it was quite a contrary road; he told me he brought it through Hendon, and up North End hill, which if he had he must have crossed the box that I was watching, and which I knew he had not done, that gave me reason to suppose the hay was stolen. I then stopped him, he told me that he could call the master of the property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Before he said that, did not you tell him it would be better to confess. - A. Yes, then he called Jem three or four times, the man came, and he refused to be taken; he asked him what occasioned him stopping, he told the watchman, he asked the prisoner to give him the whip out of his hand, to knock me down; making use at the same time of bad language. I pulled out my pistol and took him in custody, and let the prisoner go on with the team; he offered me half a guinea first, then a guinea, not to say any thing about it; I refused to take his money, he told me he brought the hay from Needham, I asked him if he knew the man that was driving the hay, he declared he did not before that morning; he said he was going with the hay to Mr. Price's at North End, and I saw the hay unloaded there.</p>

               <p>Q. Whose team was it. - A. Mr. Price's</p>

               <p>The man that threatened to knock you down has escaped. - A. He has.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you understand from him, that the prisoner was employed by him, and that he was a servant of Mr. Price. - A. Yes.</p>

The Evidence for the King, as it was before taken in the Coroners Inquest, deposed, that Mr. Darcy and Mr. F - meeting near Charing-Cross, Mr. Darcy Accusing Mr. F - for Riding away with his Bridle, Mr. F - satisfied him thereof; upon which Mr. Darcy told Mr. F - he was Indebted to him Six-pence upon the account of a Reckoning, which Mr. F - denying, Mr. Darcy gave him the Lye; upon which Words going out and Drawing upon one another, with their mutual Passes and Tilts they were interchangably Wounded, Mr. Darcy being seen to draw his Sword out of the Body of Mr. F - ; the Evidence for the King and for the Prisoner were very Discongruous in their Relations: About the beginning of the Fight, the Witnesses for the King deposing that Mr. F - first stroke Mr. Darcy a Box on the Ear, and afterward Drew his Sword, provoking Mr. Darcy to Draw likewise, which before Mr. Darcy could do, he was by Mr. F - run into the Side, on which Wound, he was seen to lay his Hand before he Drew his Sword. Mr. Darcy had some Gentlemen spoke very honourably of his Reputation; on the contrary, Mr. F - brought at least five Witnesses, which said that Mr. Darcy gave the first Provocation, striking Mr. F - with his Fist, and likewise Drawing and Stabbing him in the side before he Drew; and that after a short Debate between them, F - Fell, and Mr. Darcy was carryed off,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="16850826004"></xptr>upon which, the Jury after some small Consult brought him in <rs id="t16850826-22-verdict108" type="verdictDescription">

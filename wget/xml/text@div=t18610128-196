My mother was a widow, and lived at 21, Nelson-street, Victoria-dock-road—she was living there on 31st December—her name was Caroline—the prisoner lodged at our house with his wife—there were other lodgers—the prisoner came home on Monday night, 31st December, from 6 o'clock to half-past—he was in drink—he came into the kitchen—the other lodgers were there—he sent out for a pot of ale—I fetched it—my mother was then in the front parlour, locked in the room—after I had fetched the ale the prisoner drank some of it—I do not know what he did after that—I went out of the kitchen soon, and went to where my mother was—the prisoner kept asking for mother—she heard him but did not answer him—she let me in, and after I was in I locked the door again—while I was inside the room with my mother the prisoner came to the door and knocked several times—neither of us answered him—after some time he said he should burst the door open if mother did not open it—my mother said that if he did he should pay for it—the prisoner swore at her—he then burst the door open, and struck her with his fist over the right eye—it was a very serious blow—it did not knock her down—I saw blood; she wiped it off with her apron—upon the blow being struck I rushed off the sofa between my mother and the prisoner—when the blow was struck there was no one in the room but myself and my mother—I called for two young men</p>

               <p>Taylor and Thornton, two of the lodgers, and they came and took him out of the parlour—after that my mother left the room almost directly, and walked into the kitchen—the prisoner was there—he used some very foul language, and said what was in his room was his—my mother said, No, they were hers—she was excited, through the prisoner's language, and one thing and the other—she said she would go out and fetch some one to put a stop to it and she ran out of the kitchen straight into the parlour—after she had gone I heard her fall—the prisoner remained in the kitchen—I went into the parlour directly I heard the fall—I found my mother on the ground, lying flat on her face—I tried to raise her—I found she was insensible—I could not raise her; she was too heavy; she never spoke to me—I never saw her breathing.</p>

               <p>then came out of the parlour into the kitchen; after staying some time, hearing the prisoner coming downstairs again she went into the parlour again and locked the door—the prisoner went and knocked and told her to open the door—she did not answer—I heard no more till the deceased called me and told me to take the prisoner out—I went in and saw him standing with his hand half open—the deceased was in the middle of the room and her daughter by her side—I persuaded him to come out, and he came into the kitchen—his wife told him to go upstairs and not make a fool and laughing-stock of himself there, and he went to the front door—the deceased then came into the kitchen and said she would not stand it any longer—the prisoner came in and said to her, "Have I done anything to you that you should lock the door in my face, a thing your ever did before, when I was drunk or sober; have you any spite to me that you should do so?"—she said, "No, my lad, but when you are drunk I am frightened"—a few more words passed—the prisoner said that every cup and saucer he took his tea in was his own—the deceased then said she would not have it any longer, she would go and fetch some one who should put him out—she left the prisoner standing in the kitchen and went into the parlour and there fell—the daughter followed her and called to me to come in—I went in and saw the deceased lying on the floor with her head on the concertina—I picked her up and saw she had received a blow in the eye—blood was beginning to flow—I laid her on the sofa, got a glass of water, and wiped her eye—I did not know she was dead till two or three more came in—I put the water to her lips—she just gasped at it—when she was in the kitchen she seemed excited and frightened.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of Barking-road—on the night of 31st December, I was sent for to 21, Nelson-street—I found Mrs. Mortlock on the sofa dead—that was about twenty minutes past 8—I examined her, and found a severe contused wound over the left eye, and a scratch over the right eyebrow, and some recent marks of bruises about the arms; no other external appearances—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination on 2nd January, in conjunction with Mr. Taylor—on dissecting the scalp, we found some extravasated blood over the entire portion of the left temporal muscle, corresponding to the seat of injury, the mark over the left eyebrow—on opening the head, I found the membranes of the brain much injected, and the convolutions much congested; the ventricles were gorged with sanguino-serous fluid in clots—the entire surface of the brain, and also the base of the brain, was covered with clots of blood—there was no other appearance in the head—the other portions of the body were healthy—the liver was slightly enlarged, and there was some gall stone in the gall bladder—the mark over the left eye was a contused wound—it was a slight wound—the skin was very slightly broken in five or six places—I should say that a blow from a man's fist would have produced it—I believe the cause of death to be extravasation of blood within and around the brain—taking into consideration the great excitement the woman was under, I believe that a slight blow would cause the mischief that I saw—insensibility might come on within a few minutes after the blow was struck—excitement after the blow would hasten the insensibility, supposing the injury to have been caused by the blow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> That is, in other words, if the blood had set in to the brain, the excitement would be the predisposing cause of that, and continue as long as it lasted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Of course excitement would tend to increase the tendency of blood-vessels to rupture—I do not attribute the death to the scratch over the right eyebrow—I think that had nothing whatever to do with it—I have listened attentively to the evidence given by the two last witnesses—I heard what was said about the concertina, that the woman was discovered with her left eye resting on it—I should say that the appearance I saw, was caused more by a blunt object than by a concertina—what I saw was more like the blow of a fist—I would not take upon myself to say it was impossible for the concertina to have inflicted what I saw—I should not attribute the death to the excitement alone; it might have been caused by great excitement, there was a possibility of it—you can distinguish a laceration of the brain or the membranes by excitement, and by a violent blow—I know what is understood by a counter-stroke—a violent blow given on the front of the head will very often cause death by a rupture at the back—you generally, where death is caused by over-excitement, find the appearances which I found on this person; a general suffusion of the</p>

               <p>surface of the brain, and also clots at the base—I could not say in this case that death was more consistent with excitement than with the blow—she might become insensible from excitement itself, without the blow.</p>

I am a surgeon at Stratford—I was present at the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I perfectly agree with Mr. Morris as to the state of the brain—in my judgment, the cause of death was the effusion of serum and blood in and upon the substance and surface of the brain, pressure on and within the brain—I think the excitement and the blow together would produce the appearance I saw; but I do not consider that the violence of the blow, as evidenced by the external appearance, would account for the fatal appearance exhibited inside the brain—I do not think the blow was sufficiently violent to produce the fatal lesion—I am not speaking from the mark of the blow, but from the gravity of the internal lesion compared with the evidence of violence—excitement very probably caused it—excitement produced by a quarrel would occasion the appearances I saw—a blow would certainly aggravate the mischief.</p>

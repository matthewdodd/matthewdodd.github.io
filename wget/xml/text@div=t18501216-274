                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, S</hi> 296). On 2nd Dec. I was on duty in Acre-lane, near King's Cross—I saw Goodman come out of the dust-yard at twenty minutes past eleven o'clock—he bad these two pieces of timber—I watched him to a beer-shop kept by Hiron—I saw him go into the house, and be returned in half a minute, with Hiron—Hiron took up this large piece of timber—he said, "This is a fine piece of wood, I shall give you a pot for this"—Goodman said, "Here is another piece"—Hiron said, "I shall give you a pint for that"—Hiron took the large piece, and carried it to the wash-house, and Goodman took the other, and followed him; both the pieces were thrown into the wash-house—the two prisoners then went into the beer-shop—I stood in the road, and saw Goodman drinking from a pint-pot, in front of the bar—he then came into the road, and I said, "What was it you took to the beer-shop?"—he said, "Nothing"—I said, "I know better than that"—he then said, "If the truth must be told, I have taken two pieces of timber"—I said, "Whose is it?"—he said, "My master's; I am watchman to Mr. Jay"—I told him he must go with me—he said, "What for?"—I said, "You know what for, these two pieces of timber"—he said, "Let me go back to fasten up the shed, where the tools are"—I took him to the wash-house, and showed him the two pieces of timber—he then said, "Here is a bottle of beer that I had for it"—I took the bottle from him, this is it, I then went to the front-door, and saw Hiron—I said to him, "I have taken this man for stealing two pieces of timber belonging to his master"—he said, "I gave a pot of beer for it"—I said, "You gave three pints"—he said, "Drink the beer, and have some more to it"—I said that was not the way I did my business—I took Goodman, and went next morning to Hiron, and told him to go before the Magistrate, as a witness; and then, by the Magistrate's order, he was placed at the bar.</p>

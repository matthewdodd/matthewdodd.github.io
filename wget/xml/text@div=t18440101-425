I live at Layton, in Essex, and am a woollen-draper—I have lately removed from a house at Bromley—I employed Mr. Single, an auctioneer, to sell some property at that house for me—amongst it was a double-barrelled gun, belonging to Mr. Thomas Lea—it did not fetch the price that Mr. Lea bad fixed on it, and it was left there amongst the property—I went with Mr. Lea to the premises after the sale, and saw the gun on the premises—I was informed it was not sold—I saw Thomas Hindley place it in the china-closet, at the end of the dining-room—he locked it up there, and I believe put the key into his pocket—I had some wine-glasses in the sale—the sale was over when I went there—I found Hindley and his son there, a boy who was in my own employ, and the prisoner, who was a policeman—I left them on the premises.</p>

"—I said, "Why you ought to have brought it back, if you had taken it away, when I taxed you with it the next morning "—he said, "Well, it is in your hands; I have lost my character and my situation; but if you will apply to Mr. Riles to withdraw the charge, I will give up the gun "—I spoke to Mr. Riles, and he said it was out of his power to make any such promise, it was not his own.</p>

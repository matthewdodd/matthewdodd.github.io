             sworn. - I live at Enfield; the prisoner at the bar offered me a side of mutton to sell, on Tuesday the 14th of last month; I unlocked the shop door, and he brought it into the shop, and I thought he had stole it; I asked him, what he asked for it, if I got a customer; he said, three-pence a pound; I told him, there was another butcher a little lower, perhaps he might buy it of him; it weighed four stone two pounds; accordingly, as I thought he had stole it, I went to a Magistrate; I am a headborough; and he ordered me to take him directly into custody; accordingly I took him, and put him into the watch-house; afterwards, I took him before the Magistrate, and he asked him how he came by that mutton; he told the Magistrate, he had bought it out of a drove; the Magistrate asked him if he would enlist for a soldier, and he did enlist; and he and the soldiers soon got thro' the mutton; he was examined by the doctor, and he would not do for them; and I had him in my custody again; I very soon after heard of the robbery. I had this apron from the prisoner, which Mr. Newman has sworn to be his property. (Produces it).</p>

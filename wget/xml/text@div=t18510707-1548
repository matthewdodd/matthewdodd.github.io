                  </hi>. I live in Esher-street, Kennington. On Saturday morning, 21st June, I was standing outside Vauxhall-gardens—I saw two gentlemen together, and the prisoner and another person with him—the person who was with the prisoner spoke to one of the gentlemen, and asked if he wanted a fly—I should say that the prisoner could bear what was said—I saw the prisoner take a handkerchief from the gentleman's pocket and run away with it—I told the gentleman—he ran after him and called, "Stop thief!"—I ran too, and saw the policeman pick up this handkerchief in the way the prisoner had run—I do not know who the gentleman was.</p>

I was on duty near Vauxhall-gardens; I heard a cry of "Stop thief!" and saw the prisoner detained—he was given into my custody by a gentleman, for picking his pocket of a handkerchief—I found the handkerchief in the road—the gentleman identified it—the prisoner was with me at that time—the gentleman went to the station and gave the name John Baldwin, 20, Stamford-street—I have not found him since—I have been to two No. 20's, and could not find any such person.</p>

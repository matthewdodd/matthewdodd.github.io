On Sunday night, 29th October, I was on duty in uniform in the New Cut about 2 o'clock; my attention was drawn to a gentleman's hat, which was knocked off—I saw the four prisonen there and others; I asked them what they meant by knocking the gentleman'i hat over his eyes—they said they did not do it—the gentleman said that he did not know which of them did it—I told them they had better go a was Carter, Wadey and Davis used very bad language—they went away aften a few minutes down the street; I followed them—they went down Windmil Street, and Davis turned to the right down Little Windmill Street—as soon as he turned the corner I got to the corner, and a brick came and struck me and knocked my helmet off—Davis was the only person who could hare thrown it because the others had gone straight on—he said "Take that you f——old <hi rend="italic">sod"</hi> and went into No. 13; I followed him into a room on the first floor, where there was another man in bed—I took Davis out into the street—he was very violent when he got out—there was a Jmob there of twelve or fourteen people; my helmet was then on; I had picked it up. Davis said "Let the <hi rend="italic">copper</hi> have it! give him a doing "—I kept hold of Davis, and Evans and Carter got hold of him and tried to pull him and, saying "Let the man go "—they pulled him; I still kept hold of him and called the by standers to assist me, but nobody came—there were then twenty or thirty people there, Wadey had hold of me trying to pull me away—Davis then got his head between my legs and bit a piece right out of my thigh, above me knee—he bit a piece out of my trowsers and a piece of flesh outof my leg; it bled—he threw me on the ground—he had a struggle on the ground, and he said "Let him have it Wadey! knock his bleeding face in"—Wadey was close to him—my face was not bleeding, that was only an expression—Wadey kicked me across the forehead while I was on the ground, making a wound about 2 inches long right to the bone; it bled; I become insensible and Davis got away—I was also kicked on the left ear when Davis got up, and I believe it was by Davis—it made my ear bleed—I became insensible; Davis got away from me and the next I remember was when I was in the Kennington Road police-station, about 11 o'clock—Carter and Evans were holding Davis, and they rescued him—I saw Wadey, Carter, and Evans in custody at the station that night; I knew them before, I had seen them about—I picked Davis out on the next Monday week from ten or a dozen persons; I knew him by sight—I have no doubt that the prisoners are the four men—I was confined to bed eight days, and attended by a surgeon every day for a fortnight—I suffered very much pain—I have not been able to resume duty—I am very weak; I lost such a deal of blood.</p>

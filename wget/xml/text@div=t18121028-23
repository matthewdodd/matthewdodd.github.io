               <p>Q. In the beginning of the month of September had you any corn come in - A. Yes, several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, before you laid the corn in the granary, spread any black oats on the floor - A. Yes, about six bushels of black oats, and on the 8th of September I received thirty quarters of white oats, and ten quarters of foreign barley, with a mixture of tares in it. I mixed the black and white oats, and the barley, altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. What night were you robbed - A. Between the 9th and the 10th. On the 9th I left the granary between six and seven. I made my corn up in a regular heap, and mixed the corn together. The next morning, about six o'clock, I went to the granary. I found the corn in a different state. I marked the boards where the corn came to. I missed a great quantity. I informed Mr. Roberts of it.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181210280046"></xptr> WILLIAM CHAMBERLAIN. On the morning of the 11th of September I went to search the prisoner's stable. The prisoner was in the stable. I told him, I had a search warrant to search his stable for corn that had been stolen from Mr. Roberts's granary. He told me, I was welcome to search where I pleased. He said, he had got no corn, nor never had, of Mr. Roberts's, in his life. Mr. Roberts then came up. The prisoner told Mr. Roberts he never had any corn of his. He said, he would shew me what he had. He brought a sample out of the bin, for Mr. Robert's inspection. Mr. Roberts said, there was some of his corn in that sample. I went to the bin and thrust my hand down. I brought out a considerable quantity of corn. Mr. Roberts saw it. He declared it to be his corn. I asked the prisoner how he came by it, and told him, I must search his loft, and in his loft I found two sacks full, which Mr. Roberts said he would swear to. In these sacks was a mixture of black and white oats, barley, and tares. This is one of the sacks I found in the prisoner's loft.</p>

             denied having any corn on his premises whatever, and particularly that he never had any of my corn, not so much as a bushel; that was his expression. He went to a corn-bin, and brought a double handful of chaff, with some corn mixed with it. The officer searched the corn-bin, and I know it to be my corn, because there were three sorts of corn, with chaff. In the loft we found two sacks completely full of my corn, of the same mixture. I have no doubt of it being my corn. The barley is foreign barley, and the tares came in it: and in a hog-trough we found this quantity of corn; and at the price of seventy shillings a quarter, no person could feed geese. It would cost a great deal of money to fatten geese upon oats.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am quite innocent of stealing these oats. On the evening they were stolen I came home very tipsy. My wife undressed me, and put me to bed. She can prove that, and that the man ringed me up at five o'clock in the morning on being obliged to put five horses in the stable. Any person could put any thing in my stable; the door was open.</p>

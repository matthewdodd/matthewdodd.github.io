            . I am a private in the 7th Dragoon-guards. On the 13th of December, at nine o'clock at night, I was sentinel in the St. John's-wood barrack-stable yard, and saw the prisoner return from town to his barracks - he went to his own stable, and immediately he opened the door a mare ran out loose - she got by me, and I went after her - I was driving her back, and saw the prisoner go out at the gate, at the other end of the stable-yard, mounted on another horse - I asked where he was going - he said to catch the mare that was loose - I saw no more of him - I had not then been able to drive the mare back - the prisoner is a private in the 15th Hussars - it was a bay-gelding belonging to 3d Dragoon-guards that he rode away with - the same gelding came back about a week afterwards - I did not see him again till he was brought back by an escort.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How long have you known him? A. Seven months - he had been sent to learn a new sword exercise, in order to instruct his regiment, which is in Ireland - he was not perfectly sober when he came from town.</p>

            . I am a private in the 3d Dragoon-guards. On the 19th of December I was sent to Hussgreen - I found this gelding there at the Queen's Head public-house on the 21st of December, and brought it away on the 22d, and took it to the St. John's-wood barracks - it belonged to a corporal of the 3d Guards, and was a regimental horse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose before you got to Hussgreen, you made inquiries? A. Yes; I did not hear of its having been offered for sale on the road - I believe he gave information where the horse was to be found.</p>

            . I am hostler at the Queen's Head, Huss-green. On the 15th of December, between one and three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came there on a bay-gelding, which he tied up in the front of the house; he came in, and seeing he had spurs on, I asked if he wanted his horse put into the stable; he said, No, it would do where it was - a serjeant of the 8th Hussars, who was there, said, "Why, you belong to the 15th Hussars, which are laying in Ireland; what brings you here?" he said he had got an officer on leave of absence, at Roberts'-bridge, which is two miles off, and was going to see him - he then said he should walk to Roberts'-bridge, and should leave his horse - he desired me to feed and clean it - he said he should be back in an hour or an hour and a half, if he could get his business done, and should get back eight miles nearer town to sleep that night - he followed me out, and told me to take great care of the horse, for it was very malicious, and might hurt me - he went away, and never returned - Williams took the same horse away on the 22d of December.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he in his military dress? A. In a sort of undress - the serjeant went towards him, as if he took him for a deserter; he then said he had an officer at Roberts'-bridge - Huss-green is in the direct road, between town and Hastings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was very much intoxicated; but remember going to the stable-door, and the horse ran out - I immediately mounted another horse to catch it; but not succeeding, I went to see my relations - if I had wished to have sold it, I had plenty of opportunities - I immediately told the officer where the horse was.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's uncle, and live in the Paragon, New Kent-road; I am a merchant - his father and mother live at Hastings. On the 13th of December, about eleven o'clock at night, the prisoner called on me on horseback - he was very much intoxicated, and almost in a mad state - I could scarcely understand<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182701110036"></xptr>what he came for - when he left me, he rode round the Pargaon very fast - the horse seemed to trip, and he fell off - he returned, and borrowed a few shillings of me - I reprimanded him, for he was very drunk.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Horspool. I purchased a watch at Mr. Carter's shop, in Tooley-street; the prisoner sold it to me; I paid him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—I went to the shop again about three or four days afterwards, because the watch stopped—when I got there, the prisoner said the hands had stuck—I afterwards went again with the watch, because the glass kept constantly coming out—that was three or four days after the hands had stuck—I brought it back to my house.</p>

                  </hi> The prisoner was in my service—it was his duty to manage the shop in Tooley-street—it was his duty to keep books of the transactions in that shop—if a customer bought a watch he should enter it—this is the book which he kept—here is no entry in it, from 16th Aug. till 29th Sept., of any watch sold to Horspool, or to any one else, for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have carefully looked through the book—he has never accounted to me for that 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—having received a communication, I went to the prisoner on 14th Oct., and charged him with robbery and embezzlement—I had heard he was in difficulties—I upbraided him with his conduct, and told him I should feel it my duty to give him into custody—he begged me not to do so—I reminded him that this was not the first time he had been in difficulties—he left the room, went up stairs, locked himself in his bed room, and cut his throat.</p>

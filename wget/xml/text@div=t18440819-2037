                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Harewood, and live in Pool-street, New North-road. About half-past one o'clock, on the 12th of July, the prisoner came, and purchased a pennyworth of pudding—he gave me half-a-crown—I was not able to give him change—I gave the half-crown to John Haynes, and sent him out for change—John Foster, after that, brought me a bad half-crown—I kept it till the next day, when the prisoner came again, and bought a quarter of a pound of pork—I recollected him—he gave me a half-crown—I gave it to the boy to go and get change, and after the boy was gone I said to the prisoner, "I think you were here yesterday"—he said, "I am quite sure I was not, I was ill in bed"—he ran away before the boy came back with the half-crown.</p>

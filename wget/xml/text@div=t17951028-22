On the 28th of September the prisoner came into my house, I don't know what day of the week, about eight at night, and asked for a pint and penny worth of beer; I was then in my bar, I called the maid to draw the pint and penny worth of beer, which she did, and put it into a quart pot; I see her deliver it into her hand; my maid asked her where she was going with that pot? she said, to No. 2, next door. The maid suspecting her, she watched her home; I see her follow her out of doors, but I did not know then that she meant to watch her home; I remained without doing any thing further, till between nine and ten o'clock, when my pots were very short, having had about ten pounds worth stolen in about a fortnight; when I sent my 
maid after the pot; she denied to the maid that she had 
any pot, and I went to the woman myself.</p>


               <p>Q. How long was this after the maid followed her out of doors? - About three quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner's room? - In the back garret, No. 7, Stacy-street, the same street. I asked her for my pot; and she said, she had no pot, neither did she know any thing of me nor of my house. While I was speaking to the woman, a woman, whose name was Edwards, came up stairs, and said, Mr. Nurse, here is your pot, thrown out of window. It was picked up by one Mrs. Cadwell, in the adjoining yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did this conversation pass? - On the stair case, close to her garret door. I then charged the watch with her immediately. The metal was then hot when it was brought up to me. I went to the watch-house with her. I cannot swear to the metal, only my pot was never forth coming. I returned from the watch-house with the watchman, and desired them to go with me to her garret; the woman of the house went up in the garret with me; Mr. Edwards, who keeps the house, told me that that was the garret that woman lived in.</p>
               <p>Q. And that was in her presence? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find in this garret? - The frying-pan in which from its appearance<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280039"></xptr> the metal was melted in, some of the metal is now in the pan; I took the pan and carried it to the watch-house where I left it, and it remained till Saturday in the hands of the constable, who took charge of her, when he brought it to me and delivered it up, as he said there no occasion for his attendance. I have brought it here.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the same pan that was returned? - That is the very pan.(The pan and metal produced.)</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner in the house? - Yes; I drew her the beer myself; she told me it was going to No.9, three times over.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give her the beer in? - A quart pot. I watched to see whether she went to No. 9, and she went to No. 7; I watched her up one pair of stairs myself.</p>
               <p>Q. She took away the pot with her? - Yes; she had not drank the liquor. About three quarters of an hour after I went and asked her for the pot; and she said she had never a one; she was not in her own room then, she was in the next woman's room; I told her I must have it and I should not leave the house till I had it. I immediately went to my master, and my master came up to her; I went and fetched my master, and my master and me went up together; my master insisted on having the pot found, and this woman brought the metal up, and my master charged the watch with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any metal? - Yes. There was some metal found in a pail of water; that was after the prisoner was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. There was some conversation in the passage about some; did you hear that conversation? - Yes; Mrs. Edwards came up and said, Mr. Nurle, here is your pot, thrown out of window just now. She brought up the piece of pewter.</p>

               <p>Q. Should you know this piece of pewter again? - Not to swear to it; it looked like this.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did this piece of pewter feel warm at the time? - Yes, there was a warmth on it, and I gave it into the hands of Mrs. Aldridge, and she took it and gave it to Mrs. Edwards; Mrs. Aldridge said there was warmth in it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. In the first place I don't live in the room, nor does it belong to me, I only went to see an acquaintance that I knew lived there; I don't live in the house at all. I was only brought here yesterday, and I had no notice of coming, or a very short notice, and I have not had time to send for my friends.</p>

               <p>Q. Was she your servant?</p>
               <p>Booth. No, she was not. I had not missed any thing: a watchman in St. Giles's stopp'd the prisoner with the things mention'd. She wrote a letter, and sent it me; I went, the box was in the custody of the constable, lock'd as it had been in my house, with the things in it. The prisoner was there; I said nothing to her, nor she to me. [The things produced in court, and depos'd to.] I never knew any thing amiss of her in my life before.</p>

            , I am a watchman. I was calling one o'clock, the prisoner had pitched this box near the alms-houses by St. Giles's Church, I ask'd her, what she had got there? she said, what was that to me. I took her to the constable of the night. The next morning she wanted somebody to go to Salisbury-street, and I went for her to the prosecutor.</p>

               <p>Garson. She wanted me to go for the prosecutor, for him to come to her.</p>

               <p>I did lodge in the next room to the prosecutor: my landlady and I had a few words: I had a box there, and I took this by mistake instead of my own.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Kingsland, and am a town traveller. On Friday, 25th Aug., I was on Camberwell-green, about 5 o'clock—I saw the two prisoners together talking—I passed them, and went into Mr. Smith's shop—after I had been there a few minutes Daley came in, and asked to look at some gloves in the window—she bought a pair for 9 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and gave a half crown—change was given her, and she left the shop, and joined the other prisoner—I examined the half crown—I then followed the prisoners for three quarters of a mile, to the White Hart, Southampton-street, Camberwell—I went in there—the prisoners were having some refreshment—Daly nudged Williamson, and I saw something in his hand—I walked round, took a black glove from him, and found in it five half crowns—I detained him, and sent for a constable—Daly had left the door, and the potman fetched her back again—Williamson said the money was never in his possession at all, and that I tried to get up a Mint case—Daly was within hearing when he said that—I gave the money to the police constable.</p>

On 25th Aug., I saw the prisoners brought into the Camberwell station for uttering a counterfeit half crown, at the shop of Mr. Smith—Williamson said he had accidentally met Daly, but he had no knowledge of her—Daly said the same as he did, that she knew nothing of him, but when he asked her to go and have some drink, she went—she gave her address in the Wandsworth-road, and said she was an artificial flower maker—I inquired, and she was not known there—I received this half crown from Mr. Smith, and these, other five from Mr. shepherd.</p>

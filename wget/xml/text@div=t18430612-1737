                  </hi>. I live on Holborn-bridge. On the 16th of May, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I was passing Newcastle-court, Strand, coming from Lincoln's-inn-fields—I saw the prisoner standing at a door alone—she suddenly snatched an umbrella from my hand, and went into the house with it—I followed, and demanded it—the door was immediately shut, and two females came, wishing to know what I wanted—I requested them to return my umbrella; and soon after three or four more came, accom<lb></lb>paniedby two men—they struck me several times, and the men struck me at the conclusion, when they had got all the money I could give them—they demanded the money I had about me—the women struck me several times—the prisoner was one—they demanded my money, which I gave them—it was from 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was compelled to part with it through fear—they then opened the door—I left, and fetched a policeman into the house—we de<lb></lb>manded the umbrella of the prisoner—the others had left the house—the po<lb></lb>liceman got the umbrella—I believe it was behind the door, where she first put it, he took her—I was struck once or twice after they got my money—the umbrella belonged to Henry Smith.</p>

               <p>persons in the different rooms when I went with the policeman—I was very much alarmed—I do not think I went into more than one room—the prisoner met us on the landing place, and denied having the umbrella—I have seen respectable ladies go that way, with a man-servant after them—I did not offer the people in the house the money, they demanded it—I forced myself out of the house—I offered the money, or I should not get out—they demanded it, and I gave it them—the prisoner was committed for stealing the umbrella—I stated these particulars to the Magistrate.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable F</hi> 92.) On the 5th of May I was on duty in Picket-street—the prosecutor spoke to me, and took me to Newcastle-court—I went into the house with him, into three or four rooms, we saw people in each room, and asked him if those were the parties who stole the umbrella—he said, "No"—on coming out we met the prisoner on the landing—he said, "That is the woman who stole my umbrella"—I asked her for it—she said she knew nothing of it; but when she found I was going to take her to the station she said she would give me the umbrella, and, at the bottom of the stairs, she put her hand round the corner of the staircase, and took it from inside the door in the passage, against the wall—I could not see when I went in—I took her to the station.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> There was no charge of robbery with violence then? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He gave her in charge for stealing the umbrella—he was sober—he might have been drinking, but was not the worse for liquor—most of the houses in this court are bad—it is the shortest way to New Boswell-court—it might make a minute's difference—he said nothing to me at the time about being knocked about, and robbed of 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—his face was cut, and his eye black—he did not complain to me of that being done there.</p>

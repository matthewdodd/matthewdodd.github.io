            . I am an officer. About nine o'clock in the evening I saw the prisoner, with two others, go up to Mr. Browne's shop; a young man was cleaning the windows; one of them went by the side of the ladder, as if to take his attention. The prisoner and another, who he called Frank, immediately ran off towards Drury-lane; I suspected they had something, and followed them to an archway, where I seized the prisoner, and called out some name, to make them think I had somebody at hand; he called out, "Frank, muzzle him," and he immediately attacked me - he was fighting me all the way down to the Coal-yard; I saw a door open, pushed him in, and left him in charge of the man of the house, while I went after the other, but he got away; it was Frank who took the shawl, and put it into his hat - but under the archway he took it out, and was showing it to the prisoner; I seized it: the prisoner was at the doorway with him.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming up Holborn, and fell in company with Frederick Bentley and James Rush; I asked where they lived - they said they had nothing to do; that they had been out two nights, and had a good mind to steal something to get a lodging; Rush took the shawl - they ran, and I followed, fearing I should be taken; he was showing it to Bentley, by the gateway.</p>

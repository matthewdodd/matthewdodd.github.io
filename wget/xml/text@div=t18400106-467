                  </hi>I am bailiff to Jane Gammon, a farmer at Staines—she had a turkey that used to roost on some pales—it was very large, and in good condition—I missed it on the morning of the 1st of January—I then traced foot-marks to the prisoner's house, he lives adjoining our premises—he is a sawyer—he had seen the turkey every day, I dare say—the feet-marks had nails and tips on the heels, and a plate on the toes—I traced them to the prisoner's house, from the place where the turkey used to roost—when the prisoner was taken I saw his shoes, and they tallied exactly with the marks on the road—he said he had no such thing as a turkey in the house—I found several parts of turkey meat cut up, and it had been skinned, not plucked—all the feathers were gone but one—I could not swear to the marks of his shoes, but they were very much like them.</p>

                  </hi>I am inspector of the Staines police. I went on Thursday morning about this—on the road I met the prisoner—I said he was suspected of stealing this turkey—he said he knew nothing of it—I said, "The foot-marks have been traced to your house"—I took him to the place where the foot-marks were, and measured his feet, and found they answered in every respect to the marks—I asked him if he had any turkey in his house—he said, "No, nothing like it"—I went into his</p>

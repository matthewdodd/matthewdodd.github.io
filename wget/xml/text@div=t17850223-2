               <p>Where did you see them? - At a public house in Jewry-street, one May Cook was with them; he told me there was a ship done with dollars, but they would not stir in it till the noise was over.</p>
               <p>What does done signify? - I understood it was a ship that was robbed of dollars, they asked what we would give apiece; my brother Solomons said, he would give three shillings apiece, and they said they could make three shillings and nine pence of one Wolfe.</p>
               <p>Who did you pay the money to? - To Miles, a ten pound Bank-note; the next day, I told Miles my brother had sent that ten pounds to him, concerning the watches my brother had of him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. You had no dealings or transactions with either of them yourself? - None at all.</p>

               <p>Why Mr. Johnson, what did they ask about Payne? - They asked whether Payne<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230010"></xptr> was taken up and put in Newgate for dollars, and we told them yes.</p>

            . I am a police officer of Hatton-garden. On the 16th of March, between six and seven in the evening, the prisoner was coming down Cow-cross with another man, with a bag on his back; he went into an old iron shop, kept by one Newman, he acted very cautious before he went in, and turned round to see if any one was looking after him; I do not think he could see me, I was standing in the door-way of the public house opposite; the prisoner went right in the iron shop; I followed him. The other man went away then; when I got into the shop I laid hold of the prisoner, I said my friend what have you got here; he said he had only got some bits of iron; I said I must see what it is; he said it was his own property, he brought them from home; I saw it contained copper and brass, I told him he must go along with me.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of these things - A. Nothing whatever; the prisoner was one of our porters. We had a sale at Woburn-mews.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether you had any such things for sale - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. There is nothing of them in the catalogue - A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Very likely, there is many things in a sale left out in a catalogue - whose property were these things - A. The late Mr. Scrimshaw's, a stone mason and builder; they were to be sold by order of the executors.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a disposing power over these things - A. Yes; on the 16th of March, the sale was to finish in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. to Brine. You say you was in the possession of this yard, were Mr. Scrimshaw's things there for the purpose of sale - A. Yes; I saw this backband; when I was there I observed that this backband was not in the catalogue, to the other porter; these bolts I recollect, and all the things were like what was there; I told the other porter I should purchase them myself.</p>

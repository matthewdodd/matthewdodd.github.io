                  </hi>. I live at No. 68, White Horse-street, lambeth I have known the deceased, William Walker, these four or five years he was a carman—I saw him alive the last time on the 24th of May, about eight o'clock, in the Hogs public-house, Broadwall, Surrey—I was him come in, he was rather tipsy—the prisoner was sitting on the opposite side of the tap-room—Walker crossed over to him, and said, "Ben, have you got any beer?"—the prisoner said, "Yes, will you drink, Bill"—after he drank, Walker began to quarrel with him—they only had work in the tap-room—the landlord stepped in—the prisoner begged the de<lb></lb>ceased to be quiet several times, but he would not—the landlord said, "Now, Bill, be quiet; if not, one or other of you shall go out"—he would not be quiet, and the landlord put him out—he was outside about ✗ minutes—I then observed the landlord let him in, on his saying he would be quiet—he went across the room to Burlingson again, and began with him, and caught hold of Burlingson's pint of beer, and flung part of it over the landlord, and part over Burlingson—they went to very high words, and Walker said'to him, "Come outside, if you will, I will have a <hi rend="italic">turn-up</hi> with you"—he said so three or four times—Walker went out and the prisoner begged him to be quiet—he did not want to fight at all—he was very much averse to it—but Walker went out to fight, and the prisoner went out at last—there was no fighting, it was merely catching bold other and throwing down—Walker threw the prisoner down at the them first falls—I thought he had broken his back at the first fall, but they met together again, and Walker had the next fall, and that was all I saw of it—he fell on the main road, not on any curb—it was a macdamised road—there were no seconds—the moment he fell, I went in and fineshed my beer—it was a regular throw—he fell upon his head—he because in<lb></lb>sensible, and not able to speak—he was not ill used at all when he was down—there was no foul play at all—the prisoner was a little in liquer the other man seemed to be giving a great dfeal of provocation—the pri<lb></lb>soner begged of him to let him alone.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the father of the deceased. I was not at the public-house—I saw the prisoner and him together after it commenced—I was called out, and found my son in the act of fighting—I met him, stoping he was coming home—I clasped him round the middle, and begged him to come home, but he would stay and fight—he broke out of my arms and became entangled with the prisoner—I saw them fall both together three times, and believe the prisoner had the worst of it—I did not see my son fall, for I was pushed away, and did not see the last fall—I went to him after he was down, and found him insensible—he appeared to be hurt in the back part of the head—I helped to take him home—this was near nine o'clock in the evening—I put him to bed comfortably—no surgeon saw him that night—and the next morning we thought he got better, but he died on the 22nd of June—beleived a month and one day—the surgeon, first saw him on the Saturday morning, as it happened on Thursday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an assistant to Mr. Doubleday, a surgeon. I was called in to the deceased on the morning of the 26th of May, and found him in a state of stupor—on examining him I found a slight confusion on the side of his head about two inches above the left other—I bled bun—inflammation of the brain was coming on—he lived till the 22nd of June—he improved a little about a fortnight after I first saw him, hat the same symptoms of mischief about the head continued—we did not examine the body after death—he had first of all concussion of the brain—inflammation followed that, accompanied by fever, and that inflammation was the cause of. death—I do not know whether there was any abscess—I have no doubt at all that his death was caused by the fall—the Coroner asked if we thought a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination necessary, but we had no doubt of tea being caused by the fall, and the friends objected to it.</p>

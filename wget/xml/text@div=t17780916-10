               <p>I am a solicitor. Having the honour to be particularly acquainted with Mr. Nevill, I was consulted by Mr. Nevill and Mrs. Cox about this matter; I advised Mr. Nevill to take up this man; he was taken to Sir

            's on Monday the 17th of August; I attended; Sir John examined him, and finding him contradict himself once or twice, he was searched; and in the lining of his hat, betwen the lining and the crown, were found concealed the property in quession; they have been in my possession ever since: the prisoner appeared to be very tenacious of his hat; this created a suspicion that they were concealed in his hat.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>On one Sunday, as Mrs. Cox has said, my master ordered me to make his baggage ready and to go to the country. I went up into my master's dressing-room, and not finding my powder sack and comb as customary, I then went to my master's bed-chamber, and found the sack of powder and the combs in a table-cloth wrapped up together: I wrapped up the sack of powder and the combs in that table-cloth that was upon the table; after that, I took down that table-cloth to wrapped up and put it into the baggage that belonged to my master's I had the key of the trunk that was shut up, and I put the trunk behind the carriage; this happened in the day-time. When I attended my master at night to put him to bed as customary, I found that I had put up these things by mistake; finding these things put there by mistake which I knew nothing of before, and knowing them to belong to the lady, thinking that the lady was to go upon the journey with us; but I did not find an opportunity of delivering them again which I intended. The portmantua was put behind the carriage as usual. The lady next morning took a post chaise to return to London. When the lady came to London, she found, as really it was, that the jewels were missing; she wrote a letter to Mr. Nevill, who wrote one to me, to inquire whether I had seen the effects belonging to the lady, and to examine my portmantua. As I found my master wanted to examine into my things, I thought the best way would be to put them apart, and give them myself to the lady on my return to London, but had no opportunity of coming as I staid upwards of six weeks in the country. I was threatened to be carried to Mr. Wilkinson's. I had them about me in my pocket, intending to put them in the same room where I had taken them from by mistake; but I had not time on my arrival at London. I was conducted immediately to Mr. Wilkinson's; at Mr. Wilkinson's, a gentleman interrogated me several times; as that gentleman did not understand French, he thought proper to have me conducted to justice Fielding's; when I understood I was going there, I put the jewels into my hat, intending on my return, to put them in the place I had taken them from.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did you live there?</p>
               <p>E. Trotter. I lodged there about a fortnight; on the 12th of February last I went to Hampstead, to live <rs id="t17600416-14-viclabel91" type="occupation">servant</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17600416-14-victim163 t17600416-14-viclabel91"></join> there.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the things you left at Mrs. Turner's?</p>
               <p>E. Trotter. There were in my box there one linen shift, one pair of white cotton stockings, one pair of laced ruffles, three linen caps, one white linen handkerchief, one cotton stomacher, a diaper napkin, and a great many things that are not in the indictment. I was at Mrs. Turner's on the first or second of March, and to the best of my knowledge they were all safe then; I return'd to Hampstead, after staying there one night, and came to town again on the 12th of March, about seven in the evening; Mrs. Turner was not then in her lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>E. Trotter. Yes; she is a relation or an acquaintance of a fellow servant of mine at Mr. Pelham's.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see her on the 12th of March?</p>
               <p>E. Trotter. She was a lodger in the same room where my box stood; she came up stairs and open'd the door of the room, took a candle out of the closet, and went down stairs and lighted it; then I saw my box was standing open.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you lock'd it when you saw it last before that?</p>
               <p>E. Trotter. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the box broke open, or was it open'd by a false key?</p>
               <p>E. Trotter. The nails were drawn, and I missed all the things mention'd in the indictment out of the box. I went to 'squire Ingrim's, where there was a person who said she had a strong suspicion of Abigail, and said she would go with me and talk to her, to see if we could get her to own it. We went the next morning, call'd her out and told her, we suspected her to be the person who had taken the things, but she protested she knew nothing of them. The maid of the house was taken up, and carried before justice Wright, on the 12th of March; the prisoner went along with me to get the warrant, but there was nothing proved against her, and she was discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any of your goods again?</p>
               <p>E. Trotter. Yes, we did, at Mr. Powell's a pawn broker ( a parcel of goods produced in court.) These are my property, and what I left in my box when I went out on the first or second of March.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to find the things out?</p>

            , whom she had sent with them, discover'd it to me, and went to the pawnbroker's with me, where we found them.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner-say for herself, when she was taken up?</p>
               <p>Trotter. She then said she took the things out of my box.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she say this?</p>
               <p>Trotter. This was before she was carried before the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say then how and when she took them?</p>
               <p>Trotter. She said she took them out of my box on the first of March, when I went out, and left it open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go out and leave it open?</p>
               <p>Trotter. I do not remember my going out then and leaving it open.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say before the justice?</p>
               <p>Trotter. There she own'd she had taken them.</p>

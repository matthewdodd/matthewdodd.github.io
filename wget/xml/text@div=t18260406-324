The prisoner used my house in January last - one day in that month I wrote a letter at the table, by the fire, and the prisoner was in a box at a short distance from me. I took out my watch, and put it on the table, while I used my seal - I turned round to send my servant with the letter, and in that time<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060121"></xptr>the prisoner had gone out, and I immediately missed my watch, with the seal attached to it. I have not seen him since, but Mrs. Wright says he has been in the house - he had been there several times before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PRENDERGAST. Q. Had not there been some degree of intimacy between you? A. Nothing further than his being a customer. I saw he had plenty of money, and I once asked him to lend me a 5l. note - he showed me an acceptance for 50l., and asked if I could make use of that - I kept it an hour, and then returned it; I never talked about money on any other occasion - he owed me money for eating and drinking at my house; I knew his address, and wrote him two letters, which he answered - the Lord Mayor has them. The letters found him in Bride-lane, Fleet-street; I called there twice, and could not see him; I had not given orders for his apprehension - he was taken in about two months - if I had given instructions for his being taken before there can be no doubt he would have been taken.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long was it before he took the watch that you had talked about the 5l.? A. It might be about a fortnight. I did not see him take the watch, and he did not ask my leave - he never denied having taken it.</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoner on the 5th of April - he gave me a key, which he said belonged to his box, at his lodgings, at the Talbot Inn, in the Borough, and if I went there I should find a pocket-book, with the duplicate of the watch in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you see him? A. At the corner of Swithin's-lane - I told him what I took him for, and he said if I would go with him to the prosecutor he would soon make it all right.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to James Richmond Smith and Joseph Catkins, of Tottenham-court-road. On the afternoon of the 13th of May the prisoners came into the shop together, and sat down close to the coun<lb></lb>ter opposite each other, face to face—Smith asked to look at some cambric, which I showed her—she said it was for gentlemen's shirt frills—I told her we usually sold French cambric for that purpose, and it would take three<lb></lb>eighths of a yard—I served her with half-a-yard, which I cut off—she then asked to see some thread lace edgings—I produced a box of them—they both looked at them—Smith bought four different lengths—while I was winding the piece up I saw Holt take some cards of edging off the coun<lb></lb>ter,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184106140094"></xptr>
               <p>and place them on her lap—she swept them off the counter on her lap—she did not lift them at all—she covered them over with her shawl and handkerchief—that appeared done deliberately to conceal them—Smith then wished to look at some blonds—I showed her some, and she had three yards—she then wished to look at some ribbons—I sold her a small quantity of ribbon as well—I made a sign to another shopman when I ob<lb></lb>served what Holt did, for him to watch what she had done—he made a sign to me as if to say he had seen what she had taken—I made a motion for him to come round—he came and told Holt he wished to speak to her—(I had seen the corners of cards of lace as she moved them to her left side)—he said he wished to speak to her, and as she got up the cards fell on the ground—they laid quite close to the edge of the counter when she swept them with her left-hand into her lap—it was not accidentally done—I saw her take them with her hand—they did not fall from her lap—when the young man spoke to her she got up, and moved them up under her shawl by degrees, and they fell from her shawl after she got up—I am certain I saw them in a position requiring her hand to keep them in the place—when charged with taking them, she said her shawl might have touched them, and they have dropped into her lap accidentally—it was impossible to be an accident, I swear—I cannot say whether Smith saw her take them—she had not looked at nor touched the lace that I saw, nor done any thing about it—they both looked at the edging, hut not when she took the card off the counter—I do not think Holt could have taken the lace without Smith being conscious of what she was doing—they were speaking to each other all the time, and facing each other, so that she might have seen what she had done.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Smith and Watkins. I saw the prisoners in the shop, sitting face to face—I was the breadth of the shop from them—I saw Holt take the four cards of lace—she rose up the corner of her shawl, swept them off, and covered them with her shawl—after seeing they continued to look at other things—about ten minutes after seeing this, I went to Holt, and said I wanted to speak to her—she turned round and said, "Me, sir?"—I said, "Yes"—she immediately got up, and as she got up the lace fell from under her shawl—I turned round to the clerk, and told him to fetch a policeman—she said it was quite an accident, she might have said it dropped on her lap while she was looking at the lace—there was 166 yards of lace, worth 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Holt had not paid for what she bought, it amounted to 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

The prisoners were given into my custody—Bishop stated the charge against them—Holt said, at first, she knew nothing about it, and afterwards she said it might be pulled down off the counter by her shawl—Bishop said he saw her draw them up her side, under her arm—she said she did no such thing—Smith denied having noticed it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stonemason, and live at 105, Lambourne Build<lb></lb>ings, Finsbury, and am a member of the Shoreditch Lodge of the Friendly Society of Operative Stonemasons'—it is not an enrolled society—I was a member in June, 1867, when the prisoner held the office of secretary—he was appointed in September, 1866—his duty was to transmit the money to the Central Committee that was over what was used for sick members—the Central Committee was at Bolton—there is an entry in this book, "June 18th, 1867. Sent to C. C., 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—that is in the prisoner's handwriting—the money was kept in a cash-box—the secretary had one key, and the treasurer another—it was kept at the Griffin Inn—they kept a certain amount in the box, and transmitted anything beyond to the Central Committee—it was his duty to send a copy of the entry in the book and the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the Central Committee—William Hickie was the treasurer at that time—here is an entry, for the 5th November, in the handwriting of the prisoner, "Sent to C. C., 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—William Archer was treasurer to the Lodge at that time—it was the prisoner's duty to transmit a copy of the balance with the money, as before—on 19th November there is an entry, "Sent to C. C., 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," also in the prisoner's writing—the salary of the prisoner was 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a quarter—there were something like 130 members to the lodge—the prisoner was one of the members—a person only has to pay his entrance fee, and pay something yearly, to become a member; and he remains a member as long as he continues to pay—sometimes the prisoner received the money, and sometimes the treasurer; but he had to hand it to the treasurer.</p>

C., 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I received that account on 27th June—there is also an entry for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not receive a post office order for that account from the prisoner—I made entries in the cash book as I received the money—it was the prisoner's duty to send every fortnight these accounts—I received the last on the 22nd October, 1867—I did not receive any post office orders from the prisoner after that—I did not receive 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 5th November, or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 19th November—I saw the prisoner when he was taken into custody—he asked me whether this business could not be made up without taking it into Court—I said, "No; it is out of my hands," and I could not do anything in it—he proposed to take out a life insurance for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he would leave the policy in the hands of the society till it was paid off.</p>

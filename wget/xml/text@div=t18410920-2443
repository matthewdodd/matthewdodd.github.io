                  </hi>. I am in the service of William Monk, a horse-slaughterer, in North-street, Whitechapel; I live in the Cambridge-road. On Saturday, the 28th of August, about half-past seven o'clock, the pri<lb></lb>soner came to Monk's-place, and said he had a pony, which, by the wish of his father, was to be destroyed, it having done an injury to his sister—he said it had thrown her while she was riding, and dislocated her hip—he said the pony was on Hackney-downs, and asked me to go with him—I went with him, by Monk's direction—it is about two miles from Cam<lb></lb>bridge-road—he pointed out the pony to me, and my man brought it away by his directions—he was in a chaise-cart with roe—it was not a valuable pony—I gave him 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, he asked me 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was brought to my master's place that night, and left there, and he was to come between five and six o'clock on Monday morning, to sec it destroyed, but he never came—I met him about five o'clock the same afternoon, at the Sir John Barley-corn public-house, and gave him into custody—the prosecutor had claimed the pony on Monday morning—when I saw the prisoner in the afternoon, I asked him why he did not come according to appointment, to see the pony slaughtered—he said he rose early, but he was detained—I said "The pony you have sold me is stolen, and you must be detained"—he said, "Don't drag me through the streets," and offered to go quietly—I gave him to Patten—the pony was delivered to Ward—I had paid the prisoner for it.</p>

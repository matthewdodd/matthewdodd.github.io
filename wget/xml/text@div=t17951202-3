               <p>Court. Q. I should suppose you had a good opinion of him? - A. The lease was a very good security: I had a good opinion of him at the same time. The prisoner's wife applied to me on Wednesday the 7th of October, in the evening, about six o'clock, to tell they were overburdened with halfpence; I told her we were also overburdened with halfpence; I consented to take ten or twenty pounds; I sent the man down to their house, and he brought up twenty pounds; about half an hour after that, Edwards himself brought up twenty pounds more, to my counting-house in Liquor-Pond-street; I expostulated with him upon the impropriety of bringing twenty pounds more, when I consented only to take twenty; he said he had got twenty more, which made sixty, and was particularly impertinent; upon which, I said, you are a very impertinent man; I desire these halfpence may go back again, and it is not of any use for me to talk to you - you put in ten words to my one - you are an impertinent fellow, and I with you would not come here any more, but go to another brewhouse, and pay off your account; and then I left him; I did not stop to hear any reply.</p>

            Repeatedly, the whole time he was with me as a servant, and during the time of his being a publican; likewise on the tenth of October, in the morning, I received several letters, among which was this which came by the Penny Post.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have you had occasion to see the prisoner write? - A. I cannot say but I have several receipts for his wages, and some of my agents can speak to that very fully.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Can you say that that letter is his hand-writing? - A. To the best of my knowledge it is, but I never saw him write.</p>

            This conversation passed on the 7th, and on the 10th you received this letter? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before you caused him to be taken up? - A. Four or five days.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not thirteen days from the receipt of the letter before you had him taken up? - A. No, it was not; I believe some of my people in court can tell precisely to a day.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean to say he was taken up before the 23d? - I cannot say, I have no desire to say any more than the fact; this business was considered among my friends before I had him taken up.</p>

            Whether, between the 7th day and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179512020008"></xptr>time this unfortunate language took place, he did not make you more payments than one? - A. I cannot say; I fancy he made one payment besides the halfpence, in the common course of his monthly payments, which were usually made.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you took him up you got all your beer out of his cellar, by your servants? - A. Yes: it was not in condition to draw.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not that a stratagem, to get it out of his possession; would you not have taken it from any other publican under such circumstances? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not this a contrivance to get the beer out of his possession, before you had him taken up? - A. I cannot answer to that; I would always speak the truth upon every occasion.</p>

            You must know whether it was a contrivance to get the beer out of his possession before you took him? - A. It was not in a condition to draw.</p>
               <p>Q. I must have a plain answer; was not that a contrivance to get away his property, before you took him up? - A. I cannot pretend to say that was not a consideration.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it or was it not the reason that you would not take him up till you had got the possession of the property? - A. I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that it was not with an intention, first of all, to get away his property before you took him up, that that was done? - A. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Was it taken away at the request of the prisoner? - No; he consented to it, for it was really not in a condition to draw.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not make any remonstrance against it, but behaved in an orderly way? - A. The beer was out of condition and had; he was going on in such a riotons way, in drunkenness, fighting, and playing in such a bad tradesman-like manner, that I did not think the property safe in his hands, that was one reason.</p>
               <p>Q. And it was another reason that you would not take him up till you had got the property from him? - A. That was not the whole reason, coupling the two things together with the letter he wrote, and the manner in which he was living, that I did not think it safe even if the letter had not been read.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath was not this the reason why you wished to get the property from him? - A. Both coupled together was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you happen to take away this beer before you suspected he was the author of this letter? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not the man endeavoured from that time to do all the justice in his power as to any demands you had against him? - A. He has certainly paid me all; he does not owe us a shilling.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. You did not order him to be apprehended immediately? - A. No, the reason of that was, I wished to consult my friends upon the subject what steps were proper to take.</p>

            He complained of the beer, and I went down to him to get it away. Mr. Meux said before the letter was received that he was sorry he had started that beer.</p>

            Does your Lordship think we are intitled to read the letter now.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. He says he has seen him write, to be sure; that he believes it, which is all that a man can say, but he cannot swear to it. This witness has gone so far as that, and therefore I think I am bound to receive it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Grose. It is matter for the Jury. the man is uncommonly cautious; the way to prove a hand writing is, by asking the witness called to prove it to ask, if he has seen the party write, and if he believes the paper produced to be of his hand writing? The witness I understand to say he believed it to be his writing; and he says further, he cannot swear to it; he does right in saying he cannot swear to it; but so far as he believes it to be his hand writing is the evidence that has ever been admitted; how far it applies is for the Jury.</p>

               <p>I live in Mr. Meux's house; I have seen the prisoner at the bar write five or six times.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, from having seen him write, do you think you are able, upon looking at any instrument, to say whether you believe that to be his hand writing or not? - A. I think I can. (The letter is shewn to him.) This letter I have seen before.</p>
               <p>Q. But from having seen him write before, notwithstanding you have seen that identical letter before, from that ground of forming your opinion do you believe that to be his hand writing or not? - A. I am certain it is more his hand writing than I ever saw any man's in my life; I have looked over it minutely, and I believe it to be his hand writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You have seen him write five or six times? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago may you have seen him write? - A. Since he was in prison.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before that? - A. Nine or ten months.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him write any thing but his name? - A. Yes, at the Office.</p>
               <p>Q. At any other time did you ever see him write any more than the two words,

               <p>Q. It was to refresh your memory, to make it stronger upon your mind, that you looked at it to see whether it was his hand writing or not; did not you do it to make yourself certain about it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had examined it over and over again, you were more certain than at first? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The times you have read it have been since the man has been in custody? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you compare it with any other hand writing of the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, upon the comparison between that hand writing and the other, does not that give you the means of belief? - A. Yes, and having seen him write before.</p>

               <p>Q. You are enabled to speak to your belief of it? - A. I believe it is.</p>
               <p>Q. But before I shew you the letter, from having seen him write, are you able to speak to your belief of the character of his writing? - A. Yes. (Looks at the letter.) This is the letter I saw at Bow-street, and I saw it was very much like what he had wrote and sent up there: I will not take upon me to swear that it is his hand writing; I believe it to be wrote by the same hand as wrote the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't talk of comparing it with any hand writing you saw at the Office; but whether you, upon the view of it, believe it to be the hand writing of the prisoner at the bar? - A. I don't believe it is; I cannot take upon me to say, that it is, or that it is not.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. Gentlemen, you recollect that I set out with stating, that Mr. Meux had no idea but that of justice, and not a with to press against the prisoner: As the court seems satisfied that there is not sufficient proof of the" evidence, I hope in God this man will know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179512020011"></xptr>hereafter that the of his old master towards him has been far from a wish of desiring any thing vindictive and I hope he will go from this court perfectly satisfied of that.</p>

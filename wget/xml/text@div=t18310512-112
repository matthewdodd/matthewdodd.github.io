            . I am a Bow-street horse-patrol. On the 13th of April I went to the prisoner's house, at Southgate, with a search-warrant; the prosecutor's servant directed me there - I found the prisoner's wife there; I found these two pewter plates behind a partition on the mantel-piece, and some iron hooping in a tool-chest - the partition ran up from the mantel-piece to the ceiling, and the chimney is behind it; it seemed to have been used as a cupboard; the plates could not be seen as a person went into the house - the tool-chest was locked up, and the prisoner's father broke it open for me; I took the prisoner the next morning.</p>

            . I am bailiff to Mr. Powys. I went with the patrol to the prisoner's house - we found these articles; I believe these plates are my master's - I saw the iron hooping found; the prisoner was employed by Mr. Powys as a <rs id="t18310512-112-deflabel661" type="occupation">jobbing carpenter</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18310512-112-defend869 t18310512-112-deflabel661"></join>; my master had bought - cwt. of iron hoop; the prisoner was employed to cut it up and put it on some fences - what was used, and what remains, is about 49 1/2 lbs., and about 5 1/2 lbs. was found at the prisoner's; some of the iron was used on the park fence, but it was wider than this.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Where does the prisoner's father live? A. In the next house to him - he came in while we were there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. Did you ever hear the prisoner say it was his house? A. No - I know he lives there; I had seen him there six months ago, or more - we did not find him there that day; his wife and family were there - he was not in Mr. Powys' employ at that time; I do not know when he left exactly - there was a heifer killed at Mr. Powys' about Christmas; the prisoner assisted in that - I do not know whether he had permission to take any part of that; I know these plates by the coat of arms on them - they were kept in the scullery; Mr. Powys has some dogs - I do not know whether any dog's meat is ever put on these plates, or whether it was about Christmas; I do not swear to the iron hooping - we guessed the weight of what was used.</p>

I think for fifteen or sixteen months - he was regularly in my employ, but if he asked for leave to go for a week I allowed him, or sometimes for a day or two; I know these plates by the coat of arms on them - it is an old family coat of arms of a person whose property was left to me; the prisoner was brought to me in custody, and said he hoped I would be lenient to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you made him any promise or threat? A. No - he was regularly in my employ, and so was Gutteridge; I bought - cwt. of this iron, and what has been used is most trifling - the rest was cut up by the prisoner, and remained in my workshop: there were a dozen of these plates, and they all exactly correspond; there are three of them missing - my servants might take them into the out-house with dog's meat, but it is not right to do so; I remember the heifer being killed, but I have no recollection of giving the prisoner any of it; he stated that he took part of the liver of it home on these plates, but I have no sort of recollection of it - it is very unlikley; I did not see him come to my house on the day after these things were found, but I believe he did come; I rather think for the purpose of interceding with me - when I saw him in custody he said he hoped I would not transport him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know from your servants whether he had the liver to take away? A. I have no idea of it; what iron was found at the prisoner's, and what was used, makes up the weight as near as possible.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Would it have been necessary to have carried the liver on three plates? A.Certainly not.</p>

            . Q. When did you take the prisoner? A. On the 14th of April; I had searched his house the day before - I do not know whether he went home that evening; I took him at Mr. Powys', at seven o'clock in the morning - the plates were in a sort of cupboard; there was a powder-flask, and some bottles there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The iron hooping is part of my father's property; at the time the heifer was killed the cowman assisted me; he shewed the liver to the prosecutor, and said part of it was not good - he said if it was eatable we might have it; I took the plates, and took part of it home.</p>

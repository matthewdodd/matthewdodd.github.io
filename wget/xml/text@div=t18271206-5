Bank-note in a silk purse; I put it at the back of a drawer in the secretaire, so that the drawer would not shut close; I left the secretaire locked; the note was not in the drawer, but behind it; I had the number and date of the note, and had placed my initials on the top of it in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060008"></xptr>front; I had often seen the note, as I had received it on the 22d of June, and whenever I arranged my money I saw it. I returned to town on Monday, the 1st of October; I was leaving town again on Wednesday, the 3d of October, and had no occasion to go to my money till that morning; I then went to where I had deposited my note, and the purse and note were gone. I inquired of the prisoner, in an indifferent sort of way, if he had seen my purse about; he said he had not, and would inquire of the cook; he certainly left the room in a hurried manner; I heard no more of it - he did not tell me whether he had or had not inquired of the cook; I left town in an hour, and sent notice to the Bank to stop payment; I came back on the 10th, but left again, and came back on the 14th; the prisoner still remained in my service; I had collected from him that he was extremely anxious to leave my service, and on Monday, the 15th of October, I told him I understood so, and said I was not obliged to give him any notice or money, and that he had better leave that afternoon; I paid him 5l. odd as wages in the evening, and he left.</p>
               <p>Q. When you told him you understood he was anxious to leave, what he did he say? A. He said nothing - he did not at all express a wish to remain; I advertised the note, and have seen it since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not advertise it as a note supposed to be lost, and not as having been stolen? A. I headed my advertisement with the word, "Lost" - I have a stable at the back of my house- I was about purchasing a horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not been in the habit of riding it up and down the mews? A. Not in the mews certainly; I have here a memorandum of all the Bank-notes I have had in my possession, and accounting for how I have disposed of them - it was given to me by the person who gave me the note.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You had better put that away; you have said your initials were on the note, shall you know it by them? A. No; they are now torn off - there is a tear in the place where my initials were, but I know the number and date myself.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When you advertised it, did you suppose it had been stolen? A. I do not wish to answer that question, because I am afraid to do so.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Oh! answer me? A. I tell you honestly, I suspected the prisoner from the first, but if I had put "Lost or stolen" at the head of my advertisement, the note would not have been circulated, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. How many notes had you had for the three weeks, or month preceding? A. I think about seven, but only one 40l. - I have a wife, but no children; the secretaire is in my private room; the prisoner came to my service from the Rev. Mr. Young, one of the masters of Eton school - I had a written character; it was not an excellent character, but I took him; he said he had a sister, and on Mrs. Vines going to that sister; she appeared respectable, and we took him before the written character came, as the sister said she would be accountable for any thing; he told me he had lived with Lord Mansfield; he came to me on the 18th of August, and left on the 15th of October - I missed the note on the 3d - I had not been in town more than three or four days altogether - I advertised the note on the 16th, the day after he left - I have a partner, but this note was paid to me by a gentleman at the bar, who is my tenant; it is my private property.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say you know the number of the note, did you put it down yourself? A. I did, and I have it in my pocket - I did that on the 26th of August - I received it on the 22d of June, took it home, and had no occasion to look over my money, till the 26th of August, when I put down the numbers, dates and amounts of all my notes - I have the paper here now (looking at it); it was the only 40l. note I had - I have taken no other since; it was dated the 5th of May, 1827, No. 15261 - I received it from Mr. Crupton's clerk.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you leave any other note behind you? A. None, of any description, sort, or kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Why, look at this paper - here is under, the words,"Left in town" this 40l. note, and several other notes? A. I was possessed of these several notes on the 26th of August - when I came to town from time to time - I took out certain notes, I have crossed off all but this 40l. note, which was the only one I left in town, on the 16th of September - I had spent the rest at Brighton, and wanted the 40l. when I came to town.</p>

            . I am a servant. I am at present out of place - I have been acquainted with the prisoner from a boy - I met him in Bond-street, on the 10th of November; we walked together along Piccadilly, as far as the Park; we came back again, and he asked me to change him a 40l. note, which he said he had picked up in Chenies-mews, which is near Bedford-square; he told me he came honestly by it, that he picked it up in Cheniesmews - I changed it at Mr. Howis, an oilman in Piccadilly, whom I have known for some years - I got thirty sovereigns, and two 5l. notes for it - I did not notice the number of the note, but I noticed a piece torn off the top of it - I do not recollect noticing any thing else - I gave him the money, and he lent me 20l. of it; he partly offered to lend it to me, and I said I should be obliged to him - I gave him the money at a public-house in Vine-street; he said he would lend me 20l. of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to offer that? A. I told him I was in want of a little money, but not before he offered it me; he offered it me, and I accepted it - I have always given the same account of this - I know nothing more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You say you always told the same account of it; is that perfectly true? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did you not say you got it from a gentleman at the Clarendon Hotel? A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you in the first instance tell the Magistrate you got the note from the prisoner? A. I did not - I did not tell him I got it from any body else - I said I got it from a gentleman; the prisoner's family are all respectable - I said the gentleman lived at No. 109, Great Titchfield-street - I did not give any other address.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not for the purpose of concealing the person you had it from, that you said it was a gentleman? A. No it was not - I meant to give the prisoner's name, and I did - I meant the prisoner when I said the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you known him in service; when you described him as a gentleman, had he not been many years in service? A. Yes - I knew him as a footman, and in other capacities - I considered him as a gentleman - I had always found him correct and upright - I have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060009"></xptr>been in the House of Correction, for want of bail, since this transaction - I have come from there to day - I was sent there to give forty-eight hours' notice of bail to appear here, but I did not care for bail, as the Sessions were so near; it was eight or ten days ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the Magistrate, or any body that you took the note from a gentleman, who was waiting at the Clarendon Hotel? A. I did not - I mentioned the Clarendon Hotel, as I am in the habit of calling there every morning, and I mentioned the hotel to Howis, but did not say I took it from a gentleman there - I do not recollect the Magistrate saying he did not believe my account - I do not think he said any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You changed the note at Howis'? A. Yes - I asked him to cash me the note, and had a long conversation with him, and he has since said, that I mentioned Lord Henley's name, but I did not mention any such name; he did not ask where I got the note - I told him I was expecting a situation to go out of town with a gentleman at the Clarendon Hotel.</p>

            . I am an oilman, and live in Piccadilly. I have no knowledge of Morris, except from his living in different services - I knew his person, and what places he had lived in; he came to me with a 40l. note, about the 8th or 10th of November - I do not know the day; he came from ten to eleven o'clock in the day; he came and asked for change for my Lord Henley; he said we served my Lord Henley.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he introduce himself in that way? A. No; he asked for change for a 40l. note - I hesitated, and said, "I do not know you;" he then said, "I serve Lord Henley;" that was in order to remove my scruples - Lord Henley's father had been a customer at our shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him where Lord Henley was, or did he tell you? A. He said he was at the Clarendon Hotel; that he had come from Ireland, on account of the death of the Hon. Sir William Wynn, his brother; I hesitated again, and looked at his appearance, which was that of a nobleman's upper servant, and then asked him for the note; I inspected it, and saw it was without any writing, or any thing on the back - I thought it had very probably been received from a banker, and from those circumstances gave him change; he stated other families which he had lived in before, and whom we were connected with in business, which strengthened my idea that he lived with Lord Henley; he mentioned Mrs. Trail, the widow of Henry Trail; he observed, that he was brought up on Mr. Trail's estate - I asked his name, and wrote it on the note; he gave me the name of Morris; he observed his lordship was going to trave which induced me to change the note - I paid it into Messrs. Drummonds, with our general account, and should know it again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had he mentioned Lord Henley's name so frequently, that you had no doubt he was telling you the truth? A. Yes - I understood him clearly to say, that he was going to travel with Lord Henley, as his servant - I am certain he mentioned his lordship's name, and Mr. Wynn's.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. I apprehended the prisoner on Friday, the 23d of November, in Great Titchfield-street - I took him to the office, and asked if he knew a person of the name of Morris - I asked him the question several times; he repeatedly said, he did not; this was not before the Magistrate - I asked if he knew any thing respecting a 40l. note, and if he had not given a person named Morris a note, of that description; he said No - I had not said it would be better or worse for him to say any thing; the chief constable then said, "Young man, do you mean to say you don't know a person named Morris?" he said he did not, but there was a Welshman named John, who was bred up in the same village with him - I asked if he had not given that John a 40l. note to change; he said he had not; he was examined by the Magistrate, and sent to the watch-house till the following day, and on our way to the watch-house, he himself began the conversation, and said,"The reason I would not know Morris was, because I had heard that day that he had been taken into custody" - Morris was at the office, but he had not seen him; on the following day I was present at his examination - the clerk wrote down what he said, and I attested it; no inducement whatever was held out to him; the Magistrate said,"Now, prisoner, you need not say any thing without you like, you are not bound to say any thing;" he said the truth was the truth, and began to make a statement - the clerk was called in, and took it down, and on the Tuesday following I saw him sign it; here it is (looking at it); this is his signature.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Why were you not content with one denial from him, without asking him the same question over and over? A. Because I knew he had not told me true; I thought it right, to further the ends of justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you examine every man in this way? A. If I found any thing intricate, I probably should. I would not try to get a confession by any unfair means.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the Bank of England, and produce a 40l. note, No. 15261, dated the 5th of May, 1827, which was paid into the Bank by Messrs. Grotes, the bankers.</p>
               <p>STEPHEN HOWIS. I know this note - the name of Morris has been taken out at the Bank, but the first part of the M and of the s remain - I have no doubt of its being the note I received from Morris; when I paid it into Messrs. Drummonds the name was complete - the name has been partly stamped out since - I sent it to Messrs. Drummonds by a relation.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is there even the M to be seen on it? A. Here is the beginning of the M - it might be taken for the first part of an A. I made no memorandum on it, except writing the name; we always write on notes who we take them from, either the nobleman or the servant.</p>
               <p>GEORGE DYER. I know the note was paid in by Messrs. Grotes, by referring to our books; the bankers leave their parcels of notes, and write on the outside who they are from; I have written "Grote" on this note; I copied that from the book; we punch out the sum, and tear off the corner, to cancel it. Any writing at the back would be taken off if it covered the sum.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is done with the bits cut out? A. I believe they are kept till there is a large quantity, and then burnt; the book from which I copied this is still at the Bank.</p>

Bank of England note, and at the same time my master was riding on horseback up and down the mews; it was about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon - I told no person that day what I had found, nor did I mention it to any body, until I met John Morris, in Bond-street, last Saturday fortnight, when I told him that I had picked up a 40l. note in the mews, and asked him if he could get it changed; he said that he could, at Mr. Howis' in Piccadilly; we then walked together into Hyde Park, where I put the note into his hand, and told him to take it, and if he got it changed, he should have half; we then went into Piccadilly, and I waited outside, while he went into the shop of Mr. Howis, and he soon afterwards came out, with the change in his hand, and said, "Come along with me Bob, I have got twenty-five sovereigns or thirty (I cannot recollect which), and two 5l. notes", and we went together to a public-house near there, and he gave me two 5l. Bank of England notes, and ten sovereigns, and the same day I changed one of notes, at a public-house in Great Titchfield-street, and the other I changed two or three days afterwards, at a linen-draper's in Oxford-street - I wrote Morris's name on them, after I received them.</p>

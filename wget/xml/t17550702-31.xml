               <p>Turner. On the 9th of June last, the prisoner came to my shop, on the terras in St. James's-street. I keep a china-shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure this is the man ?</p>
               <p>Turner. I have great reason to know him. He had another man with him. He was booted and spurr'd, and had a whip in his hand. He said, he wanted a pair of little pug-dogs to give his child to play with. I shew'd him all I had. I had one odd one; he fix'd particularly upon that, and would have an exact pair of such; and said, none would do but them, and desired I would get them for him, and he would come on Thursday following for them; but before he went away, he robb'd me of 18 guineas.</p>

            . I was at Mr. Turner's shop when the prisoner came there to cheapen some pug-dogs. The prisoner then desired he'd give him a guinea for some silver. Mr. Turner did; then he wanted him to let him have a King Charles's guinea in change for another. In the mean time his hands were busy in Mr. Turner's money, so as to take the quantity Mr. Turner has mentioned.</p>
               <p>Court. He is not trying for that now. The question now is, was the prisoner at large?</p>
               <p>Turner. Yes, my lord, he was. I took him to be a customer. When I found what he had done, I secured him. He offered me three guineas to let him go.</p>

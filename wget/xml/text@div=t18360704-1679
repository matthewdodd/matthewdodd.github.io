                  </hi>. I am in the lace business, and live at Penn, near Beaconsfield. I employed the prisoner to sell lace and caps for me—on Monday the 20th of June, I went to London, and came back again with him on Tuesday; and between Brentford and Hounslow, between eleven and twelve o'clock on Tuesday night, we were walking and talking to<lb></lb>gether, and he said to me, "What a h—of a hurry you are in"—I was walking very fast—I said."It is very late"—I wanted to go where I was going—he said, "You need not fear as long as you have got me with you; I will see you safe to your lodging at Hounslow, and then I will return to my brother, and stop there; for you cannot afford to pay me for my day's work to<lb></lb>morrow, and I cannot afford to lose it; it will make a bad Satur<lb></lb>day night"—he then instantly gave me a blow with his fist on my head, and I fell to the ground—it was a light night, and in the middle of the horse-road—I got up again, and said, "John, What have I done to deserve</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183607040034"></xptr>
               <p>this treatment?"—he gave me another blow on the eye. and said, "There, then, "and I fell again—he kept kneeling on me, and Beating me, and I begged of him to have mercy—he said, D—you; now I will do for you"—I then hallooed, "Murder, "and "Thieves," and again begged for mercy—he repeated his blows on my head several times—I received two blows in my head—he then put his hand on my left thing—my money was tied shillings, and two sixpences—he put his hand on the top of my trowsers and rent them down, shirt and all away together—he took the piece of trowsers which was hanging to my pocket, and threw it down—I took it in my hand—he tore my pocket by force from me, and took it away, with the money in it, and ran away—I saw no more of him, till next morning, as I was walking out, a little after five o'clock, at Brentford, in a street leading to Ealing—he gave a short stop, turned round, and ran away—hallooed, "Stop thief," and two policemen came along after him—I saw him in the station-house, in less than an hour, at Brentford—I said to him, "John, what have you done with my money?"—he said, "I have put it in the bun<lb></lb>dle, and thrown it away behind a hedge"—I believe the officer heard him say that.</p>

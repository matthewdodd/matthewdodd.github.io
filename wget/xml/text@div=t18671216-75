I live at Manchester Street, King's Cross, and am tra<lb></lb>veller to the Dairy Farms Association—on 7th October the prisoner called on me at the warehouse in Grenville Mews, Guildford Street, and asked to see some eggs—I showed him some, and he said that he had dealt very largely with Peacock's, the egg merchants, and had got a great many bad eggs, and was going to give us a trial; he selected a case of eggs, which he asked to be delivered early that morning, and they were to be paid cash for—I took them to 36, Charles Street, Hatton Garden, but Mr. Gould was not at home—I saw a man, who I believe is John Day—he told me to leave them and call as I returned for the money, which I did, and found the eggs turned out and partly sold—he told me to call the next day—I went again on 15th October and saw the prisoner, who told me again that he had been dealing largely with Peacock's, and had several shops and a farm at Barking; that he wanted good eggs, and did not mind the price he paid—I concluded that I had a very good customer—he said that his custom was to pay once a month and to give cheques, and I consented to let him run the month, on the faith that he was the man he represented himself to be—I left him then 600 eggs, value 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on Saturday, October 19th, he had another case at 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., another on the 22nd, another on the 25th, and another on the 29th, value altogether 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I was induced to let him have the goods because he told me he had several shops in London, and was a farmer at Barking, and had several cows—my master was away in France at the time—on 1st Novem<lb></lb>ber I went for a cheque, but did not see Mr. Gould—I called several times, but was never able to see him, and never got a cheque for the goods—I did not see the prisoner till he was at Bow Street—I did not give him in custody—if he had given his right name, Bristow, he would never have had the things, because I have heard of the name of Bristow.</p>

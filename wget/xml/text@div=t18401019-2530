                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Gray, and live with him at Northampton. On the 6th of October I came with Mrs. Hickson and her little boy, by the Gravesend steam-packet, to London—I arrived at half-past five o'clock, and got to Fish-street-hill, and there took a hackney-coach, which the prisoner drove—I had a deal box among my luggage, with a wrapper over the top and sides—it was placed on the foot-board of the coach—I was driven to No. 20, West Smithfield—I got down, and my friend paid the coach—I supposed my luggage was out of the coach, but I missed the box a very short time after the coach was gone—the things stated in the indictment were in it, and amongst them a pair of mit<lb></lb>tens, marked with gold and silver on the backs—I have a pair here (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>during a pair</hi>) bought at the same time, and of the same pattern—there were some things of Mrs. Hickson's with mine—her husband's name is William—there was a cap, two yards of lace, and two collars belonging to her—I saw the prisoner again on the Thursday, two days after, in New<lb></lb>gate-street, and knew him immediately—he was driving a hackney-coach—I took the number of it, and gave the number to Mr. Hickson, and he in<lb></lb>formed the police of it—the value of my things is about 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and Mrs. Hickson's, about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

            . I live in Castle-street, Falcon-square. On the 19th of August I was accosted at half-past ten o'clock at night, in Bond-street, by the prisoner, and went to a room on the second floor of <placeName id="t18240916-213-crimeloc1147">No. 7, Shepherd-street, Oxford-street</placeName>

This 20 l. note was in my fob when I went into the room. I went to bed, and put my breeches under my head, and bolted the door. I was awoke about five o'clock by the servant of the house; the prisoner had then left the bed, and was dressed. I had given her money before I missed the note; the trowsers had been pulled from under my head, and lay on the top of the bed. I offered her a sovereign to give up the note - she denied knowing anything about it. I had written the letter B. upon it; it was produced at the office. I am quite sure I was sober at the time.</p>

             The prosecutor offered to give her a sovereign, but she positively denied having the note. I then searched her, and found it on her - it had the letter B on it; she gave no account of how she came by it.</p>

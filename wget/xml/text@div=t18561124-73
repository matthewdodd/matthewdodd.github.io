                  </hi>. I reside at Charlton, in Kent; it is my dwelling house. I left it on Thursday evening, 16th Oct.; I bolted the back door, and locked the front door, and left the key with my neighbour—I left about 7 o'clock in the evening—I left no one in the house—I returned on Monday, 20th Oct., about a quarter before 10 o'clock in the evening—I discovered that my house had been broken into—I went up stairs, and my attention was directed to a cupboard, which had been opened, and a silk dress, and one or two little articles, taken out—that cupboard had been shut safe—a drawer, in a chest of drawers, which had been locked, had been attempted to be opened, and two boxes had been rifled, and their contents, of no very particular importance, were scattered about on the floor—the next morning I found the lock of the street door would act on the outside, but not on the inside.</p>

                  </hi>. On Monday evening, 20th Oct., about 6 o'clock, I went to the prosecutor's house, in consequence of information—my father went with me—he went the front way; I went to the back of the house; I jumped over the fence, and found the back door of the house open—I heard my father in the front, turning the handle of the lock, and heard the sound of footsteps running down the stairs—I stepped on one side of the back door, and a man, who is not in custody, came out—I laid hold of him—the prisoner came out directly after him, and the man I had hold of said to the prisoner, "It is no use, <hi rend="italic">Fred</hi>; we may as well give ourselves up"—the prisoner immediately struck me on the head—I had no hat on—I was stunned, and fell—I dragged the man I had hold of with me—he struggled with me for a minute or two on the ground—I then lost my con-sciousness, and when I came to he was gone—I found a hat, with a cap inside it, close by where I had been struck—I ran down the back yard,</p>

               <p>jumped over the fence, and saw the prisoner in charge of my father—he is the man who came out of the house last, and the man that struck me the blow—I have not the slightest doubt that he is the person—my head bled a great deal—about an hour afterwards I examined the prosecutor's garden, with my father, and saw him pick up a life preserver, about three yards from the place where I received the blow—I went up into the prosecutor's bedroom about a quarter of an hour afterwards—a drawer had been attempted to be prised open—the mahogany was chipped away.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you hear a noise? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, when I stood out<lb></lb>side the back door—it was about 6 o'clock—it was dark—directly I saw the prisoner he struck me—this house is in the high road, which is a thorough-fare—when I got to the back door it was open—the prisoner struck me with a life preserver—I did not think so at the time—I think I have not said that he struck me with his fist, I thought so at the time; but when I came to reflect some time after, I thought it must be something harder, so we made a search, and found this life preserver—I should think I was insensible for a minute or two—I am certain that I have got the correct words that the other man used—I did not take them down—I stated three times before the magistrate what he said.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the father of the last witness—in consequence of information, I went to the prosecutor's house on 20th Oct.—I directed my son to go to the back, and I went to the front—I tried to open the door with the key—I thought I unlocked it, but I could not get in—I called a man who was passing, and said, "Here are thieves in this house"—I heard a slight noise, and saw lights in the house—I told him to watch the door, and I heard a rushing down the stairs—I heard some men running to the back of the house—I ran round to stop them—I saw the prisoner, without a hat, running across the road in a direction from the back of the house—I caught him, and we fell down together—the words, I think he said, were, "Don't hurt me"—I said, "I will not hurt you, but I will hold you"—I held him, and took him to the Dockyard police station, and handed him over to the officer—I went back, and my son and I examined the garden together—my son pointed to the place where he had stopped the other man, and I found this life preserver—the next morning, at the house No. 11, two doors from the prosecutor's, I saw a labourer, who was with me, find this hat—my son's head was bleeding.</p>

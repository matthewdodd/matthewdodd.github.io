                  </hi>. I used to keep a beer-house—I live at 6, Manor-street, King's-road, Chelsea. On Tuesday, 13th July, I went to the Admiral Keppel public-house in the Fulham-road about 1 or 2 o'clock in the day—after I got in there two women named Diggory and Howden intro<lb></lb>duced themselves into my company—I drank with them and treated them—while doing so, the prisoner and a companion of his, named Brown, intro<lb></lb>duced themselves—I had never seen the prisoner before—I saw some motions pass between the men and the females, and I endeavoured to get out of their company—I called a cab, and Diggory and Howden and I got in, together with a man of the name of Lewis—I allowed him to accompany us through the introduction of the females, as I thought we four would go away and leave the other two men—we went to Battersea Bridge in the cab, and there I saw the two men I had endeavoured to avoid, Cole and Brown—I asked them why they were following me—they said they were not following me—I walked over the bridge, and, to avoid them, I went into the Prince Albert, adjoining Battersea-park—the two females and Lewis went with me—whilst we were there, the prisoner came in—I paid half-a-crown for some drink for the females in his presence; 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was given in change—Howden snatched up the change and took it away—I demanded it back again, and she gave it me up—while we were having the altercation, Cole said, "B—him, we will have the lot"—I then went out of their company, and sat on a seat in front of the house, facing the river—Cole came to me again, and asked me if I would have something to drink—I told him no, I did not want him, his drink, or his company—I walked into the park to get away from him—I had not proceeded above 200 yards along one of the high-roads in the park before the prisoner got in front of me—I asked him what he wanted of me—during that time Brown came up and pinioned me behind, and threw me on my back—Cole directly put his knees on me, and endeavoured to tear my clothes to pieces to get at my money—my clothes were all torn from the front of my person, and my pockets turned out—I had my porte-monnaie in my hand, and Brown said to Cole, as he was lying across me, "B—him, he has got it in his fist"—they then made another struggle, and Cole took the porte-monnaie out of my hand—it contained about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had pulled out my porte-monnaie in the Admiral Keppel, and changed a sovereign—I had 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before that—Cole was present, and saw me change the sovereign—during the struggle the park-constable came up to my assistance, and they ran away—I endeavoured to run after them, but I was too much injured—Brown, Diggory, and Howden were tried here last session, and convicted.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the park-keepers of Battersea-park. On Tuesday afternoon, 13th July, about 4 o'clock, my attention was attracted by seeing the prisoner, Lewis, Brown, Howden, and Diggory—they had the prosecutor down on the ground—I walked up towards them, and when they saw me coming they ran away—I ran after them, and I took Brown—I took him in charge, took him down to my box, left him there, and went after the other prisoners—I took Howden and Diggory in charge—Cole escaped in a boat across the water—the prosecutor had been drinking, but he could recognize every one about him; he knew perfectly well what he was doing.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner at Sheerness on 31st August—I told him the charge was for highway robbery in Batttersea-park—he said, "It is all right; it is bad company that has drawn me into this; I am very sorry for it, I must get out of it in the best manner I can."</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that he got into the prose<lb></lb>cutor's company on the evening in question and that they were drinking together for a considerable time, with others; that when in the park the prosecutor called out that whoever got his money might have it, provided they spent it, and that in a lark, he, with the others, accepted the challenge, but he had no intention of robbery</hi>.)</p>

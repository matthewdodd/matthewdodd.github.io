I was at the Blue Posts near Porters-block; the woman was coming by us, she rushed against me, I thought I heard some pots knock together; we followed her about twenty yards, and heard them knock together several times; when we got into Cow-cross, my companion jostled against her, and they knocked together again; she turned again and struck him in the face, and asked him what he did that for; he said he thought she had some alehouse pots about her; I came up to her, and challenged her with it; she struck me, and said she had no such things about her; I felt, and said she had pots about her; she said she had not, and called me villain; in that time came several people by, some of them said she was the woman that was whiped in Hatton-garden for stealing pots, and said if we let her go we were to blame; she struck us several times; we found six pots about her, they were tied round her with a cord; there was one belonged to a man on Tower-hill; then she said it was the first time she was guilty, and if we would let her go, she would never do the like again.</p>

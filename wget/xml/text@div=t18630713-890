                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Park-place—on the evening of June 10th, I was called to 6, Alsop-place, and found the prisoner lying on the sofa in the front parlour, totally insensible—I examined her carefully all over to ascertain whether any of her bones were broken by her fall—she had received severe injuries on both legs, but no bones were broken; also injuries on the arm, and slightly on the head—she continued insensible seven or eight minutes after my arrival, and I directed treatment, under the in<lb></lb>fluence of which she revived—I then inquired how she met with the injuries—she said that she had fallen off the doorstep on to the paving-stones, and injured herself—I asked her if she knew anything with regard to her child being dead—in the first instance she did not appear to know that it was dead, but afterwards she muttered something about having killed it, though she was rather incoherent—she had no recollection of having fallen or thrown herself from the window—she was sufficiently sensible to recollect antece<lb></lb>dent facts, but she did not recollect the attempt made by cutting her own throat, or the attempt made by swallowing laudanum—as soon as she was sufficiently recovered to be left, I went up to the second floor back room—I found the bed-clothes thrown down to the foot of the bed, and the body of the child lying on the side of the bed, with its throat cut completely across, and a pool of clotted blood in the centre of the bed—the body was warm, but the extremities had got cold—the wound had been recently inflicted—I sent information to the police; a constable came, and I saw him pick up a common table-knife, which had blood on it, but it appeared to have been wiped, and we found the paper that it was wiped with—I went to the open window, and noticed that a small flower-pot, on one side of it, had been overset—we then went down to the back yard, and saw three little patches of blood on the paving stones—I returned home shortly afterwards, and sent the prisoner some medicine—there was no apparent evidence of her having taken</p>

               <p>laudanum, or other narcotic poison, but a bason was brought to me by the constable which was analyzed, and found to contain laudanum—I returned at half-past 10, when the prisoner informed me that she had been for some time past in a very low and depressed state of mind—all the information I obtained was elicited from questions put to her—she said there was no cause which she could tell me of why she was so depressed—her husband was in permanent work, and a good husband, but that she had been in a very low state of mind during her first pregnancy, and was now four months gone in the family-way—I asked her where she had obtained any laudanum; she said that she had two-pennyworth of one, another two-pennyworth from another chemist, Mr. Greenish, and had called on a third chemist, and could only get one pennyworth from him—she said that her child was with her at the time—she had taken him out with her in the afternoon, and returned with him to her lodging, and left him down stairs at play with the landlord's children—that she felt ill and depressed, and afterwards called the child up from below before she went to bed—both she and the child were undressed—she said that the child was out with her all of the time—she had no recollection at any period of throwing herself from the window, nor did she repeat the observation about falling off the doorstep—there is scarcely any doorstep, not anything which would injure her by a fall.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LILLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any mark on her throat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was a slight mark of a knife having been drawn round her throat, bat it did not extend through the skin.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> It was not deep, was it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was very super<lb></lb>ficial, but quite recent—laudanum has not only a narcotic effect, but it will produce something analogous to insanity—pregnant women are sometimes in a morbid or deranged state of mind, lasting only during pregnancy, and recovering themselves afterwards—the prisoner is four months gone—there are, no doubt, cases recorded in which persons in that condition have inflicted deadly acts, on persons most near and dear to them—the low, depressed con<lb></lb>dition, which has been deposed to as having existed in the former and the present pregnancy, would be indicative of that state of mind.</p>

LILLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say that laudanum will produce something analo<lb></lb>gous to insanity, does not that depend on the condition of the person who has taken the laudanum? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It depends upon whether it enters the system—it would disturb some persons' minds, but not others—there is no evidence that the laudanum had entered the prisoner's system—it was re<lb></lb>jected from the stomach immediately, and not absorbed, which is indicative of previous delirium in the patient.</p>

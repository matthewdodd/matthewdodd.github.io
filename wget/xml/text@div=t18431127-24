               <p>house of Joseph Syer Orme, of Nassau-street, in the parish of St. Ann, Westminster. On the 24th of Nov., at half-past three o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing, I was in bed in the front kitchen, and was awoke by a noise at the window which had been closed the night before—there is no fastening to it, but it was shut down as far as it would go—I sat up in my bed, and as I arose saw a man partly through the window—I thought his feet were out—his hands were through the window—there was a lighted lucifer match in his hand—he was kneeling on a dresser near the window with his feet out of the window, all his body was inside the house—I screamed out—he instantly went out of the window—I ran up to Mr. Orme and alarmed him—after the man was gone I found two lucifer matches in the area, which had not been lighted, and two on the dresser—I had gone to bed at twelve o'clock.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) I was on duty at half-past three o'clock in the morning, on the 24th of Nov., in Nassau-street, and heard an alarm at Mr. Orme's house—I went up to the house, and saw a man getting over the area gate—he jumped down just before I came to him, and ran away—I fol<lb></lb>lowed him into Church-street—he was stopped there—it was the prisoner—I am quite certain he is the man who got over the gate—I took him back, found the kitchen window thrown open, and at the station I found a lucifer match on him—the servant gave me two lucifers which are of the same de<lb></lb>scription as that found on him.</p>

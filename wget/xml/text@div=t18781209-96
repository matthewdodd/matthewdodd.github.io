                  </hi>. In November last I lived at 122, Cable Street, St George's in the East—on the night of the 23rd, about 12.30, I was walking in a street near there, when I met the prisoners and another man—I asked them where I could get a lodging—O'Bryen pinioned me behind, and Picket went to my pocket and took out 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and my purse—there was nothing in the purse except the pawn-ticket of a watch for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said, "Take the 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., don't kill me"—I was knocked on the nose, and when the policeman came up I was bleeding—I afterwards saw the prisoners and iden<lb></lb>tified them—I was not sober.</p>

I saw three men on the night in question, in Royal Mint Street, running away from a man who had his nose bleeding—they went up Cartwright Street, and I followed—the prisoners went into a house and the door was shut—I knocked, and when the door was opened there were two men, some women, and a police-constable inside—by that time the prosecutor came up and I asked him if those were the men, and he said "No"—the prisoners I afterwards found in the room when I turned on my light, and the prosecutor identified them at once.</p>

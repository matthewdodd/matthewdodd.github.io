               <p>Ford Beauchamp. The two Prisoners lodged in my House, and my Son lay with them; on the 26th of December, they two went to Bed about half an Hour after 10, my Son went up in order to go to Bed about a Quarter after 11, and opening the Door, he saw a great many Chips, both upon the Bed and upon the Floor; seeing this, he called me up, and found the 2 Prisoners in Bed, I asked them what they had been doing? they made no Answer at first, but at last Mortished raised his Head, and said, - I know nothing of the Matter, do you, John? No, says Gardiner, we have had a Sleep since we blue the Candle out. I felt the Candle, and found the Wick hot, and the Tallow warm; upon which I got a Constable,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173712130017"></xptr> and two or three Watchmen; the Prisoners had no Money at all when they went to Bed, but the Watchmen found all the Money which was in the Club-box, upon them, except one crooked Sixpence which was found in the Bed. The Box wherein the Money, the Bond, and Note was lock'd, was in a Closet in the Room where they lay, and the Key of their Chamber opened that Closet. I saw the Box whole in that Closet the same Afternoon, and am positive nobody had been in the Room from that Time till they went to Bed.</p>

             confirmed his Father's Evidence; adding, that he saw the Box with a Hole broke in the Back, and Gardiner's Knife, a Gimblet, (broke in two Pieces) all lying at the Feet of the Bed; and that the Bond was found under Mortished's Pillow.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wightman, Constable, deposed to the same Effect; and likewise, that upon searching Gardiner's Pockets, they found a Piece of Wood (which exactly fitted into a Part of the Breach in the Box) and one Shilling; that upon Mortished there was found 8 s and Three Half-pence; that the Note was found in the Room, the Bond under his Pillow, and 6 d. in the Bed.</p>

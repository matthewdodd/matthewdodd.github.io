My wife said "There is a sergeant outside has got a man in custody." I put on this old coat without any shoes and stockings and went into the passage, and saw Crisp and Allen there, and Chapman was coming downstairs—the sergeant said "He is all right, he is a cab-driver, I know him." I went to put my things on and came back again, and as to going in the yard, I did not.</p>

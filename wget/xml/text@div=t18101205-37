I went to the door. I supposed I had lost a pair of shoes; the nail was bent where the shoes had been on. I missed one pair of shoes. I looked out, and saw a boy going very quick. In about ten minutes a boy came again; he made a stop at the door, and I walked to him - then he walked off. Mr. Hobson, a neighbour facing, calls out, lay hold of that boy. I saw him take a pair of shoes. I went and secured the boy, and the other boy that was with him ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get the shoes again. - A. No; I never got the shoes. I am sure I lost one pair from the door.</p>

            . On the 7th of November, about three or four o'clock, I saw the prisoner snatch a pair of shoes from off the nail, at Mr. Shrubsall's door; another boy was with him; they both ran off. I was minding my mother's shop at the time, standing at the window. In about ten minutes the prisoner returned and looked about the shop, and walked off, I then informed Mr. Shrubsall that was the boy that stole the shoes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been looking after a place. I was going up White Lion-street, to my house. The gentleman came and took me. He charged me with stealing a pair of shoes. I told him I had no shoes, and I was willing to go with him wherever he pleased.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

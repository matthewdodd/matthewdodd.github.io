                  </hi>. I am a private gentleman, and live at Church Street, Islington—on the morning of 5th March, a little after one a.m., I was near the Angel, Islington—I saw a cab, a cabman, and three other men, of whom Foulger was one—I asked for a light; they gave me one, and I said, "If you are going my way I should be very glad to get into the cab and take my share of the expense"—they agreed, and I got in—we went to Packington Street, where I got out and offered to pay the cabman a shilling—they said, "Do not do that; get in again and come and smoke a pipe with us"—I got in again, and was driven down to Whitmore Street, Hoxton, where we all got out, and they told me I should have to pay the whole expense—while I was speaking to the cabman, one of them put his hand into my jacket pocket—I saw there was something wrong, so I paid the cabman and immediately ran off—two of them followed me, I believe Foulger was not one of those—they threw me down, snatched my watch, and ran off—I saw nothing more of them that night, but gave information to a policeman whom I saw on the canal bridge—after going home I went to the police-station and saw the three pri<lb></lb>soners there and my watch.</p>

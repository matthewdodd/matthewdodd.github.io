                  </hi>. I live at 37, Swinbourne Road, Peterborough Road—in October I was in the employ of the proprietor of the "Chelsea News," Mr. Richard Russell—I know the defendant by seeing him at the office in King's Road, Chelsea—I was acting as the manager of the paper; it is published twice a week—on 9th October the defendant came, he pro<lb></lb>duced this pamphlet, and asked me to read it; I glanced carelessly through it—lie then, asked me to insert it in the "Chelsea News"—he went away and called again in a quarter of an hour with a letter; this is the envelope</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); he gave it to me for the editor—he went away again returned almost immediately and said he had forgotten to enclose the pamphlet; he gave me a copy and told me to give it to the editor with the note—he said that he and Mr. Baum were well known to each other and that there was a difference of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. between them—he asked me if I had seen the pamphlet before—I said that I had not—he said he was the author and expressed his surprise, saying that he and a friend had 10,000 printed and circulated in Chelsea with a view of closing the gardens—he said his name and address were enclosed in the envelope and we might make what use of it we liked—I gave the pamphlet and the envelope to the editor, Mr. Russell—the defendant called on Wednesday for a copy of the paper—I told him he could have one, but his pamphlet was not inserted; he seemed disappointed at that—he said he wished the gardens closed, and that all that he had stated in the pamphlet was true—he left seven or eight copies, I think, at the office.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the editor of the "Chelsea News"—this envelope with the contents was handed to me by Armour on 9th October; the date of the letter—I opened it and read it—a pamphlet accompanied the letter, which was enclosed in the envelope—that is the letter. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Dear sir, Will you kindly insert the enclosed lines in your paper, and oblige, yours &amp;c., John Robert Gornall.") The pamphlet was headed "The Trial of John Fox, or Fox John, or the Horrors of C*e**rne," and consisted of some hundred stanzas, alleging immoralities at the gardens—there was no printer's name to it—after reading it through, I had no doubt to whom it referred—I believed it referred to Mr. Baum, and judging from the nature of it I thought it was not fit to be inserted in any respectable paper; I did not insert it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am lessee and manager of the Cremorne Gardens—I have known the gardens for many years as a place of public entertainment—when I took them they had music, dancing, dramatic, and spirit licences—I went into possession in 1869—I have a lease for twenty-one years, and pay a rent of 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I have laid out a large sum of money in improving the gardens; roughly, from 12,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in 1873 there was an opposition to the music and dancing licences, and they we both refused—in 1874 a music licence was granted to me, and in 1875 the full licences were restored to me, as they were when I originally took the gardens—in 1874 and 1875 there was an opposition and the matter was discussed at the Sessions—no petition has been presented against my licences this year—the music and dancing licences were granted to me without any opposition—I have seen this pamphlet and read it—it was left at my private house by the prisoner—it applies undoubtedly to the Cremorne Gardens and to myself—I had to compound with my creditors during the last year—the suspension of my licences in 1874 had a very injurious effect upon the gardens, and cost me serious loss—the statements with regard to my looking with glee upon persons misfortunes are not at all true—I have never been convicted of any</p>

               <p>offence before I took the gardens—the admission to the gardens is 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and of course extra charges for the different entertainments, theatre, and so on—they are open at 3 o'clock in the day during the summer season, and the ordinary time of closing is about 12.30 by the Act of Parliament—we have an entertainment of fireworksat 10.30 now—during the last season nearly 300,000 persons have been in the gardens—all classess frequent them; especially the middle class—the police have charge of the grounds—I applied to the commissioners for the police to keep order in the ground, so as to regulate the traffic, and they do so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The middle class attend the gardens; husbands and wives and their families, and stay till 12.30—I seriously say this—there is a large platform, with an orchestra in the centre, upon which people dance—the band consists of forty-two performers, and is very skilful—the dancing generally commences about 7 o'clock and goes on, at intervals, till the close—the largest number of admissions to the gardens are not between 10.30 and 12.30—of course some loose women come between those hours, naturally; but to prevent any increase, I have increased the price—I charge 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. after 10 o'clock, to keep it very respectable—I swear that I do not know if hundreds of the women of the town come into the gardens between 10.30 and 12.30—I am-walking about the gardens and observing the women and the way in which they are dressed—there may be some loose women, but you might see a great many more at the Crystal Palace—there are refreshment bars, in various parts of the gardens, at which spirits and liquors are sold—there are also supper rooms—I generally remain on the premises till the close—I have been at the entrance, facing down the embankment where the cabs stand, and I swear I have not seen hun<lb></lb>dreds of women going away in the company of men—they, come and go certainly in the company of men—I should know some women of the town if I saw them there, but not all—in 1873 there was a very small attend<lb></lb>ance of Magistrates upon the bench on the day my licences were refused—in a pecuniary point of view the garden were more prosperous when I obtained my licences again—now and then I give free admissions to the persons who exhibit boards and distribute bills; not perpetually.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The boards are exhibited outside the shops—we give the people tickets from time to time—we do not pay them for doing this service, we generally expend a few orders—there was no opposition to my licences this year—when the opposition arose we had a firework entertain<lb></lb>ment and a representation of the bombardment of Strasbourg, which made a noise by firing—after that we gave a more peaceful representation with with less noise—persons who conduct themselves well are admitted; in fact I do not think I have the power to refuse anyone who does so—when the licences were renewed it was the largest number of Magistrates ever known to be present on the bench, and witnesses were called, and counsel on both sides heard.</p>

                  </hi>. I am ostler at the Milford Arms, Spring-grove, Heston—on 24th March, the prisoner and prosecutor were there, in the room where the bagatelle table is—it was between 1 and 2 in the day—I and Hilton, Martin, Wilson, the prisoner, and two or three others, were all playing bagatelle, until a dispute arose about the payment of some beer, which was settled without any violence—the dispute was amongst all that were in the room—we went on playing and joking—the prisoner and Hilton played a game single-handed—Hilton won, and the prisoner refused to pay—they played for a pint of beer—the prisoner called Hilton bad names—that passed off with joking, no blows—Hilton was joking the prisoner, and he took offence at it and threatened to pull his moustache off—after some time the prisoner vent away—he returned in about 10 minutes—Martin and Hilton played a game—the prisoner bet threepence that Martin would win—Hilton won, and then the prisoner refused to pay; they called each other bad names until the prisoner struck Hilton in the face with his fist—Hilton instantly returned it—they had a scramble in the parlour and both fell, Hilton at the bottom, and the prisoner kept hitting him when he was down—I took bold</p>

               <p>of Hilton and Wilson took hold of the prisoner, and we ported them; there was blood drawn on both sides in the parlour—the prisoner went out of the bar and asked for his cap—Hilton said he had not got his cap, but if he would come outside he would give him a good hiding, or he should him—they went outside and Hilton began fighting first, before the prisoner was hardly outside; they had hold of each other; it lasted about two minutes—the prisoner walked away; he muttered something—I do not know what he said—I did not see him again until he was taken into custody—I did not see him doing anything to Hilton mote than striking him—immediately after the prisoner had gone away I saw blood running down Hilton's jacket, behind, from his head—Wilson and Martin went with him to the surgeon's.</p>

I am painter—on 24th March I was at the Milford Arms about a quarter-past 1 o'clock—there were several disputes about the payment of the beer and bets—I had rather a serious dispute with the prisoner about ten minutes to 6, before he went out; he wished me to stop till he came back—I did so, and then we commenced another game—he brought in a bunch of violets in his hand—he passed them round the room and observed how nice they smelt—I asked him if he would give me a few and he gave me them all—we commenced another game of bagatelle, and another dispute arose, and as I was standing against the bagatelle board the prisoner up with his right fist and struck me in tht face—he danced round me as if he was geing to hit me again, and I was obliged to hit him again—we</p>

               <p>had a scuffle—he got me down on the floor, and struck me several times—the waiter picked him off me, and I went and spoke to the landlord—while I was talking to him the prisoner came and accused me of taking his cap—I told him several times that I had not got it—then as soon as we got outside he took hold of me and clung round me, and it seemed to me as if he was scratching me down the back—I did not feel him stab me at all—I had on a white jacket, two waistcoats, and my shirt—he then let go of me and walked away, muttering something which I could not hear—Martin came up to me and said "You are stabbed"—he took me into the parlour and I found that my head was laid open, and the blood was streaming down me—my head was not in that condition when I was talking to the landlord—Martin took me to a chemist's shop, and then to Mr. Chapman, the surgeon, who attended to me—the constable has the clothes which I had on.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, residing at Hounslow—Hilton was brought to my surgery on 24th March, in a very feeble state, bleeding front a clean cut wound, about an inch long, at the back of the head—I could not say exactly whether that had been inflicted with a knife, or what—it might have been cut by the edge of anything else—there were two punctured wounds on the buttock, one of them an inch long, and an inch deep—they must have been inflicted by some instrument forced into him; some pooket-knife I should think—a stone could not do it—there were also two punctured wouuds on the back of the neck, and a wound and one or two scratches on the arm—the wounds on the neck were the same kind as those on the buttock, and inflicted by the same sort of instrument—I think the scratches might have been inflicted with the same sort of instrument, only with the edge turned—there were six wounds in all, and two scratches—the wounds were not in the posi<lb></lb>tion of any important artery, and therefore were not serious—if inflicted in the front of the person, in the neighbourhood of any important artery, they would have been serious.</p>

               <p>Largent. He had, he dined at my house almost every day, but I can't say I saw him at my house that day. I asked him if he had been drinking with any body out of my tankard, he said no, there had been 2 gentlemen drinking out of it, and he watched when they went away, and then he said he took it; (produced in court) here is my name engraved on the bottom of it, and that he took it that very afternoon.</p>

            . On the 14th of Dec. the prisoner came to my house, and offered this tankard to me to sell, I looked at it, and at the bottom I saw the prosecutor's name and place of abode engraved; I looked at the prisoner and recollected I had seen him tried here before; I gave a signal to one of my servants to get a constable; when he was come, I asked the prisoner, how he came by the tankard? he said, it is no matter how he came by it, if you will buy it, I'll sell it you; he said, he had not stole it, but he had lent a person 4 guineas upon it. I said, pray tell me your name; he told me a fictitious name. I said, I had seen him at another place, is not your name

               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Was there not a person with me when I first came to your house?</p>
               <p>Abrahams. Yes, there was one Barnard, an acquaintance of his.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to stop him?</p>
               <p>Abrahams. I apprehended he brought him, thinking I would stop him; they had been in Newgate together, but the other was not there for a robbery.</p>

               <p>The day before this thing happened, I met with Barnard on Snow-hill, I asked him, if he would take a walk with me; we went up Holborn together, he said, if I could get any old silver or jewels, he would buy them of me. I went to this house to dine; I staid drinking beer, I saw this tankard standing on the table, and being in great distress, I took it, and put it in my pocket, and went to Barnard with it; when I came to him, he said, he would not buy it, but he would go with me to a person that would buy it of me, and I was to give him a guinea. I went with it, and there I was stopt.</p>

Between two and three o'clock in the morning of the 27th of July, I was called up and informed that the house was broken open. On examining the counting-house, I found the desk broken open, and also the iron closet opened, and a drawer within the iron closet, which contained the notes and sovereigns stated in the indictment, in a bag, and bills and papers. I cannot exactly say how many sovereigns there were, but I presume about forty or fifty; there were two 10 l. bank-notes, and one 5 l.; they were gone also; a snuffbox, which had a portrait of the Duke of Wellington, was taken out of the chest. The prisoner had repeatedly seen me put money in the iron chest. No other place was forced open. I searched the house all over, with the watchman, but found nobody; I called the prisoner up, and he assisted in the search; in the course of which he went into the kitchen, where there is a copper on the left hand side, and on the right there is a flue, to convey steam into the chimney; the prisoner got up on the copper, to search this flue; I said,</p>
               <p>"What is the use of your getting up there? nobody can be hid there;" he got down, and made no farther observation. Between ten and eleven o'clock next morning, 
               <persName id="t18220911-29-person271">Harrison</persName>
             the officer examined the premises; he told the prisoner he should search him, and said it must be some person in the house who had done it. The maid servant and the shopman slept in the house, besides the prisoner; they were all searched, but nothing found. Four days after, from other causes, the prisoner was taken to Guildhall, and discharged; he was still in my service, and after he was examined, I gave orders that he should not be admitted into any part of the house but the shop; he did not know of these orders. The maid servant was discharged after the prisoner's examination, not about this robbery, but about something the prisoner said of her conduct; the prisoner went before the girl; I discharged him after his examination on the 3d of August; she stopped in my service till the prisoner was taken a second time. About two days after his discharge he called for his clothes, which were kept in a garret where he slept; I ordered them to be brought down to him, which was done; he endeavoured to go down the kitchen stairs, but the servant hindered him; he did go down the back cellar stairs for some brushes. I saw some chimney sweepers ring at the bell about seven o'clock on Tuesday morning, the 13th of August; in consequence of this I directed that none should sweep the chimneys but Mr. Brown or a person in his employ. On the Thursday Mr. Brown's boy came, and the servant knocked at my bed-room door, and gave Mrs. Laurie, in my presence, a bag containing forty-seven sovereigns, and one was found afterwards; I am sure the bag is the same which was in my chest, and the amount is the same, as near as I can guess. I expected the two boys to call again on Friday, to sweep the chimney, and got Harrison to be ready in case they came, which they did about seven o'clock, and were let in. Harrison came across, and apprehended them, and in about a quarter of an hour after they came I saw the prisoner in Harrison's custody; he had gone out in consequence of what the sweeps said, and brought the prisoner in in about two minutes; he was taken before Mr. Alderman Brown, and committed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. How many days after the alarm did the prisoner leave your service - A. It happened on the 27th of July, and he left on the 3d of August; he had full access to the house for the first four days.</p>
               <p>Q. And had ample time and opportunity to remove any thing during the seven days - A. Certainly; the counting house is in the back part of the premises; he must come down from the garret into the shop to go there. When the alarm was given, I found the street door open, and the counting-house door also; the side of the desk was wrenched off, as well as the lock being picked or forced; it must have taken some time to do it; the chest was open, and the lock of the drawer in it picked. I called the prisoner down from his bed-room. He made some charges against the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110015"></xptr>servant girl, and that girl brought the sovereigns up. The bank-notes and snuff-box are not found.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where did the servant sleep - A. On the 3d floor; the shopman slept in the next room to the prisoner; they were all alarmed at the same time, dressed, and came down. I went to bed between ten and eleven o'clock that night; I could easily hear a person come down stairs if he had his shoes on.</p>

            . I am a marshalman. I went to Mr. Laurie's house first about a quarter or half-past nine o'clock, and was shewn the state of things; there was no force on the door from without; it must have been opened from within. I have no doubt about it. There was a chain and bar to the door, neither of which were forced. I searched the premises; no place had been opened or attempted to be opened, except where the property was. We called the prisoner up stairs, and questioned him. I told him I thought somebody had broken out, and not in; I searched him, and all the servants, but found nothing. On Friday, the 16th of August, I went to the prosecutor's house about five o'clock in the morning; I was walking up and down opposite the house, watching for two sweeps; and just before seven o'clock two chimney sweeps came. I followed them into the house. The servant let them in. I questioned them for full ten minutes; the servant girl was there all the time, and in consequence of an observation she made, I ran out instantly up to the left, and saw the prisoner standing at the corner of Crane-court under the arch of the court, against the wall, singing - I took him, and said,</p>
               <p>"This is found out, Mr. Charles;" he said nothing. I took him over to Mr. Laurie's, into the presence of the two sweeps, and the servant. The biggest sweep said,</p>
               <p>"That is the man who hired me to sweep the chimnies, and to take the bag of gold out, and I was to have two sovereigns" - the prisoner said nothing; the sweep said to Mr. Laurie,</p>
               <p>"I did not mean to take the gold out of the house, Sir, but to give it you." He then said to the prisoner,</p>
               <p>"What a pretty mess you have got me into?" the prisoner said nothing - the other sweep was frightened. I took them all three to the Compter. The prisoner was committed, and the sweeps discharged.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who was present while you were questioning the sweeps - A. Mr. Laver, the shopman, the girl, and Mills, who was with me, and I think Mr. Laurie was coming down stairs. The door must have been opened inside.</p>
               <p>Q. Anybody connected with persons outside could let them in - A. Certainly. The sweep said he was to go down to the chimney below, and in a certain flue he would find a bag of money.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You went out in consequence of what the maid-servant said - A. Yes. I had seen her looking out of the window for an hour before.</p>

            . I am a chimney-sweeper to Mr. Brown, who sweeps the prosecutor's chimney. On Thursday, the 15th of August, about seven o'clock in the morning, I went to sweep the chimney, and in the steam flue of the kitchen, I found a bag containing something; I gave it to the servant girl. I looked into the flue with a light, and found a sovereign, which I gave to the servant. I thought there was money in the bag, because I heard it jingle. She took the bag up stairs, and told me to go up the chimney.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the girl tell you to look in that flue - A. Nobody told me - I was feeling for the copper flue, which goes into the chimney, for if we do not attend to that the soot goes into it. When I gave her the bag, she told me to go on; and when I came down, Mr. Laurie told me to look further, and I found the sovereign.</p>

             the robbery, I remember two chimney sweeps coming to the door - I did not open it; the errand boy told them when to come again. I did not hear him - they were not let in. Two days after the last witness came, and swept the chimney. I was in the kitchen when he found the bag in the flue - he went there of his own accord. He delivered me a bag from the flue - I opened it, and saw it contained sovereigns, and immediately took it up stairs, and gave it to my mistress in the presence of my master. After the chimney was swept, I saw the boy take a single sovereign from the flue. On the following morning Harrison was set to watch the house. I was up at six o'clock, an hour before the two sweeps came. I placed myself at the front room, second floor window, with the sash up. The two sweeps came. I saw the prisoner a quarter of an hour before that time, at the back of a mail coach, standing up holding the straps, going towards St. Pauls's; I saw him no where else. When Harrison spoke to the sweeps I told him what I had seen; (They were the two boys who had been there three days before). He went out to look for the prisoner, and returned with him in two or three minutes. The biggest sweep said,</p>
               <p>"You are a pretty fellow for bringing me into this scrape," and that the prisoner was the lad who sent him to sweep the chimneys, and to tell the lie, by saying that he came from Mr. Brown's when he did not. The prisoner made no answer. I do not remember anything more being said. The money was produced.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you servant of all-work - A. Yes. I had twelve guineas a year.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you very angry with the boy for the accusations he made against you - A. No, because some of it was true, and I forgive him the rest. I saw the sweeps come twice,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110016"></xptr>their faces were black. I do not know that I had seen them at other times. I went to bed between eleven and twelve o'clock on the night of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you were accused of having sweet-hearts - A. Yes. I saw nobody on the night of the robbery, I am positive. I slept in the back room, second floor. I am not in service now.</p>

            . I am a chimney-sweeper, and live in One Tun-court, Strand. I am climbing journeyman to Mrs. Watson. I was never in Mr. Brown's employ. I know the prisoner; he first spoke to me one Monday, in the Strand; he met me there, and said he had left his place in Fleet-street, and told me to go and see about the kitchen chimnies; I was to ring the bell or knock, and I should see the servant or the young lad. He told me to tell the lad if I saw him, that the chimney had not been done for three months. He said there was a bag of money in the copper flue, and I was to bring it away, and he would give me two sovereigns - that it would not chink; it was tied up safe. I had never swept Mr. Laurie's chimnies. I was to say I came from Brown's of Water-lane. I went to Mr. Laurie's on Monday morning, and the lad told me to come next morning, which I did, and was let in, and told to come on Friday morning at six o'clock. I saw the prisoner on the Monday evening in the Strand, about half-past six o'clock, and on Tuesday morning I saw him about seven o'clock, and told him what I was to do, and he said then it would be all right. I went on Friday morning, and Harrison came and took me into custody. I had Woolley, a boy, with me - I do not think he knew what it was about; he was present on Monday when the prisoner spoke, but did not know what passed between us. Harrison spoke to me in the shop, then went out, and brought in the prisoner - I said,</p>
               <p>"You have brought me in a nice scrape." I had told him in the Strand that if I got the bag I would give it to the gentleman or lady - he said I ought to be ashamed of myself, and I mentioned it in the shop that morning. I was taken before the Alderman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you still work for Mrs. Watson - A. Yes. I saw the lad on Monday and Tuesday mornings. I am quite sure I saw nobody but him. I saw the shopman and servant girl on Friday, and not before.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not go, and tell Mr. Laurie of this - A. I know I am guilty of that; I kept it to myself till Friday; I told the prisoner on Monday, that I should give it to the lady or gentleman. When he first spoke to me, he said he was very wild that he could not go into the kitchen to get the money out of the flue. I told nobody of it. I have served ten years with Watson, and am thirty years old. I told the constable what the prisoner told me; I had nothing to do with him before, but have often seen him go through Hungerford market. I knew nothing of it till he told me.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You never spoke to him till Monday - A. No; I never saw the servant before Friday, whether she saw me by looking through the window, I cannot say: I did not see her at the window (looking at her).</p>
               <p>Q. Did you expect any thing for returning the money to the gentleman - A. Unless he chose to give me any thing. I told Harrison, who sent me about the chimney before he brought the prisoner in.</p>

               <p>MR. LAURIE. I produce the bag; it is the same which contained the sovereigns stolen on the night in question; here is a mark on it; I had only one; it contained many more than two sovereigns.</p>

Allons! The Prisoner said, I'll fight you no more, for I believe you have got it - This is your own seeking, you forced me to it. Then they spoke French. I saw some Blood run from the Deceased's Back, under his Shoulder The Prisoner put his Sword up, and the Deceas'd put his Clothes on, and said to the Prisoner, give me my Hat and Wig. Aye, says the Prisoner, if you'll give me or that Gentleman your Sword first, for I won't trust my Life in your hands. Then the Deceas'd took up his own Hat and Wig, and we all went into the Lane The Deceas'd appear'd still full of Resentment, and therefore the Prisoner would not walk before him, but said, my dear Dubois (for they were both of the same Name, and both Masters of the Sword) if you will go before, I will take care of you; but I won't trust you behind me - You know you forced me to it. The Deceas'd made no answer; but to end the difference, I went between them, the Prisoner being on my right hand and the Deceas'd on my left: He bled very much; and so we went to the bottom of the Lane, and then I turn'd back.</p>

            , Surgeon. Between 3 and 4 a Clock the Prisoner came in a Chair to my House in Panton Square - He said he had walked two Miles from Berwick-Street, before he could get a Chair, and bled all the Way. He desir'd I would go home and dress him; but I advis'd him not to go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173407100022"></xptr> home in that bloody Condition he was in, for fear of frightening his Wife. I saw the Wound was Mortal, it pass'd above the Right-breast, and below the Collar-bone, and cut the auxillary great blood Vessel that goes to the Arm. He still seem'd to retain some Animosity against the Person that had wounded him, tho' he would not name him, but said he had not done, if a Man on Horseback had not come up while they were fighting - The Deceas'd dy'd next Day, and the loss of Blood was the cause of it.</p>
               <p>Several Gentlemen of the Blade depos'd, That the Prisoner was a peaceable inoffensive Man, and gave a different Character of the Deceas'd.</p>

I live at 35, Brewer Street—on 21st April, about 10.30 a.m., the prisoner came into my house and said "I must kill you," and struck me on the head with a little instrument, knocked me down, and' ran away with my chain, seals, and locket—I put my hand on my watch, the chain broke, and he did not get it—I knew him before; he came to me for assistance three months before, and I allowed him to stay in my house out of charity—I have seen him five or six times, and I believe him to be sane—he told me that he was perfectly sane, but that he was quite capable of feigning insanity.</p>

On 25th April, about 2.45 p.m., I went to 105, Long Acre and saw the prisoner—he recognised me and said "Mr. Greenham, how do you do? you want me"—I said "Yes, I shall take you in charge for assaulting Dr. Martinoli and stealing his chain, and seals, and keys"—he said "I had a perfect right to them, because he owed ine money"—I took him in custody.; we walked out of the public-house together, and when we got into I he'street he ran away—I ran after him; he was stopped—I took him to the station, and found three keys, a seal, and a locket, which Dr. Martinoli identifies—I knew him before, having had him in custody several times—he appeared to understand me, and perfectly sensible.</p>

I am surgeon to Her Majesty's Gaol of New-gate, and have been so 25 years—I have had a very large experience in cases of insanity—on 12th May my attention was called to the prisoner in Newgate, specially to understand the state of his mind—he would some<lb></lb>times converse and sometimes not—I am of opinion that he is acting, that his conduct is assumed, that it is not real—he seemed to understand, but he did not answer or talk in a silly way—he conformed to the rules of the gaol—I have had a great many cases of persons feigning insanity, it is one of my greatest troubles.</p>

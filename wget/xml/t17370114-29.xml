               <p>William Weaving I can only say I lost the Plates the 5th of Jan when I was out upon the Inquest, and I swear to them.</p>
               <p>A Witness. I went into the Yard, and saw the Prisoner there; I asked her what Business she had there, she said she only wanted to make a little Water, but I saw the Plates in her Apron, and she rattled them down in the Dust Tub, which stood in the Yard; she had brought them about 6 or 7 Yards from the Place where they stood! This was between 12 and 1 o'Clock.</p>
               <p>Defence. I have nothing to say, - I never ow'd that Witness any ill Will, nor did she ever see me in the Yard: I had been out to buy some Bone to mend my old Stays, and wanting to make Water, I stepp'd up the Yard, and there I was charg'd with stealing those Plates. She has ow'd me a Grudge, for more than 12 Months. <rs id="t17370114-29-verdict155" type="verdictDescription">

When I left my lodgings on Thursday morning, the 27th of July, I fastened the door, and left nobody therein. I had occasion to go back again at ten o'clock, and the padlock was off the door, and I could not get in. I pushed, and the person who was inside was pushing also; in an instant he rushed out upon me, and I saw it was the prisoner; I laid hold of him, and said, murder, and thieves; he ran down stairs, and I after him, and I cried stop that thief, and he was taken. I found nothing was removed out of the room; but a bonnet-box, which had been on the top of another box, by the side of the bed, was removed, that contained a black silk bonnet, and a straw bonnet, for one of which I gave fourteen shillings, two years ago; and the straw one twelve shillings. I don't think together that they are worth more than five shillings.</p>

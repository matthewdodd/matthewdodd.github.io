                  </hi>. I am manager to Christopher Walton, a goldsmith, of 8, Ludgate Hill—on 25th March, about 5.30, the prisoner came in and asked me to show him a ruby pin—I said "What price?"—he said "About 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I said that he could not have one at that price, and showed him a small one at three guineas—he said that he should like to see one with more gold and less stone, and asked to see others—I produced a tray—he looked at several, and at last selected one from the back part of the tray, marked a guinea, and said that he would take it—I said, "I will brush it up for you"—he put his hand across the tray and said, "I will leave this," putting down a shilling, "I am going a little further while you are packing it, and will look in again"—before he left the lobby I missed the most conspicuous pin in the tray, a diamond one, value fifty-five guineas—I halloaed to the clerk, went to the door, and saw the prisoner running—I called "Murder!" and "Stop thief!" and was tripped up a few doors before I got to Ave Maria Lane—I got up again and pursued the prisoner into Newgate Street, and he was captured in Giltspur Street—I have not the least doubt he is the man.</p>

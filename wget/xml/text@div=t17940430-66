               <p>Q. What is the young one's name? - Eversfield. He made use of a great many bad words; they said they would cut me open, and he gave me a violent blow across my nose and my eye; the justice saw what a terrible black eye I had; and then he ran after the other; I then got up and went and looked after the watchman, and could not find him, and a gentleman went to seek for him, and he came and found me; I went away with the watchman to look for my pattens, and went with him to his watchbox, and then while I was there this gentleman called out for assistance; then the prisoner was taken; the patrole went to him, and the gentleman came back holding the prisoner, the young man Eversfield; I said that is the person that has left me, that used me so, says I, the other is a thicker set person. He was secured.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the magistrate the next morning? - No, I did not go till the third hearing, Mr. Burrell appeared the first and second hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see Raine after that night? - I did not see him till I came to the justice; when I was there the justice had him up.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they produce any thing to you at the justice's? - The things that are set down; the officer has them.</p>

               <p>I am an officer; I got these things from Raine's pocket. On the 5th of March, I was officer of the night, I was on my duty at ten o'clock; Eversfield was locked up in the Cage, and the officer was gone to look after Raine; at eleven o'clock when I was going to take Eversfield to the watch-house, some of his friends said, it was a pity I did not go and seek after Raine, and I did go and take him.</p>

               <p>Q. Dark? - Yes, moon light.</p>
               <p>Q. It was so dark you could not discern a person? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first saw the prisoners, were they not on the opposite side of the road? - No, they were on this side.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did you or did you not speak to Eversfield before he spoke<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300111"></xptr>to you? - No, they came speaking to me, and then they sidled me into the field, as I before mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not hesitate much to go into the field, Mrs. Carter? - They sidled me there, and then tripped me down.</p>
               <p>Q. They talked with you very kindly, and then you withdrew with them into a field? - No, they sidled me into the field, and tripped me down.</p>
               <p>Q. There was some conversation passed between you? - Not very much.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did they keep speaking to you? - Not two minutes.</p>
               <p>Q.Pray, ma'am, how do you get your living? what employment have you? - I have lived on a great many good things, since my husband died; I live by needle work when I can get it to do, and I had been to a shop to ask for work then.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never offered to make this business up with the prisoners? - They came to me to make it up several times; I did not go to them, Raine's wife came to me and made me go to Newgate to see Raine; they were always coming to me, and would not be easy without I would go.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you or have you not, at any time, now speak the truth, heard any thing like a reward, some money to be had provided the prisoners were convicted? - I never heard any thing about any money.</p>

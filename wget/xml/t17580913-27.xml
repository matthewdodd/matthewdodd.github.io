            . I am a watch-maker, the prisoner came to my house yesterday was sen'night and asked me if I would buy a tankard, she producing it in this condition. I asked her how she came by it; she told me her sister found it at the fire in White-chapel. (He produced a tankard that had been in a fire, and part of the lid melted.) I looked over the goldsmith's-hall bills, and found by the descriptions on the tankard, that it belong'd to Mr. Manning.</p>
               <p>Q. to Manning. Look at that tankard?</p>
               <p>Manning. ( Takes it in his hand.) This is my property; here is my name and arms upon it. I have not had it above three or four years.</p>
               <p>Q. to Abrahams. How long ago is it since the fire in White-chapel?</p>
               <p>Abrahams. It is about a year ago; I shew'd the prisoner the bill and told her the tankard belong'd to a person in petticoat-lane, said she, pray send for Mr. Manning, naming his name, before I mentioned it. I charged a constable with her and went to Mr. Manning; she insisted upon it, another woman gave it her, and she was to have a shilling for selling it, she would not confess she took it from Mr. Manning's house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I went down by St. Mary-ax to see for my husband, and then to Duke's-place; a woman met me and said to me will you go into that watchmaker's shop, and ask him if he buys plate; I went in and asked, and he said he did, I went out and told her; she said she should be obliged to me if I would go in and sell this tankard for her, and she would hold my child for me the while. I carried it in, and said the woman asked 4 s. an ounce, or to leave it to his own option to give her what he would; then he sent for a constable, I said pray do not charge me, I'll carry you to the woman that owns it, the people said they saw the woman ran away.</p>

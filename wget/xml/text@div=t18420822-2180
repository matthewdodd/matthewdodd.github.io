I had six ducks in a shed—I shut them up at nine o'clock—the policeman called me up between twelve and one—I found the shed door open, and three ducks gone—one was found in the ditch—I never sold the prisoner any—when he was taken he said he had bought them of me, and told me to say he had bought them, and he would satisfy me.</p>

I was at Longford about twelve o'clock on the night of the 31st of July—I heard the ducks cackle, and in a short time I saw the prisoner coming along the road with this basket—I asked what he had got in it—he said, "Nothing"—I found it contained two ducks, and asked where he got them from—he said he bought them of a man at Colebrook—I asked who the man was—he said he should not satisfy me—I said I should lock him up if he did not—he</p>

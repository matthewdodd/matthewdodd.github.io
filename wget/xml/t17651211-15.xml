On the 16th of October, about three in the morning, I happened to be awake; I thought I heard some rumbling noise: I lay still a while and heard it again, I came down gently, and saw a light in the cellar through the crevices. I called the watch, and took care to keep the window close to keep them in; the light was then put out: I found somebody striving to make their escape. The watchmen came and took the prisoner out of the cellar to the watch house. (He produced a dark lanthorn, and an iron wrenching tool;) these were found upon him, he begged to be let go.</p>
               <p>Q. What goods were in the cellar?</p>
               <p>Whitehead. There were candles and tallow, I cannot say any thing besides; the hatch was removed.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the window fastened?</p>
               <p>Whitehead. There was a bolt in the inside, and a wooden slipper on the other, and two nails to keep the bolt from going back; they were bent: there were the marks of the wrenching tool in several places. I am certain when I went to bed the window was fast.</p>

I am a watchman; I and my partner Larimer were called, we found the cellar window about half a yard open: we took the prisoner out of the cellar, and found part of this dark lanthorn in his pocket, and in the watch-house we found the other part of it in his great-coat pocket; we found the wrench upon him: we asked him what business he had in the cellar, he hummed and hawed: we could get nothing out of him.</p>

               <p>Going along, I had got pretty much in liquor. I fell over the cellar door, and let the lanthorn fall. I do not know how I came by the lanthorn.</p>

               <p>REV. WEEDEN BUTLER. I do duty at Brompton chapel. On Sunday evening, the 31st of January, as I came out of the vestry to go to the pulpit, to preach, I saw the prisoner close behind the stairs; it was about twenty minutes or a quarter to eight o'clock - we begin service at seven; I ordered the pew-opener to put him into a pew. On the following Sunday I found the lock of my box forced off - it was fastened by the hasp, remaining as I had locked it; when I opened it I found a silk handkerchief, in which I wrap my cassock, gone - when I searched the pocket of my cassock, I missed a white cambric handkerchief, but am not certain I might not have taken it away on some former occasion, but I thought it was in the cascock - I saw the silk handkerchief again to the best of my belief, in Woodberry's hands, but should not like to swear to it;

               <p>WILLIAM WOODBERRY. I am a constable of Queen-square. I went to the prisoner's lodging, No. 4, New-street, Brompton, on the 1st of February, about two or three o'clock - he was at home; I saw him - I was making a search there, not for this property - I saw in a box, in a paper, some pieces of wax and mould candles; I asked him where he got them - he said they were given to him; I found nothing else - I went to him again on the 8th of February, hearing of the robbery at the chapel; he was not at home then - his wife was; I found some pieces of wax and mould candles, two wine-glasses, a tumbler, a cork-crew a silk handkerchief, a glass cloth, a wine-bottle, with a little sherry left in it, and an ink-bottle; I took his wife into custody, and brought her to the office - I saw the prisoner the same evening, about half-past seven o'clock, at the corner of York-street, Westminster - his mother fetched me to him there; he said he was come to tell the truth - I had not spoken to him, and neither made him any threat nor promise; I said I would take him before the Magistrate, and as we were going towards the office, he said he was guilty of going to the chapel with a young man named Chitty - I had not said any thing to him about the chapel.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you not told his wife, and told her to tell him it would be better the whole truth should be told? A. No such thing; he said he was sorry for what he had done - I then took him before the Magistrate, as he said he wished to tell the Magistrate; no examination was gone into that night - I told the Magistrate he wished to confess something; the Magistrate told him he would advise him not to state any thing - he was not examined, as there was no clerk there, and what he told the Magistrate that night was not taken down in writing, but it was next day, when he made a similar statement - he told the Magistrate that night, that he did go with Chitty; that Chitty came and called him two or three times that night, and he went out with Chitty, went into the chapel with him, and went into the vestry, drank some wine, and Chitty had told him if he would go in with him, he should have a good fire and a glass of wine - that he was so frightened when he was there that he spilled the wine over him, and that these glasses and things were given to him by Chitty; they were were not produced that night - he knew I had them; that is all he said that night, except that he was very sorry for what had happened - he was examined on the Thursday following, and the witnesses also; he made a statement that day to the Magistrate, which was taken down in writing - (looking at it) this is Mr. Gregorie's (the Magistrate) writing; I heard him examined - (read).</p>

             (in continuation.) I found a knife at his lodging; I went and examined the vestry on Tuesday, the 9th, and seeing the lock of Mr. Butler's box had been forced open, I put the knife against the impression left inside the box, and it answered the size of the knife exactly - the mark agreed with the width of the knife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This is a very common kind of knife? A. It is; he said Chitty had given him the things - I went to his lodging first on the 1st of February, saw the wax candles, and inquired about them; he said they were given to him; I saw the glasses there that day, but did not ask about them, because I knew nothing of the robbery of the chapel; I did not mention to him about the glasses: he might know I had seen them - they were in a cupboard which I opened, in his presence; he could have made away with them between the 1st and 8th of February if he had chosen; he was at large those seven days - I only found a few pieces of wax candle on the 8th; he said Chitty gave him all the things - I have been looking for Chitty ever since, but cannot find him.</p>

I know these things - these glasses were left in the chapel; they have been there for years - I have had the care of them about eight months, and have no doubt they are the glasses, and this cloth has the B. picked out - the C. is left; here is the mark where the B. has been - this tumbler is a remarkable one, more so than the glasses; I believe them to belong to the chapel, but the cloth certainly belongs to the chapel - it is inked with the gentlemen wiping pens on it - I have seen Mr. Butler with a handkerchief of this kind.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. That is an extraordinary tumbler? A.

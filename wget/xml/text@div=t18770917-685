I am a merchant in partnership with three others in Calcutta—we commenced the partnership in 1860—I knew the prisoner while I was in Calcutta—he was a merchant, I heard in England of his having failed—I came over to England in February, 1875, for the purpose of establishing a branch—I took premises in Lime Street—I had no personal communication with the prisoner till January, 1876—I had received a communication from my brothers, after which I saw the prisoner—I did not refer to that communication to him nor he to me—I said "Take a seat in the office and go on with the business"—I knew he was coming, by the communication from my firm in Calcutta, and by that only—I arranged with him to pay him 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month, which was to be debited to the account—his duties were Continental correspondence and Continental business in general and to bring in some of his old constituents to our business—he was to have 25 percent, on business he brought in—he remained in our employ until the morning of the 27th June, 1877—he brought in some business, not to a very large extent, perhaps 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the gross amount of value of the goods; the transactions resulted in a loss—I have not, under my arrangement, to pay him on those—two or three telegraphic codes were started about March 1876, and May or June, 1877, by the prisoner—he was to make them for our business—some time subsequently to January I increased his salary to 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month—I entered into no agreement with him whatever beyond what I have stated—I was never indebted to him beyond the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month excepting any profit he might have brought in—as a matter of fact there' was no profit—I certainly never at any time made an arrangement with him which would entitle him to claim 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I repeatedly gave him my blank signature upon letters and memoranda—he was not authorised to draw bills or promissory notes on our account—the signature</p>

               <p>on the promissory note A is mine—the handwriting is the prisoner's—I gave him no authority whatever to write that—I had no idea of any such com<lb></lb>munication as that being made to the official assignee in Calcutta—he made a remark one day about paying his creditors, in the presence of two or three people—a broker came in and said "What are you at that again," referring to the code, and he said "Yes, as soon as this is finished, Rushton Brothers will pay my creditors," at which we all laughed and thought it a very good joke—we never undertook to pay him anything for the code—there is no truth in it—this letter of the 23rd November, 1876, bears my signature—it is written on our office paper Limp Street; and the body is in the prisoner's handwriting—I did not authorise him to write it and knew nothing about it—the first I heard of it was at the Mansion House, and I then looked at the letter-book—it is the original of the press copy—this letter of the 1st May 1876, headed "Memorandum to B. H. Hirsch, from Rushton Brothers, Lime Street" is signed by me—the body is in the prisoner's handwriting—this paper was delivered in my office about the 19th August, following the May it purports to be written on—I never used memorandum sheets similar to that before August—I can speak to that solemnly—the body is an entire fabrication—I never heard of the contents, I certainly never gave the prisoner authority to draw for 200,000 Rupees—it is a question whether I could draw it myself—the business has improved since the prisoner came to us, because we started in London and had his services as a clerk in the office with four or five others, and naturally the business would increase—it has not increased through any introductions of his.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was born in the Province of Bengal—I left India for the purpose of going into business about January or February, 1875—I had previously been in England—I left the prisoner in Calcutta—he was at that time a merchant; he had only just started, about a year—I knew him for some time before that—he had been in a large firm, and so made friends with a number of commercial people; that is what I mean by his consti<lb></lb>tuents—I first saw him in London about the beginning of January, 1876—I left my brother Hayward in Calcutta—I did not know anything about the document proved by Mr. Lattey to come from Dignam and Robinson; they were solicitors to our firm, and may be now—I do not remember hearing of the powers of Attorney—I had a communication from my firm in Calcutta with the text of the agreement which had been come to; I think it was about August, 1875—the business of Rushton Brothers in London was principally a jute business, direct through me—this list of forty-six names comprises principally names of constituents we had before our dealings with the pri<lb></lb>soner—there do not seem to be any jute men, except one—I should say the whole business, including the jute, would be about 200,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 300,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—the jute would represent, perhaps, half—the agreement I was advised of from Calcutta was never signed, I believe—I believe the prisoner wrote to my brother in Calcutta in February, 1876, the month after his arrival in England—my brother is here—these are specimen sheets of the telegraphic code (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I was not aware that the prisoner had been five years com<lb></lb>pleting the code until he said so—I paid Messrs. Straker as much as 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for printing with reference to the perfection of this very code—the copying work was the work of the prisoner's—it is copied from other codes and put into this shape—it is not a very difficult thing to make a code—the sheets were supplied to Straker for a period of more than two years—I never supplied any of the copy for the printing—I did not know that the prisoner</p>

               <p>laboured until midnight and 1 o'clock in the morning for the purpose of perfecting the code, I have heard it so said—I think it was the 29th June, 1870, that I gave him into custody for stealing the code—I was not there purposely—it was not my brother, but my clerk, Mr. E. J. Short, gave him into custody, by my instructions—I had consulted Mr. Thomas Beard about arresting him—I did not in the meantime go to the prisoner's lodgings with a detective without a warrant and get access to them—I have no recollection of twenty copies of the code being carried off from his lodgings; I did not know that twenty copies had been made—I have had five copies made since he was given into custody—I gave an order that if the prisoner delivered up the code they were not to press the charge, but if it were not given up he was to be kept in custody for stealing the code—five copies have been given up and ten more—the first telegram I had from Calcutta after I arrested the prisoner was on 30th June, 1876, the day after, and the day after he was at liberty—I did not go to his place then, nor he to mine—as to this document being a copy of that in the book, it may be a miraculous thing, but I should say it is a copy; not having seen the actual operation of copying, I cannot swear to it—it is not a fact that I expressed a desire in the presence of Mr. Von Kalin to break up the whole business of Rushton's; I should be very sorry to—I have two brothers in England and one in America—I have never expressed feelings antagonistic to them, I could not do such a thing—I never made any agreement at all with the prisoner that the amount of his claim upon us should be paid to the official assignee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> These codes are very much used in mercantile firms now—a cipher or letter will represent a word, and in that way we save expense—the telegraph companies recognise it to the extent of ten letters to the word—this code consisted of copies from many houses, improved upon as time went on, not an original idea—I paid part for the materials and am liable for the balance—the prisoner is not liable for a farthing—he left our employ on the morning of 27th June—when my brother and I arrived at the office, after staying there a few minutes, the prisoner walked in and said, with his back to me and facing my brother "Oh, I see you are not going to carry on that second agreement, I am discharged, and am off," and he put on his hat and walked out, and I never saw him again until I had him arrested—that was the first mention he had made of the second agreement, and I looked up in astonishment—after he had gone I found some of these telegraphic things had gone also—I wanted to have him arrested at once, but my brother said "No, don't do so, you may find them at the printer's"—I ascertained the fact at the printer's that they were gone—I never gave him. authority to take them—I consulted a solicitor and acted under his advice—our names are printed at the top of every page of the code—the prisoner never made the slightest claim to them—I learnt from the officer who took him into custody that he had given them up and had been released—I after<lb></lb>wards heard that he had only given up a very small portion; some are missing now; the police have them, but we cannot trace one or two; they got the others since this prosecution—the prisoner said nothing more when he put on his hat and walked out of the office.</p>

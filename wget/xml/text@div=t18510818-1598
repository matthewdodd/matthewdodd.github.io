                  <hi rend="italic">sub<lb></lb>mitted that, as the prisoner's wife, her evidence was not receivable. He admitted that if it was clearly established that she was the sister of the prisoner's first wife, that would invalidate her marriage, and so admit her testimony; but he contended that that was not shown to be the case; her mere statement that she called her "sister" was not enough; nor would the reputation of relationship apply in a criminal case: the best evidence was that of the parents, in the absence of which he contended the evidence should be excluded.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>

Then came the question, was she competent to prove that she was sister to the former wife? In his opinion, although seven years younger, she was competent to prove that relationship: there was no rule of law requiring that it should be established by that which would be demonstration, namely, by the testimony of persons present at the birth. The witness was then sworn, and examined as follows:</hi>—The prisoner Muzzall left me in May last—he stayed away from me a week—at the end of the week he returned—in consequence of what passed between us, I then went into the service of Mr. Thomas Var<lb></lb>den—I am in his service now—whilst I was living with Muzzall, he was in the service of a person of the name of Sharland, an attorney, at Gravesend; he was also in the employ of the postmaster at Gravesend—in Sept. last, Muzzall brought two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes to me, and asked me to change them—I asked why he did not change them himself—he said he had his reasons for it—I said I would not change them—about a week after, he again asked me to go to London and change them—I asked why he did not do it himself—he said they were <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Young's, and he did not like to—I told him there was something wrong, or else <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Young would have changed them himself—he asked me if I would change them if he told me where he got them from—I said, "Yes"—he said, "You don't mean it"—I said, "Yes, I do"—he then said that <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Young had taken them out of a letter that was posted at Bitterne, near Southampton, and that it was directed to the Gravesend post-office till called for—I asked him what there was in the letter—he said, two tens and a five—I told him I would not change them, and told him to take them to <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Young, and tell him to send them back to the person they belonged to—he said he should not be such a fool as that—I afterwards saw the notes in his waistcoat pocket in the bedroom; that was about a week before the post<lb></lb>master's house was searched—he was then at the office—they were two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes—I looked at them—they were dated June, 1850—I think Muz<lb></lb>zall came home about 7 o'clock that night; I do not know—it was in the evening—he came home to dinner—I told him what I had seen, and where; and when he came home at night he told me to put them away—that was the night that the postmaster's house was searched; he told me to put them away, as they might come and search his—I asked what I was to do with them; if I was to burn them—he said no, he wanted <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Young to have them, and he told me to take them to <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Young in London—next morning I went to London, and took the two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes with me—I took them to a house at Shepherd's-bush—I found Young there, and gave him the notes—he said, "All right"—I then returned to Gravesend—I have since been to the house at Shepherd's-bush with Peak—I pointed out the house to him—it was in Cambridge-terrace—I cannot recollect the number—a short time after I had taken the notes to Young, I saw Muzzall with two sheets of postage-stamps—I asked him where he got them—he said <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Young had changed the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note, and brought him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-worth of stamps, and kept the remaining 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. himself.</p>

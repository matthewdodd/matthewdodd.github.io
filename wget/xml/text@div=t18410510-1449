                  </hi>. I am a steel-worker, and live in Seven-dials. On the 30th of April I was in Holborn, between twelve and one o'clock at night—I met the prisoner—I was not sober—she wished me to go to a house with her—I declined—she then begged of me to give her a penny—while I was giving her the penny she rushed her hand into my left-hand trowsers-pocket—I had 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. there—I felt her hand in my pocket—she drew her hand out of my pocket, and started off with all my money—I turned, saw a policeman, and said, "Did you see a woman pass?"—he said, "Yes, that is her"—he took the prisoner—three shillings were found in her mouth—I believe she swallowed the rest—I had eight sixpences and six shillings in my pocket.</p>

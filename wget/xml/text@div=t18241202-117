On Monday afternoon, the 29th of November, I went out at a little before four o'clock, leaving my servant Collins in the house; my place was then safe. I returned just at six o'clock; the servant, and several of the neighbours, were at the door. I went up to the first floor, and missed from the sideboard, two silver tureen ladles, and two silver table spoons of mine; also three silver forks, and a gold watch of Mr. Hanson's; all of which was safe there when I went out - the watch had formerly been mine - I gave 25 l. for it, and sold it to Mr. Hanson. I employed the prisoner about a month before that to do some needle-work in the house, for nearly a fortnight - she had left nearly three weeks.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutrix She went out about four o'clock. I was at home, and in the kitchen, most of the time. I did not let her out - but exactly at twenty minutes before five, I was up in the drawing-room, and looked at the watch to see the time. The property was all safe then. I went up again at half-past five, to lay the cloth, and it was gone. A tradesman's wife had called about four o'clock, after mistress had gone out, and I latched the door after her, but did not lock it: she waited till mistress came home. I was alarmed on missing the property - went and found the street door half open. I am sure I shut it after letting the tradesman's wife in - it could be opened outside with a latch key.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS, Q. How long before that had your mistress gone out? A. At about a quarter to four o'clock - I did not see the prisoner that night.</p>

I thought she wanted to pawn something, and shewed her the passage door; she said, she did not want to pawn any thing, but that about five years ago she had sold us some spoons, and wanted to sell something more - she produced three silver forks. I questioned her about them; she gave her name as Harriet Green, living at a coffee-shop, No. 4, Oxford-street. I asked if she brought them on her own account; she said, No; for Mrs. Robinson, No. 16, Great Russell-street. I went there, and could find no such person, and then sent for a constable, who took her, with the forks, after I had marked them.</p>

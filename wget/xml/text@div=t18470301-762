Didot and others, foreign booksellers in Paris—I have a book here which was published by them—on Saturday, the 13th of Feb., I received ten copies from the binders—they were placed near the shop door—on Monday, the 22nd, the police-constables came and showed me this book—I had not at that time sold any of the copies I had had bound in this way—that is one of those ten copies.</p>

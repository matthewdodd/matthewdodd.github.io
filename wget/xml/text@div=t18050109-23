               <p>Q. Do you sell bacon? - A. Yes; on Saturday, the 22d, I left the shop about twelve at night; I locked it up, and on Sunday morning I was alarmed by the watchman, between four and five o'clock, and when I came to the shop I found it was open; I examined it; there were two sides of bacon gone, three parts of another side, and several pieces; I stopped in the shop till eight o'clock in the morning, and then I locked the shop up; I heard no more of it till the Wednesday, when my brother was going past the prisoner's shop; he keeps a sheep's head shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the prisoner's shop? - A. Not till after my brother and Mr. Pike went.</p>

             sworn. - I am brother to the last witness; I was coming up Well-street, by the prisoner's shop, on Wednesday, the 26th of December, and I saw the bacon in his shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from your sister's shop? - A. A very little distance; I saw three pieces lying on his counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Lying on the counter so as any body might see it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was your sister's? - A. I was not certain it was my sister's, but coming by, it struck me that it was; my sister gave me twopence; I went to the prisoner's shop, and bought a quarter of a pound of it, and when I came home my sister dressed it, and it had very much the same flavour as my sister's; I eat some of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell your sister's bacon from any other person's by the taste? - A. I think I can.</p>
               <p>Q. Hardly enough to tell your sister's bacon from any other? - A. Mr. Pike and I went down to the prisoner's shop; I stopped out while Mr. Pike went in.</p>

             sent to me to go down and look at this bacon; I asked him how much he had got of it, and where he got it; he said, it was a very unfair question; I told him that a neighbour of mine, that rented a shop of me, had her shop broke open on Sunday morning; then I asked him what he gave for it; he said he gave two shillings a stone for it; I said, you have bought it cheap enough; I said he could get money by it; he said he could tell me where he bought it, and if I would send the young woman down he would tell her; as soon as she went down, the bacon was gone; I saw three large pieces.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go and tell her? - A. Not directly;

             told me when she went it was gone; the wife told her he had taken it back to the person he had bought it of, and when we got the warrant, he and the bacon were gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. In point of fact did he not surrender himself? - A. Yes, he sent word afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. It is old rusty bacon? - A. No, it is bacon of two years old.</p>
               <p>Q. It is an inferior sort? - A. It is old bacon, the salt eats away the rhind.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What might it be worth? - A. You can buy it at one place at 3 s. a stone; you could not buy it at other places under 3 s. 6 d. a stone, at 8 lb. to the stone; that is the wholesale price.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you deal in bacon? - A. Not now, I have.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Prosecutrix.) Did you go to the shop of the prisoner after Mr. Pike had been there? - A. Yes; I told him I had come to see the bacon; he said he had sent it all away to the person he had bought it of; he told me I could not hurt him, he could tell me the person he bought it of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he? - A. No; I told him if he would not tell me, he must be made to tell; I left the shop.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You went directly from the shop; you did not give him time to tell you.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. He did not tell you, and when you came back the bacon was gone and the prisoner too? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. When Mr. Pike came to me to see the bacon, he saw it in the shop; while he was looking at it I said to him, here is some more of it; he saw it all; I then had a man who had bought two hocks, I told him; and I said, if you please, I will go, and fetch the two hocks from the people, if possible, perhaps there may be some marks on them; he said he did not think it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180501090026"></xptr>the bacon, it was too wet to be her's; I told him I could sell it all, a man had bid me 7 d. a pound for it, it was all open in the shop, and if I had known it had been stolen, I would not have put it there; the man came back that bid me the money, and I let the man have it that bid me the most money for it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

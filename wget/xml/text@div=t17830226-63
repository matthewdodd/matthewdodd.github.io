               <p>(Produces the things.) These are the things the last witness delivered to me at the Red Lyon at Chiswick, he told me I must go to Bow-street with him; on Saturday I saw the prisoner come out of the Red Lyon, with a bundle wrapped up in her apron, she tapped against the tap room window, and said, come along, come along; and two men followed her up the walk; in about ten minutes the landlord said, Mr. Marshall had been robbed, and I said, I saw the maid go up the walk with a bundle, I went up the town and pursued her, and overtook her, and she had a bundle.</p>
               <p>Were these the things that she had? - I cannot say, she gave the bundle out of her hand into her father's hand.</p>
               <p>Did not you stop that bundle? - I told them they must come back, the two men very readily came back along with me, and in turning the corner she snatched the bundle from under her father's arm, and chucked it over the garden; I sent a woman for it, and she brought it back to the Red Lyon, the woman is not here; the landlord brought in the bundle to the parlor.</p>
               <p>Court. We have no evidence about that bundle, but the stockings that you found on her are yours; - Yes.</p>

               <p>I gave the gentleman 18 d. for two pair of stockings.</p>
               <p>Court to Marshall. How long had this woman lived there? - I know nothing of her, but I think she had never done any such thing before.</p>

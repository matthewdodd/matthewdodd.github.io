About ten o'clock in the morning of the 24th of October, I went into a loft occasion<lb></lb>ally used by Hunt—I found two nose-bags, one nearly filled with oats, with a small portion of chaff covered over the top; the other had about one peck of oats in it—it was Hunt's duty to feed the horses on Sunday morning—for that purpose the shed-man delivered the oats to him on the Saturday night—the horses were generally fed between seven and eight on Sunday morning—there was no occasion to have oats to feed them the rest of the day—the horses had to go out on the Monday morning—it was Hunt's duty to obtain corn to feed them—he had the chaff in his own pos<lb></lb>session, but had the oats from one of our men—I went to the corn-bin when I saw this corn—I found it locked—Hunt generally stopped at the Thatched-house public-house at meal times, to water the horses, but the food we provided.</p>

I was with another officer near Seckford-street on Monday morning, the 25th of October—I saw Hunt come out of his master's yard, driving a cart with two horses—I noticed two nose-bags on each shaft—I followed him to the Lower-road, Islington—he stopped at the Thatched House public-house at ten minutes past eight o'clock in the morning—Rowland came out—he went up to him—they appeared in close conversation—while they were talking, I saw Rowland take a key from his pocket, and undo a door, and directly after Hunt took one of the nose-bags off the shafts and handed it to Rowland—then Hunt undid another bag, and took it in himself—I watched till the door was pulled to, I believe by Rowland—I then went in—they were standing close together, and Hunt was pouring the contents of a nose-bag into a bin—I went up to them—I am sure it was Hunt that was emptying the bag—I seized him by the arm, and told him I was a policeman, and had instructions from his master to watch him, as he was suspected of stealing corn—he said, "Pray don't; I never robbed him before "—I examined the bags, and found oats in one, and oats and chaff in the other.</p>

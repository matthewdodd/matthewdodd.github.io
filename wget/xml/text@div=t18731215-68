               <p>there just a week—the captain was David Murdoch—one of the prisoners was second mate, and the other was a seaman—there were four others on board besides—the captain did not send me away; he employed me—I recollect McKinnin rowing the captain ashore in November—Archie Gil<lb></lb>lespie was with him—when McKinnin came back Rogers sent me and a little boy named Andrew Blair, who ran away from the ship at Wilming<lb></lb>ton, into the captain's room to get some money—McKinnin did not hear that—the boy then went into the captain's cabin through a hole in a kind of shutter, and came out with two 20 dollar notes in his hand, which he gave to Rogers, who said "Go in and see if you can get any more"—Blair said that there were no more—I cannot read, but I heard McKinnin say that they were 20 dollar cotes, and Rogers took them to the forecastle to put them by—he showed the notes to the crew the same even<lb></lb>ing in the forecastle, and said that there would be a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> to-morrow with the captain—McKinnin had nothing to do with telling Blair to take the notes, but he went ashore and bought some provisions with the notes—he brought back some whisky, some cheese, and some soft bread, and we all had a share of it—Rogers gave Blair five dollars to help him on his road just before he deserted—when the captain came back he went to the fore<lb></lb>castle to see if he could find the notes, but he could not—he asked the pri<lb></lb>soners, and they said that they knew nothing about it—the captain had some of the drink, but none of the provisions.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Williams' Hotel, Bow Lane, City, and am the owner of the <hi rend="italic">Queen of Commerce</hi>—I was at Wilmington, in North Carolina, when she arrived there on 9th October, and on 12th October I gave the captain forty-five dollars—there were two 20 dollar notes, and a 5 dollar note—five days after the ship left Wilmington, and went down to the bar to fill up—Captain Murdoch was very ill; he had been ill all the way home.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The forty-five dollars were for him to pay the towage down to the bar—it is not common for the captain to make an advance to the men when the owner is present—the men asked me for an advance, and I refused to give it to them, as they had gone ashore, and had got bills at grocers', clothiers', and shoemakers' shops—I should deduct that from their wages—would you give your servants clothes after paying their wages?—if I gave them an advance they would have got drunk and deserted—I did not come home by the ship, and did not see the state the captain was in when he left; I went to catch the packet to come home.</p>

London in time to see the captain before he left the ship, I could have settled it better by dividing the sum between the crew—a good deal more than that was due to them at the time for wages—Rogers had about 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due to him, and McKinnin about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not desire to prosecute the prisoners, and the captain is on a sick bed and is not likely to be well for a year—I have no doubt that the prisoners will return him the money—Wilmington Bar is about thirty miles from Wilmington out at sea—we pull on shore to America in fifteen minutes—the men would pull two miles in fifteen minutes.</p>

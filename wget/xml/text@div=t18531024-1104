                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 169). On the morning of 23rd Oct., I was called to take the prisoner out of a house in Shadwell—the party belonging to the house called me—I found him sifting on a bed, and another man by the side of him—I asked him to come out several times, which he refused to do—I then got behind him, and he Walked out—I walked a way, and left him for ten minutes—I asked him to go away after he got outside—when I came back in ten minutes he was knocking at the door for admittance—I asked him again to go away—he went away in front of me to High-street, Whitechapel—it was not my beat to follow him—I walked behind him several yards—when he got to High-street, Whitechapel, be picked up a stone and threw it at me, and it struck me on the head—he then ran away, and I ran after him—I had not done anything besides follow him—I have not done duty since—the blow cut me—I went to Dr. Ross, and he attended to my head—the cut in my head with the stone was three quarters of an inch long—this is the stone—I picked it up after I took the prisoner into custody.</p>

I saw the prisoner running, and Pegler following him; I went and stopped him, but he made a fault and ran further off; he was rushing towards the wall, and Pegler after him—I never saw any staff drawn—after I got to the station 1 saw blood on Pegler; and blood on the back of the prisoner's head—I did not see anything to cause that, unless he struck it against the shutters.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dresser at the London Hospital; I am a medical student there. I examined Pegler's head; it was on Sunday morning, a quarter before 3 o'clock; I found a slight contused wound—I examined the prisoner, he had a wound at the back of the head; it might have occurred from a truncheon—it might have occurred from a fall—I should say a fall was the most likely of the two—my father is surgeon to the police; if the man had fallen it might have broken his head lower down; he might have fallen and caught the bolt; I do not think he could have done it if he ran against it with his face; it might have been done with a truncheon; if I had heard that a truncheon had been used, I should not have thought it impossi<lb></lb>ble to have such a blow as that—the wound on the head of the policeman might have been more than half an inch long—I told the policeman to keep the wound covered—I think I did not strap it so as to leave the edges of the wound exposed.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> One of the crowd said the boys had been throwing—I did not see then that White's head was cut, but I saw it afterwards, and there was a very large cut in his hat—the bystanders did not say that the stones had hit anybody—Holt said that the boys had pushed against them, and would not let them pass, that the boys were all abreast—I am quite sure that one of the boys said that they had four pots of beer—I said "How much have you had to drink?"—they said, "One pot of beer"—I asked them several times, and they admitted that they had had four pots of beer—Holt has been till recently in the police, and it appears that he bears a very good character—I believe it was his wife whom he was with.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practitioner of 209, King's Road, Chelsea—on 8th September I was called to John Finn, and found him dead—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination on the 10th and found on the left jaw a loose swelling which might have been the result of a blow—on the back of the head I found a large contusion penetrating the scalp, with effused blood beneath it—I found a quantity of blood effused within the</p>

               <p>membranes of the brain, and a part of tie brain structure was broken down, which was the cause of death—I do not think the same fall caused the swelling on the jaw and the damage to the back of the head—the immediate effect of such an injury to the brain would be insensibility and probably vomiting—the insensibility would probably, be instantaneous, followed by a partial restoration—he would not be able to understand a question at the moment, but probably sensibility would return after a short interval.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The puffy swelling on the jaw might possibly be of two or three days' standing, there were no appearances to guide me—I think his saying that no one struck him, and his giving his name and his correct address, is quite consistent with the nature of the injury.</p>

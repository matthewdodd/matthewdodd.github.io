                  </hi>. I am a jeweller, of 146, Great Portland-street—on Monday, 25th August, Brun came and asked to look at a gold English watch, not any Geneva watches, for he could get plenty of those in Paris—I told him I had not a gold English lever watch, but that I should have in a few days—he then left, saying he would call again—he came again on Wed<lb></lb>nesday, the 27th, with Torturat, and asked if I had got any English watches—I showed him a gold English lever, a hunter, which he liked very much indeed—he asked me the price of it—I told him—they talked together in French—I could not understand what they said—Brun asked me in English if it was a good watch to go—he could speak tolerably good English—Tor<lb></lb>torat could not speak a word of English—Brun said it was the custom in France to time the watches before they bought them, and would I keep it one day and time it; so I put it by my regulator at the shop door, which keeps good time—they went away—I kept it till the next day, Thurs<lb></lb>day, when they both came again—I then informed Brun that I had timed the watch—he asked to see some chains—I showed him four or five, and he selected the best, and wanted to know the price of it and the watch together—I told him the price, but he could not, or would not, understand it, and asked me to write it down—he made signs for me to do so—I wrote it down, the watch and chain meantime lying before me on the counter, just under my eyes—I found something come in my eyes, which hurt them very much, and I heard a scuffle—I could not see—they both rushed out, and closed the door after them—I called to my wife to mind the shop, and rushed after them, without stopping to see whether the watch and chain had been taken away—on the way I saw Brun throw the watch away—I picked it up—they were running as fast as they could—the watch was mine—it was the one Brun selected—I took him back to my shop—I overtook Torturat first, but I did not stop with him, because I guessed that Brun had the watch—I asked Brun when I brought him back if he threw the stuff in my eyes—he said, "Yes"—I asked him what he did it for—he said, "I was very hungry; I have had nothing to eat for three days; I must take something to get food"—I asked him if he had got the chain—he said, no, his companion had got it—Brun wrote this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) at the station—here is</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186209220032"></xptr>
               <p>another, which is part of one that he wrote in the shop, and subsequently tore up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ask him to write something down? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said, "Give me my liberty; I will give you the address of my father; I will give you the address of my friend, and he shall render you up the chain; "I said, "Very well, give me the address then"—the prisoner tore the paper up afterwards—this is only a piece of it—in consequence of what he said, I went to 40, Silver-street, Golden-square, and found Torturat there—I am perfectly satisfied that the prisoners are the two men who came to the shop on the day the snuff was thrown and the watch taken, and also on the two days before—I saw Brun three times, and Torturat twice.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, D</hi> 197). I took Brun on 27th August, about 4 o'clock—on the way to the station he stated to me that he threw the dust into Mr. White's eyes, and ran away; that he was hungry, and must have some way to procure food—I took Torturat about half-past 8 the same evening, at 40, Silver-street—Brun wrote this paper in the station and gave it to me, and I went to the address and found Torturat there—he said nothing to me—he could not understand English.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And you could not say anything to him that he understood? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I saw the tailor with whom he lodges, and I saw him here on Monday—he is a foreigner, and does not speak English—he has not said any<lb></lb>thing to me—I have never found the chain.</p>

The person who was there in the room can answer very well for my being there on the 27th. They told me the trial would come off on Monday, and now it is Wednesday.

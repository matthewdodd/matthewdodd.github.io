I am a laundress; the prisoner's mother worked for me, and he used to come for her at night; he came on Saturday, the 22d of December, about eight o'clock, and went away with her about ten o'clock. I missed the money on the Monday morning, from a drawer, in the room where he had been sitting all the time - other people were in and out. I saw it safe in the morning; a certificate of my marriage was taken with the property. I had no suspicion of him, but on New Year's-eve, I saw the caddy-spoon exposed for sale, in Beardwell's window, and had him taken up the next morning. We found him at work at Mr. Bird's, at Hammersmith - I have found nothing else.</p>

Between the 22d and 26th of December, (I think it was on Christmas-eve,) the prisoner sold me the caddy-spoon; I knew him before, he said he found it on Bird's dust hills, where I knew he was employed in sifting dust; he has lived in the neighbourhood all his life - he brought it in open day.</p>

            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner in Bird's-fields - I asked what he had done with Mrs. Wood's property, he said he did not know what he had done with it. Wood asked what he had done with her small box, he said he did not know, but afterwards said that on the Monday morning he fell over a wall and broke the box to pieces; and that Mrs. Wood's certificate was in his waistcoat or breeches pocket at home. He described the box as being a little French straw one.</p>
               <p>MRS. WOOD. It was a French straw box, the spoon is mine.</p>

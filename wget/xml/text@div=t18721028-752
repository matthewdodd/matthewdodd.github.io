                  </hi>. I live at 21, Poplar Place, Bayswater—I have been employed by the Metropolitan Railway to watch the defendants and others—on 21st October, I went with a man named Cremish to Notting Hill Gate Station, where I saw Floyd with another man, who is not in custody—he left the other man outside, came into the station, and spoke to Parmenter—I then saw him go to a tray, where the collected tickets were put, in front of Parmenter—he selected some tickets, and put them in his coat pocket—Parmenter was looking at him at the time—Floyd went out and called the other man, and they then passed Parmenter, whose duty it was to click the tickets—I saw him clicking the passengers' tickets as they passed by; but neither of those men showed their tickets to be clipped—they passed Parmenter without his doing it—Cremish and I followed them—they got into the train and so did we—we got out at South Kensington, and so did they—we followed them up the stairs—there is a ticket-collector there—Floyd spoke to him, and the man who was with Floyd passed out without showing any ticket—Floyd gave a ticket up to the collector—on</p>

               <p>the 23rd I went with Cremish, and Walker, and Urban to the Notting Hill Gate Station—I left them there at 10.30, and went to St. James's Park—about 11 o'clock I saw Floyd and the same man I had seen with him before come out of the station, followed by Urban, Cremish, and Walker—Urban stopped Floyd—he said he was a detective, and asked what ticket he had given to the collector—he said the one he had come up with—Urban asked him where he had come from, and he said "From Victoria"—Urban asked him if he had any more tickets on him—he said be thought he had one more, and he took a half-ticket from his pocket and gave it to Urban—Urban said "You can't go back with that, as it is cancelled"—he said "Oh, yes, I can; I am known down the line, and I can be passed through"—Urban left Floyd with Cremish, and went up to a man named Cooper—shortly after he came back, and took Floyd to Cooper—Cooper was given In charge, but he was subsequently discharged by the Magistrate—Cooper said, in Floyd's presence, "That is the man; I know him well; he is up and down here three or four times a day"—Urban said "Then you know the man?"—Cooper said "Yes, I know him perfectly well"—Floyd said that he had given the ticket to Cooper as he came through the barrier—Cooper said "Yes, he did give me a ticket"—he was then told he would be taken in charge for conspiring to defraud the Railway Company.</p>

Cooper was discharged—he was the person who would receive the cancelled tickets—any cancelled ticket would be refused by an honest collector—I was a gentleman's servant, and am now in the employment of the Metropolitan Railway Company—I was in Dr. Oldham's service—he became a bankrupt and I left—Mr. White employed me on the railway—I never acted as detective before, and this is my first trial—it is not the first time I have been a witness; I was at the police-court as a witness—I have been acting as detective about a fortnight—I saw Floyd go up to where Parmenter was standing—the booking clerk was inside—I don't believe he could see what was going on—I was reading a reward against the ticket-office: I was not thinking of a reward—I saw Floyd take a ticket from a little drawer at the top of the desk—he was face to face with Parmenter—there were one or two persons going down—I don't know whether there was any train in the station—Floyd was about 7 yards from me—I was just against where you get the tickets—there is a refreshment station there: I was not in there.</p>

I have not had much experience myself In traveling about the line—when you pass the barrier you show the ticket and have it cancelled—I never saw a person employed on the line pass a ticket-collector without giving up a ticket—I have known Floyd four or five years—I have never known a ticket-collector to cancel the wrong end of a ticket—it has never happened to me—I don't know that it is often done—a man coming from Victoria, westward, might alight at St. James's Park—I should say about twenty persons got out at St. James's Park that day, but I was not looking after the passengers at all—I heard Cooper say that Floyd was in the employment of the Company—Floyd made no reply, to my knowledge—I have never been in this Court before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an accountant, and live at 12, Regina Road, Tollington Park, Hornsey—in consequence of a communication from Mr. White, I went to Notting Hill Gate Station on 23rd October—I saw Floyd there—he went up to the booking-office, but did not pay any money or take a ticket—he went to a kind of pigeon-hole by the side of which Parmenter was standing—I saw him put his hand in and take out either one or two tickets; Parmenter gave him either one or two, I could not say the number—he put them in a little pocket at the side of his great coat—he went outside the station and spoke to some man, dressed like a gentleman—they came in, and went down the stairs together; the gentleman did not take any ticket—they went to the platform from which the trains depart for St. James's Park—I travelled by the same train, and alighted, at St. James's Park—on the top of the stairs I saw Floyd make a sort of motion to Cooper, as if he knew him—Cooper was at the barrier collecting tickets—I saw the other man pass the barrier, but I could not swear that he did not give up a ticket—I think it was a green-coloured ticket that Floyd gave Cooper; it looked like a single ticket—I spoke to Urban, and he tapped Floyd on the shoulder and detained him.</p>

There is a refreshment-bar at Notting Hill Station—I was standing outside the bar, having a glass of stont, when Floyd went up to the booking-office—the refreshment bar is about 12 feet from the booking-office—he went up to the booking-office, and made a movement with his hand outside—I should think the clerk would have noticed it—he did not take a ticket at the office; I will swear that—he went up to the place where Parmenter was and took some tickets out—I would not like to say the number; I am sure he took some—he was side<lb></lb>ways to me then; I could see every thing that was going on—I am certain he took a ticket—there is not a pigeon-hole at every station—I noticed that the one at St. James's Park is totally different to the one at Notting Hill—I saw Floyd give a ticket to Cooper; I could not say that it was the same that we took from Parmenter; I believe it was a green one—I was close to him, following him up—I believe that different classes have different colours.</p>

Who is this friend of yours? I don't believe he has a ticket either"—he said "I don't know"—I said "you must know him"—he said "I do not"—I found an old half return-ticket in his trousers pocket from the Mansion House to Notting Hill Gate—before that he said he had only got the one which he gave to me—I subsequently searched Parmenter—I found thirteen tickets, of different dates, in his inner coat pocket.</p>

I am chief travelling inspector in the service of the Metropolitan Railway—Floyd was originally in the service, but he was allowed to resign in April last—I have seen him and Parmenter together at the refreshment bar and at the public-houses in the neighbourhood—I have seen them spend money freely, in consequence of which I ordered them to be watched—the thirteen tickets found upon Parmenter had no right in his pocket—one of them was issued on the 7th October, and they range from that date up to the 23rd, the day he was taken into custody—some of them have been altered—this ticket was originally issued on 21st October, it has been again issued on the 22nd, and re-dated—we have seen the ticket collectors in the clerk's office sometimes—the duty of the collector is to partially sort the tickets, put them into a bag, and send them to the audit office, at High Street Station—he has no right to detain a ticket of any kind—there is no reason why he should put them in his pocket at all, the sorting tray is close by his side—no one has a right to pass a collector without showing his pass or ticket—the ticket which Floyd gave to Urban was issued on the morning of the 23rd, from West Brompton to Notting Hill Station—the other half was found at the proper station.</p>

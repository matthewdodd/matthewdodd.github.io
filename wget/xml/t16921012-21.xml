               Cutting, Clipping, Filing and Diminishing the Currant Coin of this Kingdom, &amp;c.
            </rs> The Witnesses for the King declared, That Charles Putnam was found in his House near the Castle-Tavern in Fleet-street, with a Melting-pot by the Fire full of Silver Clippings; and in another Room one pair of Stairs higher, was found Shears, Files and Melting-pots, and such other Necessaries for the Clipping Trade; and upon the Bed in the Room where Charles Putnam was, was found some Clippings and Clipt Mony, and Charles Putnam made his Escape down Stairs, but was stopt presently in Shoe-Lane. The other two Prisoners were wont often to resort to Charles Putnam's House, and were in the House when the said Putnam was taken. The said Charles Putnam's Man and Maid Servant were both examined, but they gave account that they never knew any thing of the matter, nor never saw them Clip, neither had Suspicion of any such thing, but the Maid said further, that she had seen Men go up and down Stairs often, but she did not know what they did there; There were some Shears found in Thomas Putnam's House in <placeName id="t16921012-21-crimeloc100">Canon Street</placeName>

So that it appeared the two Brothers were equally concerned in the High-Treason. All the Shears, Files and Rubbing-stones, were produced in Court, as a further Evidence against them, &amp;c. Charles Putnam endeavoured to extenuate the Fact, and said, He was surprized by reason the Person that first took him in the Chamber had an extravagant Hanging Sword on, and threatned him, insomuch that he thought he would have hang'd him presently, &amp;c. He called several Witnesses who declared, That he had behaved himself honestly and fairly heretofore, and that they had always received good Mony of him. The two latter called some Evidence likewise to their Reputation; who said, They never knew any hurt by them; particularly Mr. Moore had been a Clerk sometime ago in the Ballance-Office, where he behaved himself very justly: After this the Gentlemen of the Jury were distinctly directed to enquire, and because they did not find a sufficient Evidence against Mr. Moore, they <rs id="t16921012-21-verdict101" type="verdictDescription">

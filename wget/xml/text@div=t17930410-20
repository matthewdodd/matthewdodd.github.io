            ; I know the prisoner, the first of my knowledge of her was the 10th of February I met her in St. Martin's-court, enquiring the way to St. James's-street; she accosted me with a very plausible and pitiful story; she said, she had been decoyed away by a gentleman from the boarding school, who had pawned her watch, and she wanted to find him; I gave her what directions I could, and gave her directions to come to me the next morning, to tell me the event of finding the gentleman; she came and said, she had not found him, and had not one halfpenny in her pocket; in consequence of which I employed her from Monday to Thursday, when I was asked out on business, and left her at work; when I returned at eleven o'clock at night she was gone, I saw the cloak about her the next day, when she was apprehended, it was a sattin cloak with a hole in the lining of it; I lost my money at the same time; the sattin cloak was not worth much; I had seen the money that morning, it was put in a cupboard against the mantle piece in a box; I cannot say the first time I saw her, but the last time I made my declaration against her was the 11th of March, I saw her then at Bow street, she had not the cloak on then because Mr. Delafontaine had it in his possession.</p>

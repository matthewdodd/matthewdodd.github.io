On 5th June I went with Hitchcock and others to Mr. Cook's premises—I had a distress-warrant with me—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I received it from Mr. Binks—he could not perform it himself, and he employed me as his agent—I produced the warrant to Cook, and made a demand on him for the rent, 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., as stated in the warrant—he saw it, and I read it to him in the usual course—he said, "I am very sorry; you know me very well; you should have let me know, and I would have made it all right"—I said, "I have a duty to perform, Cook, which I am sorry so to do, but I will perform my duty as mildly as I possibly can"—this took place opposite the door of his dwelling-house—we then proceeded round to the back of the house—I told him he had better allow the duty to be done quietly—he said, "I don't blame you at all"—I then said, "My men are close handy, I will give notice to them"—Cook proceeded into the farm-yard; and on seeing the two men to place in execution, and Mr. Binks, and a person named Melton, who was taking a walk up that way, and came in likewise, Cook used a dread<lb></lb>ful oath, stooped down, took up a brickbat, or a portion of a brickbat, and violently threw it at Hitchcock—it struck him, and he fell—he threw two bricks—nothing had been done with respect to the pigs previous to this—he went to the pigsty immediately afterwards, removed the pigs, and sent them down the lane; and I drove them back again—I said to him, "You must not let these pigs out"—he said, "Oh they are not my pigs, they belong to a cow-keeper down here, therefore you will let them go"—I said, "No, I can allow nothing to go off the premises;" and I and Melton drove them back—Hitchcock was not with me then—he was taking care of the premises—I did not send him after the pigs—when I returned, I found Cook attacking</p>

                  </hi>. I am an upholsterer and auctioneer. I went after Graham, on 5th June, to Cook's—I gave him this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which I got from Mr. Fearce, Mrs. Lidgbird's solicitor—Graham went to the back of the house, Cook came out, and Graham demanded 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., due for rent—Cook said he did not owe it, and he should not pay it—Graham said he did—Cook said, "What authority have you to come here?" and he produced this warrant—Cook then said if every one did not leave the premises, he would make them; and he went and took up a bill-hook, and held it up in an attitude, and said if the whole did not leave the premises he would cleave every b—b—down—Graham said certainly we should not leave; and Hitch<lb></lb>cock wrested the bill-hook out of his hand—he repeatedly said, would we leave the premises, and we said, "Certainly not"—he then took up two brickbats, and one struck Hitchcock on the thigh, and knocked him down—as he was rising, he aimed another at his head, which missed him—he then flew to a hedge-stake, and took up a stick similar to this, put himself in an attitude, and said if we did not leave the premises what he would do; and he not only said it, but he put it into execution, for he struck both Hitchcock and Harris with the stick, and drove us all out into the lane—we had nothing to protect ourselves with, and were obliged to fly—he aimed a blow at my head—in the lane he used the same expressions, and held up the stick, and Hitchcock and Harris flew to a hedge, and picked up a stick each to protect themselves—Cook made a blow at Hitchcock, which fell short of him—he then made another, which Hitchcock parried; he then <hi rend="italic">slew</hi> himself round and struck Cook on the head—I saw the blood come, and then ran for the police—I had received the warrant from Mr. Pearce previous to going on the premises.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you have any instructions from Mrs. Lidgbird? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—what I did was in consequence of those instructions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How was it that Hitchcock struck Cook on the head? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He dropped the stick on his head—I did not think it would hurt him, but it did, and the blood came, not a great quantity—I was not in possession for the seven days, I merely went there to see Graham execute the warrant—I took no part in it—I appraised the goods.</p>

                  </hi>, <hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>. I took possession on Wednesday, 5th June—the sale was on 11th or 12th, at the right time, seven days—I did not get possession of all the goods on the same day—some I did not get till the 9th; but they were on the same premises, consequently it was a seizure of anything they contained.</p>

                  </hi>. A person who lives in one of Cook's tenements, who they call "Jack the brickmaker," came to me with a message from Cook—I saw Cook that evening, and told him that the pigs he had sent to me to own I could not own as they did not belong to me—I told him that Jack the brick<lb></lb>maker had come to me and said my pigs were down in the lane, and I was to go and take them away; that I said they did not belong to me, and that he said there was a seizure, and I was to take them; but I would not, as they did not belong to me—Cook made a laugh at it, and then said they belonged</p>

               <p>to a relation of his, named Gardiner; and Gardiner was with me at the time, and said they did not belong to him.</p>

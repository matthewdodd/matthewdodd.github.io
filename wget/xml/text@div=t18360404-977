                  </hi>. I live in Park-terrace, Brixton. The prisoner lived with me, as cook, for eight days previous to the 12th of Fe<lb></lb>bruary—we missed a shift the day after she came into the house—when she left, on the 12th, in the morning, we missed the other things stated in the indictment—it was last in a drawer, that was kept locked, in the bed-room—she had access to the bed-room, but the key of the drawer was in my wife's possession—the prisoner had keys in her possession which opened my drawers—these are all articles.</p>

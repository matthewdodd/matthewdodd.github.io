                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) ON 20th March, about half-past ten o'clock, I was called to Trusler's coffee-shop, Gray's-inn-road, and found the prisoner—she seemed ill—I asked her what was the matter—she said she was very poorly—I said, "You have been taking something"—she said, "No, I have not"—Mrs. Trusler said she had put something out of a phial</p>

               <p>into her coffee, drank some of it, and told the servant to take it away and was it—I took her to the hospital—in going along she threw a phial away—I picked it up—it was broken—it had this label upon it, "Laudanum, poison"—I have kept it ever since—I saw another constable take this other bottle from her hand—it has "Laudanum, poison" on it.</p>

                  </hi> I am in Mr. Trusler's service. The prisoner came in about nine o'clock, and asked for a cup of coffee—I served her—she paid for it—in about three-quarters of an hour she asked for a cup of tea—I took it—she emptied nearly a saucerful of coffee from the tray into a saucer—it smelled of laudanum—I threw it away—I told my mistress—she asked the prisoner if she had been taking anything, and a gentleman asked her—she several times said, "No" and then she said she had been taking ether—that does not smell like laudanum.</p>

                  </hi> I am nurse at the Royal Free Hospital. The prisoner was brought there on 20th March—she did not appear quite herself—an emetic was given her—it did not succeed—they applied a stomach-pump, and got laudanum from her stomach—I saw it—if it bad not been brought up, it would have killed her—she was allowed to sleep for twenty minutes, and then I roused her and made her walk—she told me where she came from, and she said she had done it, and she would do it, and would not die a natural death—I asked her, in the night, if she was not sorry, and where she thought she would go to—she said there could not be a worse hell than this present time on earth.</p>

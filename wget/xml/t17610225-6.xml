            . The prisoner is a neighbour's child of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. How old is he?</p>
               <p>Johnson. Not quite 15 years old. I keep several coaches to let out; there was a door left unlocked where my corn and things lie. I went up into that room on the 31st of January, and found the prisoner in the room, with some nails in his pocket; I looked about, and missed some bolts; I took him before justice Welch, and there he confessed he had taken things before, and sold them at a shop on Saffron-hill. I took out a search warrant, and went there, and found some goods, my property, which he had sold there. There were three shackles, two iron bolts, and some brass hinges to a coach door.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the woman's name where he sold them?</p>
               <p>Johnson. Her name is Darling. [The goods mentioned, produced in court and deposed to.]</p>

               <p>Charlton. At about eleven o'clock in the day, three weeks ago; he said he came honestly by them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She paid me, and asked me if I should bring any more; I said, I believed I should; she said, I should have a penny a pound for them, and her mother paid me for them.</p>

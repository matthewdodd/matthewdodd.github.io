               <p>Q. Did you lose any bank notes at any time - A. Yes, a two-pound bank note, and seventeen one's; they were laying on the table, in the tap-room; the landlord and landlady of the house gave them me; it was near eleven o'clock in the forenoon. The prisoner was in the tap-room in my company. I was serjeant in the 13th regiment. The prisoner's husband was a private in the same regiment. I met this woman accidently, and asked her to go and drink with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she known in the regiment - A. Yes, very well. I got change while she was drinking with me, for a twenty-pound note; they were told over to me by the landlord and landlady, both; I was counting them; the landlord said, are they right; I said, they were; the prisoner said, she would count them, and she took them out of my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. You let her take them, and count them - A. Yes. She said she would put them into my pocket; she walked away with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her go away with them - A. She must go away with them; they never were in my pocket; she came round to my left hand pocket, and pretended to put them into my pocket; she went away from me to go home; I did not go with her. She never put them into my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. You were drunk, were not you - A. I had been drinking that day. I never got my money again; this was on the 28th of April. On the 29th of April, about half after nine in the morning, she came to the door, and called me, and offered me two pounds fifteen shillings in silver, and seven pounds in notes; such as they are, the constable has got them.</p>

The prisoner said, let me count it, you cannot count it; she said, she would count it, and put it into his pocket; she came to his pocket, but I cannot say whether she put it in or not; she then walked away.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took the prisoner up; I had a warrant to take the prisoner up; when I took her up, she pulled out these notes, which I now produce, torn to pieces; five one-pound notes, and a two-pound note. She said, she would sell every thing, her ring, and her clothes, if Stanhope would not prosecute her; I did not suffer it. I searched the prisoner; I found in her pocket, two pounds fifteen shillings in silver, and about two shillings and eight-pence in halfpence.</p>

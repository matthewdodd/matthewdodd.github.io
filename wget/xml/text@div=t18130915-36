             caught hold of me by the throat; he hit me by the throat and nearly strangled me; whether it was his elbow or fist I am not able to say; he then caught hold of my watch seal; he took my seal and chain from my watch, and key; he broke the pendant off, and ran away I called stop thief, and ran after him. I ran about one hundred and fifty yards; Abrahams then came and hit me at the back of my neck, and another person struck me against the wall. I was then nearly in the act of taking Levy, with that I stopped. A young man came up, and said, do not pursue them, you will be murdered. I did not see the prisoners after until the Wednesday following; I then saw them at Lambeth-street office; Levy and Abrahams both. I knew both the prisoners before from children. Abrahams' father lived right opposite of me in Houndsditch when I was a baker, and the other I have known for thirteen or fourteen years. I have known Abrahams fifteen years and upwards.</p>

Last Friday fortnight, in the evening, a young man came and said Mr. Johnson had got an execution against me and my house, so that I could not go out of town; that very night I gave my son supper. Barnet Levy, my son, was at my house a quarter after seven; he staid with me until almost ten o'clock. It was last Friday fortnight.</p>

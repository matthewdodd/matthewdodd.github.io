I am a dealer, of 44, Hereford Street, Lisson Grove—on 1st July, about 10 o'clock, Fisher spoke to me outside the Wheat Sheaf public-house, where several of us were standing, and asked if any<lb></lb>body would buy a watch—he asked 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I asked him if I might take it into Mr. Walker's; he said "Yes;" and I did so—when I came out I gave it to Fisher again, and said that Mr. Walker said that I was to be careful what I bought out in the street—two or three miuutes after<lb></lb>wards the other two prisoners came up and said, "This is not the watch—I went back into Mr. Walker's shop and they all three came in, and Mr. Walker asked them if it was their watch, and what was the name on it? and said he should detain it, and with that they all went out—I cannot say whether that was the watch I gave back to Fisher.</p>

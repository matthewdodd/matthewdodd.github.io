               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. It was perfectly day-light? A. Yes; I saw no person near - I was not more than ten minutes gone for the constable; the child is now alive, and appears in very good health - it is a very fine child.</p>

            . I am a constable of Acton. On the 3d of June, a little before seven o'clock, Nelhams came to me in a very agitated state - I went with him, and found the child lying on its back in a deep ditch in the field; there is a footpath through the middle of the field, but it was full three hundred yards from that, quite out of the way of passengers - it would be a trespass to go there; the ditch was very much grown over with stinging-nettles and brambles - I could not get the child out without tearing a large hole in its cap; it was as black in the face as my hat- I thought it was a black child; its face and finger ends were quite black, but those appearances turned out to be the effect of violence - its mouth and eyes were covered with dirt; it had shed tears, which had softened the mould about its eyes - I think the dirt had been put about its eyes; I do not think it was from the grass - it did not appear dirt which had got on it by being put into the ditch. but as having been put there on purpose; the child was barely alive - its eyes protruded quite out from the sockets; I ran across the fields as fast as I could to my own house -I got a woman to put it in warm water; we tore the clothes off as fast as we could - it had an old white bed-gown and a common baby's blanket, which children usually wear: it was washed immediately, and as the woman laid it across her lap she screamed out - I looked down, and saw a piece of black ribbon round its neck, which I produce; it was tied round very tight, so much so that the flesh had swollen above it - I did not observe it till the child was laid back.</p>
               <p>Q. In your judgment, were the appearances the child exhibited in its face and finger ends the result of that being tied? A. It was; for the moment I cut it the child fetched its breath and resumed its natural colour very shortly - I have no doubt the colour was the cause of this being round its neck; I had to cut it in two or three places, it was so tight, and was twisted in the child's cap-string - it got better immediately, and in the course of two hours resumed its colour quite; it was twisted round twice, if not three times - I know I cut it a second time, if not a third, to get it off; I was very much agitated, and cannot say which - it is quite well now, and in Court; I should think it was about three weeks old - I took the prisoner in custody on this charge; I had known her by sight about a year ago - I saw her on the Saturday following, (the 6th,) in the neighbourhood of Hammersmith, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, in company with a young man; I stopped her and said, "I want you: I have been looking for you a good while; your name is

            . I am a surgeon, and live at Acton. I was called in about seven o'clock that evening - I went and found the child as the officer has described - it was perfectly black in the face, and at the ends of its fingers, which arose from the pressure of the ribbon round the neck; it had the appearance of a child nearly dying from strangulation; the ribbon had been removed before I got there - in my opinion, when the child was put into the ditch it was apparently dead, but having been there some time, and received a current of air, it had revived; strangulation had certainly commenced - its eyes had nearly started out of the sockets.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think if it had not been found it could have survived? A. I think it impossible the child could have survived long if it had not been relieved - sufficient air could not have been admitted into the lungs to carry on life - at what precise period death would have taken place it is impossible to say.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner on the 3d of June last, between one and two o'clock - she came up the Green-lane, Acton; I knew her before for two or three years, and have no doubt of her - she had got two children with her then, both in her arms; she went up the Green-lane, between Acton and Ealing; I saw her go into a large wheat field - I was about a hundred yards from her; she went down to the bottom of the wheat field, sat down on the ground, and in a few minutes she got up and pulled a black whittle which she had, round her shoulders, and which the little child was covered up in - she looked all round to see if she could see any body, and she saw me looking through the hedge.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know she saw you? A. Because she sat herself down directly, and I saw her eyes fixed towards me - she sat down as quick as possible, took the black whittle, and tore it over the child again as quick as she could; the little child was in her arms when she looked towards me, and the other sat on the bare ground - I immediately got over the gate, and went down to her, and said, "Halloo, Nance, what do you do here?" she said she was tired, and had sat down to rest; I said, "What, have you got another young one?" and she said "No, it is not mine;" I knew she had had two children before that one - she said, "Do you think if it were mine I should disown it; I said, "I don't know, I am sure, Nance;" she said it belonged to a young woman who was gone to Mr. Goddard's for work; I staid talking to her a little while longer, and asked if she was going down the lane; she said Yes, and asked me to carry the biggest child,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110071"></xptr>and lift it over the gate for her, out into the lane - as soon as she got out into the lane she sat herself down; I asked if she was not going any further, and she said No; I immediately went down the lane - she said she was to wait there for the woman, because the woman promised to meet her there: I left her; it was then between three and four o'clock - I have seen the child since, and knew it by its having the same dress on; it appeared in very good health then - it had an old white bed-gown on and an old white night-cap; it did not cry at all.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.How long were you in her company? A. I think about half an hour - I observed the child's features; I saw it again three or four hours after I left her - I have known her three or four years; she used to work at Mr. Young's, at East Acton, every summer - I have seen her husband; they are separated - I cannot say whether she was subject to fits.</p>
               <p>HANNAH DUNFORD. I live at the Red Lion, at Acton - I know the prisoner. I remember seeing her on the 3d of June, at the Red Lion, a little before five o'clock in the afternoon; she had two children with her, one about two years old - she was doing nothing there; she sat with the children in the tap room; I believe she had some beer, but I do not know that - I served her with a glass of peppermint, and she offered it to both the children; I did not see them take it - I never saw her before; I am certain of her person; I did not see her go away - she left a little after five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did she treat the children with apparent affection? A. She treated them very kind in my presence - I saw her for about ten minutes.</p>

I took her biggest child with one arm, and her bundle in the other - I was ordered to assist her to take care of her children; I carried it as far as the Swan public-house, at Bayswater, where we had a drop of porter - we walked on to Notting-hill, and she said she was not going any farther, for her brother was coming to meet her at nine or half-past nine o'clock, and I left her there at thirty-five minutes past eight; she said her brother was sure to be there at nine, or half-past, and I need not stop any longer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. If I left the baby there, I was not sensible of it, and did not mean to do it; I tied the ribbon round its neck because the neck was swollen, and the nurse knows it.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH TYLER. I am a nurse of the lying-in ward at St. George's workhouse. The child was born on the 13th of May - I had the care of it till the 2d of June, when it was discharged; I have seen it here to-day - it is the same child; it was baptized by the name of Elizabeth Chapman, and was called by that name afterwards, when it went away with the prisoner and Gay - it is a female; I held it while it was baptized.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The prisoner says there was something the matter with its neck? A. It was a very fat child, and that might arise from its not being well washed, which would chaff the neck.</p>
               <p>Q.In a case of that sort, it is necessary to put a binding? A. A little bit of wet rag, or powder - we never put a ribbon round a child's neck; I never heard of that as a process to make the milk stay on the stomach.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Would tying a piece of ribbon round its neck be of any use if the neck were bad? A. No. I never heard of that - a piece of wet rag to dab it with would, but not tied round the neck.</p>

            . I generally work as a gardener or labourer. I have known the prisoner since August - I was living with her; I believe she has had eight children: she conducted herself to her children with a kind and material affection during the time I lived with her.</p>

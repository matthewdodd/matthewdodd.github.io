Oxford-road; I took Hamilton, the officer, with me, and from there we brought away eight pair of shoes, which I alledged to be my property, stolen out of my shop; the officer brought the woman and the shoes before the Magistrate; they were marked by the officer, and delivered to my custody, because the prisoner had absconded, and I put them on a shelf; some of them have been sold by my wife, while I was out of the way.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Have you any partner? - A. I have none now.</p>

               <p>Q. Were these goods considered as the property of both of you? - A. No; they were my own; my brother had no concern in this shop; the shop we were partners in was in St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>Q. They were not marked till they were in possession of the constable? - A. Yes; they were marked before that, J. C.; I mark all my shoes so when I am in the way.</p>
               <p>Q. You sell them with that mark on them? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. These shoes may have been sold out of your shop, and come back again? - A. Shoes never come back in the same state.</p>
               <p>Q. How is it possible you can swear these shoes have not been sold by your wife, or somebody else, since January? - A. I know I lost these shoes out of my shop; there is a witness to come forward that can swear she bought them of the prisoner.</p>

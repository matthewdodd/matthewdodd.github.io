                  </hi> I am potman at the Navarino tavern, Dalston—on Saturday night, 6th July, about 11.30, the prosecutor and prisoner were standing at the bar drinking together—the prisoner said that he reckoned himself a Roman Catholic, and Callaghan said, "I am a Protestant"—the prisoner made some threat of an assault which I did not hear, and the master put him out, but he came in again, and called his friend Martin out, and Martin and himself and Callaghan all went out together up Navarino Grove—when they were about forty yards from the tavern I saw the prosecutor and Coleman <hi rend="italic">sparring</hi> I ran up directly, knowing that the prisoner had got a dagger-knife on him, as I had heard he had produced it at the bar—Callaghan had just tumbled on the floor, and the prisoner had got the knife, just going to strike him again—I did not see him strike him first—I knocked him down, that he should not use it a second time—he got up, ran round the field, and went in doors to No. 7, he and Martin together—I helped Callaghan up—he said that he felt very faint, the sergeant came up with a light, and said, "Take him to the hospital."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I saw the prosecutor lying on the pavement in Graham Road, Dalston, and Whiteman an sitting by his side, I turned my light on and saw that the front of his shirt was saturated with blood; I found he had a wound on his shoulder, I called two doctors, and sent him to the hospital—between two and three in the morning of the 7th I went to the prisoner's house, 7, Navarino Grove, and found him in bed; I awoke him, and told him he was charged with stabbing a man named Callaghan outside his house last night—he said, "What I done I done to defend myself"—I showed him the knife, and said, "Is this your knife? "—he said, "Yes, it is"—it had been handed to me by 341 N; I had it in my hand at the station, and he said, "I took out that knife to defend myself; several men attacked me; and I would do it again."</p>

                  </hi> I am a surgeon, of 123, Graham Road—on 7th July I was called to see the prosecutor, and found him perfectly insen<lb></lb>sible, partly from loss of blood, and partly from inebriation; on opening his waistcoat and two shirts, which were saturated with blood, I found a stabbed wound on the top of his shoulder half or three-quarters of an inch broad, and an inch and a half or two inches deep; it had then ceased bleeding—this knife would produce it—it was dangerous, from the loss of blood, and an artery was cut, which had to be tied—I saw the knife, there was blood on it then.</p>

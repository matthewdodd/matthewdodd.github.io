I lost a pair of shoes and silver shoe-buckles, on the 7th of November. I went out in my boots and left my shoes and buckles in the coachhouse. Towards the evening I went to look for them, and missed them. I used to employ the prisoner occasionally to help me; he not coming that evening, I had a suspicion of him. I went to look for him two days, but could not find him. On the next Tuesday I got a constable and took him, and had him to the round-house. He confessed he had taken my shoes and buckles, and said he had lost one of the buckles, and sold the other.</p>
               <p>Did you make him any promise to induce him to make that confession? - I said I would not hurt him. He had my shoes on his feet when I took him.</p>
               <p>Could you have known those shoes if you had seen them any where else? - There is no particular mark; I know them by the shape of my foot and my own judgement.</p>
               <p>Have you ev er found the buckles? - No.</p>
               <p>Are you sure these were your shoes? - Yes.</p>

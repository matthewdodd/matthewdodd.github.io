                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Lee, and reside at Leyton—on Thursday night, 18th August, about 10.50, I saw the house fastened——the front window was quite secure—I came down between 7 and 8 o'clock in the morning and found the place in confusion, and missed a musical box, a pocket book, a pipe, and two dresses, some money, and a number of other articles, valued at about 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are some of the things—they were safe when I went to bed—an entrance had been gained by the front parlour window.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman A R</hi> 201). I received information of a burglary at Mr. Lee's house, and I went to the Sultan's Head public-house, Upper Clapton, about 10 o'clock at night, on 19th August—I saw the prisoner there—he had this musical box on his knees, and was playing a tune called "Not for Joe"—I took him into custody—he resisted very violently, and called on the people to throw open the doors and rescue him</p>

               <p>—he tore my trowsers—I had a constable with me—we handcuffed the prisoner, and took him to the station—he said the musical box had been given him by another personal found a pawn ticket in his pocket, referring to this dress, pawned at Stoke Newington—on the way to the Court the next morning, he said "I was led into this by two others. I did not enter the house, but I stood at the window and received the property, and con<lb></lb>veyed it away."</p>

I live at Bickeridge Road, Leyton—I call Mr. Lee up every morning—on 19th August, I went there about 6 o'clock, and saw the prisoner tying up a bundle inside the forecourt of the house, just at the gate—I saw the parlour window open, and I said "Is Mr. Lee up?"—he said "Oh yes, they are all up, Mr. Lee will be down in a minute"—I wished him good morning, and went on—it was perfectly light then.</p>

I am a draper and hosier, in Hare-street, Woolwich—on Saturday night, 24th December, I observed the prisoner about my premises in the early part of the evening—later I was down the street, and saw him go into my shop, cut a string which held up some stockings, and two pairs fell on the ground—he picked them up, and was about to conceal them under his coat; he observed some one watching him, and placed them behind the place he had cut them from—I distinctly saw him take the knife from his pocket and cut them—I walked to the door, and said he must consider himself my prisoner—the witness Waller was coming down the street at the time—a constable came up and took the prisoner to the station.</p>

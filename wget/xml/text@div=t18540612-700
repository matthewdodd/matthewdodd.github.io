                  </hi>. I have a farm at Iver, where I live, and another at Ruislip, in Middlesex. I had on that farm about 200 ewes—I cannot say to a few, but about that number—the prisoner was my shepherd there to look after them—the ewes were lambing from Lady Day till the latter end of May—I received information, and went to Mr. Lawrence, at Ruislip—I there saw some lambs which appeared to be miner—there was one dead and one alive—they were the same sort as mine—we took the lamb, and put it down, and asked the prisoner if he knew anything about it—at first he hesitated, and then he said he thought he did—Goff then asked him if he had sold any lambs to any one else—he said, yes, he had sold some to Mr. Humphries' son—we went to Mr. Humphries, and found five lambs of the same breed—we took them away, and they were shown to the prisoner—he did not say anything about them—about two months before, he had sold six sheep skins, and I told him never to sell anything of mine, but if anything happened I would sell them myself—he knew that I was at that time riding about the country to get lambs, and offering half a crown a piece for them, to put to those ewes who were in full milk.</p>

I know the prisoner—I bought some lambs of him—the first that I am certain I bought of him was about six weeks ago—I believe I bought some others, shortly before that, of him—I bought five altogether which were alive, and were given to Mr. Goddard, and two that died—I gave 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a piece for them—the prisoner said he had a right to sell them, because the ewes had died—he said he was Mr. Goddard's shepherd.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you sleep at home on the 4th of December last. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you before you had gone to bed seen your poultry house. - A. I had; I secured it just after dark, about five o'clock; I fastened it with a nail, top and bottom.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that the fowls were all in it. - A. Yes; at four o'clock, when I fed them, there were just four dozen and six, they were all in the coop; I do not breed any fowls, I only fatten them; I was disturbed about half past three in the morning by the fowls, I was rather suspicious, I got up, I had a rush light in my room; I lighted a candle and saw what o'clock it was, it was half past three; I went down stairs into the kitchen at the back of my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe how the poultry house is situated with respect to the dwelling house. - A. The poultry house is attached to the house, so far as it is a bit of a shed built against the house; the beams of it run against the walls of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that in an enclosed yard. - A. Yes; the house is enclosed all round, with paling, and one side a ditch. When I got down stairs I heard the noise more and more in the poultry shed; I went to the shed, I found the door of the shed was wide open; I had a candle in my hand, I observed Mr. Baker come out of the shed, he advanced rapidly with his face towards me; there is the person [pointing to the prisoner]; he knew me and I knew him very well, the prisoner is the person, he is the man, the very man; he had a sack on his shoulder, the sack had some loading in it; he kept it on his shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe how he was dressed. - A. He had a coloured handkerchief and a dark waistcoat on; he came out of the shed, and gave me a blow on the side of my face, and said, God d - n your eyes, what do you want; the blow knocked me down, the blood ran out of my nose; I halloaed murder, Baker ran away, I could see no more of him; I was a good deal hurt. Several of the neighbours came to my assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you see Betts the constable. - A. In about a quarter of an hour I saw him, I sent for him; I sent Mr. Betts to go after the prisoner when I found out who it was; I went with him as far as the prisoner's house, he lives about a quarter of a mile from my house. They brought the prisoner to me about half after five, he was in the custody of Betts; I said that is the man that knocked me down and robbed me of the fowls; his waistcoat and his handkerchief were the same; the coat I cannot say, because he had a sack over it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing to you there. - A. He said I was a very false man, it was not him.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after the prisoner Baker knocked you down and absconded, did you examine the poultry house. - A. About two minutes after Baker had ran away. I had put a cloth of one side to keep them warm, that was removed, and the door was wide open.</p>
               <p>Q. What had become of the fowls. - A. That I cannot say; there were ten missing, I have never found any of them since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. There is no internal communication from your house into the shed. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you fasten it. - A.About five; my servant went in the shed in the course of the afternoon to feed them; she is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went down stairs you went with a candle. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you found the door wide open. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And a man whom you say was the prisoner came running upon you. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He came running rapidly upon you, as fast as he could, therefore you could not see him only momentarily. - A. So I could; and when he was brought back he had a coloured handkerchief, and a dark waistcoat on.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner told you you was a false man for charging of him. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no moon that night. - A. It was a dark night. I had a candle in my hand.</p>

            . Q. You are a constable at Feltham - A. Yes. On the 5th of December last Mr. Pottier sent for me to apprehend Baker. I went to Mr. Pottier's house about four in the morning. I and Pottier went to the prisoner's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find Baker. - A. No, not directly; there was a light in a room, which I took to be a bed room; we waited near three quarters of an hour, and then we saw Baker get up from his bed side, we were about twenty yards off; he was swinging his clothes over his head, and then he came down stairs and went into his stable to his horse; we did not go in directly; he made a little fire and called his people up; then I went and rapped at the door, he opened it; I went in and catched fast hold of him and said he was my prisoner; he seemed very much surprised what it was for; I told him it was for robbing Pottier of his fowls and knocking him down; he said, I knock him down! he is a very false man for so saying, he wished he had the knocking of his bl - y French head off for laying such lies to him; he said he never robbed him nor knocked him down, nor never went into his house at all. We took him to Mr. Pottier's, and then to the Red Lion.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Pottier, when he first saw Baker when he was first brought back to the house, did he say he was the same man that robbed him. - A.He said he was the same man and no other.</p>

            . Q. Where was you on the morning of the 5th of December. - A. A little after six o'clock I was going to my labour; I found a chicken coop in Smitcham-lane, about threescore yards from Mr. Pottier's house; I also found a gander in a bag close to it, in a gateway; a prong was put in the mouth of the bag to keep the gander in; the prong was marked J.

               <p>Q. On the night before he was at home all the evening. - A. Yes, he never went out from five o'clock till my mother came home from London; she returned between eleven and twelve o'clock; then he went out and unloaded the cart, and came in.

               <p>Q. During the time from one o'clock, to the time which you and the servant went to bed, had the prisoner got up. - A. No, he could not, for the stairs that we had cleaned after they went to bed, came down into the room that we were cleaning.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore he could not have got up and come down without your knowledge. - A. He could not.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember on the night before he was taken up coming home. - A. I do, I had been to town with poultry; I came home about eleven o'clock, I went to bed; after the horse had been done up, it was near upon one o'clock, when I went to bed; Baker went up to bed before me, and I followed him up stairs; I sleep in the same bed with him. He never went out of the bed till near five o'clock, I looked at the watch, I called him up myself; we were to go to Kingston market. I swear solemnly, and declare to God, it is the truth, that he never went out of his bed and never went out of the house till near five o'clock.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

I was coming up York-street, and saw the prisoner, whom I knew perfectly well, and two or three more men—I saw there was a copper, and I heard Cole lay, "Where are you going to take that copper? I dare say you stole it from tonw poor man, take it back"—I went up, and the prisoner said two men gave it him—I asked him where he was going to take it, and he said "Home"—I took him to the station, on suspicion of stealing it—I found on him I candle which had been lighted—I saw there was an empty house in Fancy-street, and could trace, by the footmarks in the snow, that some one had been to the back door of the house—I found the back door open—a copper had been taken away, and all the brick-work lately pulled down—I fitted this copper to the place, and I believe it is the one that came from there—I took the prisoner's shoes, which were worn very much down at the heel—I tried them with the marks in the snow, and believe they correspond—I put the shoes in the marks, but before I put them down I examined them particularly—there had been liquor in the copper and it was turned out on the snow.</p>

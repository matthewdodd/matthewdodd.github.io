On the 2d of October, about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to the shop and put down this tool in a handkerchief; I was busy and put it aside for him to wait; and before I could attend to him, Jones came in and described it; I produced it, and he claimed it in the prisoner's hearing.</p>

On the last Saturday in September the pri<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260019"></xptr>soner came to my place about eight or nine o'clock at night, to ask me to lend him a few shillings - I saw him at eleven o'clock when I came home, he was waiting for me - he supped, with me, and after supper finding it was after twelve o'clock - the house I lodge in is a baker's - and shuts up at twelve on Saturday, after that, nobody came in or out without asking the landlord for the key - I said if he liked he might sit by the fire in a chair for the night - he did so - I am married, and have three children - he sat in the room we slept in - I have but one room he was there at seven o'clock when I awoke - my wife is not here - he is my second cousin.</p>
               <p> - SLANEY. I am a shoe-maker, and live in White Cross-street. I made all the prisoner's shoes - I never made boots for him - he had a pair of shoes repaired at my house on this Sunday - they were delivered to him on the Sunday morning - I had had them about three days - I soled and heeled them - those produced are certainly the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say these shoes have only been worn a day after they were soled and heeled? A. They have been worn in the mud.</p>

I had seen the other Prisoner Strafford once in his Company at my House, and therefore suspected that she might be concerned with him; at last I thought if I could meet with her I might by that means hear of him: So next Morning, understanding that some Lawyet in an Alley in Chancery-Lane was acquainted with her, I went to a Chandler's Shop there, and made Enquiry; but all I could learn was, That she sometimes drank a Dram there: I advertised my Goods, and next Day Word was sent me that she was taken with most of the Plate upon her.</p>

I privately advised 'em to send for 2 Constable and Charge her, because I thought she did not come honestly by it; but they would not, and so she went away with it. Mr. Bains, and the Prosecutor's Landlord, told me next Day that such Plate was Advertised. Upon which we went to enquire for her at a Silk-Dyers in Spittle-Fields, Mr. Barns having heard that she had lived there; but when we came thither, we were told that she had been gone from thence above 4 Months We went away thro' some Back-Alleys into Shoreditch, where we accidentally met her with a Piece of Linnen under her Arm. I stopp'd her, and said, Madam, I am glad to see ye! She asked what Business we had with her. We told her she should soon be satisfy'd, and so we took her to the Swan Tavern in Shoreditch; Mr. Earns and the other Man went for a Constable, and charged him with her on Suspicion of being concerned in stealing the Plate. She directed us to Pet. Hughs's Lodging, which was at the Crooked-Billet, hard-by. The Constable went and fetched him, and as soon as she saw him she curs'd and damn'd him for a Son-of-a-Bitch for bringing her into such a Premunire. Peter took 4 or 5 Tea-Spoons out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173412040005"></xptr> of his Pocket, and gave them to the Constable. We went again to Peter's Lodging to see what we could find. Strafford pulled out the Drawer of a Trunk, from whence she took this Silver Tankard, 2 Porringers and a Punch-Ladle, and deliver'd them to the Constable: Then we all took Coach to the Prosecutor's House, where Peter owned that he had taken that Plate out of his Master's House.</p>

I, and two more, went thither; where we were told, she had been gone a pretty while from that Place; but in going back, we met with her by Chance in Shoreditch, and carry'd her to a Tavern, where we examin'd her about the Plate. She said she had it out of the Country, and defy'd the World to touch her Honour. Look ye, says I, It signifies nothing to deny it, for that very Plate which you offered to pawn to Mrs. Slater is advertised - It is By-God? Says she, Then that Rogue Hughs has brought me into a fine Scrape.

He came to me next Day and brought a Silver Spoon which he desir'd me to sell for him; telling me, that Newnham having given him leave to take a Shirt out of the Box, he found Means to take the Spoon unperceived. So we sold the Spoon for 11s. and hearing that the Prosecutor wanted a Servant, he went to him and was hired, and I went thither afterwards to give him a Character, because I knew his Friends in the Country.

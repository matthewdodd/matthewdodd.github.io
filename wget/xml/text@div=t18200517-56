               <p>"the gardener will." The price of the colt was 15 l., the prisoner immediately pulled a 10 l. and a 5 l. Bank note out of his pocket, I asked him to put his name on them, he said he was no scholar. I told him to come round to the garden-shed and I would mark them.

            , Holloway," which I wrote on both the notes, and the date - (looks at two) - these are them. He said he bought it for his brother, who lived at Hampstead. While I was writing his name on the notes I said there were many bad notes about; he said,</p>
               <p>"Is there? I have all my notes from the Bank." He took away the colt, and I took the money. He said he paid away a deal of money both in town and country, and that he was well known at Holloway. I put the notes into my pocket, went into the stable, and kept them nearly two months; I then gave them to Mrs. Clark - I kept them till she came to town.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you gave them to her did you learn anything respecting them - A. A few days after I heard they were bad; I then made diligent enquiry for the prisoner, but could get no intelligence of him. I enquired at Hampstead, but did not find that his brother lived there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he, in conversation with you, say he had agreed with any one in town about the colt - A. I asked him if he had agreed with anybody? he said he had agreed with a tall young man in Shoreditch. Mrs. Clark's son is grown up, but is not very tall.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. The prisoner was a stranger - A. Yes. I first saw him in the farmyard; he had spoken to Skinner about the colt before he spoke to me. He gave the notes into my hand, and I immediately wrote on them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not your question,</p>
               <p>"What name shall I put on the notes" - A. Yes. I am sure I put down the address he gave me. I enquired at Hampstead for a person named Mills. I asked at one public-house, and enquired of several people passing by. I had no other 5 l. or 10 l. note in my possession.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long was the prisoner with you - A. Between five and ten minutes. I saw him again when he was in custody. We had very little conversation. He told me he had sold Mr. Clark a horse about two years ago. I am quite sure he is the person. I think he had a blue coat on.</p>

               <p>Q. When he came the first day what did he say - A. He came into the yard, and said</p>
               <p>"You have got a colt to sell?" I said Yes. He asked to see it; I said it was out in the field just by. I went with him, he liked the colt very well, said it was a pretty colt, and asked the price? I told him 15 l.; he said he could not give that money, but would give 13 l. I said I would not sell it for less, as that was the price, and told him he must go to town to Mr. Clark, and see if he would take less. As he was going out of the yard he said to me,</p>
               <p>"I will give you 10 s. more." I said I could not take less. He came next day about twelve o'clock, he had a porter with him; he said,</p>
               <p>"I am come for the colt." I said,</p>
               <p>"You have bought it, have you?" he said Yes. I said</p>
               <p>"What did you give?" he said 15 l. I said,</p>
               <p>"Did you see Mr. Clark?" he said, Yes. I said the colt was out in the field. He asked me for a halter, and said my master told him I had halters to put on the colt - I said I would fetch one. He then said,</p>
               <p>"Shall I and the man go and fetch the colt out of the field into the yard?" I said Yes, and they did so. He asked who was to take the money? I said the gardener, and fetched him - I did not see him pay him. I put the halter and bridle on the colt while he went to pay the money, and delivered it to his man, they then went away - the prisoner followed behind with a whip.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long was it before you saw him again - A. Last Wednesday.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you a good deal of conversation with him - A. Yes. I have no doubt at all of his being the man - I know him as well as I know my own brother. He had a blue coat and blue apron on.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to the Crown and Sceptre, public-house, in Golden-lane, on the 14th of April, and saw the prisoner standing in the entry, talking to another man. As soon as we came in, and got towards the prisoner and the other, the prisoner went out at the side door - I went out after him, fetched him back, and asked his name? he said it was Miller. I asked him where he lived? he said in Aylesbury-street, Clerkenwell. I asked him what trade he was? he said he was a dealer. I then unbuttoned his coat, put my hand into his waistcoat pocket, and found 13 s. in silver. I asked him if he had any more money? he said No. I put my hand into his fob, and there found two notes, one good and the other bad. I then said,</p>
               <p>"Vann, lay hold of him, he has some bad notes." I gave these notes to the landlady, Mrs. Potter, and made her mark them in his presence - I also marked them myself. I then saw Vann take out of the prisoner's left-hand breast coat pocket four other notes. I gave them to Mrs. Potter also - she marked them in our presence - (looks at them) - these are them. I asked him of whom he got them? he said he was a dealer, and took them in trade, but he did not know of whom. I went with him to Aylesbury-street, but could find no such person there. I found he lived in Woodbridge-street, which is close by.</p>

            . I have been an inspector of the Bank for twenty-five years. The 10 l. note is forged in every respect, paper, plate, and signature. It bears the name of C. Watts, but is not his writing; he is not a cashier, and is not authorized to sign 10 l. notes - there is no other clerk of his name. The 5 l. note is also forged in every respect, and bears the name of J. Vantine, we have no such person; we have a Vautin, it is not his signature - he only signs 1 l. notes. The five 1 l. notes are all forged in every respect, are off one plate, and bear the same kind of water-mark - they are not the signatures of the clerks whose names they purport to bear. All the notes have the same water-mark - the paper is of the same fabric.</p>

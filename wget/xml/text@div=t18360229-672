                  </hi>. I live at Tottenham with my mother. On the 22nd of January I went to London for the purpose of getting some money—I returned home about four o'clock in the afternoon—I had 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my pocket on my return, in two bank notes of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and twenty sovereigns—after I returned from London to Tottenham, I delivered the notes to my mother—I know the Swan at Tottenham—I went there about eight o'clock—I had the gold in my left-hand breeches pocket—I took some gin and water in the bar—I remained there till nearly eleven o'clock—I then went towards home—I live about two hundred yards from the Swan—on my way home I was struck on my ham, thrown down on my back, and a hand was put over my mouth—that was done from behind—I cannot say whe<lb></lb>ther it was done by one or more than one person—it was quite dark—I had only taken a couple of glasses of gin and water—I cannot tell how many men knocked me down—I had my great-coat on, which they rip<lb></lb>ped open, and my other coat and waistcoat—I had a gold watch in my fob—a hand was put into my left-hand pocket—a hand took my watch, chain, and seal—the hand was over my mouth all the time that the other hand was in my pocket—they first took my money, and then the watch—no one spoke—they then went away—I had some keys in my left-hand waistcoat pocket—I got up and ran straight home into the kitchen—I was about twenty yards from home—I ran into the kitchen and told the servant I had been robbed—I ascertained that I had lost my gold watch, chain, and seals, and the twenty sovereigns—I afterwards returned to the spot where I had been thrown down, with one of the servants—I there found the keys which had been in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Sarah Blake. I am servant to Mr. Gurr, who keeps the Swan, and was so on the 22nd of January. I saw Mr. Wilkinson—he came there about eight o'clock at night into the bar, and remained there till about a quarter to eleven o'clock—on that evening I saw the prisoner Charles Willis—I had seen him before—I did not see the other prisoner there—the pri<lb></lb>soner Charles left about half-past ten o'clock—he had been some time there—I saw him go out—John Oliver went out with him—I know that Charles Willis lives down the Hale-lane, at the back of the Rose and Crown—they did not go towards their homes—instead of turning to the left hand they turned to the right, the same road as Mr. Wilkinson would have to go—they left before the prosecutor—there were many others in the tap-room at the time they left—the other persons remained in the tap-room about twenty minutes after the prosecutor had left—about half-past eleven I heard of the robbery—Mr. Wilkinson's footman came into the bar and mentioned it—I did not see Charles Willis after that evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Barker, a pawn<lb></lb>banker in Houndsditch. I remember the prisoner Charles Willis coming there on the 3rd of February, to pawn a gold watch-chain, between two and three o'clock—there was nothing appended to it—observing his ap<lb></lb>perance I felt well convinced it could not belong to him—I asked him whose chain it was—he said his own, and he had had it between five and six years—he had given me the name of James Willis, of Old-street-road, I think—I asked him where he purchased it—he said of a person of the name of Stevans—I asked him where Stevens lived—he said it was</p>

I went to Giltspur-street Computer, and saw Charles Willis there, but I had been to Mr. Barker first, in Houndsditch—at Giltspur-street I asked for James Wood, and Charles Willis was produced—I had known him two or three years—I asked him how long his name had been James Wood—he made no reply to that—I heard he had gone by that name at Barker's, No. 91, Houndsditch—I then said, "I thought we were not far out of our judgment when we apprehended you for the robbery before"—I was speaking of the same robbery—he said he did not commit the robbery—I had taken him and Oliver up for this rob<lb></lb>bery on the Monday after the robbery, which was on the Friday night—he was then discharged, because we had not sufficient evidence—he said he was not the person who committed the robbery—I asked him how he came in possession of the gold-chain—he said that it was put into his pocket by some person in the tap-room, at the Swan, at Tottenham High-cross—I think he said the right-hand jacket pocket—I asked him if he could tell me where the seals were—he said he could not—I produce no seals—I found them on another day—the pawnbroker has them—he told me he knew nothing of the watch.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 8th of October, the prisoner brought in some work to my master's shop, in Ludgate-street—it was my business to look out materials for people to make shoes with—I turned from him for that purpose, and was absent two or three minutes—on my return, I observed something in his bag—I gave him the stuff, which he put into his bag—I then turned it all out, and found these two pairs of shoes—he had given me the contents of his bag—it consisted of a pair of boots, new bottomed—these shoes were on the right-hand side of the shop, near the window, four or five yards from the shop door—I had seen them three or four minutes before he came, on the shelf, near the window—he cried, and said, "For God's sake, John, do not tell the master"—he went away unperceived by me, while I went to ring the bell the second time—he was taken the same day—these shoes belong to my master, and were missing from the shelf, near the window.</p>

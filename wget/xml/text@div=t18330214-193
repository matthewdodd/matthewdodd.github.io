On Wednesday, the 13th of February, I went out about ten minutes or a quarter to eight o'clock, leaving nobody in the house, I am certain; I have a wife and one daughter - I fastened the outer door, and the parlour door also; I locked the parlour door with a key which I put in a desk in my back parlour - the desk was shut, but not locked, nor was the back parlour door locked; I looked into the parlour before I locked the door - the drawers were shut, and the room was not in confusion at that time; my wife had gone out at half-past five o'clock, and my daughter also - I came back a few minutes before nine o'clock, and found the outer door about half open; the parlour door was also open - I held the door, pulled it too, and sent a person for a light, while I held the door, as I thought there was somebody in the house - when the light came we looked into the room; the things were all about, every drawer open, and every thing in confusion - my wife came in about ten minutes after nine o'clock, as I sent for her; I remained in the room till she came, and so did the Policeman and three or four more - she can tell best what was missing; I have found nothing except a pin, which was found in a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you take the parties to the station that night? A. Yes, and they were discharged, and went to bed at their lodgings as usual - I took Mann up again that night, when I found the pin in his handkerchief; I returned to the house three or four minutes before nine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. I believe you apprehended some other persons? A. Two more; Lee was taken a second time in my house in the morning; their room was not locked.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was it at your request they were discharged at night? A. The superintendent said as nothing was found, he saw no need to detain them, and it was agreed they should appear at the office next morning.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are the other lodgers still with you? A. One, the other is Mann's brother; I would not keep him - whether either of the other two went into the house between eight and nine'clock, I cannot tell.</p>

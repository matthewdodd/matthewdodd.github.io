            , whose draught has been forged, was in habits of intimacy with the brother of the prisoner, during their intercourse Mr. Wood had frequently supplied him with sums of money, and those supplies were by way of draught, whether the prisoner took opportunity from these draughts to commit the crime in question, I know not: although there are several more indictments here remaining against the prisoner, I do not think myself at liberty to go into any of the facts concerning them at present, but I shall confine myself to the present transaction. On the 20th of April last, a Mr. Tait, who is a clerk of Mr. Hankey's, was in the office for the purpose of paying the draughts that were brought, and then it was that the draught, the object of the present enquiry, was brought by the prisoner; Mr. Tait, upon looking at the draught, had some suspicion, he thought there was an evident dissimilarity in the writing, he went to a drawer where there were two other draughts which we say are forgeries, and which had been presented a little time before, but on comparing this note with those, and their appearing alike, he was induced to pay it; however, the circumstance itself caused him to suspect the prisoner, and made him take a more than ordinary notice of him: Gentlemen, undoubtedly the evidence of identity will be always received with considerable caution: probable it is, very probable, that persons may be deceived with respect to likeness, and with respect to recollection; but where there are circumstances that aid the memory, and induce at the moment particular observation, people in cases like this, may be enabled to speak with as much certainty as any human creature can do from memory; and you well know, many of the transactions in life require we should rely on memory, for seldom do we come to demonstration; if Mr. Tait therefore speaks certainly to the man, there will remain nothing but for you to go into the other circumstances of the forgery, which I shall then proceed to lay before you, and if they are proved to your satisfaction, it will then become your duty to find the prisoner guilty of the charge.</p>

            ; I speak of the partnership in April last.</p>
               <p>Lock at the prisoner, have you a recollection of him? - Yes, Sir, I think I have a very strong one?</p>
               <p>Did you see him in April last, and where? - On the 26th of July, at Hoxton.</p>
               <p>Did you see him on the 20th of April? - It struck me very forcibly that he was the same I saw on the 20th of April.</p>
               <p>On the 20th of April a man came to your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>At what time of the day? - About ten in the morning, as far as I can gather from my own book, this is the draught I have in my band; I looked at the writing, and I saw a sensible difference to Mr. Wood's usual way of writing; I took the opinion of my fellow tellers at the counter, and they told me it certainly must be his writing, they thought it was; I was not perfectly satisfied, but referred to a drawer, in which Mr. Wood's draughts lay, I looked at the draught, and found it the same hand-writing, I paid sixteen guineas and a half, and six shillings, and the gentleman returned me two shillings as bad.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, one of the prisoner's counsel. In what shape did you pay the draught? - Sixteen guineas and a half, and six shillings in silver.</p>
               <p>Have you a memory of the person that so presented the draught to whom you paid the money? - I had a very strong recollection then, I had rather speak to the time that I saw him on the 26th of July.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ask the person who presented the draught any questions? - None.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Did you take any observation of the person? - Yes, I looked at his person, and I apprehended in myself he was a relation of Mr. Wood's, because I thought there was a kind of family likeness in the fullness of his eyes to Mr. Wood's son, but I found it was quite different.</p>
               <p>On what occasion was it that you saw him at Hoxton? - He was taken into custody by a constable.</p>
               <p>Look again at the prisoner at the bar, is he or is he not the person that presented the note; what is your opinion of him now, that you can warrantably say upon your oath? - I believe him to be the same, on recollecting that it struck me so forcibly then.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Does your memory serve you to say whether that was the man or not? - I will not say, but upon that recollection.</p>
               <p>Do you believe him to be the man? - I belive him to be the man that presented the notes, but I only belive it upon the strength of that recollection.</p>
               <p>Court. That is a very fair and candid evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Do you know Mr. Wood? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Now, Mr. Tait, I am disposed to hope, as the court does, that you mean to give a very fair and candid account; it is that hope that induces me to give you a caution, because I have here your information before a Magistrate; now, you have told my friend, with some difficulty, (which certainly is in favour of your testimony) that after all the corroborating circumstances that you have put together, you do believe that the person at the bar is the person that presented the note.</p>
               <p>Court. He says he does not speak from his knowledge now, from his recollection.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Now I ask you, abstracted from all you have heard, from all you have done at the bank, and all that has been told you on the subject, I ask you, without these corroborating circumstances, will you swear the prisoner is the person that presented the note? - I hesitated, as you remember before, about that question, nor can I answer it now; I say I am uncertain.</p>
               <p>That is a very fair answer, and just such an one as I expected you to give; you have told us very fairly that you are uncertain, I believed that you was, because I observe<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140188"></xptr> that in the catalogue of reasons you gave before the Magistrate, your recollection of the person is not to be found; you was examined, I believe, by the Magistrate on the 29th of July? - On the 26th in the evening.</p>
               <p>Then your examination was reduced into writing, and signed by you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In that examination I see you enumerated several reasons which induced you to suspect, (for it goes no further than that you had great reason to suspect) upon several accounts, that one

             was concerned in this forgery; now, amongst those several reasons, though so close on the time, there is not one single mention of the person of the man that tendered you the note; the person, whoever he was, who received the payment, appears by your books to have taken it in cash? - Yes.</p>
               <p>No notes composed that payment at all? - None at all.</p>
               <p>You was some time examining the draughts, and comparing? - Perhaps a minute.</p>
               <p>And there was nothing in the conduct of the prisoner or the draught, that induced you to stop the draught? - No.</p>
               <p>The person who received the money returned two of the shillings as bad? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you before the Magistrate say you did not recollect him, and could not swear to him? - I might say I could not swear to him.</p>
               <p>That was in July; now, in September, having clapped together a variety of circumstances, you believe he is the man; the draught was tendered in April, and you did not see him till July, and then he was in custody for forgery? - He was in custody then.</p>
               <p>Did you go to the house of the prisoner on the 25th of July? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know, however, that there was an application made to him on this subject on the 25th? - I have heard so.</p>
               <p>And you have reason to believe it, it was made by your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He was found in his own house the 26th? - Yes.</p>
               <p>At what time do you begin paying in a morning? - Nine.</p>
               <p>What is your high time? - Between one and five; we have but little to do of a morning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Mr. Wood keeps money in your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the account between Mr. Wood and Hankey? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Is the book here? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Is the book in your hand-writing? - I have signed it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It is only an attested copy of better evidence; you may as well hear my friend's brief.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Your Lordship very well knows my friend would object to Mr. Wood, and I shall not call him without a release; I shall call others who know his hand-writing perfectly well.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. Is the younger Wood here?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He was obliged to step home; I told him I believed he might be spared for a few minutes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Then do once more enquire at the door if he is there?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. He says he is gone home; do not let us lose time.</p>
               <p>Wood. He cannot be gone above five or six minutes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. I have done, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. If young Wood was here, I should think it incumbent on Mr. Fielding to call him, especially after the manner of the last witness giving his evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. I have no further evidence in this case.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, it is impossible to call on the prisoner for a defence in this case; it stands merely that a person brought a draught to Hankey's and Co. which one witness swears is not the hand-writing of the person whose writing it purports to be, for payment; no questions were asked that person, payment was made; and now one witness swears, that he believes the prisoner to be the man, but is not sure of it: in the first place there is no reason to believe that that person, whoever he was, knew it to be forged, his conduct in returning two bad shillings is reverse to that, and if the mere taking money for a draught would make a man guilty of forgery, a man would never take a draught; at the same time it is but justice to the prosecution to say, that though the recollection of Mr. Tait is very uncertain, and that uncertainty is greatly increased nearer the time of presenting the draught, yet such recollection is a proper reason for commencing this enquiry.</p>

On the evening of the 1st of December I left home about four o'clock: I then had one crown and two half-crowns - I received 3s. while I was out, and spent half a crown during the evening; I got intoxicated - I had a watch with me; I did not fall asleep on the pavement - I was raised up from a state of sickness: I then found my right-hand trousers pocket was inside out; I have not stated that I fell asleep.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. About what time was this? A. Between eleven and twelve o'clock the same night - I never said before the Magistrate that I was asleep; I have always given the same evidence as I have today - I had a few glasses of ale; I cannot particularly state how many, and a few glasses of port - I cannot say how many; I had not had a dozen - I might have had half a dozen; I paid 4d. a glass for it - I believe that was all I had to drink; I had something to eat at the Marquiss of Stafford's, but I did not pay for that - I saw the crown-piece and the two half-crowns when I went out, and received the 3s. when I was out - I missed the money at the end of Charlotte-street, New-road; I was not on the ground asleep for two hours - I left my friend at York-house between nine and ten o'clock; I then went to a house in St. James-street - I cannot tell how long I remained there; I was pulled from the gutter to the wall by a gentleman, who I believe is here.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did you change the half-crown? A. After leaving York-house, in St. James-street, and I missed my money between eleven and twelve o'clock - I think I was not there half an hour.</p>

            . I live in Hooper-street, and am a comedian. On the night of the 1st of December I was passing along the <placeName id="t18301209-46-crimeloc271">New-road</placeName>

I received no answer - I asked him a second time, and during the interval I saw the prisoner take his hand from the prosecutor's side and place it in his own top coat pocket - I said, "Is the gentleman so far tipsy that you can't help him up?" the Police-officer then came up, who made himself extremely active; I saw the prosecutor's pocket was turned out, and his watch-ribbon extended a considerable way out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This was about twelve o'clock? A. A few minutes before twelve; it was light enough for me to observe the features of the prisoner and the prosecutor - the prosecutor was under a wall, not in the gutter: I asked the prisoner why he did not assist him - I believe he was forcing him back instead of helping him up; his arms were round his middle, and while I was there I saw his hand move to his pocket - he might have moved his hand in the most innocent manner.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable of the Hampstead district. I was on duty, and came up to the prosecutor; he was on the footpath, and the prisoner was stooping down with his arm round his waist - I said,"What are you doing with that gentleman?" he said,"Going to get him up;" I said, "Why not take hold of his arm, as this gentleman is doing?" the prisoner then let go his hold and stood up - I thought he had been robbing him; I searched him and found a crown, a half-crown, 3s. 6d. in silver, and 6d. in copper, in the right-hand pocket of his top coat - he did not, in my judgment, appear to be giving him assistance; I thought he was robbing him - the prosecutor's pocket had been turned out, and the watch pulled as far as the handle would admit; the prisoner ran away, but I took him again in Albany-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you say you thought the prisoner was robbing the prosecutor, had he not his hands under his arm-pits? A. No, round his waist - I found the whole of this money in the same top coat pocket; when we lifted the prosecutor up, he said he had been robbed, but did not say of how much - I found Mr. Ball there; the prisoner might have robbed the prosecutor before, but I thought he was trying to get his watch; I do not know that any thing was taken after I got up.</p>

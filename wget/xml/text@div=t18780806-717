                  </hi>. I am assistant to Henry Soames, a pawnbroker, of Fulham Road—he has three shops in Chelsea—I have been twelve years in the trade—on 12th July, about 9.30, the prisoner came and wanted me to send for some Apolonaris water and brandy, and to advance her half-a-sovereign on a cheap common ring; but I only advanced her 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she came again about 10 o'clock and asked me to lend her 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on this bracelet—she asked to look at some things out of the window, which came to 43<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. altogether, and the put the other bracelet in and asked me to make them 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said that I did not think I could—she said "Yes, you can; they are splendid brilliants, and this one cost 300 guineas," or pounds—I agreed to advance her 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the two, upon that representation—I would not have done so if I had known that she bought them at Mr. Pike's Abyssinian shop—she subsequently purchased another ring for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and gave me 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the change I gave her, and this metal bracelet, to make the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; but she said nothing about the value of the bracelet, and I did not try it, as she took me off my guard—I afterwards found that the bracelets were not gold, and that the stones were paste, and that Mr. Pike had charged about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them all—I let her have the value of 63<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them, goods and cash—she called next day, about 11.30, in a Victoria and pair, and produced a locket, two pain of earrings, this pendant, a bracelet, and something else, and asked for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on them—I said "They are paste and metal"—she said that I most be mistaken; she never wore fictitious jewellery, and if I did not like to lend it she would take them round to Mr. Young—I then found that the goods she pledged on the first day were worthless.</p>

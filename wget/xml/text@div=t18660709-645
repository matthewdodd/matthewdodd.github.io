                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of 2, Hungerford Street, St. George's-in-the-East—I was returning home from the "Clyde" Public-house, Com<lb></lb>mercial Road, about a quarter-past one o'clock, I can't tell the day of the month—I saw about twenty people on the opposite side—I went across to see what was the matter—they began to move, and I moved with them—as I went to step off the kerb the prisoner's husband seized me by the legs, and threw me down and kicked me, and the prisoner kicked me—I had no chance to get up, and was obliged to make a scuffle—my coat was pulled</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186607090085"></xptr>
               <p>off in getting up—the prisoner's husband then challenged me to come on the pavement and fight—while I was on the ground the prisoner got hold of me and said, "I will have your head off"—she took hold of my head and used very bad language, and cut my ear off—she then gave me several kicks—her husband was holding my legs at the time—a policeman came up—her husband then said, "Sling," and she slung a knife across the road—I was perfectly sober—I went to the hospital.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was the whole of your ear cut off? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I cannot see how much—I left work at half-past eight that evening, and went to the "Clyde" Public-house, and then to the barber's—I was not in the a "Clyde" from half-past eight till one—I was there from ten minutes or a quarter to nine—I drank about two pints that evening, or it might be three, and two pennyworth of gin and bitters—there had been a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> in the Commercial Road, but it was all over when I was there—I did nothing when I went up to the crowd—I did not roll against anybody—I do not know the man as the prisoner's husband, but I know him about the "Bed-ford Arms" fighting—I call him her husband because they pass as husband and wife—they live together, people tell me—when I was on the ground seven or eight prostitutes were round me—the twenty people were the mob in the first <hi rend="italic">row</hi>; they had all cleared away—I told the magistrate about the prisoner slinging the knife across the road.</p>

                  </hi> (404 K). On 19th of June I was on duty in the Com<lb></lb>mercial Road, saw a disturbance, and went up and saw the prisoner and the man she lives with and some more people—as I got half-way across the road I saw the prisoner throw something from her hand, but could not see what it was distinctly—I saw Lyons on the ground bleeding very much from his ear, and blood running down his coat—he said that the prisoner had done it, and I took her in custody—there was a mob round them, but they flew into the road where the knife was thrown, and covered the place—they were prostitutes—Lyons was not tipsy, but the prisoner was the worse for liquor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you on the other side of the road? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—Lyons was trying to hold the prisoner, but there was a mob round him who would not allow him; I mean five or six <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi>—the knife came from the prisoner's hand—it was not thrown till I was half across the road—they were struggling away, and I firmly believe they would have taken the prisoner away if I had gone to look for the knife—I did not take the man, because I saw no assault by him.</p>

I am a packing-case maker, of 29, Corner Street, Commercial Road—on the morning of 19th of June I was bidding some friends good night at the corner of Hanworth Street, and saw a bit of a row across the road—I crossed to see what it was, and saw Lyons fighting with another man—as I crossed I heard something fall, which sounded like a knife—I did not see from whence it came—I saw the prisoner there.</p>

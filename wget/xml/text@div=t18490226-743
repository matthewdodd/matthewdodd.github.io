                  </hi> I live in Castle-street, Falcon-square. I know the prisoner—I first had transactions with him about the middle of Oct.—he obtained one customer for me for some cloth—on 25th Oct. I had a case of gloves, containing 110 dozens of different sizes and qualities, sent to me direct from Paris; they were done up in dozens, and were in cartoons—the prisoner said he thought he could dispose of the whole to a friend, or a relation of his, in Regent street, who were large buyers—he mentioned the name of Ablett and Wheeler, and asked me whether I would allow him to take samples of the lot, to show to that house—I said I should take till next day to consider—he called next day—I said I had looked up eighteen dozen, of different qualities, which would be a fair representation of the 110—I gave him the price they were to be offered at—he was to bring them back in the afternoon, and tell me what he had done—he did not come back—on 2d Nov., about a week afterwards, I met him in the street—his eye caught me, and he apparently wished to avoid me, but we came in contact; he appeared very much embarrassed—I said, "Where are my gloves?"—he said, "I have been extremely ill, laid up; I could not come to you"—I said, "Where are the gloves?"—he said, "They are at Ablett and Wheeler's, for ap<lb></lb>proyal"—I said I had sold the lot; I must have them returned immediately—I added, further, I had sent them to Birmingham, and I must have them that evening to sell the lot—he said, "I will go instantly, and fetch them"—before</p>

               <p>he went I asked him for his address, and he gave me a false address, 14, Bartholomew-close—I was not able to find anything of him there; <hi rend="italic">I</hi> went to every house there—he turned off from me, in the direction of Regent-street—he did not come back with the gloves that evening—on the evening of 9th Nov. he called at my house, in my absence, and saw my wife—I found that ten dozen of those gloves that had been sent, bad been left at my house; they were rumpled and creased terribly, as though they had been in pawn—they were not in a condition in which I could sell them at the same price as the others—on 10th Nov. I met the prisoner in Falcon-street—I told him to come back to my house, and when I got him inside I said, "Now, where are my gloves? you have brought back ten dozen; where are the eight dozen?"—(the eight dozen were worth about 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the others were in about the same ratio)—he said first he had lost them—I said, "I have just come from the police-office, in Scotland-yard; I intend to give you into custody"—he begged and prayed of me not to do <hi rend="italic">to</hi>—he then said he had left them at the bar of a public-house—I wanted to know the public-house, or whereabouts it was, but he could not tell me—he said this was his first offence; that his character had never been tarnished before, and it would blast his reputation if I exposed him; that he would restore them if I would give him time—I told him he had given me a false address—he said he could not account for that—I asked where his lodgings were—he told me, and I went there with him; it was in Charterhouse-lane—he remained outside—I went in, and made inquiries—I found that he lived there, but said that I was not satisfied with what I beard from his landlady, it appeared that his illness was constant drunkenness—he said he would restore the gloves, if I would allow him to do so, and not give him in charge—he did not tell me that he had sold them at an inferior price, and in a wrong name.</p>

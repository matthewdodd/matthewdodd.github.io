On 6th May I followed the prisoner Hogan, in company with another man, from Mr. Cassell's warehouse, on Ludgate-hill, to Perkins's house, No. 21, Windsor-place, City-road—he was drawing a truck, loaded with four sacks filled with waste paper—Perkins is a waste-paper dealer—it is a private house—there is a board over the door—Hogan went in, and he took the bags in—I went in after him—I searched the bags, in the presence of Hoghn and Perkins—the officer Knight was with me—I told Perkins that my reason for searching the bags was, that I had reason to believe he had purchased prints stolen from Mr. Cassell, he knowing them to be stolen—he said, "I have never bought</p>

                  </hi>. I am the manager of Mr. John Cassell's printing business—I have examined a great quantity of this paper, it is Mr. Cassell's—I describe it as printed paper, prints and publications—it is by no means waste paper—a small portion of it may be—on some of these sheets is a print that has never been published—here is on this sheet a print that is not published up to the present time—it is part of the <hi rend="italic">Illustrated Magazine of Art</hi>—here are a large number of this print—it is the "Virgin and Child"—the whole of these (<hi rend="italic">looking at a number</hi>) are duplicates of that—they are all the same print—these other are printed parts of books—Hogan has been in the habit for some time past of dealing with us for waste paper—he has been in the habit for some time past of clearing the office of refuse, purchasing it—he was in the habit of giving half a crown a cwt. for what he bought—the value of the sheets produced here by weight before any printing was put on them is nearly 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a cwt., but the paper the prints are on, would be more, because it is heavier—these are never sold in sheets, they are divided into four parts the size of a page of a book—we keep them in this form for sale in different publications—they are all made into books before Mr. Cassell sells them—they are cut up, and one accompanies each No. of the book—this print of the "Virgin and Child" has never appeared in any publication—in the most careful printing some sheets would be damaged—the majority of these are good sheets, fit for selection—it is possible that a single sheet or two may be damaged; but, speaking generally, I do not consider these waste sheets by any means—none of them have been sold in the state they appear in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What sort of paper is it that you sell to Hogan for half a crown a cwt; could these have been taken for it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; by no means—what be has is dirty and utterly destroyed, except to be re-produced at the mill—it is the sweeping of the office, and paper run through printing machines so frequently as utterly to deface it—if we have any clean waste it is not sold, but used up on the premises—one way in which we get rid of a great quantity is to print large posting bills on it, by which way we get rid of a large quantity—this is one of the bills (<hi rend="italic">producing one</hi>)—in this way we can use clean waste—this is a printed sheet, but quite good enough to print posting bills on—it is quite the same value to us for that purpose as white paper—the paper we sold to Hogan is swept up into a closet or cupboard—there is a place appropriated for that kind of' waste—this paper could not have got into that place by any means to the extent I see before me—a single sheet might.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

I went with her into a broken house, there are several old houses which are uninhabited, and being pretty much in liquor, I fell asleep, and slept I believe for about half an hour. When I waked, I missed the things and my money; it was about three o'clock in the morning before I came out of the broken house - I know I had the stock on, and I had the money, when I came from a publick house that I had been at; and there was no other person that I had any thing to do with. There were my snuff box and a knee buckle found in her pocket.</p>

            . As I was beating my rounds about four o'clock, I met the Prisoner, and she asked me to light her candle. I said, she might light it and welcome. She said, Watchman, as you are coming this way, I desire you would go with me in here; for Jemmy is got drunk, and will not go home without a dram, and may be you may get a dram. When I went there, Mr. Robertson, the Prosecutor, as standing at the door, and the Prisoner said to him, it is a cold morning, let the watchman have a dram. We went to a house, and she filled a cup, and gave it me, and she would have given the Prosecutor some, but he would not have any. He desired me to stay a little, and the Prisoner said, let us have another dram, for I have another three halfpence left. When that was drank, she was going away, and the Prosecutor said, I charge you with this woman for picking my pocket, and upon searching her the knee buckle and snuff-box were found in her pocket, and some other odd things of the Prosecutor's were found by her direction in the empty-house. She said, she had not the money; and as to the other things she picked them up, and did not know whose they were.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The Prosecutor asked me for a lodging, and I went with him into this empty house, and we staid there two or three hours, and when we came out, he charged the watch with me. <rs id="t17441205-20-verdict135" type="verdictDescription">

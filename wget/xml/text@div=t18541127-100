                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Harriet Williams, who keeps a linen draper's shop, in Church-street, Woolwich. On Saturday, 18th Nov., about half-past 12 o'clock" the prisoners came into my mother's shop to<lb></lb>gether—one of them, I do not recollect which, asked to look at some coloured silk handkerchiefs—I showed the handkerchiefs to both of them together—I placed the handkerchiefs before them, they both examined them—the handkerchiefs were in a box—I placed the box before them—the prisoners consulted each other, and they both said the handkerchiefs were not thick enough—there were scarfs in the same box—they did not ask to look at them—the prisoners had before asked for shoe binding—they purchased a black and white handkerchief—Dean paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—after they had purchased that, they left the shop together—when they were gone I missed three handkerchiefs and three scarfs from the box which I had placed before them—I missed them within half an hour after the prisoners were gone—these are the handkerchiefs and scarfs—this one handkerchief has a private mark on it by which I know it—our handkerchiefs had private marks on them when they were in the box—only this one has the mark on it now—here is the place where this other handkerchief has had a ticket on it—the value of these handkerchiefs is 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the scarfs 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I am quite sure I saw all these in the box when I placed it before the prisoners—I am quite sure this one is my mother's property.</p>

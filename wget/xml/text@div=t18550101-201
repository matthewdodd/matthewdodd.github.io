                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. George Edward Eyre, and Mr. Spottiswoode, printers, of No. 189, Fleet-street; they are printers of the Bible to Her Majesty. I have known the prisoner about six years, as being in the service of Messrs. Leighton and Co., the binders—he was frequently in the habit of coming to the shop for Messrs. Leighton—on or about 7th Dec., he came there about 4 o'clock in the afternoon; he said he had a friend going to Australia, who wished for a good family Bible—I gave him a cata<lb></lb>logue and a specimen of types to show to his friend—he went away with them, and returned in about half an hour—he said his friend was not par<lb></lb>ticular to price, but wished a really good Bible, and would I let him have two for his friend to select from, and he would return one in an hour, and pay for the other—I said I would do so—I was very busy then, and told him to call again—he said he would, and he did in about half or three-quarters of an hour—I said I was not ready for him yet—he said he was going round to Messrs. Leighton, in Harp-alley, where he should be about half an hour, and he would then return for them—while our man was gone</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185501010011"></xptr>
               <p>up stairs to bring down the two quarto Bibles, I said, "Are you still in Messrs. Leighton's employ?" wishing to make myself very sure upon that point—he said, "Yes," he was—as we knew him when he used to drive the cart, I asked him about his change of occupation, and he said he preferred the in-door occupation now, but at first it had affected his health—I had seen Messrs. Leighton in the mean time, and himself too; he had been to our warehouse, and I understood he was warehouseman to Messrs. Leighton—I then delivered him the books—I did not see him again until the morning of the 19th, when he was in custody—if I had known that he was not at that time in Messrs. Leighton's service, I certainly would not have delivered him the books; the two were worth 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he never returned them.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

Leighton's place of business very well, there was formerly an entrance in Harp-alley—I cannot say whether there was at the time—I always used to go in at the Harp-alley entrance—I have not been in Harp-alley for three or four years—I am quite certain he said he was still at Mr. Leighton's—he said at the station house that the Bibles had not been parted with, and he could bring them if he was allowed to go to the place—I did not hear him say so when he was taken—the two Bibles came back on Saturday last by the Parcels Delivery Company—the cheaper of the two has the mark of 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it, since it left our warehouse—that was after he was committed; with the exception of that mark they are not in any way the worse.</p>

I am the wife of Edmund Washington Knight, a clothier in Blackman Street—on Saturday night, 8th November, three people came into the shop; the female prisoner and Goldberg are two of them; I cannot swear to the other—Goldberg said "We want two overcoats, we want to see some cloth"—I showed them some—there was some conversation about it, and I reached some more large pieces down—they said they were much too dear—the conversation was carried on in English; they spoke English very well—they were in the shop about 10 minutes; they said they wanted an overcoat at about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not sell them one, nor any cloth, and they went out—my husband came in and said something to me, in con<lb></lb>sequence of which I searched for a piece of cloth which I had seen before these people came in—I had seen my husband reach it down before he went out, and it was lying on the counter when the prisoners came in; there was about 11 yards—the original quantity was marked 23 yards; it was worth about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—next day, Sunday, I went to the police station and identified Leah Bloomenthal and Goldberg—they were placed with nine others, three of them women—I have not the slightest doubt about those two—I could not say whether Hyman Bloomenthal was the other man.</p>

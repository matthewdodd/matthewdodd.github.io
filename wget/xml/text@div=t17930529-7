               <p>Q. Had you ever seen her before? - I think I have some knowledge of her by standing at the gate; I have stood there at times, and I think I have some knowledge of her face before; she took me over the way to the wine vaults, and we had a glass of gin.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into a room with her? - No; she came out and took me by the hand, and said, go along with me to my lodging; I went along with her, and when I came to the lodging, (her lodgings are <placeName id="t17930529-7-crimeloc35">No. 9, Star-court</placeName>

               <p>Q. Was there any witness in this place but yourself? - None in the place but myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober? - Yes, sober enough; I was as sober as I am now; I had been drinking in the evening part of two or three pints of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been at work that day? - I had not; I had been about business for my brother-in-law.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you drank any liquor in the course of the day? - Not in the day time, in the night I had part of six pennyworth of rum and water that was with this woman before I came to the house and that was all then, and I had only two or three pints of beer all the whole day. I gave her half a crown; then she requested me to give her something to drink; I said, I have no more silver; she said, you have more money; I put my hand into my pocket and gave her half a guinea to go and get something; she went to the door and talked as if talking with somebody to give an order for the liquor, and then returned in again, and was there about ten or twelve minutes, or thereabouts; I said, this liquor is a great while coming; she said, I think it is; then she turns about and whips my watch out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive it go? - I did, it was a silver watch with a steel chain, a metal watch key, and a steel bed hook; she was gone out about a quarter of an hour after she got the watch, and then returned in again, as soon as she returned in again I said, give me my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you permit her to go out with your watch? - She went out in an instant as she got the watch; it rained as hard as it could rain, and it was very dark, and I was in an entire strange place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get your watch again? - Neither the watch nor the money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hat-manufacturer, and live in Skinner-street, Snowhill. The prisoner was in my service, and had been so since September last—I engaged to give him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, but he was not to make a hat for himself, or for any one else—on the 31st of May, I re<lb></lb>turned from the country—there were some words between the prisoner and the workmen—the workmen put on their hats and were going away—I said it was very unhandsome, as I wanted a great deal of work, and they knew by the rules of the trade I could not set any person to finish ano<lb></lb>ther person's work—they then said the prisoner had not done the thing</p>

               <p>that was right—I said nothing to the prisoner then; but on the Tuesday he said he was going to the Epsom Races on the Thursday following, if he got his work finished—he finished his work, and went; and then I made inquiries—he came to work on the Friday, and I called him into the counting-house, and said, "Sinfield, you do not know how hurt I have been at your conduct; how can you account for taking my apprentice to work at your house?"—he said he wanted a dozen hats made, and as the apprentice was going to have a holiday, he told him if he would go to work at his house he would pay him—I said, "It was very wrong, where did you get your willows from?"—he said, "From here, Sir"—I said, "Where did you get your brims from?"—he said he had some old mate<lb></lb>rials about—I said, "Don't say that, the apprentice will prove that you took it from this piece "—he then said, "I had not enough, and I took the remainder from here "—I then said, "If you are an honest man, you can have no objection to my searching your house"—he said, "Certainly not; but you cannot go directly, my wife is not up "—I said, "I will go and see, and rap her up "—I went, and his wife was in bed—I told her she was wanted directly—I returned, and met the prisoner running, and the officer after him—he ran past me—the officer said, "You must not lose him;" and we followed him into his house, No. 27, Hosier-lane—we found he had got a workshop there—the officer found there a quantity of cotton shag, some silk shag, some tips, and other things—I said, "Where did you get these?"—he said I had allowed him five yards and a half to cut out a dozen hats, and by his ingenuity he could cut them from less, and he had taken the remainder as a perquisite; but some of the pieces were three yards long, which a man could not have left from five yards and a half—in another room we found some tips, lining, and other articles, which I have here—we then found some other leather and trimmings which had my mark on them.</p>

                  </hi>. I work as a trimmer for Mr. Wood—the prisoner worked there—on the 16th of May I saw him bring in some hats—I asked him if I was to trim them—he said, "No," he was going to send them to his wife—I said it was very strange.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> He has been in the habit of sending half-a-dozen hat trimmings, or more at a time, to my house; there was sometimes two or three leathers over, and sometimes less; and it is very easy to see that a few leathers might have been left—I had no idea of tipping when I went; but he said if I would do it, he would give me half-a-crown a dozen, which I did; and then he said he could not afford that, he would give me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I felt disappointed, but I still remained with him.</p>

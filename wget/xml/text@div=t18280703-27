On Thursday morning, the 3d of July, about half-past nine o'clock, I went out - I was the last person in the ground-floor room, and locked that room door myself; the street door is left open for the lodger, but is fastened at night: I returned at eleven, in company with Clark, my sister-in-law, and as I got home I saw the prisoner step off the step of the door with my blanket under his arm - I knew it directly to be ours by the border; I went up and said "Sir, you have got my blanket," and he said he had not - I returned to my room and found half the pannel of the door broken out, so that a person could get through; I returned to the prisoner, who was standing with my sister-in-law - she was then taking the blanket from under his arm, and then the brass candlestick fell out of the blanket: they were both my husband's - the blanket was on my bed and the candlestick on a box by the bed-side that morning; the prisoner was given into Clement's charge - the bed was up a small flight of stairs adjoining the room, over the wash-house, and is part of the house; you go through the ground floor room to get to it, but not out into the open air: the prisoner said voluntarily "Don't make yourself uneasy, don't fret yourself, for I have done it;' he said that directly he was stopped with the blanket - the things are worth 3s. 6d.</p>

            . I am an officer. I know Hill's house; it is in the parish of Christchurch, Spitalfields. The prisoner was delivered into my charge last Thursday; he said he had broken open the door and taken the things out, and he thought it was the best day's work he had done for a long while; nothing was said to induce him to say this - the prosecutrix and a man gave him into my charge.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

I am Mrs. Hill's sister-in-law, and stopped the prisoner two doors from the house and took this blanket from under his arm; he never moved after I stopped him - I said "What business have you with this blanket?" he said it was not hers; Hill went to her door and cried out that it was broken open - I had hold of him; I then took hold of the blanket, he let go of it and the candlestick fell out; a mob collected and he was taken to the watch-house.</p>

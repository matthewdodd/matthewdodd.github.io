                  </hi>. I live at 18, Charles-street, Marylebone, and am a compositor—on 23d September, about half-past 12 at night, I was coming down Pentonville-hill, and saw a woman and three men coming along the pavement towards me—I went into the middle of the road to avoid them and quickened my steps—they followed me—the other three stood behind me, while the prisoner stood in front of me—my arms were held behind me while the prisoner took my watch—he cut it oft from the swivel with an instrument—I struggled and was thrown down in the road, and they all made off—the prisoner was standing in front of me about a minute and a half or two minutes—I had a good opportunity of seeing his face, from the reflection of the gas-lamp that shone full on his face—I called out for the police, but there were none there—I went and gave information—on the Saturday following I was in company with Dudley, a policeman, on Penton<lb></lb>ville-hill, and he pointed out four persons sitting near a public-house—I went over, and instantly recognised the prisoner as the man that had robbed me—I gave him in charge—I have not the slightest doubt that he is the person—I was perfectly sober at the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> The gentleman stated at the Police-court that he had been drinking. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I had taken about the-quantity I generally take, two three<lb></lb>penny worths of whisky and water and a glass of bitter ale, extending over a period of three hours and a half—I was as sober as I am now—I gave a description to the police, and can positively swear to him.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman N</hi>, 488). In consequence of information I received, I went with the prosecutor on Monday, 25th September, to Pentonville-hill—I saw four persons outside a public-house there, and told the prosecutor to go across and see whether the person was there who stole his watch—he did so, and came back and gave the prisoner into custody, saying,</p>

               <p>"That is the man who stole my watch"—the prisoner said, "Oh, you have got the wrong man."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> At the time the gentleman, says this happened I was at home and in bed, but I cannot bring witnesses to prove it, as I live by myself. It is a very serious thing to be brought here innocently; I know no more about it that the Judge himself.</p>

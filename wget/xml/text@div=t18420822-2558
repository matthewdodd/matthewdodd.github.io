On Monday, the 22nd of August, between six and seven o'clock in the evening I was on duty on Kennington Common—there was a meeting there of three or four thousand persons, I should say—I did not hear any speaking myself—we were ordered clear the Common, and shortly after doing so I saw the prisoner in the Kennington-road, throwing stones at the constables who were on the Com<lb></lb>mon—the last stone he threw struck me on my right hand—I got over the rils, and took hold of him with my left hand—be resisted, but through the bow on my right hand he succeeded in getting my staff from me, and strug<lb></lb>ged with me in the road—he struck me on the head with my own staff, which stnned me for the moment—I was assisted by the constable to a doctor's—ve were struggling at the time he struck me, and both fell down on the footway—he was underneath—he struck me twice, but only once on the he—the other blow was on the shoulder—I was stunned, and cannot tell who her he struck me after the second time—when I came to myself two conables of the L division had him in custody—I did not see my staff agai till I got to Tower-street station—it was taken from him—the ser<lb></lb>gean who took the charge gave it me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pensioner from the army, and live in Upper Crown-street, Westminster.

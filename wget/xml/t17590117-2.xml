He sent for her; she went with me to Mrs Folier's lodgings, one that buys old cloaths; she went with us to Mrs Hambleton in Monmouth-street; I did not see the spoon that night, but after that it was brought before Mr Welch, there I saw it.</p>

Mrs Davis came to me about five weeks ago, and described the prisoner; I afterwards took the prisoner upon suspicion; I ask'd him if he ever lived at the King of Prussia by Brooks-market; he said he did not; I ask'd him his name he said Williams; I sent for the prosecutrix; she said that was the man, that she described for me to take; upon being charg'd with taking the spoon he own'd he did take it, and also he own'd the same before Justice Welch; after it was produced by Mrs Hambleton, the prosecutrix brought another to match it.</p>

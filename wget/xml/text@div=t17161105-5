Mr. Holder thinking it might be true, took it, and borrow'd 10 l. for the Prisoner. Two or three days after, Trippuck met Holder, and desired him to borrow some Money upon a Silver Watch; which he seeming unwilling to do, Trippuck used some menacing Language; telling him, if he did not, it should be worse for him. He afterwards hearing of the Watches being advertis'd, carried them to Mr. Smith. The Watches were produced in Court, and owned by the Prosecutors; but they would not swear the Prisoner was one of the Persons who robb'd them. The Prisoner said in his Defence, that he received the Watch of Trippuck. The Jury considering the Evidence was not positive to the Prisoner's taking them, <rs id="t17161105-5-verdict32" type="verdictDescription">

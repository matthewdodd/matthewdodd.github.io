            . I am Mr. Harris's errand-boy. I went to Inman's about half-past four o'clock, and got the parcel. As I was returning I met the prisoner on the middle of London Bridge; he asked me where I was going? and I told him. He said he was going to Arundel-street, Strand, and would shew me a nearer way than I was going. He took me through Lombard-street, and when we got to Cornhill he asked me to have some beer? he took me up a court to a public-house, and as I was going in at the door, he took the bundle off my head, and laid it on the taproom table, called for a pint of beer, and sent me for half a pound of black pudding; when I returned he was gone with the bundle. On the Monday following, I saw him crying matches at the top of a court, knew him again, and fetched my master, who secured him. I am certain he is the person. I observed him particularly.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 8th of November, I took the prisoner in charge; he denied the charge, and said he lodged at No. 1, Fleur-de-lis-street, Brick-lane. I went there, told his wife what I came for, and she immediately attempted to throw some duplicates on the fire, but I seized her hand, and took them from her; they related to the property produced. I searched her, and found other duplicates of her own property. In the room I found a quantity of linen, and two pair of black worsted, and a pair of black silk stockings, and a piece of wrapper - they were taken before the Alderman. She was discharged on producing a certificate of her marriage to the prisoner.</p>

On the morning of 8th September, about 1 o'clock, I was in South Street, Walworth—the prisoner came driving up with a horse and cart, to Mr. Goldiug's livery stables—I was standing opposite—the prisoner said to me "What are you looking at?"—I said I had a right to look at anyone—he became very abusive—he left the cart,</p>

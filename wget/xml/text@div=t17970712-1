               <p>Q. Did you lose any thing? - A. Yes; one of them got his hand in my pocket, and took out two keys; one of them was the key of Buckinghamgate, the other was the key of my own watch-box, and about five-pennyworth of halfpence, which were in the same pocket.</p>

Yes; as I was down upon my side, one of them said, d-n him, here is a watch, we will have that; I told them for God's sake, to save my life, and they should have it; they snatched at the chain, and broke it; they took the chain, but left the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any stick with you when you went into the Park? - A. Yes; they got that from me; the serjeant brought it to me afterwards, his name is Hemblin; when he came up, he said, d-n you, what are you about, is this you Mr. Keough, what are you robbing or murdering the man; says he, I know you very well, you will know me another time.</p>

            Did you hear the person he called Keough, make any reply? - A. He said, by the Holy Ghost, or some such thing, he did not know any thing of him; then there came up two of the patrols, and the soldiers all three ran away; I lost my hat and my stick; I got up as soon as I could, and ran after them; one of the patrols caught Ives, and had him away to St. James's watch-house; I was high enough to them to hear the patrol say, what is that you have dropped, he said, nothing; I saw him stoop and pick up something, but I did not see what it was; I went with them to the watch-house.</p>

             sworn. - I am a serjeant in the Coldstream regiment; I served in the same company on the continent, with Keough; I know him very well, and I have done duty with Ives, in Knightsbridge barracks: On the 14th of May, I was returning to my home near Tothil-fields, about twenty minutes past twelve; just as I entered the Park, at the stable yard gate, I heard something of a noise, which induced me to stop, when I heard a man begging very hard for mercy, but it was at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179707120004"></xptr>distance of eighty or one hundred paces, that I could not perfectly understand; I waited a few minutes, and I heard a man say, that he was only a poor watchman, he had no money; and after that, I heard him say, for God's sake, spare my life, and take my watch; I then went to the spot immediately, and saw the prosecutor lying on the ground, and two soldiers on the top of him; then Keough lifted his head up, and the moment he held up his head, I knew his face; I said to him,"Oh master Keough, are you here?" upon that he got-up, and made use of an expression, by the mortal Saviour, says he, you are mistaken in the man; after that, he was coming up nearer to me, and I was afraid he was going to attack me,and I immediately struck him on the side of the head with this stick; the stick, with the violence of the blow, broke in the middle, so that I was left totally disarmed; after that, Ives got up, and I knew his face.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How near were you to Ives? - A. About three paces; when he got up, he had this stick in his hand, (produces it, the prosecutor's); I told him, it was of no use to resist, as I knew them very well, I was sure to have them, and they both held up their sticks to strike me; I was in plain cloaths at the time, and I told them I was a serjeant in the guards, and I should be sure to have them, and then Ives turned his back, and ran away from me, I pursued them, and then he turned about, and held up the stick again to strike me, and I alarmed the centinals in the park, but no one would come to my assistance, and I threatened one of them, that I saw, that if he did not come, he should be severely punished; upon my threatening the sentinel, he was induced to come; I told the sentinel, that if he attempted to pass, to run his bayonet through him, and then I seized him, and at that moment, two of the patrols came up, and he was secured; I took this stick from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt of the persons of the two prisoners? -

            Not at all; I never was farther from him than five or six paces: in the morning, I was going after Keough to his quarters, between six and seven, or somewhere about six o'clock, and there I met one of the officers, Patrick, and we went together to the house, where we had information that he was; when we got half way up stairs, I desired Patrick to go forward, which he did; I heard something pass up stairs, and I went up, and he had him in custody.</p>

I am one of the patrols of Bow-street: About twenty minutes past twelve, I was coming through the Park with Harding, and we heard the cry of stop thief; I ran towards Spring-gardens, where the cries came from; when I got a little farther, I saw the serjeant running after Ives, and I got up to the serjeant just as he took the stick out of his hand, and I secured him; when I had got about forty or fifty yards as nigh as I can guess, I saw him put his hand in his pocket, and take out something that was bright, but what it was I cannot say; I said to my partner, search him, and upon that I heard something fall; Harding immediately picked it up, it was the key of Buckingham-gate, he has had it ever since.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I was with Amsden when Ives was apprehended: Between twelve and one o'clock, on the 14th of May last, I heard a man cry out, sentinel, stop him, several times; we ran up, and when we got up, the serjeant had got hold of him, and we secured him; in searching his breeches, he took out something and dropped, which I stooped for, and found to be the key of Buckingham-gate.(Produces it.)</p>

               <p>Shepherd. This is my key; I am very positive this is the key that I lost, I have had it eight years.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I apprehended Keough the same morning that Ives had been brought in about half past twelve; I went out of the watch-house between four and five, to the place where I was informed they were, in King's-head-yard, Broadway, Westminster; I found Keough sitting upon the bed, and a woman in bed; he said, before I spoke to him, I will go along with you; I said, you had better come with me, as there is an accusation against you for a robbery in the Park last night, along with Ives, and if you are innocent, come along and clear yourself up; he then said, who put me up, or who acquainted me where I was to come after him, or something to that effect; I told him it was very immaterial, and I tied him and one Dempsey together, that was discharged, and they came along very willingly.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Keough put in a written defence, which was read as follows:</p>
               <p>Justly conceiving the embarrassment I should labour under in the presence of this honourable Court, I have committed my defence to paper, having no<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179707120005"></xptr>doubt but I shall meet with some compassionate gentleman who will take the trouble of reading it to this honourable Court. On the night stated in the indictment I had been drinking at the Greenman, in New-street, Covent-garden, till near two o'clock, and on my departure from the house, not being able to get into my quarters, and being for guard the next day, I went to Westminster, with an intention to sleep with a comrade, where I kept my best clothes, that I might sooner get dressed; and, in Tothill-street, I met with a girl of the town; being rather intoxicated, I went home with her to her lodgings in the Broad-way; while I was getting ready, I was apprehended by serjeant Hemblin, and others; I can only solemnly declare I am innocent of what is laid to my charge, and throw myself upon the mercy of the Court.</p>

            (To Pevering.) Did you observe any marks upon Keough's face? - A. I observed one side of his face was swelled, the left side, but I did not take any particular notice; but when the serjeant, at Bow-street, told me he had struck him, I thought I observed one side rather larger than the other.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Ives put in a written defence, which was read as follows:</p>
               <p>On the night on which the prosecutor says he was robbed, I had been drinking in Paved-alley, St. James's-street, till twelve o'clock, and in crossing St. James's-park, in the way to my lodgings, I heard a noise as of men sighting, or struggling; being unwilling to be seen in the Park at that time of night, I made haste to get away, and stumbled over something, which I found was a walking-stick; I heard a cry of stop thief, and was stopped by the sentinel, when serjeant Hemblin, and the prosecutor, came up, and owned the walking-stick; I am entirely innocent of it. With respect to Keough, I had not seen him for twenty-four hours before.</p>

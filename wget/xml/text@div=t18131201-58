The prisoner and two or three more stopped me bodily; they hustled me; my coat was buttoned; they soon opened that, and took my pocket-book out of my side pocket. I put my hand in my pocket, and missed my pocketbook; it contained six 1 l. notes and a check. I could not run after them. I made haste to the Banker's, No. 66, Lombard-street, and stopped payment of the check. It was a quarter after five when I was there. They told me to be there the next morning, to see if they came in with it. On Wednesday morning I went to Hatton-Garden office, when these gentlemen here asked me what I wanted. I said my six 1 l. notes. They said they had got the six 1 l. notes and the pocket-book, but they had not got the check. I am sure Golding is one of the men that hustled me, he was as near to me as my finger is to my nose.</p>

            . On the 9th of November I saw the prisoner in company with a man of the name of Williams, and knowing them both to be notorious characters, I watched them. They were going up Brook-street; they walked on the left hand side of the way, and I on the right, till we came to the top of Brook-street, near the potatoe warehouse. I stood at the potatoe warehouse door on the right, and as they were passing me, I saw Williams take some notes out of his pocket-book and give them to the prisoner Golding. They walked on down Dorrington-street, Brook's market, and went into the George public-house, Leather-lane. It being on a particular day, I thought they had committed a robbery. I went to Hatton Garden, and informed Read senior of it, and Read senior went with me to the George public-house, and there Read searched them in my presence. On Williams and Golding he found three 1 l. notes on each, and some silver upon one of them, but how much I cannot say.</p>

               <p>THOMAS PEARSON. I have never found the box - I employed him several times; he was recommended to me as particularly honest - he moved from his lodging the next morning, and could not be found: I found it was not delivered, about an hour after - I had told him to call on me at the Bell, in Aldgate, to be paid; he was to wait there for me - he came, and was informed I was gone to the docks; I returned there in a quarter of an hour; he did not come again - I never heard he had lost it till he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I lost it, and got some employment at Brook's wharf.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WHEELER. I was sitting on a step when I saw him, and do not know which way he came - he could have gone up John-street to the docks from there.</p>

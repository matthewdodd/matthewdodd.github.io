               <p>I was robbed of the thread lace; the money belonged to lady Elizabeth, my wife; the prisoner was my <rs id="t17930529-18-deflabel94" type="occupation">house maid</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17930529-18-defend255 t17930529-18-deflabel94"></join>, she lived with me till she was taken up; I had been absent from London a fortnight or three weeks, and when I returned I marked a number of guineas and put them in the place where the money was usually kept, in her dressing room; I marked fourteen or fifteen and put them in a purse which was kept in her pocket on a horse, in her dressing room; I believe it was the 22d of April, in the evening, I don't know the day of the week, I marked them and took down their dates, also, whether they were old or new guineas; I went into the dressing room immediately before the prisoner went in to light the fire, the day after I marked them, the 23d, I counted the guineas then, and found them right, fourteen or fifteen, I have got them now in my pocket and the list.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Now over night you marked a certain number of guineas, you put them in a purse, and took a list; when you again came into the dressing room did you again take the guineas and compare them with the list? - I did not exactly campare them with the list then, but I found them right.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find them right from your recollection, or from actual comparison? - By my recollection. On the 22d of April I took a list of these guineas, but I did not examine them by the list the next morning, but I found them all right before she came in to light the fire; immediately as she left the room I went and examined them again and I found one missing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say for a certainty, and are you sure that there was any one less than there was before? - Yes, there was. I went down the stairs, called the prisoner to me, and told her to give me the guinea she took out of lady Elizabeth's purse; she denied having taken any; I then told her to shew me what money she had in her pocket, and she pulled out a guinea, which I had marked, and I can swear to.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you kept that guinea separate? - Yes, I have, I then sent the housekeeper up stairs to lock up her room, and sent for one of the Bow-street officers; Mr. Kennedy came, she gave up the keys of her boxes, and I had them searched, and I found this piece of lace, I believe it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290037"></xptr>belongs to me, I missed just such a piece, and have compared it with some others, and it suits exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take it out of her box? - No, Mr. Kennedy did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him do it? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you found it? - I meant to say that I sent for Mr. Kennedy and he searched the box.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you had taken down a list on paper of a number of guineas which you put into Mrs. Palk's purse? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. There is but one guinea in dispute? - There is not.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you looked at a number of guineas the next morning? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Does your recollection now serve you to be accurate whether it was fourteen or fifteen? - I have not looked at the list; I cannot be positive now; I know there was one missing by the list, and I will tell you how, when I found one guinea missing I compared the rest with the list; I marked them down as I took them out of the purse; I found one missing; I took notice of the mark on that, and I found it answered exactly with the one on the list that was wanting.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you know they were correct by the list when you did not take the trouble of comparing? - My memory may be indifferent, but it would serve me for a dozen hours.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray in whose pocket had this purse been? - in nobodys pocket but lady

               <p>Ann Potter. I am wife to the prosecutor, the prisoner came to our house on the 18th of Jan. in the evening, and asked me to lett him a little mare, that he said he had had before; I told him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175305020005"></xptr> he could not have that which he describ'd, (but don't remember he ever had her, or any one of us before;) but I told him he should have another; I went to the stable and shewed him one, he gave me a shilling earnest, and said he should come the next morning about eight o'clock; my husband works at a brew-house, he saddled her and hung the bridle ready before he went out; the prisoner came about half an hour after ten, and gave me the other 1 s. 6 d. and took the mare, and said he should be back again about two in the afternoon, he then said he had had a fall from a horse in St. James's-street, which had gave him a fear under one of his eyes, which I took particular notice of, by which I am sure he is the same person, he said he was going but into Long Lane, on the other side of the water, and could walk it in two hours, but he wanted a bit of a ride; he told me he liv'd at the King's-Arms, in St. James's-street; but I went afterwards to enquire, and found no such place in the street, we never saw the mare since.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour was she?</p>
               <p>A. Potter. She was a black one.</p>

            . I was not at home, when my wife let the mare out, I have advertised her twice, but never saw her since. When I took up the prisoner and asked him where my mare was; he said, hush! hush! don't make a noise here; I'll go with you where ever you will.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the mare?</p>
               <p>Potter. I could have had three guineas for her several times.</p>
               <p>Q. What age is the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Potter. He said before the justice he was eighteen years of age.</p>

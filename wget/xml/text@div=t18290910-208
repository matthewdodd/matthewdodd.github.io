I lost a pair of seales from my shop in Church-street, Bethnal-green, on the 23rd of July, at twelve o'clock; I saw them at the prisoner's house; these are them; I value them at a guinea and a half - they cost me near 3l.</p>

            . I went with a search-warrant to the prisoner's house; I asked if she was the mistress of the house; she said Yes - I asked if she had any doctor's scales; she paused, and said, "Yes, up stairs;" I went up, and found them under the bed, covered with some dirty linen; she said she hoped we would be merciful to her, she was a poor widow woman - I asked for her book; she said she could not write herself; she gave me a book, which had not got them in; I took her to the office, and afterwards a little girl, whom she called her daughter, came and brought a book, which had got the scales down at 2s., which she before said she gave for them - she did not say from whom she purchased them, nor did she say that she had not them for sale, as they were intended for a friend; I did not hear her say so at the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. MILLER. Q. Was not a boy examined at the office? A. Yes, but he was put in the workhouse to be kept, and ran away; he was here on Saturday, but I could not find him to-day; he said he saw two boys go in with them, and they gave him 2d. to say nothing - it was through him the search-warrant was granted; his name is Driscoll.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The officer came to my house, and asked if I had a pair of scales; I said, "What sort of scales?" he said, "Doctor's scales;" my reason for asking was, I had bought several pairs for the shop - I said, "I hope I have not done wrong in buying them;" I did not know where my little girl had put them, as she had put them away up stairs, as she had been cleaning - I stood for some minutes; my little girl came up, went to the box, and took them out; the officer did not take them; the lad I bought them of was by himself; he had a very decent appearance: I questioned him, and he said they were his father's, who was ill - I had bought two or three things the week before of him.</p>

             sworn. - Mrs. Gadd being ill, I took her place at that time in taking the money; I was a waiter there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember, on the 25th of July, how many notes you took in the course of the day? - A. There were six one-pound notes taken in the course of that day belonging to Mr. Gadd; I had put them in a bowl in the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner do any thing in the course of the day? - A. I saw her take two notes out of the bowl on the 25th of July, about half past four in the afternoon; I was coming across the shop at the time; I saw her take them from the bowl and put them in her bosom.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know they were two notes? - A. I saw them separate in her hands; I immediately asked Mr. Gadd how many notes he had left in the bowl, he said six; I said Mary must have taken two; then she was called in; at first she denied having taken any; I did not see her searched.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bolland. Q. Did you give any account before the Magistrate of having seen her take these notes? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you saw her take distinctly two notes; you then asked your master how many there were, in order to ascertain how many were gone; he said six, then you said Mary must have taken two? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you put any mark to these notes? - A. No; I cannot swear to them.</p>
               <p>- BLUNDLE sworn. - I am a constable: In consequence of information that I received from Mr. Gadd, about a quarter before five in the afternoon, on the 25th of July, I searched the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you searched her did you question her? - A. I asked her if she had the notes; she said no; I told her, if she had, to give them up; I then proceeded to search her; she resisted; at last we conducted her to her bed room, and I searched her as narrowly as I could, and between her stocking and her shoe I found a one-pound note (I produce it); I then supposed that I had searched her every where; I took the note to Mr. Gadd; I went up again to search her, and as I got upon the last stair, the nurse called out, I observe something chewing in her mouth; I went to her, but I could not perceive what it was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bolland. Q. She objected to your searching her, you said; whether that objection was not arising from modesty? - A. I told her, in the first place, I was a family man; she seemed intoxicated in liquor.</p>

             was in my employ - his father was my foreman, and is so now. On Sunday morning, the 30th of November, I sent for an officer; I charged Stringer with robbing me, and told him it would be better to confess, and if he would tell me the parties who were implicated, I would forgive him - he then gave me information.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You knew nothing of the matter but what he told you? A. No; he is not related to me - he has been about six months with me; I am a tailor and pawnbroker - his father has been about four years in my employ.</p>
               <p>Q. A. person transacting business with them might naturally suppose they were respectable people and doing no wrong? A. That they certainly might, as they had been so long with me - the father had the entire management of the tailor's business, as I do not understand it.</p>

            . I was in Mr. Gofton's employ for six months, and left him last Sunday morning; Hall was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040030"></xptr>in Mr. Gofton's employ, as a journeyman tailor - he worked in Barrett's-court, Oxford-street, opposite the house, and came there once or twice most days; about three months ago I asked him for 30s. to pay a debt in the City - I told him I had received a letter from the person, and it must be paid; he said I might take something and pledge it, and there would be no harm in it, provided I got it out again - I hesitated a little while, and then gave him a suit of clothes belonging to Mr. Gofton, for the the purpose of getting 30s.; he took them, and brought me back 30s. the same evening - I took the coat out of a drawer, a pair of blue trousers and waistcoat out of a wrapper; they were all in the shop - he was present when I took them, and I gave them to him; two days after I told him I thought we had better get the clothes out again, as I was afraid we should be found out- he said, "Oh, never mind - we are quite safe;" no one knew of it but ourselves - nothing was done then; I never mentioned it to him again - we had before that pawned things and got them out again: I would not have let him have these if he had not undertaken to get them out; about three days afterwards I delivered him a pair of blue trousers and two black waistcoats of master's, worth 25s., for the purpose of getting money on them, which he promised, and he brought me 10s. back - he did not say whether he had pawned them or not; he saw me take them: about a week after that I delivered him two fancy waistcoats and a pair of dark drab trousers, to get money on - he brought me back 10s., and was present when I took them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you expect to be able to get all these things out of pledge? A. No - I expected to get out the first, but not the two last; he never told me whether he pledged them or not, but brought me back the money - he never produced any duplicates.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had he been in the service of Mr. Gofton? A. I do not know - I had known him about six months; my application to him was to raise money for myself - he was in the shop when I took the black trousers and two waistcoats; I did not tell him what I wanted the money for - he was to have part of the amount he got for the goods; there was no bargain made that he was to have any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Your master found you out, and on his pressing you to name somebody who was concerned, you named the prisoner? A. Yes - the prisoner never told me I might take money of master's, and charge it to him as paid on account.</p>

               <p>GEORGE STRINGER. These are not the trousers I gave him when he produced the 10s. - he had these the second time; here are some black trousers and two waistcoats produced by another witness - I cannot identify the drab trousers, as I gave him others; they were delivered to him about three days after - I think I gave him more than one pair of black trousers; nobody in the shop missed them.</p>

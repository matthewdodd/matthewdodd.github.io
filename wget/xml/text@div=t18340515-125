On the 1st of May, the prisoner came into my shop between seven and eight o'clock in the evening - he had had dealings with me on a former occasion- he said he was very glad to see me - he hoped I was quite well, and he said he wished to speak with me - I asked him in, and he said he was very sorry for what he had done- (alluding to a transaction which occurred three years previously) - he said he was very sorry for the way he had behaved to me - that it preyed very much on his mind, and he had never been happy since, and he had now come to make me amends - I said I was very glad of it - he said"I have arrived from St. Petersburg about a fortnight since, and am going to Quebec to-morrow - I will leave you a monthly note to pay the debt which I owe you" - I said,"Very well," and asked him for it - he said, "I have not got it now, but if you will come on board the ship

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What day was it you sent to make inquiry at the tier? A. The same night the policeman sent, and two witnesses have made inquiry about the ship - I did not send them - what he asked me to do was, to cash it as a favour - he has been a seafaring man for about four years - I have only one partner - if I had cashed the order my partner would have an interest in it.</p>

             (police-constable K 211). I took the prisoner into custody by desire of Mr. Child - he produced this note to me - I took him to the station-house - the inspector asked the prisoner where the ship laid - he said at Union-tier, Union-stairs - he was asked where the Captain lived, and said at Stepney, but did not know where - he was then asked where the owner lived, and said he should not answer any more question - I was then directed to go to Union-stairs to inquire if such a ship laid there - I went and inquired of several waterman there, if such a ship laid in the tier - they told me no - I inquired at a public-house if they knew of such a ship - I went next morning to No. 48, Fore-street, and inquired if R. Ray, Esq., lived there - there was no such person lived there - I asked if they knew the name in the street, and was told no - I inquired of two or three shopkeepers if they knew the name, nobody knew it- I afterwards was taking the prisoner from the office to the station-house, and he asked me what I thought he would be done to - I said I did not know - he then said the note was given to him yesterday, on 'Change, by a man whom he had not seen before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is there any body here from the house in Fore-street? A. No; I saw a man and woman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150077"></xptr>at the house in Fore-street - there are always a great number of ships lying in the tier.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What sort of a house is it? A. A linendraper's shop, I think; I went to the private door.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the office of the Registry of shipping in the Customs - I cannot say whether there was any vessel called the Mary Ann, bound for Quebec, lying at the Union-stairs on the 1st May - I have searched the Registry for the "

             of London" - I was told to look for that - if the owner resided in London, she should be registered there - there are several Mary Ann's registered, but not with that Captain's name nor the owners - the note purports to be signed by G. Martin, master, and there is no Mary Ann registered with that name as master, nor any R. Ray as the owner - I have not seen the order before.</p>
               <p>Q. What description of vessel should you expect to find if that note was genuine? A. We should look in the London registry - it being only " R. Ray Esq., Fore-street," we infer means that he is the owner - he is not called the owner - he might be an agent - but I believe that is not usual.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the register enable you to say that the vessel does not exist? A. Presuming the vessel to belong to London - I could find no such vessel with Martin the master: but I find about two years ago there was one which was sold to the Revenue - I have made no extract from the book - I could find nothing to extract - I have searched it very carefully and could find no such vessel.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What did you go to look for? A. I was instructed to look for the Mary Ann; Martin, master, of the port of London, bound for Quebec - we have a general Register - I looked for her as a London vessel.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose Ray was a banker? A. I have not sufficient means of ascertaining the question - I cannot say whether these notes are ever directed to a banker - I supposed it was a London vessel from the supposition that Ray was the owner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If it was not a London vessel, have you made sufficient search to say there is no such vessel? A. No - I have searched the entrances and clearances, and could find no such vessel having entered from Petersburg, and cleared out for Quebec - I find neither an entrance nor clearance of such a vessel within the last three months.</p>

               <p>(Note read.)</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HENRY NOSS re-examined. I searched to see if the ship had cleared out on the 1st of May, and up to the 4th of May, as they do not always, sail to a day - they frequently clear and sail out the same day, or they may be a week longer than was intended - if a vessel from Petersburg discharged her cargo at Scarborough, and came in for ballast, she would not be entered in our register.</p>

             re-examined. I went to the private door at No. 48, Fore-street - there is a linendraper's shop there - I did not go into the shop - I cannot say they were not different establishments, but believe the shop belonged to the house.</p>
               <p>EDWARD CHILD re-examined. Q. Did the prisoner put the note into your hand before or after he said, "Will you cash this note for me?" A. I rather think he gave it to me at the same time - he said, "I have a favour to ask; will you cash this for me?" and immediately handed me the note - I had not agreed to cash it - he only asked me to do it, and after giving it to me, enumerated what articles he wanted for it.</p>

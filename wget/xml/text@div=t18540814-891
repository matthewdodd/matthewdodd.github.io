                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mary Ann Winton, a lighter-man. On Tuesday, 11th July, I sent a lighter to bring some goods out of a foreign ship—they were five casks of marbles and three cases of mineral vinegar—the vessel was lying off the Tower-stairs—the goods were to be landed at Brewer's-quay—I saw the barge on the Wednesday—it contained five casks of marbles and two cases of vinegar—one of the cases was gone.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lighterman. On this Tuesday evening I was on the Tower shore, about 20 minutes to 10 o'clock—the tide was then ebbing—I was waiting for the flood tide—I had a barge alongside the <hi rend="italic">City of London</hi> steam vessel—I know both the prisoners—I saw them that night—they rowed alongside the <hi rend="italic">Barber</hi> barge, and put the case into the skiff—James rowed, and Bourne sat on the case—they rowed to the Tower shore—they eased the case down on the shore, carried it up a little way, and broke it open—Bourne carried one bottle, and James the other; that I saw.</p>

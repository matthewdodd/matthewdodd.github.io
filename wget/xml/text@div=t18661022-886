                  </hi>. On 19th September I was serving in the "Lord Campbell" beershop, Campbell Road, Bow—the prisoner came in for a glass of the best half-and-half, and put down threehalfpence—he drank it, and then called for another glass and a newspaper, and gave me a florin, which I put in the till—I cannot say whether it was there by itself—he then went out—when he was gone I looked at it and put it on the shelf—he came again on the 25th—I served him with a glass of the best half-and-half, and he put down a bad shilling—I said, "This is bad, and you were here the other day and passed a florin; I knew you directly you came in"—he then ran out at the door, and I sent the potman after him and he was taken into custody—I gave the florin and the shilling to the constable.</p>

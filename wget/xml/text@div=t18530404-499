                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Pope, of Isleworth. On Thursday night, 10th Feb., my husband was from home—I closed up the doors, locked up the house, and went to bed—during the night I heard a noise like the slamming of a shutter next door—I got up about a quarter to 7 o'clock in the morning—I unfastened the stairfoot door, and found the shutter wrenched aside and an inner door open, leading into a little room; the back door was wide open—I ran out of doors, and saw the glass and part of the window frame lying down, and a steel and knife belonging to my husband; the window frame was broken all to pieces, and was taken out, which left a space large enough to admit a man—on searching the house I missed a drawer, containing 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of farthings and twenty-five slate pencils—the till had been emptied; it had contained 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of halfpence the night before, besides farthings; I had taken out the silver—I also missed a bottle of sweets, some Spanish liquorice, and a piece of meat—there was one coin, marked "2 cents;" I saw that on the Thursday afternoon, because I picked some of the farthings from the halfpence, and put them into the till; the two cent piece was put into the bowl in the till in the afternoon—I took a bad farthing of a man that Thursday afternoon; there were two 2's on it, the date of the year, and it was likewise bent—I had also another farthing with three holes in it, also a bent farthing, and there were six farthings all alike—I have known the prisoners ever since I have been at the shop, four yean, and they have all been there.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant, T</hi> 18). On Friday, 11th Feb., about 9 o'clock in the morning, I went to Mr. Pope's house—the back part had been broken into—the window-sash had been taken out—I measured the place—it was twenty-two-and-a-half inches by fifteen-and-a-half, large enough to admit a man—I could get through—I traced footmarks across one garden into Mr. Pope's premises, of two people with shoes on, and of one without shoes going, and of three people with shoes returning—on the Saturday morning I apprehended Kill near Twickenham—I searched him, and found on him this small coin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and a tobacco-box—I told him I took him on suspicion of breaking into Mr. Pope's house on the Friday night, and stealing a quantity of farthings—he said he knew nothing at all about it-—he would defy anybody to say he had any farthings in his possession at any time—I said, "You were at Twickenham yesterday, with Goldsmith and Tamplin, spending a great quantity of farthings"—he said, "I did not see them;" but afterwards he said, "I did see them; they asked me to go with them to have a game at skittles"—he said nothing about their being with him on the night of the robbery—he also said, "I have no money—I have only 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I was on the spot when Goldsmith was apprehended, and I apprehended Tamplin on Saturday evening, and found on him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there is one halfpenny among it which Mr. Pope identifies—he said he was at North Hyde on the Friday—that is five or six miles off Twickenham Common—on the Sunday morning I took the shoes of the three prisoners to Mr. Pope's premises, and compared the footmarks by placing them by the side of the footmarks—Kill's were very heavy boots, tipped at heel and toe, and with two rows of nails on the outside, and three in the middle—Tamplin's had no nails, except a few small-headed ones just round the heel—the marks corresponded both going and returning—I took off Goldsmith's boot, looked at the bottom of his foot, and saw a piece of clayey soil, similar to that in the garden, attached to his stocking—it was Goldsmith's shoes that I could not find any marks of going to the premises—the prisoners at first all denied having been there on the Friday, or having a farthing in their possession—I saw Goldsmith searched—there was nothing found on him—the house is in the parish of Isleworth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How many nails were there down each row on the boot? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot tell you; but I counted the rows—hundreds of shoes may be made off the same last in Twickenham and Isleworth. I do not know it—I have known the three prisoners for some time, Kill has been in custody once for being drunk, that is all.</p>

                  </hi>. I cannot speak positively to this farthing, or whatever coin it is; but I have seen a similar one to it in my shop—I know this coin found on Tamplih; I saw it in my shop, as near as I can judge, a fortnight before the robbery.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> I believe this coin to have been in our possesion some time ago; T cannot say I have not parted with it, but one of our children had it to play with—I believe these six farthings to be the six which I looked out on the Thursday afternoon, and put into a little bowl in the till—this farthing, with the three holes in it, I had in the farthing drawer about a fortnight before, in which drawer all the farthings were when I went to bed, but I do not know whether this was among them—we had not taken any farthings out of the drawer for ten months, and I am sure I put it there; it has a slight bend on the edge—this two-<hi rend="italic">cent</hi> piece has been in our till three weeks, or a month; I remarked to my husband upon it, and can say positively that I had it on the Thursday.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Does your child go to this drawer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I have a good many children, but I never allow them to go there; they could not reach without getting up on a chair; the eldest is five years and six months old—a sister of mine sometimes serves in the shop; she never touches that drawer, there are plenty of farthings in the till; but I do not say that she would not go to the drawer for some if there were not any.</p>

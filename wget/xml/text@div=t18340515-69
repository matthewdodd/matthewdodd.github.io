I keep the King's Head in the Tower, which my brother superintends for me - on the 15th of April I was there, and the prisoner was introduced to me as knowing a friend of mine - I asked my brother if he would go out that afternoon - the prisoner said he should like to go with him, and I took them to Shoreditch - while my brother and I were up stairs, the prisoner took this brush and the bird, but I did not see him - we then went back to the Tower - the prisoner assumed a great deal of consequence, and called for some brandy and water, and while we were sitting there, I missed my snuff-box off the table, and asked the prisoner about it - he denied it - he then asked the way to the water-closet - I directed him, and while he was gone, I asked my brother if he had seen my snuff-box- he said no - I then looked for it, and it was not on the floor - the prisoner then returned - I again asked him about it - he took the key of a private closet, and ran up stairs, and, as he as was going, threw this bird down, which was brought to me - I then went up and found he was locked in the closet - I told him if he did not open the door, I would send for an officer - he then came down, and we sent for an officer - when the officer was coming, I looked down and found the snuff-box on the floor - I am certain it had not been there before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q. Did you ever see either of these articles in the prisoner's possession? A. No- this box had been on the table in the bar that evening- a friend of my brother's had dined there, but he did not return.</p>

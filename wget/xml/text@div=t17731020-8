               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of his hat and stick so as to know them again?</p>

               <p>Q. What was the occasion of your taking particular notice of that stick?</p>

            . I am a surgeon; I live at Hammersmith: I was called up between three and four in the morning of the 16th of September, (they had brought the deceased from the road to the Cock and Magpye) to see farmer Wingfield; I found him dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the deceased?</p>
               <p>Palver. By sight, by seeing him pass and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177310200011"></xptr> repass. The people stript him; his body and limbs were very fair; there was no bruise upon his body at all; I examined his head; upon the left side of his head I saw a bruise; that was the only bruise I saw about him; I did not make any further examination that morning; I deferred the rest till I was sent for by the Coroner's Jury, on the Friday afternoon; then I laid the skull bare, and precisely under the contusion I found a fracture of the skull and a depressure; the skull was depressed and beat in upon the brains, a round piece, something bigger than a shilling; from thence a fracture extended both ways forwards almost to the eye, and backwards to the hind part of the head.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that from your opinion the cause of his death?</p>
               <p>Palver. No doubt of it; there was no outward wound, the skin was not broke or even grazed.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you think it might happen?</p>
               <p>Palver. From some blow I should imagine.</p>
               <p>Q. Would not the skin have been broke if it had been occasioned by a blow?</p>
               <p>Palver. Not if it was done with a round stick; if it had been done by any thing pointed or sharp it must have made some external wound.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hammond. Did you take notice of what money or things were in the deceased's pocket?</p>
               <p>Hammond. His pocket was cut long ways and cross ways, his left side breeches pocket; they were leather breeches; there were three keys hung out of that pocket; there was no money, not a farthing; I found upon him a clasp knife, a penknife, a pair of spectacles and a pencil; there was nothing else found upon him, not a handkerchief or any thing in the world.</p>
               <p>Q. to Livard. You dined with the deceased?</p>
               <p>Livard. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pay the reckoning?</p>
               <p>Livard. There was no reckoning paid till after he was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe him pull out any money?</p>
               <p>Livard. No; I paid for some oysters and things; he said he would pay me again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether he had any handkerchief?</p>
               <p>Livard. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a substantial farmer?</p>
               <p>Livard. Yes.</p>
               <p>Allan. He pulled out ten or twelve shillings at my house when he paid for the pint of beer, as I was told by my ostler; I did not see that; I changed a shilling for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a man of substance?</p>
               <p>Allan. By all accounts he was: he said when he took the money out to pay me for the poor, this is not the pocket where I keep my gold, I am not afraid of giving gold instead of silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see which pocket he said was not the pocket where he kept his gold?</p>
               <p>Allan. No.</p>
               <p>Q. to Williams. What did you observe of the pocket?</p>
               <p>Williams. I observed it cut as Mr. Hammond has said; I saw the key hang out of his breeches pocket.</p>

            . I belong to Sir John Fielding's office; when Serjeant Fisher came up to the office, I brought the prisoner from the Savoy up to Sir John Fielding's office; going along with Serjeant Fisher he cried; I asked him what he cried for, he said I did a robbery last night between Kensington and Brentford and the man was ill used, and he was afraid murder was done, but he hoped not; he said he had robbed the farmer of a hat, and sold it to one Dominic; going a little further, he took out this knife, (producing a clasp knife,) and said this is the bloody knife that cut the farmer's pocket on the left thigh.</p>
               <p>Q. In fact I suppose it was not bloody?</p>
               <p>Prestow. No, it only cut the breeches.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>My lord, they have got my money which is my own property; I hope they will return me that before I make my defence.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I hope your Lordship will order me my money first</p>
               <p>Court. It does not appear to me to belong to you, is appears otherwise at present, because it is proved by one of the witnesses that you took the money from this man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was drunk and mad when I said these things; I worked hard for the money. At eleven o'clock at night I was drinking in the Hay-market at a public house upon the right hand, I do not know the name of the sign; I went from there to Great Windmill-street, which is at the top of the Hay-market, there I had a glass of gin at a liquor shop; I mentioned to the landlord of the house that I was in a great deal of trouble, and did not know whether I had better go to sea or not; I wanted a petition to the Earl of Waldegrave; I had two petitions by me ready, but he not being in town, I was obliged to wait for him a little longer if I could; I went from there to St. James's-street, there I met with two chairmen, I asked for one

            ; I could not find him; I went from there to a public house in Piccadilly, and had some gin; it was about twelve o'clock then. I had no home to go to; I was going to lie down in a court; I could not lie there because they were emptying a necessary. I went as far as Hyde-Park-Corner, where there is a public house and a bench, where we soldiers used to powder ourselves; I lay down upon the bench and hung my hand down; I fell asleep; I looked further under the table and picked up a hat; I got up and looked about to see if I could see any body asleep; I could see nobody; I came back into the town; then I could not see any ho use open. I met two girls; they shewed me this house open in St. James's street; I had some gin twice with them. I offered the hat for sale to the chairman; he gave me half a crown for it. I had a 4 s. 6 d. in my pocket, which I had had a good while about me; I had left the same four and six-penny piece in pawn for a glass of gin a month before, at the Suttling-house at the Horse Guards, and Barlow, a soldier, and I had sixpence a piece upon it besides; I went there and released it; the landlord would not change it because it wanted sixpence of weight. I drank at a public house in St. James's-street till I was quite drunk and very stupid. I heard of a robbery being done on the other side of Kensington; a butcher had been robbed of a watch and silver buckles, and a farmer had been robbed of some money, I did not hear how much, and his pocket cut; I did not hear any thing about any death or any thing of that kind. I was persuaded to say I had committed the robbery, as some people told me I should get clear of military punishment; I do not now know what I said at that time; I believed myself several times with foolish things before, when I had been in trouble, to screen myself from military punishment, when things have never been done, but this unluckily has been done: but I am now before God Almighty.</p>

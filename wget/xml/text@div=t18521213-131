                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 364). On 20th Nov., about half past 2 o'clock in the morning, I was passing by the Piggott Arms, in the East India-road, and found the yard door at the back of the house ajar—I pushed it open, and saw the prisoner opposite to me—I said, "Holloa! what are you doing there?"—he said, "Nothing"—I laid hold of him by his collar, and sprang my rattle, and another man escaped from the yard—after the other man left, I received a blow at the top of the back of my head by the prisoner from some instrument which I could not see; it was a blunt instru<lb></lb>ment—I afterwards found this life-preserver (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he struck me four or five times—I laid hold of him by the waistcoat, and he left part of it in my hand and got away—I left the portion of it in the yard, and pursued him, calling, "Stop, thief!" and he was stopped by another constable in the East India-road—I recognized him at once, I had never lost sight of him—I was bleeding very much—I went back with the prisoner and the other constable to the yard, and found the piece of waistcoat and a hat—the prisoner said, "They are mine"—I then found the life-preserver close to where I was struck—I was confined to my bed eight days, and am under medical care now—I had four wounds on my head.</p>

On the night of 20th Nov., I was on duty in the West India-road, and saw the prisoner running direct from the Piggott Arms, and heard a cry of "Stop thief!"—he was running towards me, and I ran and took him—he said, "I will go with you"—I took him back to the Piggott Arms, and as I was taking him back I met Brooks, whose face was covered with blood, and his head was bleeding very much—I took him back to the yard, and he picked up this hat and part of a waistcoat, and said they were his—the waistcoat he had on corresponded with the piece—I took him to the station, and then returned to the yard—I found the shutters of the back window had been wrenched open with some iron instrument—there was a clear mark between the two shutters, such as an iron bar would make—I saw Brooks pick up the life-preserver.</p>

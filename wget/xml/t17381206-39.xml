Mr. Snoud (the Surgeon) being call'd, the Bleeding was stopp'd, and after the Deceased had kept his Bed about three Days, he seem'd to recover, and at Length the Wound was cur'd; but the Effusion of Blood had occasioned a Weakness of Body. It appear'd that under this Indisposition the Deceased had play'd at Skettles, and that three Weeks after the Accident, he walk'd to Richmond Park, where he sat a great while to see the Nobility hunt in the Park; after which he walk'd some Part of the Way home, and came the rest by Water. It likewise appeared that he had taken Cold; which was follow'd by a violent Fever, of which he died.</p>

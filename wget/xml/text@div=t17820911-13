The prisoner knocked me down before I saw him, and I felt him lay across my body, I got from under him, but in the meantime he picked my pocket of 7 s. I called out watch, and he ran away; he was taken at about twenty yards distance. He knocked me down with his fist I believe: I had been drinking a little, I was very well to pass; it was not a very bright night. I cannot tell how near the watch-box it was, he was dressed then as he is now.</p>
               <p>From Prisoner. Whether I had not a brown jacket on? - That outside jacket appears to me to be the very same.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman at Ratcliffe-Cross; I took the prisoner the 22d of July, between eleven and twelve, a little between Cock's-Hill and Stone-Stairs; when the alarm was given by the neighbourhood, the prisoner was running down against me; I took him within ten minutes after the man was knocked down; it was about a hundred yards to this alley, there was nobody else in the street: I took him to the watch-house, I found no money on him, he had a few half-pence, I cannot tell how many.</p>
               <p>Jury. He had no silver on him? - No Sir.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178209110030"></xptr>Did he say any thing when you took him? - He said he came from Greenland Dock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said that was a tall, stout, lusty man that knocked him down, he told a lad so that was in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Question to Warren. Had Marks any difficulty in swearing to the prisoner? - Hearing the prisoner going on with his un-rude ways, blasting his eyes, and that, he said, I can swear to the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That lad is not here, I am just come from sea; I had got a ship, being rather in liquor, I left my hat in the boat, when Marks came to the watch-house, he was so much in liquor he did not know what it was for, any more than me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live at 3, Seven Step-alley, Hounds<lb></lb>ditch. On Wednesday night, the 8th of April, I went into the tap-room of the Box Tree public-house, Gravel-lane, Houndsditch, between ten and eleven o'clock—I was the worse for liquor—I saw the prisoner there—I have known him many years—I sat down on the same seat as him, and in two or three minutes he asked why I offended his wife, and called him an informer—I said I knew him to be the occasion of two men being taken up for desertion, and considered he was an informer—he directly struck me in the face—I stood, up to defend myself, to fight with him, intending to return his blow, and he knocked me down—we tustled to get the better of each other—he got me down—I got up again—we had another round—he knocked me down again—I fell convenient to the fire-place, and, to the best of my opinion, he caught me by my collar—I am sure he put his hand on my shoulder or collar—be knelt his knee on my body—I was lying on my back—I saw him put his hand to the boiler which was on the fire, and I believe on the cock—he certainly turned the cock, or spilt the water out of the boiler—it came over my belly and thighs immediately after, and scalded me very much—I tried to get up, and be kicked me on the face, and said he was sorry he did not scald the b----to death—the pot-boy assisted me home, and what took place after I do not know—I found myself in the London Hospital next morning—I remained there seven weeks and two or three days—I am much better now, but feel it very slightly.</p>

I was at the Box Tree—the prisoner and prosecutor were both intoxicated, and quar<lb></lb>relling—I saw the prisoner knock Tothill down—he got up again, and the prisoner knocked him down again under the fire-place—the prisoner then placed his hand on the lid of the boiler, and kept it there about half a minute, and then pulled the boiler, and the water went on Tothill—he poured it from the boiler—he then up with his foot, and kicked him in the face—the water was not long running on him—he was picked up.</p>

I was at the public-house with my husband—the prisoner and Tothill were quarrelling when I went in—I afterwards saw the prisoner strike him, and knock him down—they had two rounds—the boiler was on the trivet, on the side of the fire—the prisoner put his hand on the top of it, and turned it over him—it fell on the ground—after it was all over I heard him say he was only very sorry he had not scalded him to death—that was after Tothill had gone away.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a linen-draper, and live in Sydney-place, Commer<lb></lb>cial road. On the morning of the 26th of May, I was at my door—I saw the prisoner come up to my door—I went back into my shop, got on the counter and watched her through the window—I saw her take hold of two prints, and draw one piece out from the bundle that was outside the door tied togo<lb></lb>ther—she doubled it over, and laid it on the top of the bundle—a female then came to the window, and the prisoner walked up and down in front of the shop—the other person came in, and I told hex my object—I saw the prisoner then come again to the bundle, take this print, and put it under her left arm—she then came into the shop, and asked the price of the muslin handkerchiefs which were hanging up—I told her 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she said they were too dear—she went out, I and the young man went after her, and took her with the print—she said she hoped we would not give her in charge.</p>

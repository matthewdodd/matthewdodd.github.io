I said I wanted 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the screws, and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pair for the hinges/' &amp;c.) That does not state that I asked him to give me what he had given me before—I was never asked the question, nor about going to have half-and-half at the public-house—I have never been a witness before—I was never found out before—I went before the Magistrate for the purposes of justice, not to, get myself out of the scrape—I cannot say how much I have stolen from my father within this last six months—I am single—after leaving my father I got my living by working for him—I worked for Mr. Brown, an undertaker, in the Edgware-road—I had so much a job, sometimes about 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a-week—my father did not know I even got that—there is a back room to the prisoner's shop—I had not endeavoured to persuade his wife to buy these things before he came home—I swear that—I had not offered them to her—she did not ask me where I got them from, or whose they were, nor did I say that night to her or the prisoner that they were my own, what I had in my business, and for which I had no longer any use—I think I took three pairs of hinges, but only two were found—I forgot the third pair—I have been a carpenter, and in the course of that time have used hinges and screws—the prisoner knew I had been a carpenter—we once worked on the same job, and my father also—he was a bricklayer at that time—I do not know how long the prisoner has had this shop, I think from July to November.</p>

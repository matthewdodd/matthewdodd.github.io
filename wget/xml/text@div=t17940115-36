               <p>I am a servant to Mr. Kirby. The prisoner was tried here in September sessions last, for stealing an handkerchief, and was convicted, and received sentence to be transported.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure as to his person? - Positive. On the 6th of January I had orders to convey him with nineteen others making twenty in the whole, to Portsmouth; last Monday was a week we went with the coach, when I got about thirty-four or thirty-five miles, he was missing when I came to Farnham, I never missed him till I came to Farnham, for I was inside of the coach with six others; I believe Farnham is thirty-four or thirty-five miles, he went in what they call the basket, belonging to the stage coach, in the same coach in which I was, he with seven others, making eight in all were in that place, there was six on the roof, and six withinside with me; when I came to Farnham I went to give them a little beer, by way of nourishment, being a cold night, I found him and another missing, by examining their irons, I believe it was about one o'clock in the morning; I gave every possible alarm that I could at that time of the morning, I continued on the journey with the eighteen others, and delivered them safe.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you hear again from him? - On Sunday last one of the officers, that apprehended him, came and informed me that he had apprehended one of the people that got away from me, and I went to the New Prison, there I saw him; I have not the least doubt in the world but this is the same man.</p>

               <p>I am an officer belonging to the office of Shoreditch, in Worship-street; I was present when the prisoner was taken, we had a coach and took him down to New Prison that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they receive him there without a commitment? - Yes, I left him there as a night charge. On Monday he was carried before the magistrate, and on Sunday I went and informed Mr. Owen.</p>
               <p>Q. In what parish is this Rosemary-lane? - In Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. If you please to consider if any gentlemen had found opportunity to make their escape they would have done the same. The guard behind the coach was fast asleep, I made my escape with no other idea than to serve my Majesty, I asked before to go for a soldier, and the Recorder that tried me, would not grant it me, I went at first to Deptford, to go on board a King's ship, and they would not take me, and I went to Rosemary-lane, and enlisted for a King's soldier to go to the East Indies, I did not do it for any intent than to serve his Majesty, either by sea or by land.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose company did you enlist? - With Mr. Mozelle, I was taken out of his house, I was in bed when they came for me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Kirby. They don't enlist into any company, only for five years, to serve in the East India company's settlement, and under no particular officer.</p>
               <p>Court to Armstrong. Was he in bed? - Yes, he was with another man.</p>

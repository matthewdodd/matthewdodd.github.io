The boy Cummings was in my service—I have seen this brush; it is mine—it is iron-bound—I saw it safe on 18th June, about the middle of the day, and missed it next morning—I spoke to Cummings about it; be confessed it, and said he sold it for three-halfpence—at the station he said something, and I went with the officer to Garcha's, and saw him—his house is a private house; there are a few things in the window—I went in by myself, and asked him if he had any old paint brushes for sale—he said he would look, and he found an old one covered with paint, but it was not mine—I said it would not suit me, and asked if he had any more—he said, "No"—I went out to the officer, who was outside, and went in again with him—I then asked Garcha if he had bought a brush of a boy Over</p>

                  </hi>. I am footman to Mr. Henry Philip Hughes, of York-street, Portman-square. On the 19th of May the prisoner came with note to Mr. Hughes—I took it up to Mrs. Hughes—I was up about four minutes—Mrs. Hughes found it was a begging letter, and told me the knew nothing of him, and she could not think of relieving him—if she had, she would have relieved him—he came again at nine o'clock with an<lb></lb>other letter—I went up stairs with that, and as I was going up the stab, I went to ring a bell to call one of my fellow-servants to take it into the drawing-room, and saw the prisoner unhook this cloak from the hall, and go off with it—I followed him—he threw it down an area in York-street—I still followed, and took him.</p>

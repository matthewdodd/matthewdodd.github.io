            . I keep the Hertford Arms, public-house, Little Grosvenor-street. I bought these things at various times of the prisoner. They came together to 13 l. or 14 l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you include the articles the prosecutor sold you in the amount - A. Yes. I was altering my house, and sent my carpenter to buy the things of Taber.</p>
               <p>Q. You was not in the way when they came to search your premises - A. I was out collecting money, I returned at night. About twelve of the prosecutor's men frequent my house. I knew nothing of the search until I returned.</p>

            . I am a coachman. On the morning the things were found, Tetsall asked me to move the things to a house opposite, which he had bought, and was repairing. I had taken two or three boards and some sashes, and was going with more, when Mr. Taber's men came and claimed them. Plank took me in custody.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to Tetsall's, there was some confusion at the door - it was ten o'clock. The prosecutor's man had stopped the sashes from going out. I asked Dennison if he had moved any? he denied it, and I took him in charge. He then said he had moved some sashes and shutters by Tetsall's direction. I found a pair of sashes and some shutters there. I then searched Tetsall's house, and found six sashes and a piece of timber with Mr. Taber's name upon it, in the spirit-cellar; we found three mantle-pieces, and various other boards, which the prosecutor claimed. Tetsall called upon me, and expressed himself ready to attend before the Magistrate, which he did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were the sashes in the other house concealed - A. No, there were lodgers in the house.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>- I am a shoemaker. Tetsall sent me one morning for some sashes he bought of the prisoner, at No. 68, Lower Grosvenor-street; I went and saw the prisoner in the passage, and he delivered them to me. I went another time, and he delivered me some more sashes.</p>
               <p>MR. TABER re-examined. The prisoner never paid me for the sashes he sold him.</p>

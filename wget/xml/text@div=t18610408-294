                  </hi>. I am a gun manufacturer, and have a factory at 3, Union-row, Tower-hill—the prisoner was an under worker for us, in the employment of a man of the name of Clode—on Wednesday, 28th January last, I missed twelve musketoon barrels and a quantity of other brass that</p>

               <p>had been stripped from different finished guns—at that time the prisoner was at work in my factory—in consequence of some information I received from Messrs. Devey and Vale, brass-founders, in Shoe-lane, I went to their premises—I there saw two barrels and identified them as part of the number I had missed on the 28th—in consequence of something I heard from them I went to a person named Shea, and Shea and myself went to one of my factories, where the prisoner, together with other men, were waiting to receive their work, and he identified the prisoner as the lad that had sold him the barrel—I called the prisoner into the counting-house and taxed him with it—he at first denied it, but afterwards admitted it—he said he had been led into it by another man of the name of Harvey—the value of the two barrels is about 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>.

                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner's statement before the Magistrate was here read, as follows:</hi>—About the beginning of last month I went upstairs to go to work; I saw Daniel Harvey outside the door with one of the barrels in his hand. I asked him what he was going to do with it; he told me to mind my own business, and told me not to say anything about it, as he had bought it at half-price. I met him again in the evening and he brought the barrel with him; he said he would give me two or three shillings to sell it. I asked him if it was his own; he said "Yes," and if I said anything about it he would put a knife into me. Mr. Shea bought the first, and the last one I took he</p>

               <p>refused, and I brought it out again to Harvey, and he told me to take it home with me—I would not, and left it in his care—he came two or three days afterwards and brought a note with him and told me to take that in, and that would do, and if they asked me where I brought it from, to say it was my master's.</p>

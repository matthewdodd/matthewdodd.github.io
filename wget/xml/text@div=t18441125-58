I desired him to take some goods of my master's to Mr. Cordings, about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon—there were thirteen coats, three pairs of leggings, two pairs of trowsers, and one pair of boots—I put an invoice with them—I afterwards received the invoice and the receipt from Mr. Cording—the prisoner told me at Guildhall where the remainder of the goods were, and I found they were where he told me.</p>

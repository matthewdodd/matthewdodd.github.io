               <p>Q. What was the amount of the notes you made up - A. 2,946 l. I made the entry from the notes themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there one for 10 l. No 9000 - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Is it your own entry - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Turn to your entry, and tell me the two 10 l. notes, 535, and 629, what bank were these notes - A. That I cannot tell. They must be either the Barton or the Tamworth bank; I do not know which.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, look for the 5 l. notes, I shall confine myself to seven of them; 5,938 - A.

The box was directed to Messrs. Peal's Harding, and Company, printers, Tamworth. When I had made up the parcel, and put it into the box; I put the box into the back accompting-house.</p>

It went out of the house. When I parted with it for them to take it to the coach it was quite safe, and the same as when I made it up.

I have no doubt it is the box; it bears the number 16, which corresponds with the entry in my book; that is how I know it to be the same; to the best of my recollection, I received it about six o'clock, it was to go with the coach at seven o'clock.</p>

               <p>MR. STONE. I am the coachman of the Chester mail; I was so on the 19th of April, 1813. I remember that box being in my coach. I drove the coach to Redbourne. Redbourne is twenty-five miles from London. I did not observe the box broken at all; I had not time to examine it; I got up in an hurry. I took up a person at the Royal Exchange; he said he was in the habit of going by the Glasgow mail, and as they were gone could I accommodate him to Hadley-high-Stoke, and then he could walk the remainder of the way to his own house. There was no one in the coach when he got it, not till I came to the Peacock, Islington; that is a house we all stop at; and at the Peacock I took up Mr. Wilson. I put the person that came in the coach at the Royal Exchange, down at Hadley-high-Stoke. Mr. Wilson had to go forty or fifty miles.</p>
               <p>Q. Did anything pass at his going away - A. No; he turned down the Hatfield-road. Mr.

             I knew before; he is a respectable gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. Look round, and tell me whether you know the prisoner - A. I do not. It was nearly his size as possible, but his features I cannot recollect. He was dressed in dark clothes, or black.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did you come from the Exchange to Islington - A. By Moorgate, and up the City-road. I delivered the coach to Hope.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got your way bill - A. I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put down all the passengers, and the one to Hadley-high-Stoke - A. I did not; the other I put down.</p>
               <p>Q. That is shoulderage - A. Yes.</p>

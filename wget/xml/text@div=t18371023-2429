                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Thomas Poile. I had his child in my arms in Great Suffolk-street, Borough, on the 20th of Sep<lb></lb>tember—her name is Martha Poile—she was twelve months old last Au<lb></lb>gust—she had a coral necklace on her neck—I was coming home from the Borough, and was just by Mr. Lloyd's, the carpenter's gate, when all at once. I felt something shoved against me—I turned my head round to see what it was, and the prisoner had got the necklace in his hand—he had got it off, and ran down John-street—I never saw him before, but I am certain he is the person—I cried out "Stop thief"—he was followed, and a young man ran after him, but came back again, as he had left his shop—there was no one with the prisoner when he took the necklace, but there were two more on the opposite side of the way, who had been in company with him, and one of them was taken—I did not see them speak together.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow. I saw Marsh with a child in her arms in Suffolk-street, about eleven o'clock in the forenoon—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner cross from the side of the road on which I reside—I was coming out of my own door—he crossed over to the side on which the girl was, followed about two hundred yards behind her, then closed with her suddenly, took the necklace from the child's neck, and ran off—I ran across the road to try to take him, but he turned into a street, and was pursued by a butcher's boy—I called,"Stop thief"—but he was not taken that day—I had seen him in the neighbourhood before, and knew his features very well,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable. On the 20th of September I saw the prisoner in the Borough, opposite St. George's Church, with two others, as near eleven o'clock as possible—they turned back from the church, and came towards Suffolk-street, all three of them—I followed them—they followed a gentleman about three hundred yards, then left him, and went up Suffolk-street—I saw them following Susan Marsh—after following her a few yards, my attention was taken by something else, and I heard a cry of" Stop thief "—I saw the prisoner run away, and the other two cross the road—the prisoner passed the girl, and ran down John-street—I went across, and seeing a mob, thought they had stopped him, but they had not—he got away—I went in the direction the other £ro took, and took one of them—I did not see any body take any thing from the child, but I saw them all in company close to the girl.</p>

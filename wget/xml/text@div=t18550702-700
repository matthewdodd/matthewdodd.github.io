                  </hi>. I live at Middle-row, South, Knightsbridge, and keep a coffee house; the prisoner is my wife. On 13th June she came home about 12 o'clock at night; she had been drinking, but was not drunk—I asked her how it was she was so late in—she said she had been after some dress—I said, "I cannot allow this, and I shall not take you out if you have been getting a dress to go out"—she had gone out about 6 or 7 o'clock to take up a servant's character, and that would not have taken her above two hours—she was perfectly sober when she went out—when I said this to her, she replied, "If you won't take me out, you shan't go out, for I will burn your trowsers;" and she ran up stairs to fetch them—she brought them down, and I prevented her from putting them on the fire—there was a fire burning in the kitchen, and she would have put them on the fire, if I had not prevented her—she then took up the cups and saucers, and smashed them through the windows; she broke six or seven windows—she then tried to run up stairs, but I prevented her, because I had some money up stairs—I got before her, and she was not able then to get up stairs—I saw a knife in her hand; she must have got it from the bar—there was a struggle between us for me to prevent her going up stairs, and I found I was wounded in the back, right on the shoulder bone—I cannot say whether she struck me, I was so flurried, seeing her with the knife, but I found myself wounded—I turned round and saw the knife in the hand of a car<lb></lb>penter, who was at work there—I bled very much—I remained in the house about a quarter of an hour, and then went out to look for a surgeon to get my wound dressed—my wife was in the house during that time, and saw the state I was in—I said, "Look how I am wounded; look how I am bleeding"—she made no answer—I said to the man who was in the house, "Go and fetch me a surgeon"—no one did go, so I put on my coat and hat to go myself; the carpenter went with me—my wife followed us in a short time, and overtook me—she did not do or say anything for some time—I still went on, and she said, "Come back, you shan't go;" and then, when we had got just beyond the police, she struck me in the eye with her fist—I was very weak at the time—the effect of the blow was to swell up my eye, and I had a very black eye—the policeman then came up and inter<lb></lb>fered,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185507020033"></xptr>
               <p>and ultimately took her into custody—I went to St. George's Hospital, and have continued to go there nearly up to the present time; I do not suppose I shall have to go any more, I do not suffer much pain now—I have to state that my wife is a very good wife when she is in her sober senses, and if I could only keep her at home, no man could have a better wife—she is a good industrious woman—I am sure she could not be in her right senses when she did it, because she is always so different when she is sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at the prosecutor's house on the night of 13th June, when the prisoner came home—I heard a few words occur between them, and I turned out of the house—I did not want to hear their affairs—I returned in a few minutes and found a glass lying on the floor, which I took very little notice of; I walked into the coffee room to my work, and after a few minutes I heard Mr. Ohatten say, "I am wounded"—I went to the foot of the staircase where they were, and saw the prisoner lay the knife on the counter—I picked it up—I afterwards went out with Mr. Chutten, intending to go to the doctor's—his wife followed, and as soon as she over-took him, I left.</p>

                  </hi>. I was house surgeon at St. George's Hospital on 13th June, when the prosecutor came there about 1 o'clock in the night—he had ft cut above the right shoulder bkde, about three inches long, and between half an inch and an inch in depth; it did not go to the bone, it was a large serious wound, but not likely to be dangerous to life; such a knife as this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) might have done it—he has been three weeks under my care, and is still an out patient—the wound has not yet healed—he also had a black eye.</p>

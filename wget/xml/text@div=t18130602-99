I asked her what she had got in her pocket; she said, nothing but her own. I searched her; I found on her two five-pound notes, one two-pound bank notes, and three one-pound notes, all bank notes; twenty-eight shillings in silver, and twenty-five duplicates; two of them were for eight silver spoons, each of the duplicates for two table and two dessert; one was in Chandler-street and the other in Jermyn-street, and a duplicate of a watch I found. I went to the pawnbroker in Chandler-street, and in Jermyn-street, and I got six spoons at another place, which she had left for safe. I found a gold seal and a gold key upon her; the seal and key were owned by Wait; a silver watch I found in her pocket, that was owned by Broad, the servant girl; and in looking over the duplicates I found there was not the quantity of spoons that Mr. Hall had lost. I asked her where the remainder of the property was. She told me she, would take me to a shop where she had left it for sale. She said her master should have all his property back if he would forgive her. I told her it was not in my power to promise her that; I would tell her master of it. She took me to a cook's-shop, there she demanded a large bundle of wearing apparel of different description, which she had left there. I took the bundle under my care; then she took me to a shop in Marybone-lane; it is a kind of sale-shop where they buy second-hand plate. She went in, and asked Mrs. Manuel for the plate that she had left. I went in with her; six spoons were delivered to her; two table, two dessert, and two gravy spoons; she had them delivered to her. I took them out of her hand. No other property was found. These things have been in my custody ever since, all that is here present. I put her in the watchhouse a little before five. I apprehended her a little before four. I went down to Mr. Hall with the property that I had in my possession. Mr. Hall said his servant was robbed also. I did not know it then. Then William Clayton stated that he had been robbed of two five-pound notes. I produced the notes; he said he believed they must be his by the numbers. I went to the pawnbrokers the same evening, taking these spoons with me. These are the duplicates that I found on the prisoner. I recovered a watch by these duplicates. the property of Wait; a gold seal I found on her person; four silver table spoons and four silver dessert spoons I obtained by the duplicates. That is all I know.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Hall. Look at your own things - A. The spoons have my initials all of them; I believe them to be mine; they are worth ten pounds.</p>

               <p>Q. to Clayton. Look at the note - A. I can only swear to one five-pound note. I took it at the bankers; I know. It by the number, it is in the bankers book; the book is here.</p>

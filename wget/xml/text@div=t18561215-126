                  </hi>. I am inspector of letter carriers in the General Post-office. On 3rd Dec. I made up a letter, addressed to Mrs. James, No. 2, Steers-court, Barbican—that is in Aldersgate-street district—I inclosed a sovereign and a shilling—I had marked them before I put them in the letter—I sealed the letter, and placed it in the box in the Post-office, in the usual way, having first put two stamps on it—I put it in the letter box in the large hall, about a quarter past 4 o'clock—I gave directions to Lubbock to bring me that letter, and he brought it to me within five minutes of the time I put it in—I afterwards gave that letter to George Green, one of the sub-sorters, next morning, and gave him directions what to do with it—the prisoner was employed on the morning of 4th Dec. in sorting the letters for the Aldersgate-street district—the letters are sorted before they come to him, and he divides them between the three men on that district—the prisoner delivers in that district; he, and Abbott, and Steele—this letter would come in the delivery of Abbott—the prisoner was engaged in dividing these letters from a quarter past 5 till about 7 o'clock that morning—I think on that morning they would leave to go to their districts about a quarter past 7 o'clock—the prisoner divided the letters to Abbott and Steele, and each of them would arrange and tie up his own letters—before Abbott left the Post-office that morning, I sent for him, and examined his packet of letters—the letter which I had sent was not in it—I think the prisoner bad-left before I examined them—I gave instructions to Smee and Roberts to watch him—in the course of that morning Smee showed me the letter which I had put in the Post-office the day before—it was unopened—I opened it that day before the Magistrate—I found in it the sovereign and shilling which I had marked—it was a test letter—there is no such person as Mrs. James that I know of—this is the letter, and this is the money—at the time Smee showed me this letter, he also showed me a letter directed to Mrs. Bryant, No. 37, Edmund-place, Aldersgate-street, London—that letter was in Steel's delivery—it was posted at Bath, on 3rd Dec.—it was in the Post-office, London, on the 4th, and would come into the prisoner's hands, and it was his duty to put it in Steel's parcel.</p>

               <p>those which he has to deliver himself—"Aldersgate" was marked on the letters—there are three boards, Nos. 1, 2, 3, at which those three persons would be making their arrangements—up to a quarter past 7 o'clock these arrangements would be going on, and then they would go on their delivery—I do not know that, after making these arrangements, the prisoner would have to go somewhere else for a minute or two—he had to clear packages for delivery—those packages are larger than common letters, and it would be his duty to clear away those in the course of the morning—that was his duty, not the duty of the other two—his letters would remain there till he had done that—he would go, leaving his letters, to do this—it is in a direct line—the other two sorters would be in their places while he was away—the time occupied in the delivery of these letters would be usually within the hour, and after that they call for a card, to show that their delivery is com<lb></lb>pleted—it is a common thing to have letters not delivered, and they are taken back in the bag in which they take letters out—I believe there was one other trap letter put out—it was in that lot which he passed over in it's proper course—no other person is engaged in sorting these letters but these three persons; they receive them all.</p>

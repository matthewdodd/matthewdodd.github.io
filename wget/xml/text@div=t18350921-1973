                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife, and have been so thirty years. I lived with him till within these two years—I have been with my son, but my husband slept at home—we have not been on very good terms for some time past—on Wednesday night, the 5th of August, my husband came home about ten minutes before eleven o'clock—my son was then out, but he came home in a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes—my husband fetched some beer—he went into the shop and got a couple of eggs, and some wood to light the fire—he beat the eggs up in a basin—he did not go out of doors for the eggs—they were in my son's shop—he did not say what he was going to fetch—he fetched the eggs and the beer without saying what he was going to do with them, but I knew when he was beating the eggs up what he wanted—I thought he wanted a little egg-hot—I thought he had a cold—I put part of the beer into a saucepan and put it on the fire—I afterwards mixed the beer and eggs together, and simmered them over the fire, and poured them out into a jug—I went into the shop then to serve a customer, leaving nobody but my husband in the room—my son had not come in then—I was absent from the room two or three minutes—when I came back the egg-hot was poured out into half-a-pint glass, and a half-pint-pot, into two separate vessels—I told him I did not want half of that—I saw it was poured out for me—he made no reply—he drank his, which was in the half-a-pint cup—he did not offer me which I would take—he never said a word; and at that time my son came to the door—I let him in and offered him some of the egg-hot—he took two sips of it, and I drunk the remainder myself, except about two table-spoonfulls, which I left at the bottom of the glass, and put the glass on the mantel-piece—after that I rinced out the glass in some water, and threw the contents out into a clean pan which was on the table—there was nothing in the pan before—It was quite clean—no one had come into the room but my son—I went to bed soon after—my husband went to bed before I drank it—I was taken ill about an hour after I was in bed—I had not been to sleep—I found myself so ill, my stomach and bowels were dreadful—I was very sick and my bowels were very bad—I had a great deal of pain in my stomach—I never had such a feeling before—I have been dreadfully ill in my bowels and stomach, but never to equal that—It was a very sharp pain, and I was all in a heat and perspiration—I continued ill</p>

               <p>for nearly a fortnight—I was sick during the whole of the night, and Vomit<lb></lb>ted throughout the night, and continued to vomit for a week afterwards—my bowels were very much affected, and I was obliged to get out of bad many times in the night—In the night when I was so violently ill, I said, "Good God! what have I had, what have I taken?"—my husband's answer was, "There is always something the matter with you"—I do not recollect that I had fallen asleep before the pain came on—he got up in the morning about half-past five o'clock, and did not say any thing to me, nor ask me how I felt my self—he did not speak a word to me—he did not speak to me during the whole of the night, except what I have stated—he went away to Somers'-town—I got up about six o'clock and came down—I found something had been put into the pan—my son told me he had vomited on it—I took care of the par till Mr. Edwards came—I gave him the pan—before I gave it him I observed a sediment like white powder at the bottom of it—I emptied the pan, leaving the sediment at the bottom—I showed that pan and sediment to Mr. Ed<lb></lb>wards—I remained in the room till be came—I continued ill for a fortnight—I find myself a great deal better now, but I am a little poorly at times.</p>

I am the son of the last witness, and the prisoner I keep a shop in Devonshire-street, Lisson-grove—my mother has lived at my house for some time—my father came there, and slept with her—they have been at variance for some time past—on Wednesday night, the 5th of August, I came home and found my father and mother in the house—I saw a glass on the table when I came in, with egg-hot in it—my mother asked me to partake of a little—I drank about a couple of table-spoons of it—my mother partook of the remainder—after she had drank, I saw her pour a little water out of the kettle into the glass, empty it into a clean pan, and then place the glass on the mantel—piece—she left the room to go to bed, and then I went to bed directly—about half—past four o'clock in the morning, I was seized with vomiting, very badly—I got up and vomited a little into the same pan—I retired to bed again—I vomited twice, but the second time I did it in the pot, in the bed—I felt a very</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Crawford-street. I was sent for on the 6th of August, to Mrs. Banbury in the morning—I did not go until about ten o'clock—I found her labouring under vomiting and purging—after asking if she had taken any thing in the way of food to disorder her, she produced to me a brown pan, at the sides of which were sticking some white powder—I scraped it off with my nail, and took it home with me—I did not try any experiment with it, till nearly a fortnight after—I deposited it in the mean time in my desk, sealed up—I then ascertained it to be arsenic, to a certainly—I have some of the powder in my pocket now—that was about the 22nd or 23rd—After I had done that, I apprised Mrs. Banbury and her son what it was—I had not seen the prisoner then—I saw him on the evening of the day after I tested the powder, and explained to him what I discovered the powder to be, and suggested to him, that rather than let the thing come before the public, if they could come to terms, to separate—I advised him to separate—he at first rather accused me of acusing a separation between him and his wife, but then he acquiesced in it and left that night—It might be past ten o'clock—arsenic is a deadly poison in the form we have it—If it was put into liquor and drank by a per<lb></lb>son, it would poison them—a small quantity would produce sickness and purging, vomiting would no doubt bring up part of it—that would in a great measure prevent its deadly effect, especially if only a small quantity was taken—a few grains remaining in the stomach would be sufficient to pro<lb></lb>duce death—I did not take home above twelve or fifteen grains—I took home as much as would kill two people, but I did not weigh it—I tested about half of it, and have six or seven grains here.</p>

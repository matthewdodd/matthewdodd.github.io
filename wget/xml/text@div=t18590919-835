I am curate of the parish of St. Ann, Westminster—the prisoner was employed as a teacher in the evening school there—a fund is subscribed for the benefit of the schools, and the Reverend Nugent Wade, the rector, is the treasurer—he signs the cheques as they are required; but when he goes out of town he leaves them signed in my hands, and I give them up as required—previous to 4th June the rector had signed five cheques in blank in this cheque-book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I was to fill them up as occasion required—I kept the cheque-book locked up in a cupboard in the vestry, and if I filled up any cheques I used the book in the vestry, on the table—the prisoner had sometimes access to the vestry, and I remember on one occasion he was there when I used the cheque-book—in consequence of something I saw in the bankers' pass-book I examined the cheque-book, and found that a cheque had been taken out, and the counterfoil as well—this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of those signed by the rector—it has been filled up in the prisoners writing for "Sundries, 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—the sundries for the month of May had been paid on 4th June, but not to that exact amount—the prisoner was taken in custody in July or August—I went to the police-station and saw him, and in order that the charge might be taken, a question arose as to the amount of the cheque, which was not present, as I had to send to the detective for it, and the prisoner said, "I had the money; the amount was 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—he said he had spent the money in going to Scotland and Ireland about some property which was somewhere about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think—he had absented</p>

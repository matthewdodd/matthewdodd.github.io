About 12.30 on Monday morning, 23rd June, I was called to 8, Osborne Buildings, Bermondsey, and saw the deceased John Rowland; he was insensible, and appeared severely injured—he was lying on the floor of the back room—there was a bruise on his face, extending from his eye to his chin—I sent him to Guy's Hospital, and on the same afternoon, about 5.30, I went to Blackman Street, Borough, and took Charles Hooper in custody—I told him he was charged with causing the death of John Rowland—he said "I am very sorry, I did not think it would come to this; but Rowland began it"—on the Tuesday, I took A. H. Hooper, at Great Suffolk Street, Borough, and told him he was charged with aiding and abetting and inciting Charles Hooper to fight with Rowland, whereby Rowland came by his death—he said "All right, I will go with you; it is a bad job"—I afterwards took J. E. Hooper, and said the same to him—he said "All I did in the matter was, I said 'Give it to him, Charley'"—I took Cecilia Rowland next day, Wednesday; she was the deceased's wife—he was then dead—I told her she would be charged with the same offence as her two brothers, namely, aiding and abetting them to fight—she said "There has been a deal of false swearing in the matter"—I believe the male prisoners are brothers—two of them had been before the Magistrate; Cecilia might have been present.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 6, Osborne Buildings, and am assistant to a hop merchant—I know the prisoner Joseph by sight, and have seen Cecilia once or twice—I know that two or three of them lived in Osborne Buildings, but I did not know what their names were—I had seen the deceased, but did not know his name—he lived at 8, Osborne Buildings—about 11.30 on Sunday night, I heard shouts and scuffling of feet outside No. 6, where I live, on the first floor—my brother-in-law lives below—I ran out, and heard Cecilia screaming out "Pay him, Charlie! give it to him! give it to the b----! murder him, he deserves it! the b—told me to go and f—myself!"—I saw Charles Hooper fighting with the deceased; they seemed to be struggling together, and the deceased fell on the back of his head, and lay there—it was a severe fall; you could hear it at the top of the buildings, I should think—when Cecilia said "Give it to him! pay him!" Charles Hooper said "Yes, I mean paying him," or some expression like that, and Joseph and Harry were then shouting out "Pay him," and "Give it to him"—I went and helped the poor fellow up, and put him against a fence; and Mr. Turpin, who knew him, said, "Rowland, you are not fit to fight that man; go indoors"—Rowland made a sort of murmuring noise—I believe it would have been all over then, but Cecilia began inciting the men again—she said "Pay him!" and "Murder him! he has wanted it for seven years; give it to him!"—that called my attention off, and when I looked round again, I saw the deceased and Charles Hooper struggling to<lb></lb>gether again—they both fell together, the deceased underneath—Hooper</p>

               <p>was lifted off him by, I think, A. H. Hooper, and then the deceased got up without any assistance—I saw Charles Hooper strike him several blows, but did not see that they were returned—after that, Rowland was bleeding from the left side of his face; the blood spurted out—his eye seemed all bruised and bloody; his nose seemed bleeding, and there was a scratch on the right side of his face—they then had another struggle, and Hooper struck Rowland on the side of his head half way, and he lay there and seemed senseless—I picked him up, and put him against the fence, where I put him befere, and told him to go indoors, where I live—almost imme<lb></lb>diately after that a policeman came and took him indoors—Charles Hooper disappeared when the policeman came—during those three struggles, Cecilia was crying out most of the time, not all the time—the other two were also calling out—the deceased was drunk, and incapable of taking care of him<lb></lb>self—Charles Hooper was sober, as far as I could see—it was when the policeman took the dead man into the house, that Cecilia said "The b----told me to go and f—myself"—she also said "He has been waiting for this for seven years, and now he has got what he richly deserves"—Charles Hooper struck him, I should say, quite twenty blows on his face and body; it might be more or less.</p>

The first round I saw was about two minutes after I went out—although I use the word "fighting "and "round, "I swear that I never saw Rowland strike; he was so drunk he did not know what he was about—I saw him defending himself, putting his hands in this manner, but I did not see him strike a blow—I did not see the first of it, but what I saw lasted ten or twelve minutes—I did not during that time go away to fetch the police—I picked up Rowland, and other people picked up Charles Hooper, who might have been down more than once, as there might have been more rounds than I saw—once he was down in the second round, he went down on top of the deceased—I picked the deceased up, and invited him to my house, and left him in conversation with my brother-in-law, Turpin—I daresay Rowland knew he was struggling, and trying to fight somebody—No. 312 conducted him into his own house, and left him there.</p>

I was there about twelve minutes—I cannot say how long after I went there I saw him first, I was excited; I believe he was there when I picked the man up, when he fell on his head, because I had some conversation with him—about fifty people were there, a regular crowd—my brother-in-law was at a fence which divides our court from his—A. H. Hooper was urging it on; I believe he said "Give it to him, Charley! pay him I"—some of the people cried "Shame!"—Joseph was saying "Go it!" and "Give it to him!"—I heard Cecilia shouting before I went out; the window was open—I believe there was another round before that, before he got the death-blow on his head—I most decidedly swear that another round took place after I heard Cecilia scream out what I have said!</p>

                  </hi>. I was house surgeon at Guy's Hospital on 23rd June—John Rowland was brought in at 1 o'clock in the day, insensible—his wife was with him—his left eye was swollen and blackened—there were grazes on his left cheek, and a bruise on the left side of his head—he was taken into one of the wards—I could see ha was dying, and he died five or seven minutes after he cams in—his appearance was that of a man who had his skull fractured—the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> was made by Dr. Goodhart.</p>

                  </hi>, M. D. I am surgical registrar at Guy's Hospital—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem examination</hi> of the deceased on 24th June—the head was much bruised on the left aids, and also on lbs hack and on the right side—the skull was broken oh the right side, and one of the vessels was torn across-there was a large clot of blood between the skull and the membranes covering the brain—in my judgment the cause of death was pressure of blood on the brain—the slot of Wood closely corresponded with the fracture—a heavy fall wish the head on the ground might cause it—as far as I could judge from appearances, he was a healthy man; ail liver was very healthy—his age appeared twenty-eight or thirty-one.</p>

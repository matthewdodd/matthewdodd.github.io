                  </hi>. I am an officer of the Sheriff of Middlesex. The prisoner was in my custody two or three months back, for debt—he requested me to release him—I asked him on what security, and he tendered me a bill of exchange—I told him I would not take it unless Mr. Clotty would put his name to it, knowing Mr. Clotty to be a friend of his—some hours afterwards he produced the bill, with Mr. Croat's name in it—I took it with the understanding that he was to redeem it again in a short time, and I released him—I afterwards showed it to Mr. Clotty—it is not here—I do not know where it is—I gave it to a person named Thompson, who paid me the money a few days after I received the bill—I do not know whether the prisoner had then been charged with knowing the bill to be forged—it was not due when it was paid—I had seen the prisoner on passing his window, between the time the bill was given me, and its being paid, but I had no conversation with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Clotty, of Sergeant's Inn. Of the 24th of July I saw Thompson, the officer, at Mr. Croat's—the pri<lb></lb>soner also came there that day, but not in company with Thomson—the prisoner said he was sorry for it—I had not charged him with forgery, nor had any one else in terms—there was a general conversation—I wanted him to go to Mr. Croat's Chambers—he said, "You cannot detain me—I said, "I know that, but if you attempt to go away, I will give you in charge."</p>

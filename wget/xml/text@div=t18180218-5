On the 5th of February, between seven and eight o'clock at night, on my coming home my daughter gave me information, I ran out and saw the prisoner at a hatter's window in Tothill-street, about three hundred yards off-there were several others looking at my knives, which the prisoner had in his hand - I seized him and another, and saw him drop the knives out of his hand. I gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>ISABELLA DAVENPORT. I am the daughter of the last witness. About seven o'clock I heard a noise at the door, I came down, saw the boys round the window, and a pane of glass broken; I saw the prisoner put his hand in and take out the knives. I did not see the window broken. I am certain the prisoner is the boy. I had seen the glass safe half an hour before.</p>

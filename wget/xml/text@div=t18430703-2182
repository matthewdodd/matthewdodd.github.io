                  </hi>. I am beadle of Covent-garden market. Last Friday night I was coming home from Hatcham races, in the Old Kent-road, about nine o'clock, with Phillips and four or five others—as we came along the road by Hatchard-street, Kent-road, I saw the prisoner and several others standing on the footway—Mott was in advance of our party, and said, "Now, gentle<lb></lb>men, just move out of the way, so that we can pass"—they did not move at the moment, and he tried to force himself through—a person immediately struck, him in the face—that caused a general confusion and row—I was forced against the wall—the prisoner held his fist over my head, and said, "I will knock your b----y head off"—previous to that I felt a tog at my watch, which was in my pocket, but that was not done by the prisoner—one of my friends got out of the crowd—I immediately called "Police," and as he was coming along with the policeman the other parties made off—the prisoner turned round to get away—I collared him—a mob came up and pushed against us till the policeman came and took him to the station.</p>

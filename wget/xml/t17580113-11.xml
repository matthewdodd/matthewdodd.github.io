When it is sold, we send it out in carts. Since the 20th of July we have lost eleven sacks full of flour from the wharf, at different times. On the 15th of December I was alarm'd by the dog in the house, at about two in the morning; the watchman call'd to us to come down, and said they had taken a thief. I went down, and they had got the man at the bar in custody. We saw a boat just under the wharf, with a pair of sculls in her. Whatever is stole must be carried off by water, for we are lock'd up forwards. We found a coat lying upon the sacks on the wharf, which the prisoner denied being his coat, but the justice ordered him to put it on, and it fitted him very well. He was committed to New-Prison, and a search warrant granted to search his house. I was not there, but the constable brought a parcel of sacks, which he said he found there; they are here in court.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see his wife first?</p>
               <p>Hunt. Not till we were before the justice.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Where-abouts is your wharf?</p>
               <p>Hunt. It is betwixt Irongate and St. Catherine's.</p>
               <p>Q. In case any thing is lost are you responsible for it?</p>
               <p>Hunt. I have paid for several things that have been lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the marks of the sacks that were lost since July ?</p>
               <p>Hunt. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. How were they mark'd ?</p>
               <p>Hunt. One was mark'd H. H. two I. C. F. two E. T. one I. F. two W. D. two S. W. and one J. Bell. There is a factor in town that sells the flour, his name is Walton.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner taken ?</p>
               <p>Hunt. No, they had him in custody first.</p>

            . I am Mr. Hunt's housekeeper. I saw the man at the bar, on the 15th of December, about two in the morning, standing by the side of the tier of flour. I went and call'd the watchman, and when we came, he had got on the top of the flour, where we took him. There was a boat made last to a lighter, close by the wharf, with two sculls in her. I found a coat very near where the prisoner was, laid down on the sacks of flour. We took him before the justice, and had a warrant granted to search his house. I was a the searching it. We found one sack nail'd up against a window, and eight betwixt the bed and the bedding. (Produced in court.) I have heard my master say many times before this, that he had lost eleven sacks.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Look at these sacks.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I can speak to five of them; the others I cannot. Here is one S. W. one I. F. one E. T. and two I. C. F.</p>
               <p>Q Do you swear to them from any particular knowledge, or from the marks ?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I would be understood: I do not swear to them, I say they are the marks of several dealers that had sacks lost at our wharf. I don't swear these are the identical sacks. Every man has his particular mark. There may be a great number of sacks mark'd with one of these marks, that do not come to my wharf.</p>
               <p>Q. How many sacks do you apprehend to be Mr. Walton's ?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Here are two; they come in the Colchester vessels, and are mark'd I. C. F.</p>
               <p>William Sturges. I am a waterman; my boat was stow'd very safe on the 14th of December, about seven o'clock at night, on the upper side of Catherine-Stairs, and the inside of all the boats.</p>

The justice had given me an order to bring the person or persons with me, in whose possession I found the sacks, so I brought the prisoner's wife before him.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the prisoner?</p>

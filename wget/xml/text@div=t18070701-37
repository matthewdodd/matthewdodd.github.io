             of Bow employed you to bring any thing for him. - A. Yes, one hundred quarters of malt from Rotherhithe, from Mr. Northcote's; and forty-five quarters two bushels, from Messrs. Sawyer and Williams; I gave Briscoe the order to fetch it, and to hire sacks for it. On the 23d of April, in consequence of information, I told Briscoe that he had sold Mr. Cherry two quarters of malt; he replied, I know I have; he said he had it over at Northcote's; I asked him if he had hired the sacks on my account; he said no; he gave me the sack ticket for two hundred and ninety sacks.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the sack hire ticket that was delivered to you. - A. It is; he told me the sacks were in the barge's hold. I went and brought four sacks marked R W out of the barge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you understand from Briscoe they were the sacks that delivered the malt to Cherry. - A. I did; he said he supposed Ward's men had by mistake put four sacks too many; he said he threw the sacks down at Northcote's, and he supposed they filled them.</p>
               <p>Q. So then you understood from him that he threw down four sacks too many, and Northcote filled them four sacks by mistake. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any more sacks in the barge. - A. No, not when I took them out. I saw Mr. Cherry about two or three days after I had his conversation with Briscoe; as soon as I accosted Cherry I said to him, I wish you would not buy malt of my man; he said he knew he bought it and they had a right to it, as it was over, as they had put up four sacks more than the quantity. I sent the four sacks home to Mr. Ward, and I had a return ticket for two hundred and ninety-four sacks. I saw Briscoe the next day, I told him that I should acquaint the parties with it; he said I had better let it drop. When I spoke to Cherry, he said he bought it fair enough in Halliday's tap room, they had a right to all that was over, as they paid for all that was lost; he said we wanted it ourselves, or else we should not make that stir about it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in the trade of barge master. - A. About three years; I never heard of any such practice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you want that corn, or should you have brought it home if you had seen it. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mrs. Ingleton by at the time you had these conversations. - A. Yes, she said if there were no receivers there would be no thieves; he replied that he wanted it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. You are the owner of this barge. - A. No, Mr. Hearn is the owner, I am not a free lighterman.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not go to Rotherhithe. - A No.</p>
               <p>Q. You know nothing of what was delivered there. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing that was passing at the time the barge arrived. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the two prisoners. A. Briscoe has worked for me about twelve months.</p>
               <p>Q. He was about leaving you at this time. - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. He was leaving you to go to a person of the name of Kettlewell, in whose service he was when he surrendered to meet this case. - A. I understood he was going there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you know he was there. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He was a very good servant. - A. He certainly was.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does Mr. Northcote live. - A. In Rotherhithe, Surry.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Mr. Cherry. - A. I have known him nine or ten years, he is a corn<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180707010036"></xptr>

               <p>Q. You learned this on the 23d of April, how soon did you communicate that which had been told you by both the prisoners. - A. I told several people of it, Mr. Bradley and Mr. Phillips, some few days after the 23d; I never communicated it to Mr. Carry nor Mr. Hodson.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after this was the prisoner apprehended and taken before a magistrate. - A. Either a fortnight or three weeks after.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was the first time that you made any application to a magistrate. - A. As soon as ever Mr. Hodson heard of it; about a fortnight after it happened; it had been talked of in the neighbourhood, and Mr. Hodson heard it, he communicated it to Mr. Northcote; we went before sir D. Williams to get a warrant, he heard our story and refused it. Then we went to Worship-street office, we had a warrant granted us there.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 20th of April last, did you deliver any malt to the prisoner Briscoe for Mr. Hodson. - A. I delivered one hundred quarters in sacks; he came in a barge, and brought the sacks to receive it, a hundred quarters of malt would fill two hundred sacks, I was present at the delivery, I did not count the sacks; I wrote a note for the delivery of one hundred quarters, that is the note; I gave it to Briscoe to carry to Mr. Hodson, (the note read), it was pale malt of a very good quality. I afterwards went to Cherry's, she brought me a handful of malt, which I really believe to be of the same quality of that malt I sent to Mr. Hodson.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the price of it. - A. Seventy seven shillings a quarter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Pooley. Be so good as to tell us the mode that is pursued at your malt house, to prevent more malt from being delivered than is ordered. - A. When the barge comes to the wharf; when the people are at leisure they go into the barge and fetch the empty sacks, which are in bundles of twenty sacks each bundle; these are carried into the malt room, and there told over, then they are doubled up in one fold; and the twenty sacks is laid open and reversed, to denote that is for ten quarters; when they have told out two hundred sacks, then they tell out two hundred strings to tie them; they are told out the same as the sacks, and laid twenty strings in a bundle; then the delivery note of an hundred quarters is given to the bargeman, to take to Mr. Hodson; Briscoe goes from my malt house down to the barge; the sacks are filled and delivered to him.</p>
               <p>Q. This was directed by you for the purpose of preventing any mistake or fraud. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If this had been pursued, is it possible for more than two hundred sacks to be delivered. - A. It is highly improbable; I was present at the whole of the delivery, my being present if there had been any more than the regular quantity, I believe I should have seen it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you count the sacks yourself, or stand over your servants while they counted them. - A. I believe the sacks were counted previous to my going into the malt house.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore whether they had been counted correct or incorrect, you had not any opportunity of knowing. - A. I should distinguish that while the malt was filling in the sacks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you count them. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you cannot be able of your own knowledge to say whether they filled two hundred or two hundred and four without counting. - A. I think I should without counting.</p>


               <p>Q. How soon after the delivery of these sacks, did you receive any information. - A. The first information I received was from Mr.

Yes, in the month of May he came to me in consequence of having been charged with buying this malt; he said he had not purchased the malt; he observed, that if he had purchased the malt, he should not have thought it a crime, as the sweepings of the barge were the perquisites of the men.</p>

I cannot say; he said he was accused of having purchased stolen malt, of whom he did not say; he said if he had purchased it, he should not have thought it wrong, as the malt was the sweepings of the barge.</p>

I had, Mr. Billings was present; I told Mr. Cherry that I heard that he had bought two quarters of malt of Mr. Baker's bargeman; I said I thought it was wrong of a man like him to buy malt of a bargeman; he said he had a right to buy it, as the man had got it over; I asked him what he gave for it, he did not tell me; I asked him if he gave as much as three pound a quarter for it; he said he gave more, he would not tell me how much; he said that Mr. Baker only was angry that he had not the malt himself, and the reason why the man did not let Baker have the malt was, because he knew he never should have any thing for it.</p>

            . I am an officer of the Thames police; I went to Cherry's house and got the malt. I produce three sacks.</p>
               <p>Briscoe left his defence to his counsel.</p>
               <p>Cherry's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury - I rejoice at the day having arrived that I hope to be restored to peace and honour by your acquital. On the 22nd of April Briscoe was on shore at the Dog and Partridge; I called in the public house to look at the paper, when he informed me that he was going to leave Mr. Baker's lighter and that he had also some malt to sell I asked him if it was his own; he said yes, and he would sell it to whom he pleased; I then said let me have a sample if I like it I will give you a fair price for it I found the malt was tolerably good but mixed; I told him I could not give him more than seventy shillings a quarter for it. On Friday the first of May I paid him seven pound for it and took a stamp receipt for it; a few days afterwards Mr. Baker told me I had bought some malt of his man; I most readily told him yes I had. My servant will prove that it was done most publickly, it was brought along the public road into my shop-door, no concealment being made nor requested by me; and my personal surrender before the magistrate to give evidence to prove my innocence, and shewing a sample of the malt to Mr. Northcote, and offering to give it up before the magistrate; my keeping the malt seven weeks, when I might have removed it, must also afford a demonstration of my innocence. Gentlemen, some of you may censure me of being guilty of imprudence, and that you would have acted otherwise; but, gentlemen imprudence is not guilt; and for my imprudence already my punishment is more than I can bear; already to become the companions of felons in guilt, and to expect the taunts of my enemies, which your acquittal cannot prevent. As to my own fate I have suffered more than death. I have a tender wife and two infant daughters, which I love; it is for them I am anxious; it is for them you must decide.</p>
               <p>Briscoe called eight witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Cherry called sixteen witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

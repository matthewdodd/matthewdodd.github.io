On the 17th of October, in the evening, about seven o'clock, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179010270096"></xptr>had only a few friends, and we were laughing and merry, and my wife was not well, and went up to lay down; this prisoner went to the next door, and went over the water tub and over the wall, and having a few nails in his pocket, he scratched a hole in the wall, and got up to the window; there was a little dog in the room, and he barked, and the prisoner tumbled down and broke the parlour window; I opened the door, and said, the maid has broke all my china basons, and the prisoner ran into my arms; I said, what business have you there? he said, he came in there, and he owned he came over the wall; he had some nails in his pocket; I saw the holes in the wall; he did not rob me of any thing; I had sixty-four guineas up stairs, to pay my brewer, and the landlord; the prisoner had worked at my house before that; the holes in the in the walls were fresh made.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it candle-light at that time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you go with him to the watch-house? - Yes, and I saw the nails found upon him.</p>
               <p>How high might your bed-chamber window be? - One pair of stairs; it is but a small house; the prisoner was a carpenter, and had worked there five or six weeks before.</p>
               <p>Mrs. SOLOMON sworn.</p>
               <p>I am wife of Mr. Solomon: I was extremely ill that night: I went to lay down: I went up with a candle, which I never did before: that man must have been in the yard when I went up stairs: and I had not laid above a minute before I heard a window open: I could not think it was mine, and I heard the window open a second time, and my little dog barked, and the man fell down, and Mr. Solomon caught him directly, and I called out, that that was the man: he said, no, no, Mrs. Solomon, I beg you will not say so.</p>
               <p>Did you see the man, or any part of him. in the room? - I cannot justly say: I could not see him absolutely, because it was in the dark, and the window was open.</p>
               <p>It was so dark that you had no view of his person, then? - No, Sir, I could not swear to his person.</p>
               <p>Did you see the man, or any part of the man, within the room? - No, Sir, I can swear that the man gave the second jirk to the window.</p>
               <p>But you do not know that his body was within side the window, or any part of it? - Then, gentlemen, there must be an acquittal.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Charles-street, Middlesex hospital. The prisoner was my errand-boy, and I trusted him to feed my pony, but as I suspected the pony did not get all the corn he ought, I watched the prisoner—he came in from an errand on the 12th of October, and I sent him with the usual feed to the pony—it was one quart of oats and chaff mixed—I followed him to the top of the mews where the stable is, and I shortly saw him come out with the basket on his arm, in which he had carried the feed—I followed him to his home, in Union-street—I then went back to the stable, and the pony had no corn in his manger—I took a policeman and went to the prisoner's—I there found the basket with some oats and chaff mixed, similar to what I had sent him with, and besides that I found a bushel of the same mixture.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He never allows the horse half food to eat—I have many times given him a quart of corn out of my own pocket—that he found was my father's—my mother said, "Why don't you give this to your mas<lb></lb>ter?"—I said I thought it would offend him. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I allowed my pony two feeds a day, morning and night, and occasionally a third, accord<lb></lb>ing to his work—this is the second pony I have had, and they have fallen away.</p>

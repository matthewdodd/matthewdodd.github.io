               <p>Madan. He swore before Sir John that I was not the man.</p>

               <p>On his cross examination he said it was on a Saturday, about a quarter after ten at night; that it was darkish, but that he could see the men; that he was more frightened afterwards than at the time; that he described them to the Justice, but did not see them for five weeks after the robbery; that he had no doubt about the men; that he, (the prosecutor), lived with are Mr. Willoughby at Islington.

On the 9th of April Brannen was drinking at my house, the Lion and Lamb in Golden Lane, from between seven and eight o'clock till he went to bed with one Conner; he lodged between nine and ten weeks with me; he went to bed about a quarter before eleven; Brannen and Conner lay together.</p>

I was at Mr. Fife's the Red Lion in Whitecross-street some time in April last; there was a wager laid between me and Brannen about his shewing me two guineas; the wager was given for me; Brannen would not pay it; at that time the coat was produced, Brannen cliamed it; Madan said he would not return it to him till he gave me the half guinea; I saw it afterwards on Madan.

               <p>Beckenham. No, I never swore any such thing.</p>

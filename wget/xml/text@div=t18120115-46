            . I am a shopkeeper, No. 1, Camden-place. On Thursday morning the 16th of this month about nine o'clock, a woman came into my shop and said, Mr. Hawkins do you know whether Mrs. Blogg is gone to market; I said, I did not know, she generally left the key with me; she said there was a strange man in her house, she did not like<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150042"></xptr>the looks of him; I ran to Mrs. Blogg's house, I saw the young man in her shop, I asked him if Mrs. Blogg was at home, he answered no, but he had seen her, and she would be at home presently. I asked the prisoner what he had got in his apron, he said he had got something for Mrs. Blogg; I told him I was very sorry of accusing him wrongfully, but I was afraid from his being in the house without any body with him it did not look so well, and as there was so many people coming about the house I said, young man, you and I had better go over to the public-house and stop untill Mrs. Blogg comes home, and if it be your own property that you have got in your lap, it will be more to your credit. After a little while I said there will be no harm in seeing what you have got; he took it out, and a little girl saw it, she said that is Mrs. Blogg's gown. A constable was sent for, he was searched, four keys were found on him and two knives.</p>
               <p>- BELLINGER. I am an officer. I produce a gown, I took it out of the prisoner's apron; I searched him and found these four keys on him, and here are two keys that were found in the house by somebody else, they are skeleton keys. This key locked the door, and two knives I found on him.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. It is my gown.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave any body in the house when you went out - A. No, the lodger and my husband were out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There was only one key found on me.</p>
               <p>Bellinger. I found four keys upon you, these are them.</p>

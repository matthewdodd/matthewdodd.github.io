Upon seeing them go towards her, I drank my beer, and then went after them. I went round another field, and laid myself down behind the hedge facing her: there I saw one of the prisoners hold her hands fast, and the other taking things out of her pocket. Hatchett said, Now, d - n your eyes, you bitch, if you do not give me your stays, I will cut your throat. Upon that the prosecutrix called out, For the Lord's sake, leave me my stays; but they repeated that again; upon which she called out, Murder. Hatchett answered, If you squall out murder, d - n your eyes, you bitch, I'll cut your throat. Upon this, I jumped over the hedge to them, and said, You have been robbing the poor girl: upon that Hatchett came up with a pen-knife, and said, You Jew bugger, what is that to you? Upon seeing the knife, I ran away for assistance: I ran and fetched Mr. Congreve. Upon his coming up, he found them together.</p>

I saw a person get over the railing from the drying-ground, with a parcel - he went under a shed, and then into a brick-field - I followed; I touched him on the arm, and said, "What have you got here?" he dropped the bundle and ran off; I cried, Stop thief! I cannot swear that the prisoner is the man; he took a kind of circuit round the field; I took up the articles, and took them to Mr. Griffith's.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far were you from the person you think was the prisoner? A. Fifty or sixty, or a hundred yards; his back was towards me as he ran past me - I had never seen him before that I know of - I had an opportunity of seeing him for about half a minutes; I did not see him drop any thing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know the person of the man? A. I believe it was the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about it? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, was it, or was it not, the prisoner? A. Yes, that is the man who ran by me - no one was running after him - I did not see Groves that day - not to be confident it was him.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you see John Groves that day? A. No, Sir, not to be positive it was him; I saw nobody pursuing the prisoner; I do not know who cried Stop thief!</p>

On the 18th of July I was at Mr. Griffith's, waiting for my wife, and the groom came in and said, there was a person waiting about the back-ground - I went and took the prisoner; I asked how he came to take these shirts and the shift; he said he did not - but when I got him up to Mr. Griffith's stable, he owned it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was there any thing said before he owned it? A. I said it would go hard with him if he did not tell the truth.</p>

On the 8th of July I was playing at skettles at the ground of a public-house - I pulled off my jacket and hung it on a nail; the prisoner was there - he was a stranger; I missed it when I had done playing; suspicion fell on the prisoner, as he was the only one who had left the ground; the landlord gave him in charge - my tobacco-box and knife were found in his pocket; they had been in my jacket pocket; I have not found the jacket.</p>

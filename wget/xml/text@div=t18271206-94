On the opposite side of the way, I saw the prisoner take a handkerchief from the gentleman's coat pocket, and cross the road, towards me; the gentleman, and another who was with him, both pursued the prisoner; he threw the handkerchief down; I took hold of it. I did not see the prisoner taken - I saw him at the watch-house about half an hour after.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you in the watch-house? A. Yes; I did not hear what name the gentleman gave.</p>

            . I am an officer, and was in company with Phillips on the 21st of September; I saw the prisoner, in company with another, following two gentlemen; I saw the prisoner take this handkerchief from the gentleman's pocket, and then cross towards us; I suppose he saw us, and threw it down: I ran to the spot, and took it up. The prisoner was secured almost immediately, by a street-keeper. I have taken a great deal of trouble, but cannot find Wells, the other man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You prosecuted this boy last Session? A. I did. I have stated every thing. The gentleman gave me his name as

            ; I did not ask his address: he appeared a very respectable man - the watch-house-keeper took his name down. I went out in pursuit of the prisoner at that time, as he was not brought in. I did not, to my recollection, swear on the last trial, that I knew the prisoner to be a bad character before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not swear it in your oath? A. Not this boy - I never knew him before. I believe he was tried on a Monday, towards the evening; the Judge told me I might prefer another bill if I thought proper, and I considered I was bound to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say to any body, that it was in consequence of the way you was treated on the trial, that you preferred this bill? A. Not, to the best of my recollection. I think the Grand Jury were discharged on the Wednesday, and I believe it was in the early part of the day; he was discharged from here - I took him up the night after the Sessions; I could not get the copy of the indictment to prefer the bill on Tuesday. I went from here to Mr. Stafford, who made out the bill, and I went before the Jury - I could not force them to have the bill; I told Mr. Clark I had preferred another bill, but the prisoner had been discharged on the evening he was tried. I think they told me he was discharged an hour after the trial.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say to one of the prisoner's relations, that you preferred the second bill because you considered yourself ill-treated on the last trial, by his counsel? A. No - that I swear positively; I never said so, I swear positively, to any body, nor any thing like it; nor did I swear I knew him to be a boy of bad character.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that Sir

             let the prisoner out on bail, saying it was the most scandalous thing he ever heard? A. I can vouch safely, if I was to die before I moved, I never knew he was out on bail till yesterday. Phillips appeared on the last trial.</p>
               <p>JESSEE PHILLIPS re-examined. Q. When did you hear the prisoner was to take his trial to-day? A. I heard nothing about it till I was sent for this morning, about twenty minutes past nine o'clock. I never knew any thing against the prisoner. Whittingham did not, to my knowledge, say on the last trial, that he knew the prisoner to be a bad character - he knew Wells to be so; to the best of my belief he did not say so of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Are you in the habit of walking with this officer at night? A. Yes - to detect persons of this description.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to WILLIAM WHITTINGHAM. Q. Is the street-keeper here? A. No, nor the watch-house-keeper. I believe his Lordship told me on the last trial I ought to have had them here. The Jury did not request that I should not have my expenses - on the contrary, they desired I should have them, and I had two days allowed me.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know the prisoner? A. Yes, upwards of seven years. I am a broker, and live at No.29, Great St. Andrew-street. I was one of his bail, for 50l.</p>
               <p>- WILLIAMS. I am the prisoner's sister. I never saw Whittingham till I went to him, to inquire where my brother was - that was when he was in Newgate last time; I saw Whittingham the night he took him the second time, directly after: he said he was ordered by Mr. Sergeant Arabin to find another bill, and he was compelled to do it by his conscience. Phillips said, "Bill, you can't lock him up;" he said, "I will take him - I am compelled to to take him;" Phillips said, "If you do, I am blowed if I appear against him, unless I am dragged - you see the lad is going to work." He had worked for his father, as a plasterer, before he was first taken, till within three weeks, and he was still at home till he was taken away.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever hear the name of Wells? A. Not till my brother was taken. I saw him in Newgate when my brother was taken.</p>

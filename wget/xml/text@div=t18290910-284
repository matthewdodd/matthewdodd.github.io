            . I am the prosecutor's son. On the 20th of July a person came into the shop and asked for 50l. worth of French money - I counted out forty-five Napoleons into my hand and laid them on the counter; I turned to my desk to reckon what they would come to, and the person who came for them said he would step into Birch's and take something while I made the account; the prisoner then came in, seized a handful of the Napoleons, and ran off - I called my father from the back shop, and jumped over the counter - I pursued the prisoner down Pope's Head-alley and Lombard-street to the Mansion-house; a person I knew, of the name of Finch, was coming by, he saw I could hardly catch him, he caught him, and brought him back - the prisoner was running: Finch is not here; I took the prisoner to our counting-house, and went back to Pope's Head-alley to look for one Napoleon he had dropped, but it was gone; he had the rest of the money on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Were they in your possession? A. They were on the counter close before me; I did lose sight of the person who took them for perhaps half a minute or a quarter of a minute - he ran two hundred or two hundred and fifty yards before he was taken; it was about five o'clock - there were a great number of persons about - our dwelling-house is in the parish of St. Michael, Cornhill; the Napoleons were within half a yard of me - they had not been paid for.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Had there been any bargain between you? A. No.</p>

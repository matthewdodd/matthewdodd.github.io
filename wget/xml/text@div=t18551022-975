On 25th Sept., the prisoner came there about 8 o'clock, I served him half a pint of beer—he put down a shilling, I picked it up, and sounded it on the counter—it sounded very well—I tried it with my mouth I found it bad, and called my father who was in the kitchen—he came in, and I gave him the shilling—the prisoner was still there—my father told him it was bad—and he said, "Give me that shilling, I will pay you for the beer"—my father kept the shilling.</p>

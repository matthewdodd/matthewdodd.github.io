The two pri<lb></lb>soners were at my bar drinking, on 19th July, about half-past 7 o'clock in the morning—I caught Carlisle's hand in the till with money in it—he had five or six shillings in his other hand—he appeared to be quite sober—I held his hand fast, and told him he had been robbing me—he said he had not, and he threw the money that he had in his right-hand on the counter, and said, "If you think that money is yours, take it"—I told him that was not all, and he pointed to Condon, and told me that Condon had got it in his</p>

                  </hi>. I am a ham-salesman, and occasionally buy on commis<lb></lb>sion. I live in Elliott-square, in the Old Bailey—I was at the Noah's Ark, about half-past 7 o'clock in the morning on 19th July—I saw the two pri<lb></lb>soners in front of the bar—I was smoking my pipe, and Carlisle winked his eye at me—I took no notice, but presently I heard Mr. Cridland say, "You have robbed me"—I saw him try to seize Carlisle's band—his band was not in the till then; it was towards the top of the counter—he said, "You have robbed me," or, "The money came out of the till" or something to that effect—I saw Carlisle pass money to his right-hand, and pass it to Condon, and there was a sixpence dropped—the money was then put on the counter—I took the sixpence up, and marked it—I said, "It is a shame for a man to be robbed like that;" a short time before, Condon had asked me if I had any tobacco—I said I had not much, but I would give him the means of getting it, having seen him before—he said he had no money.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Carlisle. Q.</hi> Will you swear that you saw me give him some money out of my hand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; out of your right-band—during the time you dropped the sixpence—I saw your hands go to each other—I got the sixpence from the counter, where you dropped it in passing the money to him—I was at the door when the policeman came—I did not hand him the sixpence; I took it to the station—you did not appear to me to be very drunk; you might have had a pint or two of beer.</p>

Q.</hi> Where was I standing when Carlisle had his hand over the bar? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By the side of me—my back was to the door, and you were on my side—I had not been drinking with you all night—I did not hear 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-worth of gin called for—I showed the sixpence to you both when I bad marked it—I did not bite it when the inspector asked me where it was.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 327.) I was called to take the prisoners—the landlord charged them with robbing the till—I took them to the station, and searched them—I found on Carlisle two half-crowns, two shillings, two sixpences, and two pence; and on Condon, one half-crown, three shillings, two sixpences, and one penny in different pockets of his coat, the same coat he has on now—Carlisle had the money in his waistcoat-pocket,—I got this sixpence from Mayes—it is marked by a bite of the teeth, and it is bent—Condon appeared sober—Carlisle appeared to be drunk; but it is hard to tell, because parties very often sham drunkenness—he appeared to stagger a little; but when he got to the station, he could answer the questions put to him very well, like a lapwing.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Carlisle's Defence.</hi> The money found on me belonged to myself; I worked hard for it for a long time; it was my right-hand that was over the bar to get a light for my pipe; I had no money in my hand; all I had was in my right-hand, which I put on the counter; if this man marked the sixpence, why did he not hand it to the policeman when he came to the house? it is mere spite.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Condon's Defence.</hi> I went in the house that morning, and met the witness and another man; Carlisle was not there then; they asked me to drink, which I did; after their pint was out, I paid for another pint, and so it went on till half-past 6 or 7 o'clock; I went to sleep, and Carlisle took this money out of my pocket; I thought I had more than the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which he had got; he said, "All right; we will have a drop of gin;" I said, "No, I have had enough to drink;" I was then talking with the witness about a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> he had had in Stonecutter-street.</p>

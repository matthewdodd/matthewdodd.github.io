               <p>Had you fastened them when you went out? - I fastened them before I went away, and locked my door; I bolted my window about five o'clock.</p>
               <p>How was it broke open? - It was pulled open, and the bolt fairly off, and the window was open; there were six panes of glass in the half-sash, and it was fairly open.</p>
               <p>Was the glass broke? - No, the glass was not broke.</p>
               <p>How could they pull the window out without breaking the glass? - They pushed the window up, and left it wide open; I went and opened the street door, and unlocked my parlour door, and the people in the kitchen brought a light, and I missed three sheets immediately, and a shawl from off the line.</p>
               <p>What reason have you to impute this to the prisoner? - He was the person I saw in the court.</p>
               <p>You are sure? - Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Was there light enough to describe by a certainty that he is the man? - I met him just by the lamp, and gave him the wall, and was going to speak, but was afraid.</p>
               <p>Did he appear to have any thing on him at the time you met him? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Did you hear of your property again? - I did, last Thursday was a week, a person came and told me it was in the advertisement.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. You say, as you was coming home, you met a person, but you declined speaking to him? - Yes, I did; he was a tallish man which I met first, and when I went a step or two farther, I saw the prisoner,</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen him before? - I had not.</p>
               <p>Therefore you had no reason to remark the man? - No; still I thought it odd for one man to come before, and another behind.</p>
               <p>You never had seen them before? - No, never in my life.</p>
               <p>This was on Sunday? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Are you sure it was so late as five o'clock in the evening? - It was six o'clock when I went out, and I came back a little after seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Had you left any body at home? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many persons had you left in your house? - Nine persons; there were people in the kitchen, in the one-pair of stairs, and two pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>What are they? - They were all married people, and all of them got husbands living with them.</p>
               <p>You have not a single person in your house? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you call to any of these persons to shew them how your shutters had been broke? - I did; the people of the kitchen came up; I cried out, my God, my God! what have you let me be robbed?</p>
               <p>Did you let no one else know immediately that you was robbed? - Yes, I told it to another woman who lives in my house, who has got an husband; he does not come home to sleep.</p>
               <p>How soon did you tell her? - Directly.</p>
               <p>Have you any of these persons here that you gave the alarm to? - No, none.</p>
               <p>Then whether you went out earlier or later, we must rely on yourself for the truth of it; do you know it makes a difference as to this charge, whether it is done in the light? - It was done when it was dark.</p>
               <p>Do you know that it is a capital offence if the matter is done when it is dark? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That it is a burglary then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then in this house of yours there are nine people living in it, they are all married<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080017"></xptr>women, and it is not true that your house is visited by people not married? - Sometimes servant maids, out of place, are there a week or two, till they are provided.</p>
               <p>Has there never been any enquiry at your house after young apprentices that come after single women at your house? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Was there never an enquiry after an apprentice of the name of Levi, whom it was said was concealed in your house? - Not that I ever heard of.</p>
               <p>Do you know a man of the name of Holmes? - He has never been above two or three times in my parlour.</p>
               <p>You knew him? - I believe my daughter knew him.</p>
               <p>He visited your daughter at your house? - No, not in my house; I did not admit him into the parlour above two or three times in my life.</p>
               <p>If he did not come into your parlour, he came to your house, did not he? - Yes, but he used to stand at the door, or in the entry; he never spent a pot of beer in my house in his life.</p>
               <p>What became of that Holmes? - He is in Newgate, under sentence of transportation.</p>
               <p>Was there a man of the name of Mantondillon that used to come to your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there a man of the name of Roberts? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And he happened to have the same good luck as Holmes: how long was you acquainted with that man? - I was not acquainted with him; when he came to me, I had a very honest character with him, and he kept to his work, and behaved very honestly while with me.</p>
               <p>Was you never called to account about a pair of silver buckles? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Are you a married woman? - No, I am not; I am a widow, and have been for this six years.</p>

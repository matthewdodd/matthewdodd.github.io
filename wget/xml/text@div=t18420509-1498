                  </hi>. About half-past twelve o'clock on Wednesday, the 6th of April, I was walking along Threadneedle-street, and saw the prisoner in company with a man in a smock-frock, moving about between some gentlemen in a suspicious manner—I kept my eye on them—close to Finch-lane I saw the man in a smock-frock take something from a gen<lb></lb>tleman's pocket like a gold snuff-box—they separated—I afterwards saw the prisoner cross over to the corner of Threadneedle-street, and receive the box from the other man in a very close manner—they were close toge<lb></lb>ther when the box was taken from the gentleman's pocket—I told the policeman—he took the prisoner, and found the box on him—I have not found who the owner of the box is.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a City policeman. I received information from Thorogood, and went after the prisoner—a short man, dressed in a smock-frock, was with him—I took this snuff-box out of the prisoner's hand—I afterwards searched him at the station and found an old knife on him.</p>

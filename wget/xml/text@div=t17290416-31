The Prisoner pleaded he lost Money, and more than the Prosecutor had done; and that he had a Guinea in his Pocket just before the Fray began, and brought the Alehouse-Man, where he had just before been drinking, to depose it. Upon the whole of the Evidence on both Sides, it appear'd rather an accidental Quarrel and Fray than a Robbery. The Jury <rs id="t17290416-31-verdict151" type="verdictDescription">

            .

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. On the 27th of February you saw the cart safe? A. Yes, the coach-springs were not missed, till I saw them in Willow-walk; the cart springs were fixed to the cart - there was one end of them broken off; I know the coach-springs by having them in my hands, not by any mark; I cannot tell exactly when I saw them - it might be a month before Christmas; I did not say at the office that I knew them by the colour.</p>

            . I am a coach-wheelwright, and worked for the prosecutor - I know nothing of the springs; but I know Layton the wheelwright, and I believe the other is a smith. On Saturday night, the 27th, the cart was there safe - we locked it up, and carried the key to Mr. White; about a quarter-past ten o'clock the next morning, I heard the cart was gone - I went up Willow-walk and saw the cart-springs, which I knew by being broken at the end, and having a hole in them -I had seen them in the same state before, and I believe these are the springs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is not that a common place for a cart-spring to break? A. They break in various places; it certainly is a common place for them to break.</p>

             came to sell these springs to me on the 6th of March; he was then alone, but when he brought them, the other prisoner was with him; when he first came, he had a coach-spring in his hand, and asked what I would give him for them; I said 14s. a cwt. was all I could<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150064"></xptr>give - he said he had a pair of cart-springs with the scroll irons on; I said I would not give more than 15s., if they were ever so good - I bought them of him; he said they were his own, and that I had bought of him once before; I supposed he carried on business on his own account.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. And he left them there openly? A. Yes, there was no concealment about them; it is common for smith's to have iron to sell - he gave me his right address; and left part of it against the gate - he said, "I will get a truck and bring the remainder;" it is old metal, and would be worth nothing without being re-forged.</p>

            . I am a Police-serjeant. On the 8th of March, I went to Rodney-court, Chapel-street, Curtain-road, found Withers, and asked him if he knew about the springs sold to Mr. Shutter; he said he did, and he did not care, as he knew where he got them - I followed him into the room, as he came undressed to the door, and then I found the other prisoner; they both dressed, and went with me without hesitation.</p>
               <p>JAMES BROWN. I am an officer. I went with Atfield on the 6th of March, and found all this property, except these coach-springs - I went on the Tuesday to Rodney-court; I searched the back room on the ground floor - I took out the stove, and found this skeleton-key behind it.</p>

No - I have been a coach-master many years; these articles were put by till we wanted them - I will swear I have seen them within three years, because the carriage they belonged to has been broken up within that time; I may have seen them within three months.</p>

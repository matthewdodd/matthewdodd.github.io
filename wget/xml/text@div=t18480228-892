                  </hi> I am a carman, and live at Portland-mews, Soho. On Saturday night, 12th Feb., about half-past twelve o'clock, I was in New Oxford-street, and met the two prisoners—they asked me whether I would stand a drop of gin—they were together, and both spoke at once—I told them it was too late—they said they were very cold—I went with them into a house in St. Giles'—I believe it was 24, church-lane, and gave Tyrrell 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to get some gin—she went for it, and I was left alone with Williams—I am sure she is the person—she kept bothering me to stop there and sleep—I said I would not, I wanted to get away—I gave her some of the gin, and she said I must <hi rend="italic">stand</hi> some supper—I felt rather awkwardly situated, and gave her 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and they want to get some—another person came, who represented herself as the landlady, and demanded 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the room—I said I did not wish to stop these—I wanted to get away—she then said, "3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I said no, I should not give anything, I wished to go—she then went out of the room, leaving both the prisoners with me—as soon as she left. Williams took the poker, and turned to the door, and Tyrrell took a knife off the table—Williams said she would have some money, or she would smash my brains out with the poker, or something of that sort—the other said, if I did not, she would send the knife into the my b—y heart—in consequence of what Williams said, I gave her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Tyrrell said she would have 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said I had not it—she then said 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said I had 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., that was all I had, and I gave it her—she took it, and let me out—directly I got outside I told a policeman, and gave them in charge—they were then in another room—I parted with my money from fear of personal violence.</p>

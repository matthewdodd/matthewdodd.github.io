            . I am a surgeon, and live at Hammersmith. I was sent for on the night of the 31st of July, and sent my assistant; I saw her next morning about ten o'clock - she was much bruised - her left eye was black, and nearly closed - she had a cut over the right eve and another on the side of the head - she complained of much pain over the whole of the belly, particularly the lower part, and her bladder was ruptured - I told her so, and that I considered her in danger; she said she was very bad, and should not be here long; she appeared sensible of her danger; I do not think she thought she was dying at that moment; I was not certain her bladder was ruptured, and did not consider her case as entirely hopeless. I found afterwards that her bladder was ruptured, and that was certainly the cause of her death. She never said she was dying, and could not recover. Her wounds appeared to have been inflicted by a blunt instrument - the cut on the back of her head, appeared as if she had fallen on some broken crockery - she was moved to St. George's hospital that day, and I did not see her afterwards. The rupture of the bladder must have been occasioned by some violence, and the bladder must have been in a state of distension at the time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Could you judge whether she had been drinking? A. No; her falling violently on any thing, with her bladder distended, might occasion the rupture - any very violent concussion would do it - falling on a chair or tub might do it, if she was struck near the region of the bladder; frequent intoxication increases secretion and produces a weakness in the bladder - a fall might do it if the bladder was excessively distended, not otherwise.</p>

            . I am house-surgeon at St. George's hospital. The deceased was brought there on Tuesday evening, about seven o'clock - she complained of exquisite tenderness on being touched on the lower part of the belly, and there was great anxiety in her countenance - I asked how she met with the accident, and from what she said my impression was that she had ruptured some large blood vessel, or the bowels - I thought she would die, but did not communicate that to her - she told me, when I was examining her wounds, she thought she should not live - I think she said so when I first examined her, but I am not certain whether it was before or after she told me what had happened; she died next day about three o'clock in the afternoon. I opened her body, and found the bladder ruptured in two places - that must have caused her death - it must have been occasioned by a violent blow or fall - there were no external marks of violence.</p>

            . I am a stage-coachman, and lodge with my sister in Fulham-fields. On the 31st of July, as I was going home I heard a noise like china and glass breaking; I met my sister, and afterwards went to the prisoner's door - there was a light there, and the neighbours were outside - the prisoner was in the house - I would not let any one go in till he came out to fetch some water - I saw him come out with a pan - somebody lighted him to the pump - I saw his wife before he came out, laying in her blood; he never returned - I fetched a surgeon, and went into the house with him; I had not gone in before - I then saw the woman lying on a pillow down stairs - the blood was washed off her face, but there was a great deal about her clothes; I helped to carry her up stairs, and staid there all night; between three and four o'clock that morning I saw the prisoner by the side of a potatoe field, close to the road, about a hundred and twenty yards from his house - when he saw me he went down the lane, and when he found I gained ground on him he took to his heels and ran like a deer, and jumped over into Mr. Sandall's ground; I called to him, and told him I wanted him - he got over the fence, and gave himself up to me - I asked him what noise he had been kicking up the night before, and told him his wife was dead; he said "I have made up my mind to die for the bl-dy b-h;" I took him to Hammersmith, and gave him to a watchman. When I went to the house a great deal of crockery lay broken on the floor, near the fire-place; he appeared sober when I saw him. When I carried his wife up stairs she seemed very wet with blood.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What coach do you drive? A. I drive the Richmond coach off the stones. Hawkins was with me when the prisoner surrendered to me; he might have heard what passed. I swear I spoke to the prisoner and said his wife was dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not his answer "Good God, that is impossible?" A. I heard nothing of the kind; I did not hear him called an old - when he went to the pump - I did not hear him abused at all; the women called him a murdering thief; I heard nothing else; a great many people had been merry-making at Hawkins' house, and I had gone there, at a quarter to twelve, to fetch my brother-in-law.</p>

            . My husband is a labourer - we live next door to the prisoner. On the 31st of July I was at home all day - I was in bed when this happened - his wife was merry-making at Hawkins' house that evening;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140012"></xptr>I was not there, but I saw her going in and out between five and six o'clock - she seemed rather intoxicated; I believe they lived comfortably when she was sober - she was given to drink.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not he very kind to her when she was sober? A. Never otherways - he is an inoffensive man, and associated with none of his neighbours; I never knew him given to drink; I saw her at Hawkins' between five and six o'clock - she was forward in liquor then.</p>
               <p>COURT to Mr. BOWLING. Q. State particularly what the deceased said on the subject of the accident? A. On my saying I suspected her bladder was ruptured she immediately said he had done it by kneeling on her - I cannot say whether she said he or the villain - I think the husband's name had not been mentioned - something was said to her, immediately afterwards, as to her husband's having caught her with some man in a shed, she said that was false, and when he was drunk he would say any thing. No doubt kneeling on her would have done it had the bladder been distended - taking a quantity of liquor would distend it.</p>
               <p>Mr. RUSSELL. She told me her husband had knocked her down and knelt on her - that would cause the rupture if the bladder was distended.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Could there have been an effusion of the urine without a rupture of the bladder? A. No; if she had fallen on a chair or tub it might have happened, if she fell on her stomach. She was brought to the hospital in a cart, by two females, who left in a few minutes - the name of Sarah Bateman was written over her bed by the porter - it is usual for him to obtain the name.</p>

            . I live next door to the prisoner. On the 31st of July his wife came into my house, about nine o'clock and at two - I saw her in the evening, and about eleven; she had been drinking beer - she was very forward in liquor at two o'clock, and was quite tipsy in the evening; I saw her last at ten o'clock - she was very tipsy, and her child, who is about fourteen years old, was begging her to come home: she had been tipsy nearly all the week; the prisoner behaved kind to her except when she was in liquor; she always said he was a good husband, and kept to his work - and if she could wear gold he would be pleased.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you hear what passed that night? A. I sat up with her, and assisted in putting her into a cart next day, to send her to the hospital, but did not see her after she was there. After the surgeon was gone I said to her "Lord have mercy upon you, you are dying;" she said she thought she should die, several times; I asked if she knew whether her husband stamped or knelt on her; she said she did not know what he did to her - this was about twelve o'clock on the day it happened - there were tubs and chairs in the lower room.</p>

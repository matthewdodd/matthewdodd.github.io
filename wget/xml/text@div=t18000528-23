             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. I am the brother of the prisoner; my brother has been in his state of mind between eight and nine years.</p>
               <p>Q. What has been his general demeanor? - A. He has been afflicted in a kind of stupid, heavy, way, as a lunatick; the first particular thing we observed of him, was, drinking a vast quantity of water; he had a fancy in his head that he was poisoned.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you endeavour to convince him he was mistaken? - A. Yes, but it had no effect, he continued so for near a fortnight; he used to drink four or five quarts of water, one after another, he was confined in St. Luke's twelve months, and was sent away as incurable.</p>

I am a boarding-house keeper, of 3, Neptune Street—on Saturday 1st February, Much came to me between one and two o'clock and told me that Brown was coming with two sailors from the Com<lb></lb>mercial Docks, who had been seven weeks on board the <hi rend="italic">Ann of Cardiff</hi>, and that they wanted board and lodging—he asked me if I would advance the money and take them in to board—lie said that the expenses would be 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each, as they had a cab—Brown brought two men in about half an hour, dressed in sailors' clothes—there were two bags outside the cab—they got out of the cab and came into my house—Brown said he had brought two sailors from the Commercial Docks, and asked me if I would advance them the money for their expenses, and then he wanted 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each for their trouble—I gave the money to Brown—I asked them whether they intended to pay me when they were paid off, and they said "Yes"—in consequence of what they told me, I paid Brown 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—one of the sailors went away the same evening, the other one stopped till 4th February, when he went away—he owed me for board and lodging—I have never been paid—they left the bags in the house, and I found they only contained rubbish—Watkins was not one of te men.</p>

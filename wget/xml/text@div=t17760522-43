               <p>How long did she live after that? - I believe eight or nine days, and then she died.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the condition of her health before that? - She was pretty hearty, but she went out of the house and came in again; she was about seventy years of age: I heard her make no complaint, but she seemed stupid and would ramble; we used to think she made herself wicked; that was about a month or six weeks before she died; she seemed like superannuated, and was very silly about the house.</p>
               <p>No surgeon looked at it? - We never heard a word of it she was so stupefied, and so intolerably wicked she would go into any body's place and rob them.</p>

            ? - Very well.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of any blows that were given her by Tunsted? - Upon the 19th of April she came out of the fore yard, and sat in the upper yard; our window looks directly where she sat; I saw her cap bloody; I sent one of the women, and went myself; I asked her how she came by that, she said her head swam, and she fell against the bed-screw, and that made her head bloody; the women took her in doors, and dressed her head: she was taken ill on the 25th, and continued so till the 1st of May, when she died.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I did not see this old woman till she was dead.</p>
               <p>Do you attend the work-house as surgeon? - No; there is an apothecary attends it; when there are any chirurgical cases that require assistance, they are sent to the hospital; I was called a day or two after the death by desire of the apothecary to inspect her head, as they did imagine it had been the cause of her death; on taking off the cap I saw a small bruise, about the size of a silver groat, exactly upon the top of her head; I took my probe, passed it into the wound, and was very much astonished to find that it went in four inches between the two hemispheres of the brain; I then, in the presence of the apothecary, and some other gentlemen, denuded the skull, by taking off a piece of the scalp; I could not discover any trace of a fracture; the bone was very offensive and very carious about the size of a shilling; I then took out a piece of the bone; I trepanned her; I found the two coverings of the brain were gangreened, and eat quite through; and I undertake to pronounce that that wound, however it happened, was the cause of her death.</p>
               <p>By what sort of instrument did that wound seem to be given? - It might be altered in its appearance by being neglected, that it is hard to say; it must have been by a considerable bruise.</p>
               <p>You have heard that she fell against a screw of the bed, and that she had two violent blows with that stick that broke her head; did it appear to you that her falling against a screw might occasion this? - It might; it must be some hard body that had done it, whether it was a bed-screw or a stick, or what other body, it is impossible to say; it had been of some standing, the bone could not have been so carious, as it was, soon.</p>
               <p>How long would it take to occasion that; might it in three weeks? - Yes, it might; it depends a great deal upon the habit of the body; she was 75 years of age, and wrong applications might encrease it.</p>
               <p>Did you see what had been applied to it? - They told me some yellow basilicon.</p>

               <p>I never struck her at all; that very juncture of time there was another squabble in another ward; she was knocked down, and hit her head against the bedstead, Mrs. Durose knows that.</p>
               <p>Mrs. DUROSE. I gave her a small push, and she fell down against the bedstead and scratched the bottom of her head near her neck, we got a bit of loaf-sugar and put to it.</p>

I had in my pocket about thirteen sovereigns, and a few odd shillings which I had been saving up for the last four months; I pulled a handful out to give him change, and the gentleman sitting on the form who gave his turn away said, "You are well up for money, perhaps you can give me change for this?" I said, "Well, I never took such a thing before, I would rather refuse it;" he then said, "Don't you think it good? you will save me a great deal of trouble." I then took it in my hand, and showed it to a young man in the shop, and asked him if it was good, and he said it was, and another gentlemen in the shop said, "Let me look at it," and he said, "Oh yes, it is good," and I gave him change, and he put his name at the back, and as I had never taken a note before, I did not think of having his address at the back. I then had it in my possession all the morning, and I gave it to a cousin of mine to get it changed; and I took and wrote my own name at the back of it, and he could not get it changed. I kept the note until the next day; I thought when the gentleman asked me if I had seen it, I had some suspicion about it, and told him I had not had it, for fear I should lose my 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."</p>

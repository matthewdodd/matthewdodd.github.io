                  </hi>. I keep The Horns, public-house, in High-street, Whitechapel. The prisoner was my servant—on the 8th of October, between four and six o'clock, I was cleaning the windows, and saw the prisoner go behind the bar—she stopped, and went to little cupboard, by the side of the till, where we keep crockery—at the same times she pulled open the till and shut it to—I heard the money, and rattle, and jump down, and said, "Mary, what have you got in your hand?"—she said, "Nothing"—I said, "let me look"—she would not open her hand—I forced it open, and found two shillings and three sixpences in it—there was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., of silver in the till—she said she was every sorry for what she had done—she was sober.</p>

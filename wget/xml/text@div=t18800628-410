                  </hi>. I am assistant superintendent of the London General Omnibus Company, and am chairman of a committee which investigates all applications to the Company for employment—this letter came to the company. (<hi rend="italic">This was an application from the prisoner for employment</hi>) Two other letters were enclosed in that, in consequence of which I saw the prisoner and drew his attention to the one marked B, which commented with a small "t," and had a small "i" for the singular nominative—I asked him if the document marked A was his writing—he said "Yes"—I asked him if those were his testimonials—he said "Yes"—I said "Are you quite sure?"—he said "Yes, you can make any inquiry you like, and you will find that they are all correct"—I drew his attention particularly to Morley and Powell's, and said that it was utterly impossible for a thing like that to come from a business house in London, and asked him who wrote it—he said Mr. Morley, junior—I said "Are you perfectly certain!"—ho said Mr. Morley stood by him, but the clerk wrote it—I asked him if Gerald Smith's document was genuine—he said yes, and that he had lived in the firm six years as a porter—I said that he had better be careful, for he was placing himself in a peculiar position, and I must make the necessary inquiries—he said that ho was prepared to accept the position on those conditions, and I gave him a situation in the company's service—I saw Mr. Britton, and then went to Warwick Street, but could not find such a firm as Gerald Smith—I then gave instructions for a warrant to be obtained.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had some suspicion at the time he presented the certificates, but notwithstanding that I took him—I should not have done so if I had not thought he was honest, industrious, and sober, as the certifi<lb></lb>cates represented him to be—he did one day's work, and I had not time to think him otherwise than what the certificate represented—he prodnced his conductor's license, to obtain which he would have to produce a certifi<lb></lb>cate of good diameter at Scotland Yard—the thing having been practised before, we probably wished the prisoner to suffer, to make an example of him—the Company is prosecuting this case in connection with another gentleman—I did not tell the prisoner that we should not prosecute him, but that Morley and Co. would, because it was I who applied for the warrant—if there had not been a certificate from Morley and Co. I should not have taken him on his certificate from Scotland Yard—I have never taken applicants for a short time without characters—there is nothing to show that the prisoner is not a respectable man apart from these proceedings.</p>

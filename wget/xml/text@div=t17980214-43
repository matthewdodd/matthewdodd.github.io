               <p>Court. Q. How much money did you mark? - A. Four half-crowns, seven shillings, and five sixpences; the next morning, after marking the money, I went into a room adjoining the shop, and I saw the prisoner go to the till, and take out something, this was about a quarter before eight o'clock; I went and looked at the till, when he was gone to his work, and I missed the half-crown; the night before, I sent to acquaint a constable about it, and desired him to be in readiness at a public house; I went to him, and he came to the house, and searched the prisoner, and found the half-crown upon him, he came about eight o'clock in the morning; he also found a pick-lock key; he took him away, and had him before a Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What was the mark you put upon it? - A. I filed it on the edge; I can swear to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Jackson. Q. Had you marked the money at any other times? - A. Yes, the night before that; but never before that.</p>
               <p>Q. What mark did you put upon the other half-crowns? - A. I marked them with a punch; several were marked with a punch, and two were marked with a file.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. You said, if I understand you right, you had prepared a constable on the preceding night that you were robbed, ready against the next morning? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, I believe, the prisoner is not the first that you have prosecuted for the same offence? - A. Never before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Matthews. Q. Had you any other people about the shop? - A. Yes; we had another lad besides him.</p>
               <p>JAMES KENNEDY sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Marlborough-street office: The prosecutor sent for me on the 11th of January, and desired me, the next morning, to wait at the Duke's-head public-house; I went about a quarter before eight o'clock, and the prosecutor came to me, and desired I would go with him; I went to his father's house with him, and he called the prisoner at the bar out of the work-shop, and he told me that was my prisoner; I asked him what he had been robbed of, and he told me a half crown-piece; I searched the prisoner, and found a half-crown-piece in his pocket; I searched him again, and took a picklock key out of his pocket, it was made of a piece of wire, then I took him to the Magistrate; I have kept the half-crown-piece from that time to this.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Prosecutor.) Q.Look at this half-crown, is this the same? - A.I have no doubt about it, because it is marked on the edge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Q. When you paid him his week's wages it was not impossible that a halfcrown, like this, might be amongst the money you paid him? - A. Very unlikely; I will take upon me to swear that was not amongst the half-crowns I paid him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in his defence.</p>

The indictment was founded upon 13th and 15th sec. of and</hi> 4 <hi rend="italic">Vic, c</hi>, 97; <hi rend="italic">and it was a question for the learned Judges whether the facts came within those sections, or whether they amounted to an offence at common law, A difficulty occurred on the three first counts, founded on the</hi> 13<hi rend="italic">th section, as to the jurisdiction of this Court; it being directed that, upon the Magistrate declining to act summarily, the complaint should be removed to the Quarter Sessions; and upon inquiry, it had been ascertained that the Central Criminal Court did not, as had been at first supposed, possess that jurisdiction. Upon the 4th Count</hi> (<hi rend="italic">founded on 15th section</hi>), <hi rend="italic">the question arose whether the omission to see the signal was such a wilful act on the part of the prisoners as to bring them within the meaning of that section</hi>, <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE CRESSWELL</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">was clearly of opinion that the first three counts disclosed no offence at common law of which this Court could take cognizance; he had certainly supposed that this Court had the jurisdiction of a Court of Quarter Sessions, but it appeared that was not the case, and that the Middlesex Sessions stood in that position. With respect to the true construction of 13th section, it would be well that it should be ascertained whether the omission to see a signal, or, in other words, to keep a good look-out</hi>,</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">came within that section, because, if it did, it would be an offence upon any part of the journey, whether an accident occurred in consequence of it or not. Upon that point he offered no opinion. As to the 4th count, he considered that the omission to see a signal did not come within the meaning of 15th section.</hi>

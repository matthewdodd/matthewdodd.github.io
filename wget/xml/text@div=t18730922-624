I took Hopper—he confessed to me, and on the same day I went with Inspector Dann to Hooker's shop, 39, Com<lb></lb>mercial Road—I took this parcel with me, which Mr. Lewis gave me—I went in and said "Mr. Hooker"—he said "Yes"—I told him who we were, and said "Do you see that parcel"—he said "Yes"—I said "It was pur<lb></lb>chased of you yesterday, this gentleman bought it"—he said "Yes"—I said "How do you account for the possession of it?"—he said "I bought it with other goods of a man named Hopper"—I told him that Hopper was in custody, and had confessed to stealing a quantity of property from his employers, and stated that he, Hooker, had received some of it, and he must consider himself in custody for receiving it knowing it to be stolen, and that I was going to search his place—I commenced searching, and he said "If you will allow me, I will assist you all I can"—he jumped on the counter and kept handing the goods down which are here, and Mr. Lewin identified them—I said "Have you got any invoices or receipts for these goods?"—he said "Yes, I will show you"—he took me down in the kitchen and gave me a file with two bills on it—I said that there were none there and asked him for his book—he said ho kept no book—he also said "Last night I sent all my books to Mr. Batchelor.</p>

                  </hi>. I have a shop in New-street, St. Nicholas, Deptford. On Tuesday, the 6th of December, I left the shop about five o'clock—I bolted the lower and the upper latch—the next morning, about seven o'clock, I found the lower latch was broken, and the staple drawn—it was broken open—I lost a hammer and a pair of pincers—these are them—they were safe that night—I found them at Mr. West's a marine store-shop.</p>

I went after Waldin, and said I came after him for breaking open the shop of Carter—he said, "I know I broke open the shop, but I took nothing away," and he told the Magistrate so—the prosecutor made inquiries, and found the pincers and hammer in Old King-street.</p>

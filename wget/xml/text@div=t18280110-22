               <p>Q. How came you to go that way? A. I had been home, found myself locked out, and did not know where to go - I was walking about the streets - I spent the evening in Frith-street, Soho; just at the top of Bouverie-street, I, received a blow from a fist, on the side of my head, which brought me to the ground - I had not observed any body near me. When I was brought to the ground, a man stood over me, and was pulling at my watch ribbon - I saw but one man; he pulled three times, and each time, the pull lifted my body from the ground, and after pulling me up three times, the bow of the watch broke, with the violence of the pull; he struck my head against the stones each time, and the last time it quite took away my senses; the man got away - I was not able to distinguish who he was; I lay senseless on the ground; I found the prisoner in the watch-house that night. when I came to my senses. I saw my two seals at Guildhall next day, and have not the least doubt of them - they are chased, and have an impression on them; part of the ribbon remained on them - it was the same ribbon as was attached to my watch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Had you been out all day? A. No; I left home in the middle of the day; I had been on business part of the time; I left my friend's house, in Frith-street, between eleven and twelve o'clock; I had no supper. I went down to Covent-garden after that, and saw two women under the Piazzas; one was a woman of the town; the other professed not to be so; they overtook me in Bow-street, about half-past eleven o'clock; I walked with one of them down to Wych-street- I was sober, and swear I had my seals safe then.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with yourself after that? A. I cannot say, for I received a blow in Wych-street, from two men, which took away my senses - I was sober then; I stood talking with the woman. I did not apply to the watchman, for I thought they did it out of a lark, as they ran off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell the Magistrate it was a tall man who stood over you? A. He appeared taller than the prisoner; I cannot tell what happened after I received the blow in Wych-street; I drank part of a glass of brandy and water at one house with the women, and gin and water at another; the blow I received at the top of Bouverie-street restored my senses; I was not intoxicated, but the blow I received in Wych-street took away my senses. I said at the watch-house, that I had lost my watch, but I had not then discovered that it was left.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Whitefriars. About ten minutes after two o'clock, I was sitting in my box, in Silver-street, about ten yards from Bouverie-street - I heard two people scuffling at the corner of Bouverie-street and Fleet-street; I did not go up to them, but in a minute or two I saw the prisoner run by my box, and at the end of Silver-street he turned to the right, into Lombard-street, to get into Fleet-street again; I am sure it was him; I saw him turn to the right again, towards Bouverie-street: I then ran back into Silver-street, and came up with him at the corner of Bouverie-street, meeting him; when I came up I saw the prosecutor lying senseless on the ground; the prisoner was two or three yards from him; when he saw me and another watchman coming up, he calling Watch! and insisted on our taking the prosecutor in charge, for assaulting him; and about a minute after the prosecutor seemed to come to himself a little; he got up, and said to the prisoner, "You rascal, you have robbed me of my watch and seals;" he gave him in charge for the robbery, and the prisoner charged him with the assault - they were both taken to the watch-house; the prosecutor appeared to have all his senses knocked out of him: he had several blows on his head, and his coat was covered with mud. When the prisoner ran by me there was not another soul near, and when I followed him round I saw nobody but him, except the watchman and prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You heard a scuffle, but did not go up? A. No - I did not think any thing of it at the time; the prisoner made a circuit, and came round within three yards of the spot where the prosecutor lay; the prosecutor came to himself; but then his senses appeared to leave him again - he did not properly come to himself till he came to the watch-house. He said at the watch-house that the man who stood over him was taller than the prisoner - the prisoner insisted on the prosecutor being searched; the prosecutor certainly said that the man was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100021"></xptr>taller, but when he came to himself he contradicted that; when he had been about five minutes in the watch-house he said he had lost his watch.</p>

            . I am a watchman - my beat extends from Lombard-court, round to the back door of the Bolt-in-Tun, Fleet-street. I was going towards Bouverie-street, from Lombard-court; a woman was calling,"Watchman, here is a man using a gentleman dreadfully ill;" I ran to the spot as fast as I could, and about ten yards down Bouverie-street I saw the prisoner leaving the prosecutor, who was down on the ground; he ran up to me, and gave charge of the prosecutor for insulting him in the street. I saw no one else in Bouverie-street, nor near; I never saw the street so clear: when he was telling me to take the charge, the prosecutor recovered, and got up; he ran up to the prisoner, who was about ten yards off, and said, "Charge! I will give charge of you, you rascal - you have robbed me;" he did not say what of, at that time; Grimwood came up, and said, "Take hold of him, and we will take them botl, to the watch-house;" on our way there the prosecutor put his hand up, and said,"Oh! my God; I would not have had such a blow for 5l." He every now and then looked round to the other man, saying, "Take care of him - don't let him go;" when we got to the watch-house, the constable of the night sent me on my duty, and I did not hear what passed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you your watchman's dress on? A. Yes. The prisoner ran from the prosecutor to me, and gave charge of him; I was going my rounds; he could see I was a watchman - I had my stick.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not both appear to be in anger with one another? A. Why we separated them; I took hold of the prosecutor - he appeared in a stupid state, not altogether sensible: we walked to the watch-house, which is about one hundred and fifty yards; I kept hold of him, for he appeared not able to walk, and the prisoner had given him in charge; I could not tell who was right - he appeared stupid - I cannot tell whether it was from liquor or injury; he walked steady: a tipsy man generally cannot walk - he did not tell me what kind of a man had robbed him, or what he had been robbed of; he seemed stupid, and out of breath.</p>

            . I am a watchman - my beat is from Water-lane to Lombard-court. I was in the watch-house when the parties were brought there, and heard the watchmen state there was charge for charge; I went to sleep, and paid no attention to it; I awoke, and heard the Whitefriars' watchman state, that he saw the prisoner run down from Bouveric-street, along Silver-street, round to Bouverie-street again; and when I went out on duty, I went and found the seals laying against the step of the door of Carlile's printing-office, in Bouverie-street; there is a strong shade thrown across the door-way, by the gas; they were fastened with a red ribbon: there were two gold seals, a key, and a ring; I took them to the watch-house - the prosecutor was then gone, and the prisoner had been taken to the Compter. The prosecutor claimed them before the Magistrate, in the prisoner's presence.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it two o'clock in the morning? A. Yes; we are on duty four hours, and then sleep for two hours.</p>

            . I was constable of the night. On the 2d of January, between two and three o'clock in the morning, the prisoner and prosecutor were brought to the watch-house; the prisoner said, "Here is charge for charge;" the prosecutor said he had been knocked down and robbed of a watch and seals; Grimwood then stated that he saw the prisoner come up, and go through Silver-street, round Lombard-street, into Fleet-street again. Nothing was found on the prisoner - but after the watch was relieved, Saunders came, and delivered me the seals, with the ring and key attached to a ribbon; the prosecutor had then gone home, and the prisoner was at the Compter. I had searched the prosecutor, and found his watch in his fob, broken at the bow. The prisoner said he was innocent, and said, "I don't think the gentleman has got a watch," and when he was going to the Compter be begged I would search the prosecutor, and see if he had, which I did; it was broken at the bow, where the ribbon fastens, and must have been done with considerable violence. The prosecutor did not know I had the seals till I produced them before the Magistrate - he then said they were the seals he had been robbed of.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He told you he had been robbed of his watch also? A. Yes; the prisoner said there was charge for charge when he came in, but he made no charge against the prosecutor; when the prosecutor first came in he seemed much confused; he said he thought a tall man had robbed him: he had an opportunity of seeing the prisoner at that time - he did not say it was a taller man; he accused the prisoner of it - the prisoner said, "Now, Sir, look at me - I am short, and am an innocent man; let me go about my business." The prosecutor appeared very stupid, as if he was bewildered.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did the prosecutor say in answer to that? A. He said, from the blows he had received, he could not swear positively to the prisoner; he did not say how the man was dressed.</p>

            . I am waterman at the coach-stand in Bridge-street. On the night of the 2d of January I saw the prisoner at the White Bear public-house, Bride-lane; it was nearly one o'clock when I first saw him - the last time was within a few minutes of two, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it gone half-past one o'clock? A. Yes. I saw him at supper there; when the house was shut up he came out of the door - I bade him good night; he went up Bride-lane, towards Fleet-street, and I went to the coach-stand; I left him in Bride-lane; I have known him fifteen or sixteen years - I cannot say what character he bore; I have not come about that.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time would it take to walk from the White Bear to Bouverie-street? A. It is no great distance - I dare say I might walk it in two minutes; I know it was nearly two o'clock, because I could hear St. Bride's clock strike; it had not struck, but it only wanted a few minutes, for the house shuts up at two; it was more than half-past one, for it was one when I saw him at supper in the house; St. Bride's clock struck two just as I got to the top of Bride-lane, in Bridge-street - that was not more than three minutes after I left him - I live in Blackfriars'-road.</p>

               <p>Whenabouts was it? - Last month, about the 15th or 16th I think.</p>
               <p>What day of the week was it? - On Thursday, at about seven o'clock in the evening, as near as I can guess, it might be a sew minutes under or over. I was going down <placeName id="t17791020-9-crimeloc56">Field-lane</placeName>

Jonas caught hold of me by the handkerchief, and gagged me, and the others shoved me along. I clapped my back against the wall, and fought as long as I could. My money was in my left-hand breeches pocket. I had seven guineas, three half-guineas, and about ten shillings in silver.</p>
               <p>Did either of them put their hand into your pocket? - Yes, Hartley; she had a hard fight to get it away. One of them snatched off my hat, knocked the crown in with her hand, and clapped it before my face; they got me down, and got the money from me, and ran away; it was all in a purse. There were five of them, one held the hat before my face, and the others held me while Hartley took the money out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Did the other prisoner do any thing? - Yes; she struggled and hung about me, and helped to pull me down; when they had got my money, they ran into a house a few yards off. I turned my head. I was almost dead; but I saw them run into the house, when I revived a little.</p>
               <p>Did they hurt you any otherways besides holding you? - Yes; so that I have been obliged to have a plaister round my loins ever since. I cannot get out of bed without working my legs up a little first. I went to the woman of the house, and said they were in that house; that I saw them go in. She<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177910200024"></xptr> made answer nobody should search her house without a constable. I went to see for a constable. I could not find one directly. I returned to the house for fear they should be gone. I went with a young lad, and searched the house, and they were gone. I suppose I was not gone five minutes; they were taken by the constable, and brought into his house in Field-lane, the constable searched them, and five pounds all but sixpence was found in Hartley's sleeve; there were two guineas, two half guineas, and the rest in silver. There was no money found on either of the others.</p>
               <p>Was your purse found? - No; the next morning they said before Sir

               <p>Jonas. Whether he did not swear to a shilling that was taken out of my pocket, and afterwards to one that was taken out of my sleeve? - Here are two shillings, he said he knew them both, the one in particular that I took out of her sleeve.</p>
               <p>Jonas. Whether he did not say he could swear to a guinea with a cross upon it, and when you found the money there was no such guinea among them? - I do not remember his saying so.</p>

As I was coming down Field-lane, the constable laid hold of me and took me to the prosecutor; he asked the prosecutor if he knew me; he said he did not; Massey brought me in again, and then the prosecutor said he believed I was one. My witnesses are not come.</p>
               <p>HARTLEY's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I know no more of the affair than the child unborn. I never saw the prosecutor till he came up to a window where I was at work and asked me if I had seen any young women, and said he had been robbed; I asked him if he should know the women again; he said no, but he should be glad to have his money again, and said he would give me a crown to get a constable for him; I went to see for the constable; the constable was not at home; when I returned, the prosecutor was in the alley; the constable came and asked him if I was one of the persons; he said I was; I replied, are not you a wicked man to say that I am one, when you offered me a crown to go for a constable?</p>

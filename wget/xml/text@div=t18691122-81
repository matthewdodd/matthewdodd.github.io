                  </hi>. I live at 64, New Church Road, Camberwell, and am a domestic servant—I have known the prisoner three years and a half—I was not engaged to be married to him, but we were keeping company—on Sunday evening, 26th September, about 9 o'clock, I went with him from any parents to my master's house, and on arriving there I said, "I must go in now, as it is getting late"—he asked me to wait a few minutes, but did not say what for—I waited, and saw him fumbling in his right-hand trowser's pocket, and while I had my head turned aside for a minutes I felt something strike the side of my head—I thought I was shot—I staggered on one side, and saw a knife in the prisoner's hand—he stood still with his hand down to his side and the knife in it—I bled a good deal, and ran away saying, "I am shot! I am shot!"—I only ran the width of the foot-path, and then I fell forwards on my face, and then found him on my back—he tried for my neck, he tried to push my head on one side—I did not see anything, I only felt his hand on my neck—I put up my left hand, and felt a knife go across my fingers—I managed to get away from him by struggling very much, and I got up and ran away across the round—he fol<lb></lb>lowed me, and cut my face here—somebody was standing there when I ran to Mr. Brabury, and the prisoner ran between us and cut my chin while I was trying to get away with my head down—he did not get</p>

               <p>face to face with me, and I did not see whether he stabbed me or out me—while he was running after me he said, "I mean to murder you," or, "I will murder you "—I bled a great deal—I did not fall when he struck my face, because Mr. Brabury laid hold of me—I did not faint—I was taken to a chemist's, and then to St. Thomas's Hospital.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you been to the prisoner's house that evening? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I did not stop there more than five minutes—I met him at 8.45, and this took place at 9.45—his house is about a quarter of an hour's walk from my master's—I had been to one public-house with him—that was in St. George's Road—I was chatting with him the whole time up to the time I was about to go into my master's house—I had been to my parents' house before I went to him; not with him—I know that he has been at home for the last few months, and that Dr. Chabot attended him about two months, before this—he was not in the hospital before this, he was onh attended by this doctor—he complained of his head and his heart—he has been in a very weak state of health—he is a wire weaver.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk, and live at 5, Allen Street, St. George's Road, Camberwell—on Sunday morning, 26th September, I was with my brother and two friends, and heard screams of "Murder?"—I ran across the road, and saw the young woman running away—she appeared to miss her footing, and fell down by the side of the kerb—I saw the prisoner upon her punching her, as it appeared, with his hand—I did not see anything in his hand at that time—I pulled her from under him, and took her across the road, and the prisoner ran round us screaming and making a very strange noise, and using words I did not understand—he then came up to us, and wanted to get at the prosecutrix, and said, "If anyone interferes I will serve them the same."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You tried to keep her from him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I thought when he made that remark that he was going to fight, and I asked him to come on; and when he found he could not get to the young woman again he stepped back, and said, "Look, look!" and began cutting his throat—she clung to me and said, "Save me!"—I said, "Don't you put yourself out of the way, I will see you right"—I did not see him strike at her, and do not know whether he did, because I thought he was going to run at me, and I was preparing myself—I should imagine that what was done to her was done while she was on the kerb, but she seems to think otherwise—I never saw him get near her, but he might have done so—I got ready to fight, and pushed the girl into my brother's arms—it was then that the prisoner said, "Look, look!"</p>

               <p>ran back again—I waited my opportunity, seized him by the back of his shoulders, and threw him on his back—a policeman came up, and we took him to Dr. Chabot—a friend of the prisoner came up as we took him there, and said, "Why, it is young Forekett," and at the doctor's the prisoner said to his friend "I am happy"—he did not bleed much at the doctor's; but as he ran the blood flowed from his throat like water from a pump.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at St. Thomas's Hospital—on Sunday evening, 26th September, about 11 o'clock, the prisoner was brought there with a large wound across his throat—the prosecutrix was shortly after brought in with a deep incised cut across the left side of her face and chin—it went to the bone, and it was cut obliquely, which made it deeper—it was 3 or 4 in. long—I also found a small wound on the right side of her neck across the muscles—it looked like a stab, but it was not deep—she also had a small wound on the right side of her head above her ear, which looked like a stab, also a cut on the back of her left forefinger—she was very weak at first, but the wounds healed kindly—she remained in the hospital from 26th September till 10th October, but was never in actual danger—this knife might have caused all the wounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If the cut had missed her chin and cut her throat, what would have been the result? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would have been much more serious—it would have been dangerous—it was such a wound as a person trying to cut the throat would make if they cut the chin—it was a determined cut—the knife was very blunt, and it would require a great deal of force to do it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

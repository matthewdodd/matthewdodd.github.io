            . I was porter to Mr. Nightingale, of Leadenhall-street. I was cleaning the windows on the morning of the 8th of June, and saw the prisoner and another person standing about the street some time - the prisoner went into Mr. Simpson's shop, and brought out this piece of cloth on his left shoulder, and his hat in his hand - I gave an alarm, and he threw down the cloth and ran away; I ran after him, but lost sight of him while he turned the corners. I did not see him stopped - I came back with him when he was stopped; I am sure he is the same person - he was running when he turned the corners.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had he not his back to you? A. Yes, but I can swear to his person; I was looking more at him than at his companion. His nose is on one side, and I knew him by his complexion likewise - I remarked both.</p>

            . I am porter to Mr. Simpson. I was outside the door on the morning in question, and a man came and spoke to me. The last witness then came to me, and said,</p>
               <p>"Do you see that man - he has taken a piece of cloth out of your shop;" I looked at him, and saw the cloth on his shoulder; I did not see his face: I saw the cloth thrown down; I ran from the door to where the cloth was; I saw him run down Lime-street, but I returned to my master's shop, and gave the alarm; the prisoner was brought back by an officer in a few minutes, and there were persons who never lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you see the prisoner now? A. I cannot see him very well, but I have seen him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing particular in his face? A. No, not that I know of.</p>

            . I am a constable. I heard the cry of Stop thief! about half-past eight o'clock that morning, when I was opposite the East to India House - I turned round, and saw the prisoner drop the cloth; he then took his hat in his left hand, and ran down Lime-street. I lost sight of him at the corner of Cullum-street - a butcher stopped him - I came up, and took charge of him - I am certain of his person; I was within twenty yards of him. This is the cloth, which I received from a house just by where he dropped it; about twelve doors off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is the person here who took it up? A. No - it was one of the East India Company's men who took it, and it was taken into a house for about five minutes, for security.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182506300054"></xptr>Q. Do you know that it is the same cloth that was dropped? A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I would ask, if my nose is so remarkable, as that any person can say it is on one side of my face; I have not got a false nose. I have never been in such a situation in my life before.</p>

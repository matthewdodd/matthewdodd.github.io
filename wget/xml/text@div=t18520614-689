                  </hi>. I live in the Old Kent-road. The prisoner came to my house on 31st May for a penny roll—I would have served her with it, but she objected to the one that I offered her, and had two halfpenny ones, because they were crusty—she tendered me a sixpence—I pressed it on the counter, and found it was bad—I asked her if she had got any more—she did not say whether she had or not—I threatened to give her in charge—she seemed indifferent about it—I looked for an officer, but I did not see one, and she left the shop—I put the sixpence into a private till till the next morning, quite separate from all other money—the prisoner came the same evening to a friend's house, where I was—she tendered another bad coin, and I gave her to the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Saunders, who keeps the Swan inn, Park-road, Peckham. On Monday, 31st May, the prisoner came to my bar a little before 11 o'clock in the evening—she asked for Id.-worth of rum—I served her—she gave me a sixpence—as I threw it into the till I saw it was bad—I took it out, and bent it—I had no other sixpence in the till, having cleared the till before—I said, "This is a bad sixpence that you have given me"—the prisoner said immediately that I bad changed it—I had not given her the change for it—I kept the sixpence in my hand—my husband came out of the parlour, I gave the sixpence to him, and he passed it to the constable—it was not out of my sight for one minute.</p>

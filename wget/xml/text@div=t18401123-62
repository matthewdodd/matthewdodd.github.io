                  </hi>. I live in Bath-street, Tabernacle-square. On the 23rd of October, I had some linen to dry in the passage—a person came and spoke to me, and I missed a shirt which had been safe a little time before—I went out and saw the prisoner—he was given in charge, and said if I had not given him in charge he would have told me where it was—I said it did not belong to me, I had it to wash, and I must make it good—the shirt is quite lost.</p>

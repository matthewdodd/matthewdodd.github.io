On the 10th of August, I had a pocket-book, which contained three 10l. Bank notes, and a number of cheques; I missed it about ten o'clock that morning - it had been in a kind of teachest or caddy, in a closet, in my bed-room; the caddy was locked - it was taken from my bed-room up to the attic, and the nails were drawn: my son had been in my house from Whit Sunday till the 10th of August - before that he had been in the work-house; he got into the work-house and then got away - I have seen two of the notes in the possession of the constable; he sent back the pocket-book and the cheques by a porter.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was on my rounds on the 10th of August, and went into the Plough public-house; I received information there, and waited until the afternoon, when the prisoner came, and I took him into custody - I took two 10l. notes from him and seven sovereigns and a half; I told him what I took him for - he looked very stupid and strange, but gave up the notes very willingly; I asked him how he came to do so, he said he was very sorry - he did not deny it.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Are these two of the notes you lost? A. Yes - they have my writing on them; I knew they are what I lost - my son has laboured under mental derangement; he was at Bethnal-green for nine months, and then at St. Luke's for a twelve month - I believe he was at this time labouring under mental derangement.</p>

               <p>HENRY TROWSE STEVENSON. On Friday, the 13th of May, I saw the prisoner (whom I had known before), at the Roe Buck, public-house, in Holborn - we came away together about half-past eleven o'clock at night: I was very much intoxicated. We strolled about the streets a considerable time, and some women walked with us. In the morning I found myself in bed with a girl, at a house of ill-fame; I then missed my watch.</p>

            . I am an officer. Stevenson directed me to go to a house in Holborn, on the 31st of May, to take the prisoner; I found him at the door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in company with him for two or three hours; I spent a good deal of money with him, and he then asked me to go and have a spree with him; I said it was late, but I would spend an hour or two with him. We went to the corner of Bow-street, but we could not get into a house there; some girls and some men came up to us; he said he was going with one of them, and asked me to lend him a little silver, which I did - he then said,</p>
               <p>"Here, take my watch, and you can give me the ticket of it when I see you again."</p>

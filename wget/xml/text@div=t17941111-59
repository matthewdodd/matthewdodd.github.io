               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - Very well, I remember his coming to my shop on the 26th of September, between seven and eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Court. What day of the week was it? - I think it was on Friday; he came to buy a pair of shoes for himself, I sitted him on a pair; he asked me what the price of them was? I told him they were five shillings and six-pence; he said he did not mean to beat a person down in the price.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you the money? - He laid me down five shillings and six-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in shillings? - There was some six-pences among it when I looked at them, I told him they looked very bad indeed, I wished him to change them; he said he would change them if I refused them; I said they were very bad; after that he puts me down some more, and bids me take my choice, I said these are very bad, they are much like the others; he said I was very forupulous; I said I will not take any of them; he snatched them up from the counter, and said, keep what you have got, and away he ran.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you put down all those you had in your hand? - No, all but three shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. He swept away those on the counter? - Yes, he did, all besides three shillings; he ran off, and I said, stop him, and I ran after him; a person came up who was a constable, and took him up; we brought him back, and when we came in, I said, you had better search him, and he put his hand in the prisoner's pocket, and pulled out some more bad money, the constable did.</p>

            What did you do with the money you had in your hand? - I kept it in my hand, and when the constable came I gave it to the constable.</p>
               <p>Court. You say the constable searched him; what did you see taken from him? - I cannot say how many there was took away from him, there was a few shillings.</p>

               <p>GEORGE DUDLEY sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a constable? - Yes; on the 26th of September last I went out from my house; I live in St. Helens. -</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what happened when you came to Mr. Trustee? - When I heard the cry of stop thief! I saw the prisoner running, and I took hold of the prisoner, Mr. Trustee came up, and he told me he had been uttering bad money I took him back, and there I saw three bad shillings on the counter; he had some in his hand, which he chucked down on the counter, which with the two or three shillings that laid there made twenty; after that I was going to search him, I was tied to time, I was going to the Post office; I only put my hand in his breeches pocket, and pulled out eighteen-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. That is one shilling and six-pence? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cullen. Then you took him to the Poultry compter? - Yes, after that I took him there.</p>

            Produce it. (The money produced.) - I put it along with the other, that one shilling and six-pence.</p>
               <p>Court. The money you took from the prisoner should have been put separate, and not all together; always separate the money that is taken at different times.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cullen. Since you had mixed the money, what did you observe besides, in carrying him to the compter? Did he do any thing during that time? - He attempted to put his hand in his right hand waistcoat pocket; I desired him to keep his hand from his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that is the money you found on him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Just now you told me you took twenty shillings from him, and that you kept that till now? - Yes, I have.</p>

            Produce it. (Produces the money he took off the counter, and the one shilling and six-pence.) You have two parcels there, where is the other? - We had a hearing before the Lord Mayor, he desired Trustee to point out the money, he pointed out the five shillings and six-pence, and the one shilling and six-pence, and he swore it to be the identical money that he brought for a pair of shoes.</p>
               <p>Court. Now this other parcel was all that was found on him when you took him to the Compter? - Yes, except the one shilling and six-pence.(The money shewn to Parker.)</p>
               <p>Parker. This money is all bad, the twenty shillings.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The money was all thrown together, but there are three of the shillings which I can speak to, which has some aquafortis on it, them I am positive to.(The five shillings and six-pence shewn to Parker.)</p>
               <p>Parker. Three of the shillings are bad, two of the six-pences I am doubtful of, I believe they are good ones, indeed it is hardly possible to tell by candle light, they have brought the composition to such great perfection; upon these three that are bad, aquafortis has been on them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I shall leave it to the mercy of the court; I am very innocent of it.</p>

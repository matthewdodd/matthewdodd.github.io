I said it was nothing to them. I stood there looking in at a clothes shop; I felt something at my pocket - they then walked off. I felt, and missed two half-crowns. I told the watchman I was robbed by two women. They crossed the market. I said one was the woman, but found she was not. I then saw the prisoner, but am not positive to her.</p>

            . I am a watchman. The prosecutor came to me, and pointed out a woman - he looked her in the face, and said he did not think she was the woman. He came to me again in a quarter of an hour, and said the young woman was over the way - I went over, and found the prisoner. I said, "Are you certain of her?" he said, "I am almost sure; take her, and that is sufficient for you."</p>

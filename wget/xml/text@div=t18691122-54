I am living at Wells Street, Poplar—I was cook on board the <hi rend="italic">Old England,</hi> which left Cardiff on 15th June—and was a ship of 1200 or 1300 tons—Bulman was the captain, and Helburn the carpenter—after leaving Cardiff the vessel was pumped every four hours, every watch, from the time we left—the pumping lasted fifteen minutes at a time—that continued for about a fortnight, after which she was pumped every two hours—I observed that the pumps sucked—I remember Saturday, 24th July, the day before the ship was abandoned—it was fair weather—the ship had been pumped every hour that day, for fifteen or twenty minutes—the pumps sucked, but they were not in good order—about 4 o'clock that afternoon we saw a Portuguese brig, and the captain went on board about 6 o'clock—the ship was pumped the last time at 8 o'clock—the third mate gave an order not to pump, but the captain was not present; he was on the poop—as far as I saw, the men were willing to pump—the second-mate, the car<lb></lb>penter, and two sailors, went on board the Portuguese brig with the cap<lb></lb>tain—on Sunday morning, the 25th, about 9 o'clock, I saw the carpenter with a parcel under his arm, wrapped up—he went into the fore-cabin, and I asked him where he was going—he said, "Into the hold—I followed him—he went down the fore-cabin after-hatch, which is in the fore-cabin—the steward was with him—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a model of the ship—the carpenter afterwards put the parcel on the deck to take the hatch off, and I then saw two augurs in it—I afterwards saw the carpenter in the hold, on the top of the cargo of coal—he had the parcel with him—I saw no water then—I was close to the bread tank, in the fore-cabin, and could see into the hold, because the after-hatch is in the fore-cabin—there are two hatches in the fore-cabin—the ship had a between decks, the fore-cabin was in the after part—I was in the fore-cabin, which is on deck—the after<lb></lb>hatches are in that cabin, and he took up the hatches, and went down into the hold—I said to the carpenter, "I believe the <hi rend="italic">Old England</hi> don't leak no more; I don't see the water"—he said nothing—he was then in the hold, on top of the cargo—he called for the captain about half an hour after that, and I went to the captain, who was on deck, sitting on the rail, and said, "The carpenter wants you in the hold "—the captain went to the carpenter, and I followed him to the after-hold—he was away about four or five minutes, and then came back with the carpenter, who went to his work; I did not notice where, and the captain came on deck—about 12 o'clock I went down between decks, in the fore-hatch, and saw water in the hold, for the first time—it was between 5 ft. and 6 ft. from between decks to the top of the water—I went on deck, and told the carpenter, "Water; come quick!"—he answered, "Six," or "Sixteen inches?"—I do not remember which—I left the ship about 2.30, and went on board the Portuguese brig—I have been at sea about seven years—we had good weather all the way from England—the ship was floating when we left her, and as long as we could see her—I did not see the water in the hold after 12 o'clock—the Portuguese Captain came on board the <hi rend="italic">Old England</hi> on Sunday morning, and I inter<lb></lb>preted between him and our captain—I can speak a little Portuguese—the Portuguese captain asked me when we left pumping—I did not tell Bul<lb></lb>man</p>

                  </hi>. I was an able seaman on board the Old England—I have been at sea eighteen years—after the vessel left Cardiff, she was pumped every four hours first, and then every two hours—we began to pump every two hours after we had been about three weeks at sea, I think—we had fine weather—the last time she was pumped was 8 o'clock on the Saturday night, before we left her, on 24th July—the pumps sucked then at 18 in.—the ship drew about 18 ft., but I am not certain——she was a flat-bottomed ship, not a clipper—when we went to the pumps, at 9 o'clock, the second mate stopped us—he said, "What are you doing there"—I said, "We are going to give her a jog out"—he said, "Come away from there, and let the pumps alone"—we turned in between 2 and 3 o'clock on Sunday morning.</p>

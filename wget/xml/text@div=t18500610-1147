                  </hi>. My brother Theophilus is a wholesale ironmonger, of Oxford-street, in the parish of St. George's, Bloomsbury. I manage his business for him, and generally sleep on the premises—on 8th May, about nine o'clock at night, 1 went home, opened the warehouse-door with my key, shut the door, and went towards the counting-house—I lighted a candle, and as I passed the end of the counter, saw the prisoner concealed under it—he sprang up—I asked him what he was there for—he said he was let in by a party who told him to carry out that bundle which was on the counter—I found it contained eight guns, my brother's property, which were in the win<lb></lb>dow when I left—I asked him if he bad anything else—he said, "Some pen-knives," and put fifteen-out of his pocket, which had been in the desk in the counting-house, which was shut but not locked—every thing in it had been turned over—in about ten minutes I heard a voice outside say, "Are you ready"—I did not go to the door—I sent for a policeman—I saw a skeletal key on the counter, with a piece broken off it—I tried it in the policeman's presence, and it threw back the bolt, but feeling some obstacle in the lock, I took it off and found this piece of the key in it—the property is worth 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

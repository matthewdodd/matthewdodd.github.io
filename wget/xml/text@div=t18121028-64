I was up stairs at the time. When I came down stairs from breakfast, I saw the prisoner and his companions in the shop, they were looking at shoes. I only saw two pair of shoes, my young man said there had been three pair, he could only see two. I then asked them if they had the other pair of shoes; they denied having them. My young man said, he was sure there were three pair, when he went into the back shop, and one of them must have taken a pair. I observed the prisoner have something under the left side of his jacket. I opened his jacket, and the shoes were in the inside pocket. One of the men had run out of the shop, then a second ran out, and the prisoner wanted immediately to follow his companion, saying, his companion had got his money.</p>

They asked to look at woman's shoes, and when I went backwards for the women's shoes, I saw the prisoner actually conceal these shoes. My master took them from him; they are my master's property.</p>

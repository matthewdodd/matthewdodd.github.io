                  </hi>. I am barmaid at the Bell Size Tavern—on 11th July, between 3 and 4 o'clock, the prisoner came for a pint of ale, and gave me a shilling—I gave him change, and put it in the till—there was no other shilling there—shortly afterwards he asked for another pint of ale, and gave me another shilling—I gave him change for that, and put it into the till—he asked for another pint, gave me another shilling—I gave him change for that, and put that into the till—he then asked for another pint, and gave me fourth shilling—I thought it right to examine that, and found it was bad—I said, "This is bad"—he said, "It is not"—he showed his purse, and said, "You may as well say these are bad," shaking about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of silver on the counter—I took 3 bad shillings out of the counter—a constable</p>

These shillings are all bad—the single shilling is of the reign of George III. 1817, and from the same mould as one of these 3 from the till; these other 2 are of 1844 and 1845—this one from his trousers pocket is of 1844, and from the same mould as one of the other two—these 5 from his coat pocket are 2 of 1817, one of which is from the same mould as the other of that date, and 3 of 1844 from one mould—3 of those of 1817 are from the same mould, which has been broken, and the same shilling has been used to make another mould.</p>

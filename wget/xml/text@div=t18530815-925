On 8th Aug., about half past 12 o'clock, I was with Margaret Kearns, in Margaret-street, Soho, and met the prisoners Trailloux and Joseph; Joseph asked me if I would have anything to drink, and we went to a public house at the corner of Wardour-street, and Compton-street, and had some gin; we all came out, went up Compton-street, and had some more gin—we then came down Compton-street, into Church-street, and Joseph asked me if I would go with him to his chamber—I said, "No," I would not; I did not like to go—he asked me if I would take him home with me; I told him I was in lodgings, and could not—he had his arm around my waist, and I fell to the ground—he directly drew his hand from me, and I put my hand behind me, and felt blood—I called for my friend Margaret, and said that I was stabbed—when I called for her, Trailloux came and kicked me twice in my private parts—I also found a wound under my left breast—I recollect nothing more till I found myself in the hospital.</p>

I met Trailloux and Joseph at the corner of Wardour-street; they asked Clancy to have some<lb></lb>thing to drink, and we all four went to a public house—we all came out, went into Compton-street to another public house, and he asked Clancy to have two pennyworth of gin with him, which she had, and I went and had a pint of porter—when I went into Compton-street again, I saw Joseph hold<lb></lb>ing Clancy round the waist, he asked her if she would <hi rend="italic">go</hi> home with him; she said, "No;" and he asked her to take him home, she said she could not because she was in lodgings—I walked on two or three yards, and Clancy turned round, and said, "I am stabbed;" and as she was lying in the street, Trailloux kicked her—I went up to pick her up, and Trailloux bit my finger, and Martel came up and gave Clancy a kick on the back, and went away directly; I have no doubt he is the man—she was taken to the hospital, and I went with her, and saw her back and breast wounded.</p>

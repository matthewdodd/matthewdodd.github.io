            . I live at No. 6, Lamb's-street, Borough, and am a paper-stainer, in the employ of Messrs. Heath, Ashness and Co. Queen-street, Cheapside; I have been employed by them two years; they had two boys in their service.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of suspicion that fell upon those boys, did you make any application to them - A. I communicated my suspicions to my master, and had some conversation with Lucas, who was one of them; I went with him to the Angel Inn, Fleet-market, and saw the prisoner, Dent, there - I only saw him then.</p>
               <p>Q. When did Lucas introduce him to you - A. At the latter end of November, at the Rose, four or five days after I had seen him at the Angel. I was sitting at the Rose, Lucas introduced me to the prisoner, I directed him to ask the prisoner to let me have a note; he whispered to the prisoner, Lucas turned round to me again, and asked for 6 s., which I gave him. Dent went out with Lucas.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to ask Lucas if the prisoner could furnish you with a 1 l. note - A. By my master's direction, and the direction of the Bank. I was directed by my master to find out where the boys got some notes which we suspected they were dealing with, and I made application to the prisoner, through Lucas.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they return - A. Yes; Dent came and sat down. Nothing passed - he never spoke to me then - Lucas came and put a 1 l. note into my hand, across the table - both sat at the same table. I put it into my waistcoat-pocket.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181901130022"></xptr>Next morning I took it to the Bank, and marked it - (looks at one) - this is it, it has his name on it.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner again - A. On the 8th of December, I saw him go into the Rose, by accident - he frequented the house; he asked me if I had done it up? by which I understood, whether I had passed the note I took of Lucas. I said, Yes. He then asked if I wanted another? I said, Yes. He said,</p>
               <p>"then come along with me." I went with him to the pig-market, in Smithfield; he told me to wait there till he came back, and asked me for 6 s. which I gave him. He was gone about a quarter of an hour, returned, and put a 1 l. note into my hand - I put it into my pocket - I had no other. Next morning I took it to the Bank, and marked it - (looks at one) - this is it; and has</p>
               <p>"Dent, December 8, 1818, I. S." on it, it is my writing.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him again - A. I saw him several times between the 8th and 12th. He asked me if I had done it? I said I had not yet. He then asked when I thought I should want any more? I said not for a day or two - we parted. On Saturday evening, the 12th, between eight and nine o'clock, I was sitting at the Rose, he came in; I told him that

            , who lived with him, was in the watch-house for disorderly conduct to the watchman. He asked me to go with him to the watch-house, which I did, and she was liberated. We then crossed Smithfield; in the way he asked me if I wanted any? I said I would take one, and if I got that off I would come back for another. We went towards Cloth-fair - he told me to stop at the turning going up Cloth-fair, and asked for the money - I gave him 6 s. They went up Cloth-fair together. In about a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes, he returned and put a note into my hand, which I put into my right-hand waistcoat-pocket. He asked me where I was going to pass it? I said I did not know yet, but I must go and look for a place; he then said I will tell you where there is a sure place, and asked me if I knew Whitecross-street; he went with me to St. John-street, and directed me to Whitecross-street, to a grocer's. I went through a back place, by a dead wall, which led me to Aldersgate-street; he said it was a little grocer's shop, opposite to a sheep's head shop - I could find no such place. I went to Mr. Lamb's, grocer, in Whitecross-street, bought some sugar, and paid a good 1 l. note for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you go there - A. To make him believe I had been, as I was to return for another note. I had kept the note he gave me in a separate pocket until I got home, when I locked it up. I took it on Monday morning to the Bank, and marked it - (looks at one) - this is it. I marked E. D., for the prisoner's name, 12th December, 1818.</p>
               <p>Q. You went back to the Rose - A. Yes, and saw the prisoner in the passage; he asked if I had done it? I said Yes, and I wanted another. He asked me to go into the tap-room, which I did - There were several people there. He asked me for the money, I gave him 6 s. He turned round to

            . On the Monday following, between twelve and one o'clock, I saw him again at the Rose; he asked me if I had done it? I told him I was obliged to lose it. Meaning that I was obliged to leave it in the person's hands where I attempted to pass it, and not return for it. I told him it was rubbed and disfigured so - (looks at one) - this is it; the numbers were rubbed in this manner when I received it. He asked me when I should want any more? I said, in a day or two - he said he was going into the country. I did not see him again until the next week, when I saw him in Smithfield. He asked me if I should want any more? I said,</p>
               <p>"Not for myself, but I knew a person who wanted half a score." He asked me if it was sure? I told him it was. He asked me what he would give? - I said I did not know, but I had told the person I gave 6 s. a piece for forged notes. He told me to ask him what he would give - I left him, and saw him again the same day at the Rose, in Smithfield. He asked me what the person said? I said he would give 5 s. 6 d. - he told me to see if he would not give 5 s. 9 d.; I said he stuck out for 5 s. 6 d., and asked him if I should get the money, if he was agreeable to take it. We appointed to meet at the Flying Horse, Charterhouse-lane, next day. I communicated to the Bank what had passed between us.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you these conversations with him of your own accord, or by direction - A. By direction of the Bank and Mr. Heath, who introduced me to the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Who do you mean by communicating to the Bank - A. Mr. Rooker. We met at the Flying Horse about a quarter after one o'clock. He came and asked, in a low tone of voice, if I had the money? Mr. Freeman, the inspector, stood by the fire, reading the newspaper at the time - it had been planned that he should be there. I told him I had got the money, but could not pay him without a receipt. I spoke loud, that Mr. Freeman should hear me. Dent said,</p>
               <p>"Very well." I took the money out of my pocket, and gave him a 1 l. note and 35 s. in silver, and named the amount, 2 l. 15 s., loud enough to be heard. He said, if I would go with him he would give me a receipt - he could be heard. We went out - he said he did not like the Flying Horse, because Long Tom, the officer, lived near there, and he would show me a sure house. He took me to the Travellers' Inn, Long-lane - it is a very dark tap-room, with a window that looks into a back court. When I got there I told him I should not go in then - he appointed to meet me there, and said he would fetch them by half-past two o'clock. I then went and told Foy what had passed. I went to the Travellers' Inn, and waited there till four o'clock - he did not come. I waited about twenty minutes longer, and then went to the Rose, and found him there. He told me he had not got them, and asked me if I should want them before six o'clock? I said I wanted them as soon as I could have them - he said he would bring them at six o'clock. I said I would stop at the Rose till six - he went out, I remained there. At half-past six o'clock, he came and told me somebody wanted me - I followed him out. He put a small paper parcel into my hand, and said there were but five, and the next day I should have the other five and to meet him at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181901130023"></xptr>the Travellers' Inn at half-past twelve - we parted. I kept the parcel in my hand, and went to the Crown tavern, on Clerkenwell-green, where Freeman and Foy were. I opened it, counted five 1 l. notes, marked them, and gave them to Freeman - (looks at the notes) - these are them. Next day, at half-past twelve o'clock, I went to the Travellers' Inn; he came in soon after, and asked me if I was going? I said Yes - he went out, I followed. He went up an alley close by the inn, and put something into my hand wrapped up, and said, that the half-score were of no use to me, as they would not pay my expenses. I had told him we (meaning I and the other person) were going into the country with them. He said it would not pay my expenses under fifteen or twenty. I said I would see what I could do with the other person, to see if he would take any more. He said</p>
               <p>"Do," and we parted. I put the paper into my pocket, took it to the Bank and marked it - (looks at five notes) - these are them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Dent again - A. Yes, on Monday, the 21st, at the Rose; he asked me what the man said? I told him I would get what money I could, to get mine. He asked me how many? I said I could not tell, but I would be sure to bring the money on the 22d, and said I did not like the Travellers' Inn, as I saw a gentleman there in boots - I had seen no gentleman there, but told him so because I did not want to go there again; he said</p>
               <p>"Go to the Fox and Anchor, Charterhouse-lane, and wait there until I come to you." Next day I went there about half-past twelve, and he came there soon after; we went out together - he took me up the same court, and said he did not like that house, on account of an officer, and said I had better go to the Travellers' Inn. I said I did not like that house, but if he liked I would walk round Charterhouse-square; he said</p>
               <p>"No, go to the Fox and Anchor, and wait there until I come to you." I went with him to the door, and watched him out of sight; I then went up to Foy, under the archway in Charter-house-square; he sent me to tell Plank, who was at the Flying Horse, which I did, and I went out of the way until I heard he was taken - I had told them which way he was most likely to come, and to keep a sharp eye on the Fox and Anchor - he was to bring me five more notes then; I had given him a 1 l. note, and 7 s. for them, the last time that I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any transactions with him, except by the direction of your master, and the Bank - A. None at all, Mr. Rooker furnished me with the money for dealing, and Freeman gave me the last note.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Nobody but yourself was present - A. No, except at one transaction at the Flying Horse, Mr. Freeman was present.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you brought up to - A. I have been at sea above twenty years - I went of my own accord.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever transported - A. Never, the last six years that I was at sea, I was in the King's service, on board the Rambler, and other ships.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is there any circumstance in your life to raise a suspicion of your being transported - A. None whatever - I served last in the Caledonia.</p>

On the 18th of December, I gave him 2 l. 15 s., to buy ten 1 l. notes at 5 s. 6 d. each of the prisoner, Dent. At a quarter after one o'clock I went to the Flying Horse, as he had informed me of an intended meeting there - he and two or three other people were there; I was in the tap-room, and took the newspaper from Shobel, and stood by the fire. About half-past one o'clock, the prisoner came in, and sat down by Shobel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see or hear anything pass between them - A. I heard Shobel ask him if he had got a receipt, for as the sum came to above 2 l. he should want one - Shobel counted out 2 l. 15 s. loud enough for any one in the room to hear it. In about a minute after Dent said, if you will come with me I will give you a receipt - they went out together.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of the evening did you see Shobel again - A. At seven o'clock I saw him by appointment at the Crown Tavern, Clerkenwell-green - he had a parcel in his hand which he opened; it contained five 1 l. forged notes; I made him mark them before he gave them to me - I also marked them myself - (looks at some) - these are them. On the 19th of December, he came to me at the Bank, and produced five 1 l. forged notes, I made him mark them, and marked them myself - (looks at some) - these are them.</p>

             and Plank seized and apprehended him; they took him to the Flying Horse, in Charterhouse-lane, which is kept by Ellis - they went in before me, I followed immediately into the tap-room, where they had him in custody. Hawkins was searching the prisoner, and took a piece of paper out of his pocket, he gave it to me, and I marked it - (looks at it) - this is it. I asked the landlord for a private room to take the prisoner into; he showed us into a back-parlour; we went in together with the landlord - nobody else was there but us; I observed that nothing was on the floor - I always do before I search a prisoner - there was nothing. I searched the prisoner, he had overalls on; I felt something hard near his knee, on his thigh. I unbuttoned his overalls, they buttoned all the way down, and then a small paper parcel fell out of them on the floor. The prisoner put his heels on it, and drew them together, so as to confine the parcel - it fell at his feet. I took it from under his feet, and asked him where he got it, and what it was? He said he knew nothing of it, it did not belong to him, but he observed something laying on the the floor when he came into room, and he put his foot on it. I opened it, and found five 1 l, notes folded together, and ten others rolled up, and tied round with a piece of thread, separated from the five - there was also a 5 l. note folded up separate; all of them were enclosed within a piece of brown paper - (looks at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181901130024"></xptr>them) - these are the same, they are all marked by me, and this is the paper they were in.

            . I am an officer. I attended with Foy on the 22nd of December. I was placed at the Flying Horse, public-house, opposite the Fox and Anchor, and saw Dent go into the Fox and Anchor, and in about two minutes he came out, and looked to the right and left - then Shobel came out after him - they went down the street into the court together. I lost sight of them for two or three minutes; I then saw Dent come up the street, towards the square, and in about two minutes I saw Shobel, he gave me information. I went to the gate of the square, saw the prisoner come across the square, and pass Foy - I took him. He was taken into the public-house. I took a small paper from his left-hand waistcoat-pocket in the tap-room, and gave it to

I saw Foy stoop down, push his feet aside, and take it from under his feet. (I had turned round at that moment to look into the passage) - I saw the parcel under his feet.

            . I am one of the firm of Heath, Ashness, and Co. Queen-street, Cheapside, we are paper-stainers. Shobel has been near three years in our service, and would have been now, if he had not been engaged in this business - he will be in our service again. In consequence of what occurred in my house I give him directions to detect persons uttering forged notes. I afterwards reported to the Bank every particular from day to day - he was employed by me for that purpose. I know the history of his life, and am certain he never was transported.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. What character had you with him - A. I referred to the parish books, and found he was a parishioner - I took him before the Lord Mayor, and had him bound over to me. He was very industrious, and quite worked himself into my favour. I found him very honest and grateful. I became acquainted with him by his applying for relief when I was churchwarden. I consider him an honest man, and shall employ him again.</p>
               <p>JOHN LEES. I am an inspector of bank notes - (examines the note set out in the indictment) - it is forged - it is not bank paper. It has an apparent water-mark, which is put on after the paper is made, by pressure. It is not the Bank plate. The date line is engraved - in a genuine note it is printed. It is not C. Tabor's signature - I have known his signature many years. The letters No. before the number are engraved - in a genuine note they are printed. The whole of the twenty-nine 1 l. notes are forged in every respect, and off the same plate; they are different numbers, and are not genuine in one single instance, and are not the signatures of the signing clerks - they are signed Stock, Tabor, Conset, Lowe, and R. Clough. They are different numbers, but every number consists of the same set of figures, viz. 12570, but transposed. The 5 l. note is forged in all respects, and has the same figures in the number. The paper found in the prisoners pocket has the name of A. Consett five times on it, and A. C. several times - it has also R. Clough wrote on it. They are imitations of their hands.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you tell when a water-mark is made on one paper, and put on in another - A. Yes, I have seen it done in a common manufactory - these are made by pressure. My knowledge is not from practice but from theory. I have a general knowledge of engraving, so as to say whether notes are worked off one plate, and can say all these 1 l. notes are off the same plate.</p>

            . I am signing clerk of 1 l. notes at the Bank, and have been so for six years - there is no other of my name - the note has not my signature to it. There are six others bearing my name - none of them are my signature.</p>

They<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181901130025"></xptr>took me into the parlour, where there were pipes, glasses, and tobacco, as if somebody had been there. The officer picked the parcel up, and said,</p>

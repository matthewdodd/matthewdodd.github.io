On Sunday the 6th of January, about four in the afternoon, I observed the prisoner on John's Hill, selling the piece of wood in question at Cohen's house for one shilling; when he had sold the wood I asked him whether Mr. Scarlet had given him leave to sell it; he said he did not know who I meaned, and went about his business. On the Monday morning I informed Mr. Scarlet of it, and the prisoner was apprehended.</p>

            . Q. You are the acting partner with Mr. Cook, a carpenter - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. We understand you contracted at the time with the London Dock company for putting down the piles - A. Yes. When the timber is brought into the dock it is mine; when it is put down a clerk of the company measures it, it then becomes the dock company's property. I went with the lad and found the man at work in the trench that was cutting out for the piles, and the officer took him to Cohen's house; Cohen immediately brought forward the wood, the prisoner said it was the first piece of wood that ever he took from the premises. This is the piece of wood, it is the top of the pile, and here is the mark of the engine.</p>
               <p>- COHEN. I bought the wood last Sunday was a week; there were two men, each of them had logs. That gentleman came in the early part of the morning, he asked me if I had bought a piece of wood, I told him, yes, and shewed him the piece of wood; he came afterwards with the constable and took it away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. In the morning when I came to work I had no victuals to eat. I have three young children, they were distressed; I took this bit of wood and sold it to get my children a bit of bread. I leave myself to your mercy.</p>

               <p>Q. Don't be too positive at first - say whether you can positively swear to him? - A. I can positively swear to him; I saw him twice, and had a full sight of him.</p>

               <p>Q. What bundle was this you had? - A. It was a coat, stockings, and shoes, in a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you tell your master you had lost the bundle? - A. I don't know what it was o'clock, my master did not come home till late, he was out at supper.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to make us believe you saw no person whatever in that part? - A. No, I did not one, but Mr. Cummins.</p>

               <p>Q. They were striking you, and they attempted to rob you, and pull this bundle from you, how came you not to cry out to the coachman? - A. I had not that thought.</p>
               <p>Q. You really did not call to the coachman? - A. No, I did not make any noise till I got up; they only pulled me from the coach, and I fell down; I got up again, and ran after them, and then I called out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an ironmonger's assistant, of 49, Arthur Road, Holloway—on 18th April, about ten o'clock, I was in Camden Road, Hol-loway, and met the prisoners—Wilkins asked me if I did not live in the Hornsey Road—I said, "No, I live in the Arthur Road"—he said that he thought he saw me passing along the Hornsey Road several times—I was under the impression that I know Wilkins, but afterwards found I was mistaken—he asked me to go into a public-house—they paid for one glass of ale and I paid for another—that was the first glass of liquor I had that day—we came out, and as I bade them good night I received a sudden blow—I cannot say which of them struck me—I was knocked down, and while I was on the ground I felt a tug at my watch-chain—I culled for assistance—my chain was broken, and the greatest portion of it taken away—I called for assistance—a gentleman came and they made off—I ran after them, but lost sight of them—a constable came up, and at his request we went round the neighbourhood and saw Wilkins in the Seven Sisters' Road putting his hand to his eyes—I went across to see if I could recognise him, and he ran away—I ran after him, gave him in cus<lb></lb>tody, and said, "You are one of the party who stole my watch and chain"—lie said, "No, I was running after a fire"—I saw Evans walking with a constable—he said that he had been to a fire, and denied all knowledge of the robbery—I found my watch in my pocket—I was not quite sober, but I well understood what I was about—my head was slightly affected, as I cannot take much—I had never seen the prisoners before.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you a Londoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I had two glasses of ale; Wilkins paid for one glass and I for the other—he called for a pot of six ale and paid for it, and I returned it—there was not more than one person in the public-house the whole time—no one came to me when I was knocked down, except one gentleman—I received a blow on the left side of my head and fell sideways—Wilkins was on my left and Evans on my right—the robbery was committed about eleven o'clock—I left my master's, in the Hampstead Road, about 9.30—I was in the prisoners' company about a quarter of an hour before I found out that I did not know them.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi> 296 <hi rend="italic">Y</hi>). About seven o'clock on the night of 18th April I heard a cry of "Police!" in Hornsey Road—I saw the prosecutor, and we went up the Seven Sisters' Road together—I saw Wilkins on the other side of the road, and told Powell to go in front of me, for if he saw us both together he would run away—he crossed to Wilkins, who ran away directly, but was stopped and given in custody, and charged with knocking Powell down and stealing his watch—Wil<lb></lb>kins said, "You make quite a mistake; you never saw me before; I was going to a fire"—when he was taken to the station he said, "Yes, we were drinking with him at the public-house"—they said that another party attacked Powell—I found this piece of chain (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it has been broken near the centre—Powell gave me this portion, which was attached to his watch—the centre portion is gone.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you the other portion of the chain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I had the prisoner in custody ten minutes afterwards—I went the way Wilkins came back—I had my uniform on, and directly he saw it he ran away from us—Powell was making a great deal of noise, hallooing "Stop thief!"—he found his watch in his pocket.</p>

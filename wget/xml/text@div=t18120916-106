             lives next door to where I do. He has the house there himself; and I have seen Humphreys pass.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 15th of September did you lose any property from your lodgings - A. Yes. I lost a black bombazeen bag, containing a purse, with two three-shilling bank-tokens, and ten one-pound notes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came Price to be in the room with you - A. He came about half past nine in the morning. Humprhreys was with him. He came to remove a sofa-bedstead, and during the time that he was with me, he told me that he had two shillings<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160061"></xptr> to pay the porter, to carry the bedstead. I told my daughter to fetch my purse. She did, and I asked him to change me a one-pound note. He said, he could not. I said, I remember I have some silver. I gave him a three-shilling bank-token. He was to send me a shilling in by Humphreys. I then laid my bag down. I asked him if he would remove the drawers into the place where the sofa was. I left my bag in the room, on the table. I went out of the room. Price came out and assisted the man in removing the drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. The drawers were not in that room, were they - A. No, not in which I then was.</p>
               <p>Q. You then all went out of that room - A. Yes. Price might be about a minute in that room after I left it. Humphreys went out first, I followed, and then Price followed.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you went into this room where the chest of drawers were - A. Yes. Humphreys went first, and I followed. Price entered into a conversation with me, respecting the drawers, and during this time Humphreys had not time to take the bag.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first miss your purse - A. After the men left the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss it before Humphreys returned with the shilling - A. No. He did not come in. He gave it to my daughter. After that, a person called for a small bill, about five minutes after the prisoners had left my apartment a person called for a small bill. I then called for this bag. The mistress of the house with whom I lodge, she locked in every part of the room, and could not find it I then went immediately to Worship-street office for an officer. There I gave my evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. You say Humphreys brought back this shilling and gave it your daughter - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you remained after they went out - A. In the same room where the sofa had been, and where I laid down my purse. Humphreys returned with the shilling, and took the remaining part of the sofa, but he did not go into the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been while Humphreys was away the last time - A. I had been in the same room. I did not quit the room any more than a minute. I was in sight of the room the whole time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any one gone into the room - A. No. My little daughter was remaining in it the whole time.</p>
               <p>Q. Price and Humphreys came to you upon some business you sent your daughter for the bag, in which bag was a purse - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Price wanted two shillings to pay the porter, you took your purse and laid it on the table in that room, where you got in conversation with him about a pair of drawers in that room; you went out of the room, and Price followed. You are quite confident that you left the purse on the table - - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Were the drawers immediately removed into the room - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did it take - A. Not more than half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. But during the time that the drawers were removing, where were you - A. In the other room, in the front room.</p>
               <p>Q.Could any one during that time go into the room where the sofa was, without your seeing them - A. No person could go into the room, I am confident.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you he sure that no one went in the room - A. The person with whom I lodged can prove that she was in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Could not any person go up stairs, and go in without your seeing them - A. No. There is no servant there, only the mistress of the house. A person called for a a small bill, which was the occasion of my missing the bag. I went to Worship-street immediately.</p>
               <p>Q.Was any thing found upon the prisoners - A.Not any thing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. You knew the prisoner, Price - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You took out your bag to pay him the two shillings for carrying the sofa - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Where was the room where the drawers were to be removed - A. One door is opposite of the other. Price and myself were together in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, whether you can at all times command a view of that room from where the sofa was taken out - A.Before the drawers were removed, and the drawers were put where the sofa was, my daughter was in the room the whole time.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, Humphreys and Price were in the room half an hour, how much of that time had gone when you paid the two shillings - A. Price had scarcely finished taking the sofa to pieces when I put the three shillings down.</p>
               <p>Q. He remained a full quarter of an hour taking the sofa to pieces - A. No. Humphreys came back the second time, and took the remaining part of the sofa, and he brought me a shilling. When Price went away, he said, Humpreys, I shall not return again, you can bring the rest away, and bring the shilling back.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you asked him to remove the drawers you had paid him - A. Yes. I had the bag on the table. I took out a three-shilling piece. Humphreys went first, and I and Price followed. Knowing the man, I felt no hesitation in leaving him in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. How old is your daughter - A. My daughter is five years old. I left her in the room.</p>

               <p>Q. Might not she have played with it, or have throwed it out of the window - A. My child, if she had seen any thing belonging to me, she would have taken care of it. She would not have played with it, or have throwed it out of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you get the ten one-pound notes - A. I received them in change at a linen-drapers, the corner of Chiswell-street.</p>

I let Price and Humphreys in myself. I was sitting in my kitchen. I remember them going out; and I remember Humphreys coming back again, and Matilda coming down to let him out to save my trouble. Up to the time that the young woman came to ask for the bill, no one was in the house but Price, Humphreys, Mrs. Greatwood, and her daughter. I let the young wowan in. She stood at the bottom of the stairs. She never went up stairs. I called to Mrs. Greatwood, here is a young woman called for a small bill; when Mrs. Greatwood said, come up stairs Mrs. King. I want to speak to you. I went up stairs, and then heard her complaint.</p>

            . I keep an upholsterer and broker's shop in Crown-street, Finsbury-square. I have known Mr. Price near three years. This last three years I have trusted him with three hundred pounds, and would trust him with five hundred. His general character is honest and industrious. About three weeks ago, Mrs. Greatwood said, Mr. Price has lent me an old sofa which was buggy; my husband could not die upon it. She put her hands together and said, I will never forgive him so long as I live. I will have revenge. Her little girl, over and over, said, Oh, how can you say so.</p>

             says, about three weeks ago, before this loss, you complained that you had a spite against Mr. Price; that he sold you a buggy sofa your husband could not die upon it, therefore you would be revenged - A. That is not true. I told her I was extremely angry. I said, I did not think I could forgive him; that is all I said. I owned him no spite. I thought no more of it afterwards. My little daughter is here; she could say, whether I felt angry. I never said I would be revenged.</p>
               <p>Price called four other witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

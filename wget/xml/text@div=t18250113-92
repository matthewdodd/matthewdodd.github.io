            . I am eleven years old. (This witness appeared perfectly to understand the obligation of an oath.) I live at No. 3, Oliver's-court. About six o'clock in the evening, that the prosecutor's shop was robbed; I was playing at hoop with Roger Ryan up and down Little College-street - I knew Hunt before, and one Dignum, and saw them both standing at the prosecutor's window; they both went over, and lifted up the window - Dignum took some shoes out from inside the window, and Hunt held an apron, which they were put into; there were three men's shoes - I saw them take a great many shoes, and an odd boot - I only saw one boot; they took them out as fast as they could, and put them into their aprons - Dignum threatened to throw a stone at me, but did not - they did not see us looking at them, as we went away; and when we came up the street again, they were still at the window, and Dignum offered to throw at us, and told us to go away, and we went; when they had put the shoes into the apron, they all ran down the street; there were three of them altogether; Fielder was the third man; he was standing at the corner of the street, about ten yards off, looking at them, and when he saw any one coming, he whistled; I did not know him before, but am sure of him; there was a lamp at the corner, so that I could see his face - Henson's eldest daughter came out; but I did not see him come out himself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you call any body to look at them? A. No; there was only us, and my two little brothers - I knew they were stealing, but if I had gone to tell, they would have knocked me about - Dignum picked up a stone, and said,</p>
               <p>"Get away with you" - we went round the street, and met nobody; I was standing by Fielder - it was a dark night; I saw them cross over, and go to the window; I saw their faces - a woman came out of her house, and told us to go away, and Hunt said</p>
               <p>"Be off, be off" - Hunt stood by her door; it was rather a dark street; there was a lamp at the corner, some distance from the shop; there was no light in the shop; we went by them, and Dignum told us to be off - we were going in to tell, when Henson's daughter came; she came out and asked if I had seen the men, and asked, why I did not come in to tell, but Dignum had threatened to hit me.</p>

            . I am eleven years old. I was playing with Fitzgerald, and saw Dignum and Hunt at Henson's window - Hunt lifted up the window, and held it with one hand, and held his apron with the other - Dignum pulled the shoes out of the window, and put them into his apron; I only saw him take three men's shoes out; Fielder whistled, and they ran down Great College-street; Fielder had been standing at the corner, under the lamp; they all three ran away; Dignum had threatened to throw a stone at us, and told us to go away; I did not know them before, but I saw their faces, about six o'clock that evening, when they stood by a public-house, where there was a light - the public-house is only a few yards from the prosecutor's - I have no doubt of them being the same men.</p>

            .

            . I am a Bow-street officer. Henson gave Hunt into my custody, about a quarter past six o'clock; I found nothing particular on him. The prosecutor's house is in the parish of St. John the Evangelist - I have heard it so called. I took Fielder in about half an hour, and took him to Ryan and Fitzgerald, who identified him. Henson delivered me these shoes and boots; I have had them ever since.</p>

            . The shoes and boots are mine. The three shoes which Clewley picked up I gave to the officer. I had given them to a neighbour to mind while I went to the watch-house, but am certain they are the same - he returned them to me in a quarter of an hour; the others were picked up in the street, and brought to me by my neighbour while I was returning with the officers.

                  </hi>. I live at 11, St Thomas Road, Bow Common—I am foreman to Mr. Thomas Nelson, an architect, who was pulling down a church in Wellclose Square—on 19th March, about 3 in the afternoon, there was a copper ball and spindle under the stairs on the floor, on the left hand side—I received information and went to look after the copper—there were several men in the church—I went to the place where I had seen the copper safe, but it was not there—I went to the front of the church and saw Carthy—I went to the gate and then round the church—I afterwards found it on the roof, broken up into several pieces.</p>

I am a labourer in the service of Mr. Thomas Nelson—I took down the copper ball from the church—it had been on the ground floor about a week—I gave it to the last witness—I put it under the stair<lb></lb>case in the church—I did not remove it—Mr. Berney gave me some information, and I went on to the roof of the church—I found the ball broken up—Michell and Hoskins were on the roof, breaking it up—I then called Berney, and the prisoners ran away—they were working on the roof at the time—there were other men there at work—I don't know who took the ball and spindle on to the roof—Michell had a mattock in his hand—part of the ball was lying at the side of them—I did not say anything to them about it—I called out to Mr. Berney—he ran up on the roof then, and the two men were brought down and given in charge.</p>

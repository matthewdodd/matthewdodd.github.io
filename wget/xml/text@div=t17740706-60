            's and had his men for three days in order to take them; they took my rings from the hook, my stock buckle from my stock. I said I would not part with my ring; Rooke bid them let the rings alone.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of day was you at Kensington-gardens on the 4th of May?</p>
               <p>Pretty. About eleven in the morning; I had been there an hour and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to give Clarke eighteen pence?</p>
               <p>Pretty. Out of charity.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think such a man deserved charity?</p>
               <p>Pretty. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you then give him half a guinea; why should you be terrified, an honest man has no occasion to be terrified in the middle of the day?</p>
               <p>Pretty. I did it out of charity.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the strangest idea of charity that I ever heard; how came you to give Pullen half a guinea, did you give that out of charity?</p>
               <p>Pretty. Because I thought I should hear no more of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they take away the plate with or without your consent?</p>
               <p>Pretty. Not by my consent.</p>
               <p>Q. You could have refused signing the note?</p>
               <p>Pretty. I was so frightened I did not know what I did. I was below stairs, they followed me up; I did not see who was behind me till I got up stairs; when they came into the room they shut the door but did not lock it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you seen them in the street before they came up stairs?</p>
               <p>Pretty. No; I had never seen any of them from the 4th to the 24th of May.</p>
               <p>Rooke. I went and enquired if he lived there; Mrs. Jones said yes; I asked if he was at home, she said yes; Mrs. Jones called him out of the cellar; Pullen spoke to him first and said how do you do sir, you remember me; he said hah, I do, and trembled, and said, walk up, walk up, then Pullen said, come up Mr. Rooke, this is the man I have been telling you of.</p>
               <p>Pretty. I did not see Pullen nor Clarke till I got into my room.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Prisoners. Did not you unlock the door and give us some rum?</p>
               <p>Pretty. They took the bottle of rum and helped themselves; the key was in the door, Pullen unlocked it.</p>
               <p>Clarke. He passed me two or three times; he said he had seen me some where before, and turned round and said I was a pretty fellow; he put his hands upon my thigh and asked me if I could make it stand; I called him all to pieces; he bears the character of a s - e; he gave me eighteen pence; I would not have it, but insisted he should go before a Justice.</p>
               <p>- Jones. Mr. Pretty is my lodger; I had been out on the 24th of May; when I came home there was Rooke and Pullen there; my wife was on the kitchen stairs calling Mr. Pretty up; Rooke was in the parlour, and Pullen in the passage; Mr. Pretty went up stairs and Pullen followed him; I asked Rooke if he had any business with me, he said no he wanted to speak with Mr. Pretty; I desired him to walk up into Mr. Pretty's apartment, which is the first floor.</p>
               <p>Q. If Pretty had made any noise you would have heard it?</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes, but after these men were gone up stairs I went out on business; when I came home my wife said another gentleman had gone up; I was behind the Compter, Rooke and Pullen went out, and said they were sorry they gave me so much trouble, going in and out. Mr. Pretty came down to dinner at half after one o'clock; he trembled very much; he did not tell me of it till the Friday morning, when I went to Sir

               <p>Rooke. Mrs. Jones had a suspicion, what we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177407060057"></xptr> came about, and said, he bore a very bad character, a publican opposite said so particularly.</p>

            . I live in Red-cross-street, in the Borough: I have known Mr. Pretty nineteen years; his brother boarded with me eleven years; I knew his wife and all the family. I never heard a charge of this nature suggested against him in my life; I heard from his brother that about four years ago there was something of this sort, and they got about five guineas out of him; if they had asked him for fifty or a hundred they would have got the money immediately I believe.</p>

The Court then said, that if there were any persons present, who knew any thing of the prosecutor, it was their duty to give the Court information concerning his character; upon this the following witnesses were examined:</p>

R. only; I told him I did not chuse to go to a house such people used; then he asked me where I lived, and proposed going home with me; I told him a different place from where I lived, and that our family would be a-bed, and I should not be able to get the money; then he said if I would meet him in the Park at nine o'clock the next evening and bring him five guineas, I should have my watch again; I promised to meet him at that time; I went at nine o'clock accordingly, and met him in the Park; I gave him five guineas, and he gave me my watch; then he insisted upon having three guineas; when he had got that he insisted upon having three guineas more, and he made me promise to send three guineas next day to the Vine, but I did not intend to do it; I apprehended I had rid my hands of him; on the next Wednesday, which was the 11th, he came to my lodgings and told me that as I had not kept my word in sending him three guineas he would now have ten guineas; I gave him ten guineas; then he asked me if I had any left off clothes; I gave him some; I asked him how he found out where I lived; he said he accidentally saw me go into the house while he was drinking at a public house. On the Thursday se'ennight, which was the 19th, a man brought me a letter from the prisoner, the contents of which were, that he was going to be arrested for sixteen pounds, sixteen shillings, and sixpence, and hoped I would lend him the money upon his note; the next day the person that brought the letter called for an answer: I told him it was of such a nature that I would give no answer to it; the next afternoon, which was Saturday, I met the prisoner in the street; he told me he was coming to me for the loan of the money he had wrote for; I told him I had not got the money, but if he would call on Monday evening I would see what I could do for him; I then asked the advice of certain friends how it was proper to act.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you mentioned it to any body before this?</p>
               <p>Fowle. No, not to any one breathing; I would not for ten times the sum he has had of me have an affair of this sort known; for in a matter of this sort a man's character should stand free of suspicion; my friends advised me to apply to Sir

             to have the prisoner apprehended; and when he came to me he was apprehended accordingly.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the woman here that you went into the Park with?</p>
               <p>Fowle. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever advertised for her?</p>
               <p>Fowle. No, but I have been to several houses where I might expect to meet with her.</p>
               <p>Q. You was certainly in a great fright the first night; but how came you to go the second evening and give him five guineas for your watch?</p>
               <p>Fowle. I would not have lost the watch for double the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been that night?</p>
               <p>Fowle. I had been alone at a coffee-house at Charing-cross.</p>
               <p>Q. There are some aukward circumstances in this case; have you any body here that knows you?</p>
               <p>Fowle. I have sent for Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Smith.</p>
               <p>The prisoner in his defence said he was going through the Park to Petty France; that the prosecutor, who was not in company with any woman, came to him and behaved very indecently, upon which he knocked him down; that a soldier came up upon this, and the prosecutor gave them his watch and money, and begged they would not expose him.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177407060059"></xptr>Fowle. That is absolutely false; here is a gentleman or two in court that know me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wells. I have known Mr. Fowle between four and five years.</p>
               <p>Q. Intimately?</p>
               <p>Wells. Very intimately for about three; I have not been so intimately acquainted with him since he has been in town; he was an attorney at Bristol in a very pretty business; I never heard any thing of this kind of him in my life; he spent a pretty fortune and indeed lost his business by his extravagance with women.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you take him to be a man of sense?</p>
               <p>Wells. A man of very great sense.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you think him not easy to be imposed on?</p>
               <p>Wells. I should have thought not, but it is impossible to know how a man would act under such a charge as this; to be sure I should not have acted as he has done; every person of the city of Bristol I am sure would give him the same character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Smith. Mr. Fowle has lived in my house half a year.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he keep good hours or come in late?</p>
               <p>Smith. Sometimes not very early, sometimes he stays late at the office.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard him suspected of a charge of this sort?</p>
               <p>Smith. No, never; I have since this affair asked his character of some Bristol people, and find he bears a very good character.</p>

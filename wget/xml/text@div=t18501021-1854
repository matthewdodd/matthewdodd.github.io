                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at 10, Little Carlisle-street. On 23rd Sept. I went out to see a friend in Cato-street, who had come from America—between four and five o'clock in the morning the prisoner invited me to his room in Edward's-place, near Cato-street, to have some beer—I had one glass—a man named Deeley was in the room—he did something which made the prisoner tell him to go out of the room, and he said if he did not go out he would strike him with a bar of iron—he and the prisoner went but</p>

               <p>together—the prisoner came in again with a bar of iron in his hand, and said, "As I did not strike that man 1 will strike you," and he up with the bar and struck me on the head, which knocked me quite senseless for five minutes, and for near an hour afterwards—I was quite sober, and I think the prisoner was—he had had some beer—the prisoner's brother Thomas was in the room all the time, and when I got better I found Thomas had got hold of me—the prisoner came to strike me again, and said he would have my life, but he struck Thomas instead—I was taken to the Dispensary—I lost a good deal of blood—I am recovered now.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at the Westminster General Dispensary. About half-past six o'clock, on the morning of 23rd Sept., Hayes was brought to me—he was apparently labouring under concussion—there was a severe scalp wound about an inch and a half long, and down to the bone—one of the arteries was divided—I had considerable difficulty in stopping the haemorrhage—I attended him for about three weeks; he was confined to his bed during that time—symptoms of erysipelas showed themselves—a bar of iron would be likely to produce such a wound.</p>

                  </hi>. I was examined before the Magistrate on the part of the prosecutor—on the night of 23rd Sept., I was in company with Hayes—I first met him on Sunday afternoon, about half-past six o'clock—we walked to the Edgeware-road, from there to Stingo-lane—we went to Conner's about a quarter-past twelve at night—I was with Hayes all that time—we were drinking part of the time at the Wellington, below Seymour-place—we had 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.-worth of beer among a lot of us—we went to two public-houses, and then went to Cato-street—there was a roomfull of us—we had drink there—we remained there about half an hour—we came out of there—the woman of the house said she would not have us there any longer, and we went to another man's house, whose wife had lately come from Ireland—we had some beer there—Hayes was still with me—we remained there about twenty minutes.</p>

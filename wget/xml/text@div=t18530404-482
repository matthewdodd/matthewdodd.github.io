                  </hi>. I am the son of John Pollock, of Great St. Thomas the Apostle; he is a papermaker's agent—I assist in his business. I remember the prisoner coming to our place of business on 8th March; she came to the counting house door—to get there she must pass through the warehouse—she came for charity—she was crying, and she begged of me—I refused to give her anything—I had known her two or three years, and had relieved her on former occasions—when she left I shut the counting house door; I did not see her go through the warehouse—she had to go right through the warehouse—there was paper of this description lying there, close by the door—in consequence of information I followed her, and came up with her with the policeman—this paper is part of what we had; I can tell it by the number of the mill, and the weight, and by the date of the paper, when it was charged in our books; it was on 4th March—I missed this paper when I got back—it was part of a file of paper that bad just come in—there were about twenty reams of the same parcel—it is worth 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

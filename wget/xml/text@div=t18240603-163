On the 26th of March he brought an order from a gentleman of the name of Hoden, for a firkin of white lead; I gave it to my boy, Brown - it weighed 3 cwt. The prisoner did not go with him to deliver the goods. I never saw it afterwards. The prisoner remained in my service a few days - I then discharged him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he live with you - A. Yes; and he used to go and get orders for me, he was at liberty to send goods to customers. Hoden was a customer of mine, and had bought lead of me. I did not treat it as a civil debt. I never received 1 l. on account of that lead; it was on account of other monies, that he had received from other persons. I did not apprehend him about this before I had received the 1 l. He went round with the officer to the customers, to see what he was deficient. I never agreed that he should pay me by instalments. He collected some money on that day, and brought me 1 l. of a certain man's account. I had had him in custody, and let him go - I then took 1 l. from him. He never executed orders - I always did that myself. I took the 1 l. because I thought it was some money he had received from a man of the name of Capilliar; he then said,</p>
               <p>"I believe Capilliar did not pay me," and I said I must erase it; but I went to Capilliar, and saw the receipts in his handwriting, for 30 s. I saw Mr. Hoden some time afterwards; it might be three weeks or a month after I saw him, that I apprehended the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a painter, and live in Mild-end-road. On the 26th of March I had not given any order for white lead - I might have done so prior to that. I received some on the 17th of March, and on the 6th of April I received 3 cwt. 1 qr. 14 lb. I believe it was delivered by the prisoner, but I was not at home. I did not receive any on the 26th of March - I saw Mr. Atmore on the subject after the 6th of April. Firkins have different weights. I cannot say that the lead delivered on the 6th of April had not been ordered on the 26th of March. I expected that I was dealing with the prisoner himself; I never saw the prosecutor, and did not know him.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Atmore. I had taken goods to Mr. Hoden before - I did not deliver this lead to him, because the prisoner met me, and said he wanted that firkin of white lead - he had got an order for it; I said I was going to take it to Mr. Hoden - he took it, and went down Whitechapel with it; I asked if I should go with him, and he said No, as I had other goods in the truck. I went up Brick-lane. He rolled the firkin along after he took it off the truck. Mr. Hoden's is about three quarters of a mile from Whitechapel-church. I never saw a firkin rolled so great a distance.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the prisoner live in the same shop with you at the time - A. Yes. He was in the habit of taking orders for Mr. Atmore. On seeing the lead in the truck, he said he had an order for it, and he rolled it as a person would do who was going to some place near. I never heard from him where he took it to.</p>

               <p>Who was the last up in the family? - Mr. Collier; he was not long after me when I went to bed; all was then safe, the doors and windows were shut and fastened; I went to bed at near twelve; I was alarmed in the morning about six; I got up and came down with Mr. Collier into the shop; the door was open before I came down, but the shutters were broke to pieces, and a pane of glass; the screws of the bolts of the shutters had been forced out, and the glass broke; there were goods missed to a large amount, about the value of one hundred and twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>I believe you have no knowledge at all of the persons? - No, Sir, I have had the property ever since, which was given me by one of the witnesses.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. It was perfectly light when you got up? - Yes, it had been light some time.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I went to Mr. Collier's after this robbery, and in September I went with Mr. Collier to a house in Brick-lane; on the 11th of September I went to the house of Aldred, on the information that Mr. Collier had received himself; there we found a large quantity of muslin, dimity, some pieces of Irish, some pieces of printed cotton, and a quantity of handkerchiefs, both linen and cotton, I believe.</p>
               <p>Who was at Aldred's, when you found these things? - Neither he nor she were at home; they came home soon afterwards, there was nobody at home but the daughter; when they came home we took them into custody; nobody was there during the time, but Aldred, his wife, and daughter. We found a small quantity of linen at the room of Mrs. Bell, on the 19th in the morning; Mrs. Bell is not here.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner Taylor at any of these places? - No, I did not; I saw him at a Mr. Goldsmith's; we found a brace of large horse pistols, which were produced here on the former trial, and were delivered into court; Taylor was apprehended on Wednesday the 28th of February, in Golden-lane, at the house of one Mr. Trott.</p>
               <p>Was any thing found on Taylor when he was apprehended? - No kind of property whatever; I know nothing further.</p>
               <p>JAMES SHAKESHAFT sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 11th of September I received information of some goods suspected to be at Mr. Aldred's in Brick-lane; I went there on a search warrant with Mr. Collier; we found some goods there, some pieces of handkerchiefs, and some Irish; they were not at home, when we were searching the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180105"></xptr>house; they came home afterwards and we apprehended them; I found nothing else, but there was some new cloth at the lodging where I was directed, in Ratcliffe-lai, behind St. Luke's church; there was some new cloth made up in an apron; we went there first, and found out the lodgings, and I found a new apron there, and some cloth; and I said to Mr. Armstrong, we will take Athill across the fields to see if he will say any thing; and going along, he shewed me the very house where I had found the cloth, for he said he bought the goods there.</p>
               <p>Whose house was that? - Mrs. Bell lived there, and there were some men's clothes there that hung up; I believe it was Mrs. Bell's lodgings, I cannot positively say; we found her there; there was a coat and breeches hung up, we suspected them to be the prisoner's, but cannot swear they were; the prisoner was not there.</p>
               <p>Have you ever seen him there? - No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing further till the prisoner was taken up? - No, I advertised the prisoner and another through Athill's directions; I was not at the taking of the prisoner.</p>

            , the prisoner at the bar? - No, I never saw him but once before in my life, and that was at Mr. Blackborrow's; I never saw him, not to my knowledge; I never did indeed, Sir.</p>
               <p>- WEEDON sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a milkman; I remember meeting four men, with four bundles, on the last day of August, about thirty-five minutes after three, as nigh as I can guess, but who they were, I cannot tell; I met them in Islington church-yard.</p>
               <p>Did you know the persons of any of these men? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Should you know the persons of any of them if you should see them again? - I do not think I should; I should not know them.</p>

               <p>Have you any knowledge of this matter, further than finding the property? - No, nothing else; under the direction of Athill, I saw the woman where the property was bought, in company with this prisoner, since he has been committed for the fact; nothing further than that.</p>
               <p>Why did not you subpoena Mrs. Bell to attend as an evidence? - I never saw her but that time; I knew her very well; I would have done it if I thought I had the least authority in the world; I should have been very proud to have done it; I was not even at the apprehending of this man; I did not know till Lucy sent me word.</p>
               <p>Court to Lucy. Why did not you subpoena Mrs. Bell? - I did not know we could do such a thing; she was tried for this fact.</p>
               <p>Yes, but she was acquitted? - I applied to that gentleman on the bench; (Mr. Bush, who collected the money for the widow.)</p>

               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, this business now stands in such a situation, that whatever may be the truth of the case, there is no evidence at all against the prisoner.</p>
               <p>

            </rs>.</p>
               <p>Court to the prisoner. I hope you will take warning, prisoner; your life has escaped in this business, but unless you leave that course of life, which there is great reason to believe you are following, you will not escape the laws of your country long; you may depend upon it your person is too well known; your character is too well known: you may escape punishment for all the offences you have committed; provided you commit none in future; and you may return to the ways of honesty; you have health and strength enough to gain an honest livelihood, if you will do it; you will therefore consider that you have no chance of saving your life for any length of time, if you continue in bad courses.</p>
               <p>Shakeshaft. My Lord, at the time of Athill's examination, I was present when all of it was taken; he informed me that Stephens, Fosset, Taylor and Tucker were all concerned; I then said to him, you mean them that use such a house; yes, says he; Taylor and them that were tried for Mr. Reeves's robbery; them are the men; I have likewise seen him in company with Taylor, at a public house; he was sitting at a window, and abusing the officers, and threatening them.</p>
               <p>Court. You and all the officers of justice perfectly know Mr. Athill now, as well as Mr. Taylor; therefore I recommend it to you to keep an eye on Mr. Athill; if he is caught tripping, you cannot recommend yourself more to the favour of the Court, than in detecting him in every thing he may commit; if you are vigilant and active, you may at least render it impossible for him to go on with his business. Is there any body besides you, who has seen Athill in company with Taylor.</p>

               <p>Court to Armstrong. When was it that you saw Athill in company with Taylor? - It was some time last summer; it was before September.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - I am positive.</p>
               <p>Harper. I cannot positively say to the time I saw him, it was before he was taken up for this robbery.</p>

             the plaisterer's, where they all resorted, not in company.</p>
               <p>Court. Let Athill be brought into Court, and let him stand committed to take his trial for perjury, in swearing that he never saw Taylor before the evening he bought the things.</p>
               <p>Athill. I have said nothing but the real truth, according to my own judgement.</p>
               <p>Court. Let him be committed to Newgate.</p>

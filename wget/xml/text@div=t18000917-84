             sworn. - I am a milkman; I spent the evening with Kelly and another man, at a friend's house.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been drinking with them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How were you? - A. As well as I am now, to do any business that I wanted to do, I could walk home very well; when Kelly got into Broad-Street, Bloomsbury, he was taken very ill, and fell down, and I desired his partner Brannon to help him up against the wall, and I would call for a coach; there was no coach upon the stand, and I did not go three yards from him, I just turned round to call a coach, and that was all; I turned back, and then three men came up, one of them was pretending to help him up, and I observed him very busy about his thighs, that was Freak; I then called to Brannon, to take care of Kelly's watch; upon that he put his hand to his watch, and said, that he had no watch; the watchman was coming across towards us, when I took hold of the prisoner, Freak, and gave charge of him; then one of them immediately ran away, and Samuel did not stir, he stood by looking on; a proposal was made to search them, upon that, Freak handed a pair of gloves to Samuel; I really think that Samuel was innocent of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the gloves? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Samuel. Q. Did I not assist in carrying Kelly to the watch-house? - A. I have heard so, I did not see it, I had him upon my back, and carried him to the watch-house; it was mentioned at the watch-house, that he had hold of his legs as I carried him on my back.</p>

             sworn. - I had been with Kelly and Reardon, spending the evening; coming through Broad-street, Kelly was taken ill, whether through liquor I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You had drank liquor enough to satisfy you? - A. Yes; Reardon called a coach; he then called out, take care of Kelly's watch; I directly put my hand down and missed his watch; I had seen his watch in the course of the evening, it was a silver watch, with a steel chain; Reardon then gave<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180009170082"></xptr>charge of the prisoners, and we went to the watch-house, and put Kelly to bed; Freak then handed over a pair of gloves to Samuel, the watchman has the gloves.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL HEEDITCH sworn. - On the 21st of August, I saw Reardon and his company coming up Broad-Street, very drunk; Kelly fell down, very drunk; there were two or three more that passed them backwards and forwards, I cannot say who they were; the others were a little disguised in liquor, but not so much as Kelly was; I turned round, and saw Kelly taken up by Reardon, I had seen the watch in Kelly's pocket, not a minute before; I saw his hands several times about his thighs; one of his companions says to the other, take care of his watch, upon that the watch was missed; when Kelly got to the watch-house, he was so disguised in liquor, that he could not stand; I desired the constable to search Freak; when he found he was going to be searched, he took out a pair of gloves, and pushed them into Samuel's hands; I took them out of his hands, and found they were gloves; he said nothing in his defence before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Kelly. I know these to be my gloves, by a small hole at the top, and another part that is mended; I am sure I had them in my pocket when I came out.</p>
               <p>Freak. Hebditch took up another man, after he had took us up.</p>

               <p>Hebditch. I took up a man upon the information of a girl of the town, who was drunk; she gave me information of a man that knew where the watch was, and when she came before the Magistrate, the next morning, when she was sober, she denied all that she had owned to me the night before.</p>
               <p>Freak's defence. Mr. Kelly was very bad; I was coming down through Broad-Street, St. Giles's, and saw him against the wall, with his head bleeding; there were, I dare say, ten people round him, besides us.</p>
               <p>Samuel's defence. I was coming through St. Giles's, I had been spending the evening at Mr. Davis's in Broad-Street.</p>
               <p>For the prisoner Samuel.</p>
               <p>- DAVIS sworn. - Samuel left my house alone, at past twelve o'clock at night.</p>

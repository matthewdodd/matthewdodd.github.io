I am the prisoner's wife; we live at 15, Marlborough Square, Chelsea—on the evening of 7th April, about 6.30 p.m., we had a few words—I did not say a great deal to him; he said that I was always talking about him, and I said that his name was not worth mentioning—I think that vexed him.—he took up the poker from the fire and knocked me</p>

I live at Alexander Square, Brompton—the prosecutrix was brought to my surgery, suffering from a wound on the top of her head, another on the side of her face, and another at the back—one wound was three inches, and another two and a half, they went down to the bone—they must have been done with some force; a poker would be a likely instrument to produce them, the blunt part of it—she was almost insensible, and I did not think it advisable for her to be taken to the hospital—I attended her at her residence some time.</p>

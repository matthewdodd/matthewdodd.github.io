             to bathe - we met the prisoner, who asked where we were going, and said he would go with us; I went into the water first, the prisoner next, and then he said he would mind Nash's clothes while he went in - Nash then went in, and when he came out the prisoner was dressed, and sitting by the clothes; the prisoner had an apron on when we first saw him, and when he got a little way he began to catch butter-flies with it - he then gave it to another boy; the prisoner took the shoes, and put them under the other boy's apron, who ran away; we called the prisoner, and he stopped - we asked if he knew any thing about the shoes; he said No - we asked if he did not lend his apron to the other boy; he said he had no apron, but I know he had, and had given it to the other - we saw him put Nash's shoes under it; I saw the Policeman, and he took him -I went to the watch-house, and he said he would tell the truth if we would let him go.</p>

            . Boyle gave me charge of the prisoner; he said he would tell the truth if we would let him go - he owned he was to receive half the money for the loan of his apron; when the boy got home safe with the shoes, he said he only knew him by playing with him.</p>

               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

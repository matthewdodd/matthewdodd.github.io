               <p>The blow you received came from Tucker? - Certainly, I was knocked down, and was on the ground two or three minutes, and beat while I was on the ground, but by whom it is impossible for me to say; I had a thick great coat on, which kept the blows off in some measure, but I received the first blow from Tucker; when I got up again Tucker was there; I lost my hat, I picked up my hat, and Tucker was standing in a posture rather of defence, as if he was going to fight, and after I got off, (there was one of the officers advised me to get off as fast as I could) and there was a mob near me, hurraying and huzzaying, and making a great noise.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask Mr. Griffiths if he did not strike me repeatedly before I touched him? - Not to my knowledge, I do not think I did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I could bring a hundred people, if I had had habeas's, that would have sworn he struck me repeatedly.</p>

               <p>Did he strike you before you left your hold of the box? - He did; I am very sure of it; and I had not struck him at that time.</p>

I was in my stable, at Mile-end Old-town, on the 31st of January, about two o'clock, and saw the prisoner jump across a ditch, and come into the yard; he took the handkerchief off his neck, and tied up this coat; I took him, and asked him what he had got; he said, "I have found it in the field;" while I was there, my wife and the little boy came running round, and said,"Oh! Mr. Francis, that man has stolen my coat."</p>

            . I was looking through my window, and saw the prisoner take hold of this little boy, who was crossing the field, and I thought he was going to beat him; I saw him take the coat off with assistance - he appeared to be trying to conceal it in his small-clothes, or his apron, and then he ran - I got out of my house, and while I went one way, my husband caught him the other.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            , I live in Kentish Town, on the 7th of June last, as I came by the Adam and Eve, some clock struck eleven; and I was robbed a few minutes after that by three footpads, the other side of the Adam and Eve, I lost a linen bag and a leg of mutton; one of them asked me what money I had, I said I had a few farthings, and he asked me what I had in the bag; he said he would have that, and took hold of me by my right arm, and pushed me along; I let him have it, he took it off my right shoulder.</p>
               <p>What became of the other men? - They stood by, they did not speak to me; he did not touch me no further than taking the leg of mutton from me.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen either of the men before? - No.</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity of observing either of their faces? - I had a great while an opportunity of observing them all, I know two of them, I saw them the Monday following, it was not very light of dark.</p>
               <p>Did you know the men again which took the leg of mutton from you? - It was Gahagan, I saw him the Monday after at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230044"></xptr> the Justice's, and knew him again, nobody pointed him out to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Gahagan. This woman could not swear to me at the office, nor never a one of us.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you swear to him at the Justice's? - We swore to our property, not to the man, they did not ask us.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there no question asked you about the men? - No, my Lord, they did not.</p>
               <p>How near did the other man stand by you? - I was upon the King's highway, and they were upon the foot path.</p>
               <p>Do you know the other man again? - Yes, I cannot find him here to my knowledge, I cannot swear to one; the furthest one I do not swear to, but there were three in company.</p>
               <p>When you was at the Justice's you say you swore to your property; what property? - A handkerchief that they took from my husband.</p>
               <p>Did you find the bag again? - No, I could not, but the weight was seven pounds and a quarter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Smith. The woman said before the mutton was weighed, that it weighed six pounds and a half; afterwards the officer who apprehended us, took the mutton out, and called this woman on one side and her husband, and told them the weight, and then she said it weighed seven pounds and a quarter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Gahagan. What do you know me by? - I knew him the moment I saw him again, they were standing by me a long time while they were robbing my husband.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a painter, living at 4, Cross Keys Square, Little Britain—on the evening of 8th January I was walking along Long Lane with a friend, about 10 o'clock or 10.15—I was set upon by a gang of about a dozen men, who hustled me—they turned me completely round and hustled against me, making a noise with their mouths—they did not say anything—my watch was in my pocket at that time—I had a great</p>

               <p>coat on, but it was open—I had seen my watch about five minutes before when I was in the British Workman—the two prisoners are two of the men; I have no doubt at all about them—the hustling went on for about four or five minutes—I did not miss my watch until my friend, who was hustled in the road, came and said "Tom, where is your watch?<hi rend="italic"></hi>"—I looked down and saw it was gone immediately—I commenced calling "Police!" and some of the gang left; and when I persisted in calling "Police!" they began to separate—in the confusion I ran hither and thither after several of them—my attention was called by a little boy; he said something to me, and I followed the prisoners—they were about 100 yards from the spot when I came up with them—when I got to the Alley in Aldersgate Street they said they would do for me—I told them they had got the wrong sort of party, and when I got a little further up they said when they got a little higher up they would do for me—a policeman came up, and one of the prisoners ran away—I told the policeman to take him, and I got hold of the other—he struggled to get away—I stuck to him till a policeman came up, and he was taken into custody.</p>

I reside at 61, Old Street—on the evening of the 8th January I was with Mr. Shurey, in Long Lane, about 10.15—as soon as we' had passed Hayne Street we met a number of young men who were walking in couples, arm in arm—a portion of the gang directed their attention to me, separated me from my friend, and by a gradual but persistent pressure forced me backwards from the pavement into the road—I said "What are you at; what is your game"—they gave no response, but continued to thrust me off the pavement—I noticed that the rest of the gang had sur<lb></lb>rounded my friend and they were gently turning him round, and then they moved off—I noticed my friend's guard hanging down, and said "Is your watch all right?" and he said "No, it is gone"—we followed the men and called police, and one of them said, derisively, "You can call <hi rend="italic">police</hi>"—if the prisoners were to put their hats on I could identify them better—(<hi rend="italic">the prisoners put on their hats</hi>)—I recognise Jenkins distinctly, but I can't speak to Harris—I was outwalked—I had got rheumatics in my ankles, and I could not walk.</p>

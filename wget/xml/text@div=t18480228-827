                  </hi> I was a seaman on board the brig <hi rend="italic">Simpson</hi>. The prisoner was an apprentice—there was also an apprentice named. Walter Jenkins—on the 24th Dec. the vessel was in the Mediterraneam, of Tunis, out</p>

               <p>of sight of land—while on deck I heard a noise in the forcastle—I went there and saw Jenkins coming up the ladder with a panikin in his hand—I did not see the prisoner then—Jenkins went back, and I went down—I heard the prisoner say, "If you touch me again, I will have the life of you, so I will"—Jenkins then put his panikin on my chest, and went towards the prisoner, who was standing by the said of his bulk on which he slept—the prisoner turned round from us, then turned his face towards us, and he had a knife in his hand—I did not see it in his hand when I first went down—he used to keep it hung by the side of his bulk—he was standing close alongside his bulk, near enough to reach the knife—as Jenkins went towards him, I saw him thrust his hand forward, with the knife in it, towards Jenkins' belly—Jenkins cried out that he was killed—he unbuttoned his trusers, and I saw an incision in his belly—there was no blood then—he went up on deck—about ten minutes after I saw the entrails protruding out—he was then is the cabin—he was put into a berth—the prisoner was secured, and the course of the ship was altered—we came up to Tunis in two days—Jenkins was put on shore—he seemed very ill then—I assisted in taking him to the hospital—he was left there, and we came to England—I know the knife—it belonged to the prisoner at the time—he had exchanged it with Watson.</p>

                  </hi> I was a seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">Simpson.</hi> I remember this matter happening when we were off Tunis—Jenkins and the prisoner were in the forecastle, and I saw Jenkins strike the prisoner with a piece of rope, for or using his panikin—the prisoner told him if he did that again he would have his life—Jenkins was going up the ladder, and when he heard that he came down again, went towards him, and struck him again—I cannot say whether it was with his fist or his open hand—the prisoner went and got his knife, which was hanging alongside his bed—he had got it before he was struck as Jenkins was going on deck—it hung a few feet from where he was standing—it was not within reach—he had it in his hand when Jenkins struck him the second time, and he then stuck the knife into Jenkins, who called out, "I am ruined"—I examined his belly, and found his entrails handing out—I tried to put them in, but could not, the wound was too small—I carried him to the carpenter's berth, and put him in there—the course of the vessel was altered towards Tunis, which was the nearest post—Jenkins was there landed, and taken to the hospital—this happened on the Friday, and we landed him on the following Monday—we then came on to England—Jenkins was an ap<lb></lb>prentice as well as the prisoner—he was an older and stronger person.</p>

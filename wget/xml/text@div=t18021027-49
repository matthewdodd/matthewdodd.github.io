            . - I am servant to the New River Company; going home from work, between six and seven, by the Fallow Buck, Clay-Hill, I met a man blundering along, who is the prisoner, and who seemed very tipsy; he had a cloth under his arm, with something in it; he was trying to wrap it round it; I did not know what; it drew my attention, and I stopped; in about half a minute I saw him lay it over the pails; as I knew Mr. Williams's cart, which I saw there, I watched the prisoner into the public-house, and looking through the window, I saw him sit himself down, and went to see what he had put over the pails; finding it to be meat, with the cloth thrown carelessly over it, I took it into the house; Mr. Williams was in the passage, and I shewed him the lamb; we agreed to wrap up something in its room, and I went and placed it where I took the lamb from, but left others to watch it; a constable was sent for.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This man was very drunk? - A. Yes; I expected him to fall.</p>
               <p>Q. After he put his arm over the pails, he went back into the house where the prosecutor was, and began drinking again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is this from town? - A. Fourteen miles; this is the fifth day we have been here.</p>
               <p>Q. And Williams has his lamb and cloth? - A. Yes. - (The cloth produced and identified.)</p>

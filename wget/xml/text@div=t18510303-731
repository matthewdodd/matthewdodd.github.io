                  </hi>. I live in Swan-court, Mansell-street Yesterday fort<lb></lb>night I saw the prisoner at the bottom of the court, alone—there were Mr. Brosnahan's two children playing at the step of the door next to her—I saw her from half-past ten o'clock till half-past twelve, standing and walking up and down—she then took the two children, one in each hand; and took them out of the court—one of them had a pair of leather boots on—I afterwards saw the children brought back—one of them was two years and a half old; and the other, who came back without her boots, was six.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 5, New-square, Minories. On that day I saw the prisoner with the children, coming across the square where I live—I saw her take the boots off the oldest child—one of them appeared to me to be about two years old, and the other about six—she put the boots under her shawl—she then led the children about half-way into the railway arch, and then ran back from them.</p>

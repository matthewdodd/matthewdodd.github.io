                  </hi>. I was lately an officer in the army, but have retired, and live at Sandhurst. On Tuesday, the 2nd of January, I was leav<lb></lb>ing London, by the Black water coach on the Western road—I was an inside passenger, and this property was in a portmanteau, which I saw safely put on the coach in Charles-street, and strapped down under, a tarpaulin—I had no doubt of its security—I missed the portmanteau on arriving at Blackwater, which is thirty miles from town—but taking it for granted that it had been taken off to shift the luggage at Piccadilly, I supposed it had been left there, and told the coachman to inquire about it—on the Saturday morning when he came to Staines, he made a discovery, and I went and identified my portmanteau—I have found but a small portion of my property.</p>

I met Thomas Neale in Gray's-inn-lane on the 3rd of January—he was alone, and had this pair of boots—I had some suspicion, and apprehended him—I went to the Golden Lion public-house, and found the prisoner Wells in the tap-room—I asked him if he had given Neal the boots to pledge—he said he had—I asked how he came by them—he said he bought them in Holborn of a man who had several other pairs to sell—I asked him when he bought them—he said the same day—that he gave 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them, and the</p>

On the 3rd of January Wells sent a young lad, and said he wanted to speak to me—I went, and he said, "Go, and pawn these boots for me, and ask 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them"—I went to Mr. King's, and they would not have them—I then went to Gray's-inn-lane, and offered them to a pawnbroker there, who said, they were a nice pair, and he wanted to try one on, and then he would not give me any thing on them—I came out—the officer was at the door, and took me.</p>

I apprehended Walters on the 4th of January, in Chapel-street, Somers-town, coming up the Street with a bundle under his arm—I asked what he had got—he said he had got his things—I asked what they were—he said he had just left his place, and was going to his mother—I asked him if there was any mark on the things—he said there was not—I examined these shirts, which were in his bundle, and found they were marked "J. G. Wright" in full in ink, and the waistcoat also—I said they were marked, and I did not think they belonged to him—I took him to the station-house, and there he said the things had been given to him by a young man named Baldock, which is the nickname that Wells goes by.</p>

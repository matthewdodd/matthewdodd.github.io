On the 25th of December, about three o'clock my shopman was standing at the door; the prisoner passed him; my shopman asked him if he wanted to buy any clothes; he said, yes, but he had no money, he was to get an order from the captain to the owner of the ship, then he should want to buy a good many clothes; my shopman asked him to walk into the shop; I then came into the shop, and asked him his pleasure; he said, he should get an order in an hours time, and then he should want a good many clothes. I asked him if he would walk into the parlour; he said, he should be obliged to me, he stopped till about four o'clock, then the prisoner went out of my house with my shopman, and went to the top of the street, and returned in an hours time; he then remained in my house, and lodged there that night, this was on the 25th of December. The next morning, I got up a little after six o'clock, and when I had dressed myself I went to put my gold watch into my pocket; my gold watch and my silver watch were both gone; I ran down directly into my parlour.</p>

               <p>Q. When had you last seen them - A. One I had in my pocket, the gold one I had in my pocket; the silver one hung up at the fire-place; before I went to bed, I wound up my gold watch; I took the silver one from the fire-place, and took them up into my bed-room. When I missed them, I ran down into the parlour to see if the doors were all secure as I left them at night; when I looked at the bolts, the yard door was unbolted, and the door shut to. I am positive the yard door was bolted the over night; a young man that lives with me now bolted it. I went down stairs to see that it was bolted, but the bolts were not shoved quite home; I shoved the bolts quite home. The next morning the watches were gone; when I found the door unbolted, I ran up to the prisoner's room; I put my hand to the bed; the prisoner was gone from the bed and the bed quite cold.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has got the two watches - A. The officer has got one, and the pawnbroker the other.</p>

               <p>MR. SALTER. I am a pawnbroker; I live at Ratcliffe Cross. On the 27th of December, the prisoner came and offered a gold watch for sale; Butler the officer had been with me and informed me that two watches had been stolen a gold one and a silver one. I sent for an officer to apprehend the prisoner; I secured the gold watch; I have kept it in my possession ever since; this is the gold watch.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Look at the watches - A. I am certain they are my property, the seal is mine; the gold watch I wore myself, and the silver watch was for use at the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had no intention to take them; a poor man went with me to buy clothes; I had no occasion in the house; I am a stranger here.</p>

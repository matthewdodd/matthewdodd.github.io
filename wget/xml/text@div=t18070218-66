               <p>Q. On any time previous to Christmas day did you see your pocket book. - A. Yes, I saw it on that day mentioned in the indictment - I was in my warehouse when I counted my notes - I had notes in Bank paper to the amount of one hundred and twenty-three pounds; I put the notes into my pocket book, and I put the pocket book in the inside pocket of my coat; I wore the coat till I went to bed, then I pulled it off.</p>

On Saturday night I locked that coat up with the pocket book in the inside pocket. On Sunday morning I put my coat on; when I opened my pocket book every note was gone.</p>

               <p>Q. Does your memory lead you to believe that to be a payment of that indentical check. - A. No.</p>

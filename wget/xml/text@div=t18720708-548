                  </hi>. I live at 2, Albert Terrace, Blackheath Road, and am apprentice to a tinman—on 22nd June, about 9.15, I was in High Street, Deptford—there was a Punch-and-Judy there, and the prisoner <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> against me—I said "Where are you <hi rend="italic">shoving</hi>? you have got my watch"—he said "No, I have not; search me"—I said "No"—he said "If you don't let me go it will be the worse for you," and struck me on the forehead, and got away—I saw him snatch the chain, but did not see the watch—I am able to say that the watch was in my pocket at the time—I have not seen it since—I gave him into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> What was there to hinder you from seeing the watch come out of your pocket? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You stood so close to me; you only made one snatch—I did not see you give the watch to anyone; I did not see it in your hand, but I saw your hand leave my waistcoat, and saw you have hold of the chain—the chain is not broken; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); the swivel was bent almost straight, but I bent it back again—you had some of your mates round the corner, and some of them followed you—my mate was with me.</p>

I live at 9, Garden Road, Lewisham Road, and am a plumber's labourer—I was with Hills on 20th June, and was standing in front of him at the Punch-and-Judy show—the prisoner pushed against him and snatched his watch—Hills said "Who are you shoving of? you have got my watch"—the prisoner said, "I have not; if you don't leave go of me it will be the worse for you," and struck Hills a blow on his forehead, and ran away—he was caught, and he said "If you will be quiet and come round the corner, I will find you your watch"—Hills said "If you will give it to me in front of all these people, I will let you go"—he saw that he had not got it, and was given in custody.</p>

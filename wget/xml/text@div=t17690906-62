I had the money (containing the several pieces as in the indictment) in a drawer, locked up in a chest, in my dining room, up one pair of stairs. There were five gold rings, several dollars, watches, and other things. The closet door and dining room door were locked. All was there on the 14th of June. On the 15th, between three and four, I was alarmed by my wife, that my money was gone, I went up stairs, and found the drawer quite pulled out, and the several things and money laid in the indictment taken away.

               <p>Jones. My Lord, I am upon my oath, consequently I would not forswear myself, in a circumstance that does not relate to myself. I asked her on Wednesday; Nancy, confess to the fact.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you an acquaintance of her's? - She lived in the house.</p>
               <p>Do you live in the house? - Yes, at Mr. Bennet's house, and have lived there these sixteen years.</p>
               <p>Is Nanny an acquaintance of yours? - Yes; as a servant in the house.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is Green an acquaintance? - She lodged there with her mother.</p>
               <p>Hands. I did not think I wanted any witnesses, or I would have called some.</p>
               <p>Jury to Jones. What does Green do for employment? - Lives upon her mother; nothing more, as far as I know from her circumstances.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you a journeyman shoe-maker, or do you make shoes for your own customers? - For my own customers.</p>
               <p>Have you a shop? - No. I am a chamber master; I work up stairs, in the first floor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Harding, and live in hadlow-street. I employed the prisoner as a char-woman occasionally—on Saturday, the 5th of December, I employed her—she left my house about nine o'clock that night, and shortly after she was gone, I missed a silk cloak, which I had seen at seven o'clock that evening—In consequence of information from Sarah Buck, my servant, I went after the prisoner, and found her at own house—I told her of my loss—she said she knew nothing about it, and she would go back to my house, for she was sure it was there—she went back, and could not find it—I placed Buck the servant near her house to watch.</p>

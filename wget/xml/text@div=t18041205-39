               <p>Q. Did she sleep in your room that night? - A. She did.</p>
               <p>Q. Perceiving that you had lost five shillings in the morning, did you tax her with it? - A. No; the officer was ready within three doors of my house to take her, provided she robbed me that night; I went to him immediately I got up; he came and searched her, and found the marked money there, which he produced at Bow-street, and there I saw them; I am sure they are the shillings I had marked the day before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. How long has there been two beds in the room? - A. I suppose about two months, I was very ill.</p>
               <p>Q. She was not fit for a bed-fellow - did she not sleep with you? - A. I have had no bed-fellow except my wife, who is dead and gone.</p>
               <p>Q. You prosecute for the sake of public justice - I dare say you would be the last person to make offers to the prisoner's friends? - A. They have made me offers, but I have not made them any.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the reason you have come here, because they have given you none - do you know the Bull Inn, in Holborn, did not you go there? - A. I do not deny but I have been there; here is a person in Court that offered me fifty pounds, that I now positively swear to, but I told him I would not do so, that I had discharged a man in consequence of her robbing me, and therefore she should take the consequence.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore if any body should say that you went to the Bull Inn to solicit her friends to compound this, it is not true? - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you go for? - A. I went to the person that keeps the Bull Inn, by the desire of the prisoner, to let her brother know what situation she was in at this time, she would thank him to come to town.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Whenever you met them, you met them at the Bull Inn? - A. I never saw Mr. Cannon, her brother, but twice in my life; the first<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180412050047"></xptr>time I went to the Bull Inn was by desire of the prisoner</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see the prisoner for her to express that desire? - A. I was in the yard, and the sister came to me and said she expected her brother was coming up, and immediately he came up to tell him to come down that evening; I told her I would do her that favour; I would call at the Bull Inn; I was going past.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. That very sister could have done that herself? - A. Her sister was here in the yard and asked me.</p>
               <p>Q. And would not go to the Bull Inn; why did not you tell her to go herself? - A. When I came out she was gone.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What message did you deliver to the brother? - A. I told the brother that I saw the sister of the prisoner, and she wished to speak to him, if he would oblige her; that was all that passed between us then.</p>

             sworn. - I am one of the patrols of Bow-street; I went to Mr. Baker's house, by his desire; I went in and searched the prisoner; I told her I was to search her, she had robbed her master; she said she had got no property of his.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find when you searched her? - A. Two shillings and sixpence; the two shillings are marked; in about an hour afterwards she was searched by a woman; I searched her as far a man ought.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the woman searched her? - A. No; the woman took something from her breast, and put it in her pocket afterwards; I took three shillings from the prisoner's pocket, and two shillings I took up from the floor, while the prisoner was putting her clothes on; she said the money was her own; I took her to Bow-street, and she was committed; I produce the three shillings that the woman said were found at her breast.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the prosecutor.) Look at these three shillings? - A.(Looking at them.) They were in my possession when I went to bed that night; I did not put the mark on them; I had noticed the mark that was on them; I had picked out marked shillings and took a copy of the marks.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. You should have said that before.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Let me look at the paper; you say you wrote the marks down before you went to bed? - A. I did; the last three shillings are the last marked on the paper.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. This was Monday night that you put the marked shillings in your purse? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was Tuesday morning when you recovered them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a good deal more silver in your purse? - A. Yes, about 2 l.</p>
               <p>Q. This paper you wrote on Monday night? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That is as true as all the rest you have sworn to day? - A. That is the copy that I took off on Monday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that an exact copy of what you wrote on Monday night? - A. It is the exact copy.</p>
               <p>Q. Then on Monday night how could you anticipate these three shillings? - A. On Monday night I had put down twenty shillings; that is a copy of the shillings that I missed.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. That is the copy of the marks that are on the three shillings that were missing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. That could not be the copy wrote on Monday night, for here are two plain shillings, one is marked with an M or W, which way you turn it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got the paper which you wrote on Monday night? - A. I have not.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Do you keep the Bull Inn, Holborn? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Mr. Barker first coming to your house on the 30th of October last? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he speak to you when he came? - A. He asked me if I knew Mr. Cannon, of Long Crandom, in Oxfordshire; I told him I did; he then asked me if he was not a large farmer, and a man of considerable property; I told him I knew him to be a man of considerable property, and a great farmer; he said he had a sister of Mr. Cannon's living with him; she had been taking some money out of the till; did I think that if I wrote to him he would come to town and settle the matter without prosecuting her; I told him I would write down to him, and I did not doubt but Mr. Cannon would come, but I could not answer whether he would make it up.</p>
               <p>Q. How often has Mr. Prosecutor been at your house? - A. He has been there not less than ten times; on Wednesday, the 14th of November, and Friday, the 16th, he came to meet the coach, and asked if Mr. Cannon was not come; I told him, Mr. Cannon had not been in town; he appeared very much disappointed; I asked him if he had done any thing when he had been in town; he said no, they would not give him money enough.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he say how much he wanted? - A. He said he had asked 200 l. in all; he said that his recognizance must be forfeited, and the officer must have 40 l. I told him I thought it was a good deal of money for my own part; Mr. Cannon might do as he pleased.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Did he demand 200 l. or say he had lost 200 l? - A. He said he had lost a great deal of money at various times, and he did not know but she might have had it; he came on Friday, the 16th; we had two pints of wine together; I took the liberty of asking him closely about it; he came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180412050048"></xptr>of his own accord; I never sent for him, nor did any body else; Mr. Cannon was not in town; he came to enquire for Mr. Cannon; then he told me he had lost a great deal of money; his affairs were in a deranged state; he had been ill, and had been robbed, and if he could get a couple of hundreds it would stop a gap or two; this was his expression - he had some heavy bills to make up; I then quarrelled with him.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after the 16th did he come again? - A. I cannot speak positively, perhaps in the course of a week he has been repeatedly; on Sunday, the 18th, I gathered from his own conversation that there had been an intimacy between him and the prisoner; I said, I understand you have been free with your maid, and if a man makes free with his maid, he must expect they will make free with him; he then said, if I have, that is no reason I should be robbed.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Therefore, from that expression of his, you made the conclusion, that there had been an intimacy - there might or there might not? - A. I told him he had been the means of bringing the woman to seduction; from that time I would not speak to him; I desired him to walk out of the house; he after that came to my house, last Saturday night; he came in a quarter of an hour after Mr. Cannon did, and offered to make it up for 100 l. Mr. Cannon said he would not give him a shilling; there are other witnesses will corroborate that Mr. Cannon told me, that the prosecutor had followed him from the New Inn, in the Old Bailey, to our house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been intimate with Mr. Cannon? - A. Two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Barker admit of any intimacy between the woman and him? - A. When I said, if a man makes free with his maid, he must expect she will make free with him; he said, well, if I have, that is no reason that I should be robbed; that is all that was expressed; I saw her after wards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you ever hear her say any thing in the presence of Barker, if it was in his presence you may tell us? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You keep a public-house at Thame, in Oxfordshire? - A. Yes, I am acquainted with Mr. Cannon; I have been up to town with Mr. Cannon two or three times upon this occasion; we came merely to settle it, and at each time I saw Mr. Barker; I received a letter from Mr. Furnehough, and I think twice out of the three times I saw Mr. Barker at Mr. Furnehough's; the first time I think was on Friday, the 23d of November; Mr. Barker brought a publican that lives in Drury-lane to the Bull Inn, Holborn; I and Mr. Cannon, Mr. Barker, and that gentleman, were all four in a room; Mr. Barker proposed that I should be arbitrator for Mr. Cannon and his friend for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the accomodation proposed by Barker or by Cannon? - A. Barker said to Mr. Cannon, let us leave the room, and let these men settle it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Who first talked about settling it? - A. Barker.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Barker ever mention any specific sum of money? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they leave the room? - A. No, Mr. Cannon offered 80 l. I said, it is of no use for you to leave the room; I will not agree to any such money, and Barker said he would not take any such money; we all four left the room, and went into another; I went out a little while; they said, when I came back, that Barker offered to make it up for 200 l.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Did Barker ever say any thing to you respecting his circumstances? - A. Yes, when we went to his house, he told me that he had been ill, and that he had been robbed; he was afraid that he must call his creditors together, and he could not say whether he could pay 5 s. 10 s. or 15 s. in the pound.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he ever said any thing to you at any other time? - A. He always seemed to be very anxious to get it settled.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did not the first proposal come from the woman's brother; give me a true answer? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you and her brother go on purpose to make some offer to stop the prosecution? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the first sum that the brother offered? - A. Eighty pounds, and Barker said he would not take any such money.</p>

Yes, I went with Mr. Cannon and Mr. Fowler to Mr. Barker's house; we came to settle this business of his sister's; when we first went in, Barker knew Cannon; he said; Mr. Cannon, come in, and sit down gentlemen; we did so; then he began relating this circumstance that happened; he said his housekeeper had robbed him of five shillings that were marked, and they were found on her, and she was committed to prison; then he said he really believed he had been robbed of 200 l. and he was so reduced in circumstances, that he thought he must call his creditors together to take all he had; then he began to talk of his servant's character, and an excellent one he gave her as ever I heard; that he had trusted her with the keys of his bureau, that they both slept in one room, and that if he prosecuted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180412050049"></xptr>her he should never be happy; he pointed out there might be ways to settle it, but he must not be seen in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before Mr. Cannon had made any offer? - A. He made no offer of any thing, I was in the room at the time, I do not know that Mr. Cannon spoke, he sat crying; I asked him what way or how this could be settled; he said there was a way, but it must be kept a secret; then he asked me where we put up, I told him at the Bull Inn, in Holborn; he wished us to stop a few minutes, and he would go and speak to his attorney, he did not live far from there, he would be back in ten minutes; he went out, and came back much about the time he said he should be gone; he said his attorney did not chuse to come to the Bull Inn, in Holborn, for there were many catch-pole fellows there that catched at people's words, and his attorney was at a public-house near that place, and if we would go, he would go and shew us where he was; we went to that public-house, I do not know the sign, it was not far from his house, Barker went with us; when we got into the room, the attorney, if he was an attorney, said, Barker, you must leave the room; he left the room, and came in again; and after he came in again, nothing passed there, excepting having a glass of brandy and water, and we came away; this was on the 22d or 23d of November; when we came out of the public-house, Barker said, I will go part of the way with you, I will shew you the Bull Inn; he went all the way, we did not want him; when we got to the Bull Inn we ordered a supper, and one of us, I believe, asked him to supper; he said he would go home, and then return; he came to supper, I did not see any body with him till after supper; after supper, they all went out of the room, and where they were gone to I could not tell; after a time, I went to see where they were, I found they were in another room; I was going into the room, and Barker said, I must beg you to stop out.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were there? - A. Barker, Fowler, and Cannon, and another person, a stranger to me; Cannon said, I will leave it to you and Barker to settle it; Barker and I went out into the yard, he made proposals that if I would give two hundred pounds he would never appear against her; and when the Sessions came on, he would come down there and stop till the Sessions were over; I told him I would not agree to such sort of terms at all, and I did not offer him a farthing.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you seen him since? - A. He has been with Mr. Cannon every day since; I have seen him every day, and I have heard him talk to Mr. Cannon about settling it.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you seen him come to the Bull? - A. About twice; he came on Saturday night. Mr. Cannon was there, I was with him a little while; I was sometimes in the room with them, and sometimes out; then I heard Mr. Barker say, I will not hurt your sister, but then I did not hear the sum; Mr. Cannon said, I will not give you one farthing, she shall come and take her chance at the trial.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray Mr. Dodwell, have not you known Mrs. Wharton? - A. I have not known much of her of late years, she was bred and born in our place.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you knew her, what sort of a character had she? - A. An extraordinary character.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You came to town for the very purpose of settling it with Mr. Cannon? - A. No; he asked me to come with him.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Barker.) Did you call on Furnehough, and give him directions to write to Cannon, to come up and settle this prosecution? - A. I went by the desire of the prisoner at the bar, she desired me to go to Mr. Furnehough, that he would let her brother know what situation she was in, and get him to come up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the first proposal come from you, or from the prisoner's relations? - A. I never made any offer at all, they made it first; they never had a letter from me on the business.</p>
               <p>Q. You swear positively, that you never made any proposal to them? - A. Never; Mr. Furnehough and this gentleman, as a witness, has sworn that I followed them home; Mr. Cannon and Mr. Fowler was here till near nine o'clock, till after the three prisoners were tried for the five hundred pounds; Mr. Cannon was here, and gave the old gentleman a character; I went to the Bunch of Grapes, I asked a lame man that was in the taproom to put my beer to warm; I was here till nine o'clock, and my servant will prove that I was at home by half after nine.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Furnehough.) What time did the prosecutor come to your house? - A. I left the Court at the time Mr. Cook was being tried; I went home before the rest of the parties.</p>

The two prisoners came into my shop on Monday the 24th of April, at about twenty-five minutes after one clock; they asked to look at some white muslin. I took them into the back shop and shewed them some; they did not seem to like any I shewed them. I said would not a fine lawn do as well? They said let us look at it; they bought a yard of one piece I shewed them; I cut it off, delivered it to them, and took the money for it, which was six shillings.</p>
               <p>Which of them paid you for it? - I cannot recollect which. I said I am sorry I cannot sell you any muslin. One of them, I do not know which, said, have you got any good sprig muslin? I shewed them some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178005100067"></xptr>sprig muslins. While I was shewing them some sprig muslins the tall one, which was Rook, pulled a piece out a good deal and held it up before my face, as if to look at it; while she held it up so, I perceived something move off the counter, but could not tell directly what it was; I observed immediately almost, a motion of her legs, which was, I suppose, endeavouring to conceal the whole rapper; it was very heavy, there was thirty-five pounds worth of goods in it. I suppose she had drawn it off the counter upon the ground; it was a large rapper full of muslins; it was too heavy for her to conceal it, and I kept leaning over the counter to watch her.</p>
               <p>Did she stoop down? - She did not stoop to pick it up; I was rather flurried and probably she might observe it and might think I saw her; she did not stoop low enough to reach any thing; the tall one put her self on one side; she picked the rapper up and put it on the top of the counter, says she I wonder you keep your floor so dirty, if these things tumble down they will get dirty. I shewed them another piece of muslin; they bid me seven shillings a yard for it; while I was shewing it them the tall one held that up, as she had done the other, and said the work was not good enough; then the short one stood in about the same place were she stood before; I kept my eyes upon them and saw a piece pulled off the same as the rapper was; she moved herself about in the same manner as she had done before to secrete it; there was a chair there; she drew herself back and said she would sit down; I saw her put her hand to her pocket-hole, as if she was pulling something up; that was, I suppose, with a view to draw the muslin up; they both sat down upon the two chairs about two or three minutes, I believe; she said will you take my money? I said no. She said I will not have it if you let me go out of the shop, I will not come back if you call me back. They went out; at the door I laid hold of the little one and said, I shall be obliged to you to let me have what you have got of mine. She asked me what I meant by that? I said it did not signify I must insist upon searching them; she ran back towards the back part of the shop, as I supposed, to drop it, where she had seen the muslins. I catched hold of her and shook her clothes a little and I saw the muslin drop from under her clothes. I sent for a constable and gave him charge of the two prisoners, and delivered the piece of muslin into his care.</p>
               <p>(The muslin was produced in court by the constable).</p>
               <p>This is my property; here is my mark in two places, in both ink and pencil.</p>
               <p>What is the worth of it? - It cost three pounds.</p>

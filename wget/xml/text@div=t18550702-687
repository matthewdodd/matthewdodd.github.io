                  </hi>. I am a shipping agent, of No. 33, Trinity-square, Tower-hill. I am agent to Edward Anthony, owner of a vessel called <hi rend="italic">Britain's Pride</hi>—the younger prisoner, who is the son of the elder prisoner, was the mate, and the elder prisoner was captain—the vessel had lately arrived in London from Antigua—it was the captain's duty to make payments in Antigua, if necessary, and among other things, for stowage, and which would be allowed him in London on the production of the vouchers—the elder prisoner produced to me this receipt for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it purports to be for caulking—that might be a proper sum to pay for caulking—I told him that the bill was in his son's writing; he said that it was not—I had information which led me to believe that it was a false claim, and told him that the caulking was not done, and that the invoice was in his son's writing—he said that it had been done, and was not in his son's writing—I pointed out his son's writing in the log book, but he still denied it—I told the younger prisoner that that and other bills were in his writing, and showed him this receipt; he said that they were not—I know his writing, and believe that they are his—I know the father's writing also—this certificate of its being correct is the father's writing.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Mason's-grove, Chelsea. I went out as ordinary seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">Britain's Pride</hi>. and returned home as steward—there was no caulking whatever done while the ship was at Antigua—this receipt for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is the younger prisoner's writing; the notes and this signature at the bottom is the captain's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a ship chandler, of No. 33, Trinity-square. I said to the elder prisoner, "Your son has been making out bills here which are improper"—he said, "No; my son never made out any bills"—I said, "This writing and the writing in the log are both alike"—I had the bilk in my hands at the time, examining the accounts—he denied it again and again several times, but afterwards he said, "Well, the <hi rend="italic">stevedores</hi> account: he could not write, and asked my son to make out the account, and he did."</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">George Wheatland's Defence</hi>. This bill I know nothing at all about; there was a bill for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and something, but not this bill; this bill does not belong to me, and has no business there; it might have been delivered by me among other papers, but it does not belong to the ship at all; I signed my name to it, and so I have to other bills, but I was laid up at the time, and did not know what I did; I was ill, and attended twice a day by a doctor; I was nine days ashore; if they brought bills to me a second time I should have signed them; that is the clerk's fault; I never saw my son write a single bill; there is another bill from John Brown, which I have written to the West Indies for; it is for grocery, which I have paid for; I do not know who has got it; it has been taken from me.</p>

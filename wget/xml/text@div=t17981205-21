I saw my servant-maid with a gentleman's servant in pursait of her, I went with them and brought her back; the beadle of the parish was upon the spot, I brought her back and had her searched, but could not find the property; she was taken to Marlborough-street and committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find any of your handkerchiefs? - A. Yes, I found three of them since at a pawnbroker's; the officer belonging to the office found them.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know them again? - A. I know them no further than they were like them; the ten were all in one piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you suppose, that at the time you saw her move her arm from the window, was the time when she took these handkerchiefs? - A. Yes.(The prosecutor produced three handkerchiefs).</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen them last? - A. About a quarter of an hour before the prisoner and the other woman came in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. This gentleman called me in to know how I sold my fruit; his wife came into the shop, and said she did not want any; then I asked him to shew me some stockings, and we could not agree, and this woman, that he speaks of, came in while I was there for sixpence and six-pennyworth of halfpence, I never saw the woman before; I know nothing at all of the handkerchiefs.</p>

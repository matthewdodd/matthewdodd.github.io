On Wednesday, the 1st of May, Willis shoved the glass away from the putty and took these cards - a piece of glass had been puttied on the window, and Willis shoved it away from the putty - I was in the shop at the time; it was between nine and ten at night; I was very near the window - there were five or six candles in the shop, and right before the glass there was a candle - When he took the cards, I called out "Willis, don't take those cards;" he put his hand in and took this pack of cards - I knew him before; my daughter followed him, and called out "Willis, Willis, don't run, you have got the cards" - I had sent her after him; I did not go outside myself; I went to the door after my daughter, and could not see him then - I was startled and could not move at first - he went away quickly - I did not see Dolly myself - this was a pack of old cards put there for sale; I should have sold them for a shilling.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not you go to Willis's mother afterwards? A. I did, a quarter of an hour after it happened, but did not see her that night - I did not tell her her son must have taken the cards, because he had been seen passing and repassing; I said she knew he must have taken them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when Dolly came up of his own accord, saying he would not suffer Willis to be in custody; and there was a mistake, for it was him that did it? A. No.</p>

            . I am the daughter of the last witness. On the Wednesday night in question, I saw Willis at the window between nine and ten o'clock - I was behind the counter doing some needle-work, and he shoved away the putty from the glass, and took a pack of cards out; I saw him do it; I opened the door and he ran away; I saw Dolly following him - I ran after him, but could not overtake him; they went up Club-row - I had seen Willis before, and knew him by name; I called to him by name that night - I said, "Willis, don't run, because you have got the cards" - I had never seen Dolly before; Willis only lived round the corner of our house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it dark? A.Darkish, there was a candle just where the cards were - the window had been puttied up ever since Whitsuntide - he did not smash it, but shoved the putty from the glass; I saw him plainly - he lives about forty yards from us - I did not go to his house, but my mother did; I ran after him - my mother went to his house with the policeman - he might be twenty or thirty yards off when I got out, and his back was towards me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did either of the prisoners stand still when you went out? A. I went out about half an hour before to borrow a needle, and then saw them both standing by a lamp-post, one house from ours; I did not speak to them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long was this after you heard she had been robbed? A. Not above five minutes.</p>

            . I am a policeman. I took Dolly on the 8th of May; Willis's brother-in-law gave him into my charge on suspicion of this robbery in Club-row.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not come forward of his own accord? A. No, not to me; while I was taking him to the station-house, he told me he took the cards himself, and ran away with them - I had not asked him a question.</p>

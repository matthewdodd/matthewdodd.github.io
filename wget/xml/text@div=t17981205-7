Last Sunday se'nnight I missed five spoons out of the knife-cases, which I supposed he had neglected to clean; I asked him for these spoons just before dinner; I went into the dining-room, and still found that the spoons were not there; I then told him to bring up the silver argyle, and put some hot water into it; he told me had broke the handle of this argyle in cleaning it; I told him to bring it up as it was; he then told me that he had taken it to a silversmith to be mended; I asked him if he had taken it to Mr. Wirgman, who is my silversmith, and he said, no, he had taken them to a silversmith in Bond-street; I asked him the name of that silversmith in Bond street; he told me he did not recollect his name, but it was on the left hand side of the way; thinking this rather a mysterious kind of answer, I told him to bring up the spoons; he went out of the room, and shortly after returned, telling me that he had lent them for a pattern; this convinced me in my own mind that he had made away with these things; I then sent for another servant, and gave him a note to take to the Public-office, in Bow-street; my servant shortly after returned with two officers of the name of Carpmeal and Dowsett.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. The prisoner lived with you some years ago, before he went to live with the Bishop of Landaff? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he live with you then? - A. I think three or four years, it might be more.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he is not an Englishman, he is a German? - A. He is.</p>
               <p>Q. I need not ask you whether he had not, up to this time, managed every thing to your satisfaction? - A. Yes, he was always a very good servant.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, from a very foolish bashfulness, he did not ask you for his wages? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. They amounted up to this time, I believe, to 21l.? - A. Yes, 21l. 1s. 1d.; his wages were fifteen guineas, and money that he had laid out made that sum.</p>

               <p>Q. Would not that sum, if he had received it, have taken all these things out of pawn, and left several pounds in his pocket? - A. It would.</p>

            These spoons that you first missed, ought to have been in the knife-case in the dining-room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course when you were at home, it was impossible for them to have been long absent without your observation? - A. I should think not, but I had been absent ten weeks from town, and the prisoner with me.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the distance of time between your first speaking to the prisoner about this argyle, and the officers arriving? - A. It might be about an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. You had dined in the interval? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner had not left your house? - A. No, he had not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. When had you spoke to him about the spoons? - A. Three or four days before.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he received his wages? - </p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Oh, certainly; I did not mean to impute any thing of the kind to Col. Hewgill.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. He received them as soon as he was taken into custody.</p>

            . I am an hair-dresser, I live with Mrs. Chapple, she disposed of a lead cistern to Mr. Robinson, I saw the lead weighed at Mr. Robinson's, the weight was three quarters and nine pound, I went back and told Mrs. Chapman the weight, she told me to see it weighed again, it was weighed again, and it was the same weight, I told the man that weighed it, here is not all, here is a part cut away, I told Mr. Robinson that there was not the weight that it ought to be, Mr. Robinson had it measured, and there appeared a great deficiency, Mr. Robinson told me to come at two o'clock, and then the men would be come from dinner; I went at two o'clock, Rhodes and Croft were present, Mr. Robinson then asked them if three quarters and nine pound was the weight of the lead, they said that was all, Mr. Robinson said he doubted that was not all, they had taken part away, the said no they had not, Mr. Robinson said he thought they had taken it to Ferritt's a house, that buys and sells lead, they said no, Mr. Robinson said I am certain it is not all, what is become of it, they said if it was not all, they must have left the remaining part in Mrs. Chapple's cellar, Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181112040043"></xptr>Robinson said go and fetch it, Rhodes accordingly went I went after him, I believe he did not see me, and instead of going to our house he went up Orchard street, down Somerset-street, along Duke-street, into Oxford-street, then down James street, to where he lodged, at Mr. Ferritt's house; I then went back and informed Mr. Robinson where he was gone to, Mr. Robinson requested I would go back and see if he came out of Ferritt's house, I then went back and met him crossing North Audley Street, with the lead under his arm, I followed him in, I heard Mr. Robinson say something to him, he answered, that he had fetched it from a public-house, where he had left it for liquor. The weight of the lead that he brought back was thirty pound.</p>
               <p>Mr. Robinson. My house is three doors from Orchard Street, five doors from Mrs. Chapple's house. Rhodes brought back thirty-pound of lead.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who were the two persons that fetched the lead from Mrs. Chapple's. - A. The prisoners told me they had, and that three quarters and nine pound was the whole of the weight, they were the only men doing that work, I examined the lead that Rhodes brought back, it made out the entire cistern, the value of the lead is five shillings.</p>
               <p>The prisoners said nothing in their defence, called one witness, who gave them a good character.</p>

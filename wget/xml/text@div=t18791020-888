                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Robert Herring, a carman, of 7, Pell Street—the deceased John Robert Herring was my son; he was five weeks old—on Sunday morning, 28th September, about 2 o'clock, I was in my room, we have only one room—the prisoner was in the room, my husband, two children at the foot of the bed, and the baby at the head of the bed—my husband was sitting in a chair by the window; the prisoner was sitting on a chair close to the head of the bed with his arm on the table asleep; he was very drunk—I had occasion to leave the room—I returned in about 10 minutes, and found the prisoner lying on his back on the child on the bed—I took him by the coat and pulled him off, and told him he had killed the child—I did not think it was dead until I picked him up in my arms; I then found he was dead—he was alive when I left the room; it was a healthy child—when I said "You have killed the child," the prisoner said "Don't tell me that; how could I do it?"—the shock seemed to have sobered him—I screamed, and a policeman came—the prisoner had lodged in the</p>

On 28th September, about 3 o'clock, I was called to 7, Pell Street, and shown the body of a child; it was dead—I afterwards made a post-mortem examination—the cause of death was suffocation, blood was flowing from the nose, that would be caused by pressure; it would be consistent with a person lying on it, in all other respects the child was healthy.</p>

The prisoner was in my employ for two or three months; he was to receive money - there was 14s. 10d. due to me from Mr. Wigley, of Star-street, for bread; there was 6s. 6d. due up to the 9th of August, and the difference up to the 15th; the prisoner brought 8s. 4 1/2d. to me, and stated that it was the remainder of that bill, but he had never accounted to me for the 6s. 6d. - here are two bills in the prisoner's hand-writting for Mr. Wigley, one for 6s. 6d., and the other for 8s. 4 1/2d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Shew me those bills? A. These are them; I took up the prisoner on Saturday afternoon on the 23d of August, between four and five o'clock; he should settle every day - I have only settled with him on Saturday nights for the bread taken out on Saturday; I never to my knowledge settled any of Friday's bills with him on Saturday night; if I have, I have forgotten it; I will not swear that he has not settled the Thursday bills on the Saturday - he was the servant of my predecessor; he was about leaving me to go into the service of a person in that street - I took him because I knew no one else; I do not know that he had a considerable connexion in the neighbourhood - he was going into the service of Mr. Shaw; I owed him his week's wages, which were 15s., but he had monies standing on my books that I had lent him; I had paid him the Saturday night before - Mr. Wigley had been a customer from the time of my going there, and had been of my predecessor; I do not know that he had made a waistcoat for the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you apprehended the prisoner on that Saturday, was he told what it was for? A. Yes - I mentioned to him in the morning that he had been keeping his accounts very bad, and before he left me I should expect him to clear up his accounts - he said they were all right; he had had a sovereign of me, and had paid me money at different times - there was 3s. 4d. then left, and I owed him 15s; he had paid me the 8s. 4d., but said nothing about the 6s. 6d.</p>

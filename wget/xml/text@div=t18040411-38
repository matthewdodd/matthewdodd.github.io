             sworn. - I came with the Canterbury coach to the George and Blue Boar, on the 3d of April: I got into a Hackney coach with two trunks and a band-box, to go to <placeName id="t18040411-38-crimeloc219">No. 5, Baker-street North</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Where did you take the coach? - A. Opposite the George and Blue Boar, at about half-past six in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dark then? - A. No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner before? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. You had very little opportunity of seeing his person? - A. No farther than contending with him at the George and Blue Boar, for putting me into such a bad coach; it was dirty, and there was no handle to the door; it was fastened by a peg.</p>
               <p>Q. What time might be occupied after you got out of the coach, before you paid him? - A. I dare say ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the fare? - A. Three shillings; I gave my servant half-a-crown and a shilling, and she was to have change.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether the coachman went to a public-house to get change or not, you do not know? - A. No.</p>

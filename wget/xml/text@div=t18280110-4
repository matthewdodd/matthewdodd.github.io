            . I am the brother of George Mash - he had a black mare, marked with a blaze down the nose, a star on the forehead, and a white fetlock joint on the near hind foot - it was about fifteen hands high; I saw her safe on Sunday, the 14th of October, and missed her on the 17th- she was recovered on the 11th of November. I know the prisoner - I had seen him several times about the marsh in October.</p>
               <p>GEORGE MASH. In October last my black mare was turned out in <placeName id="t18280110-4-crimeloc17">Hackney-marsh</placeName>

I saw the prisoner on Monday morning, the 15th of October, with Newman, who was tried here; they were near the marsh, and going towards the marsh, or towards Old Ford, which way they pleased. I went to Romford fair, and when I came home on Wednesday the mare was missing - I found her at Mr. Batten's, at Brickwall, on Friday, the 2d of November; she was afterwards delivered to me, and is the same mare I lost from the marsh.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was it on a foggy morning that you saw them near the marsh? A. No.</p>

            . I am waiter at the White Hart public-house, Temple-mills, which joins Hackney-marsh - there is a road through my master's yard to the marsh. I know the prisoner very well - I saw him on Saturday, the 13th of October, with Newman and Holden, on the marsh; Newman was tried last Session. I saw them again on Monday morning, the 15th, at six o'clock; they were all three coming from the marsh, with two black horses; Newman rode one - it was a mare about fifteen hands high, with a white blaze down the nose, a white star on the forchead, and the hind fetlock white - I saw it afterwards in possession of Mr. Mash; the prisoner was riding a black horse or mare, I do not know which; Holden opened the gate for them to pass through, and afterwards shut it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did Hilt live near the marsh? A. Yes, he lives at the White Lion public-house, Hackneywick, which joins the marsh.</p>

            . I am an Inn-keeper and farmer, and live at Brickwall, Hatfield, Herts. On the 18th of October, between two and three o'clock, two black mares were brought to me by Newman and another person, whom I am told was Holden; I was here last Session, when Jilthro identified Newman at the bar; I afterwards delivered to Mash the mare described by Jilthro, and the other to Mr. Starkey's servant.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was any body with Holden and Newman? A. Not that I saw - I never saw the prisoner in possession of either of the horses; Holden seemed to exercise a mastership over them.</p>

            . I am constable of the night of Hackney. In consequence of information I looked after the prisoner, who lived in the neighbourhood of Hackneybay; he had left for a month, at least, after the robbery; I looked for him there, and at many other places, and at last found him at Paddington, on Sunday, the 16th of December, and found on him this bill, offering a reward for his own apprehension; I found him in bed at eight o'clock<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100006"></xptr>in the morning; he said, "I suppose I must get up;" I said, "You need not hurry:" he laid for half a minute, being rather surprised. I said he must go with us, and before he left the room handcuffed him; he said he would go quietly, and that he was surprised at being found there; he said he wondered how I came to know he was there. I did not either threaten or promise him any thing; he said,"I went on the marsh with Newman and the other, to catch the horses - that is all I know about it."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you had spoken to him about the horses? A. Yes; I did not ask how he came on the marsh - I am not certain whether he said Holden had employed him to catch the horses - he might have said so; I told him not to commit himself before me: he said he helped to catch them, and that was all he did.</p>
               <p>CHARLES L -. I am a horse-patrol, and live in John-street, Homerton. I was employed to look after Hilt and some others. I went with Cowling - his statement is correct.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Holden came to me on the 15th of October, in the morning, and asked me to go and help him to catch two horses in the marsh; having nothing particular to do I went - I asked why he wanted to go so soon; he said he had brought them from the fair, and expected the marsh-driver might impound them, as they were not marked; I got off my mare when I had rode about fifty yards, and Newman went away with the horses - I went on with Holden to Lea-bridge-road, stopped with him two or three hours, and did not see him afterwards.</p>

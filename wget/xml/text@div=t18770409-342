                  </hi>. I am assistant inspector of Customs, in the Port of London—I know Dowgate wharf, a portion of it is occupied by Messrs. Brefit and Co.—it is a bonded wharf, under the control of the Customs</p>

               <p>authorities and it is locked by them at night—Doherty was the foreman cooper in Messrs. Brefit's employ, and the prisoner was also in their employ subordinate to Doherty—I was on the premises on Monday, December 18th, about 4.45 p.m.—the spirit warehouse is outside, and the wine ware-house is an inner vault—I went into the wine vault and saw the prisoner and a lad named Carr about a dozen yards from him—the vault is as large as this Court—the prisoner was near a pipe of port, which was wet round the bung hole, a small tub was close to it, with fluid in it, which I after<lb></lb>wards ascertained to be water—there was a syphon and a funnel there—I said to the prisoner "What are you doing here?"—he said "I am putting a little wine into the pipe—I tasted the liquor and found that it was water—I said "It is water you are using of"—he placed both his hands in the tub, put them to his mouth and said "No, it is wine"—I made him take the tub into the small office, and took out a glass of the liquid and it was water I said "Does Doherty know this?"—Carr and Donovan both said No, we did not want him to know of it"—I afterwards guaged the pipe of port, and it was 7 gallons short, allowing 1 gallon for evaporation as it had been there two months—we allow a gallon in a year for evaporation—I communicated with the authorities in reference to Doherty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner was under Doherty's directions-Carr's age is seventeen or eighteen, he was charged, and said that he acted by Doherty's directions, and the case against him was not proceeded with—I had seen Carr there on the Saturday, doing something to the cash and liquors, and Donovan took the responsibility of it—Doherty was not there I saw Doherty on the Wednesday engaged in a certain act with some sherry—the prisoner was not in custody then—the prisoner was not given in custody till about a month afterwards—Doherty would draw samples into a bottle if he had sampling orders—the casks are guaged on impor<lb></lb>tation, but not afterwards unless something arises to call for it—other men were in the vaults occasionally—I did not hear Carr say, that if he did not execute Doherty's orders he would give him the sack, but I heard that he had said so—the water was not clean, but it was not bright—it was not like brown sherry or pale sherry—Doherty was primarily responsible for the contents of the vault—wine or spirits going in or out would come under his notice—every man engaged in the vault had his responsibilities—the charge against Doherty was being concerned in stealing 7 pints of brandy and 13 gallons of sherry—the quantity taken out as a sample is 3 gills, very nearly a pint.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. There appeared to be no wine in the water—the syphon was within a yard of the pipe of port—the pipe was 8 gallons short in two months.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the employ of Messrs. Brefit two years—Doherty was their foreman and Donovan was under him—on Monday, 18th Decem<lb></lb>ber Mr. Olds came down when Donovan and I were in the wine cellar—I did not see what Donovan was doing to the pipe of port, and did not see whether the bung was out—I heard Mr. Olds ask Donovan what he was doing there—Donovan said "I am just putting a little wine into this cask"—I saw a tub—Mr. Olds put his finger into it, tasted it, and said that it was water—I had taken the water down in a can that morning, about 8.30, and it was put into the tub.</p>

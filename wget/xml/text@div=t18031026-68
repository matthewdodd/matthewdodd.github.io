Hoares, bankers, in Fleet-street; the prisoner was with us as clerk without any salary, and is a foreigner; I gave the bill to him to take out for acceptance, and did not enquire for it next day; but in three or four days after, looking over my bills, I found this missing, and asked him if he had not called for it; he said, he had, and he had put it on my desk; I searched, but could not find it, and let some time elapse before I made further enquiry; near the time it became due, I sent to Hoare's to stop payment, and went myself the day after it became due, and found it had not appeared; I wrote to my correspondents, and applied again to Messrs. Hoares, but did not get payment of the bill; sometime after, Mr. Pearce came to town; I sent a clerk again to Messrs. Hoares, but did not get the money; at the beginning of August I sent again, and found the bill was paid; I went myself to Messrs.

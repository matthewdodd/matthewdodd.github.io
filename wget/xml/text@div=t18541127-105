                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Colcell, at Greenwich. On Tuesday, 14th Nov., I went to bed between 10 and 11 o'clock at night; before I went to bed I saw the silver spoons safe on the plate shelf—I came down the next morning between 7 and 8 o'clock; they were then gone—I also missed a piece of cheese, and a piece of pork, which had been in the safe; these are the articles—I found the safe door and the kitchen door open—they had been closed when I went to bed.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policemen, R</hi> 208). On the morning of 15th Nov., I was on duty in New Cross-road—I saw the prisoner about half past 4 o'clock, going in the direction of London—I asked him where he came from—he said, "From Woolwich"—I asked what he had been there for—he said, "Singing songs"—I asked what he had about him—he said, "Nothing"—I searched him, and found in his inside pocket these half dozen spoons—I asked him how he accounted for them—he said in walking across the road he kicked against them, and picked them up—I searched him further, and found these nut crackers—he said they were by the spoons—I afterwards found this cheese, in his outside pocket—he said he bought that—I afterwards examined the prosecutor's premises, and found some person had gone over a high wall, and then into an enclosed passage, and then into the kitchen.</p>

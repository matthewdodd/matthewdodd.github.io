                  </hi>I am a butcher, and live in Bell-street, Edgeware<lb></lb>road; the prisoner was my journeyman. On the 28th of May he went out, about seven o'clock, without permission—he came home in the morn<lb></lb>ing—he remained at my house till between ten and eleven o'clock, and then went out with a bit of meat, and never returned—I saw him at Bow<lb></lb>street next morning—I examined my drawers between two and three o'clock in the afternoon on the Friday, as a policeman gave me information—I missed 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. afterwards—it was all in sovereigns—there might be some half-sovereigns—I had counted the number of sovereigns in the bag about a week before, and there were 223—I had taken three outt and on Friday, when I counted them, there were only 190—there were thirty missing—when I went to Bow-street that night I could not see the prisoner—I went home, looked over my book, and found people had paid me 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. since I had counted the money, and I had put that in the bag—the prisoner knew where I kept the money, for he slept with me in the same room—we all lived in one room—I found a key in my shop just after he had got up one morning, three or four days before I missed my money—I tried it to the drawer where I keep my money, and it locked and un<lb></lb>locked it—it was not my key—I never saw it till I picked it up in the shop—I could identify some of the sovereigns, if I saw them—I have not seen them since—the policeman has shown me twenty-nine sovereigns—I never saw the prisoner with money—he had no money at all—he had 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week and his board and lodging, and he was paid every Sunday—he generally wanted his money before he had earned it-he was very badly off for clothes and money when he came to me—I produce the clothes he came in.</p>

About eight days before, in the afternoon—he was taken into custody on Friday afternoon, the 29th of May—I will swear it was not a fortnight before that I counted the money—I kept the money in a bag, in a, drawer, in my room—I added the 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. just as I took it—I dis<lb></lb>covered what I had lost before I was told how much was found on the prison—I carry on several businesses—if I can buy any things, and get any things out of it, I do it—I buy a cow or any thing—I have dealt in other articles, but do not now—when the prisoner was with me I sold cigars—I never sold a pocket-handkerchief in my life—I have sold brandy—I got it from a customer who deals with me—I gave 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>a bottle for the brandy—if any body wants a bottle I let them have it—I do not make a show of it—I do not advertise it—I do not ask people to buy brandy—I have sold it, if they asked for it—nobody has access to my room but the prisoner and my wife—I have no partner.</p>

               <p>one door opens into the two—my wife sits in the room where the money is kept—people who deal in brandy do not come into our parlour—a Jew named Solomon, frequently came to my shop, and he has been in my par<lb></lb>lour when I have been serving customers—he used to come into the shop when I went out—he has never watched the shop, except when there has been any body else present—I have a little boy—Solomon has watched it, to see if a customer came in—he did not serve them—he might go in and tell them I should be back directly—there is an old woman there—she was not a servant of mine, and did not watch the shop between the ime of my counting the money and missing it—she might be there, but she was not employed to watch—my wife has been poorly, and she came and did any thing for her.</p>

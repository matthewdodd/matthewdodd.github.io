             sworn. - (Produces an earthenware pint jug). On Tuesday the 1st of May, the prisoner came to me, and asked to go to the privy of my house, in King's-head-court, Holborn, she was quite a stranger to me. I never saw her before<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179805230021"></xptr>in my life; I went down with her, and she gave me this jug; she said it was of no use to her, and told me to let nobody see it; as she was coming out of the necessary I heard money chink, and she said it was what she used to keep her money in; she told me she was out of place; I asked her where she lived, and she told me at the Rose, Hatton-wall; when she went away I sent my husband to her mistress, and she was then taken, that was about two hours after she had given it me; it is a cracked jug, and particularly remarkable.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Crook. This is my jug, I know it by being cracked at the bottom with being put over the fire, and a star in the side of it; I cannot swear to any of the halfpence.</p>

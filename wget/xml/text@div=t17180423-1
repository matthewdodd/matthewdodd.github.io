             when he was examined why he staid out so late, answer'd as before, that he had carried a Gentleman,&amp;c. to White's 'chocolate-House, waited there, brought them back to Star-Court or else could have been at home two Hours sooner, and notwichstanding could get but a Shilling, which the Woman of the House gave him, and that he did believe it, was a Bawdy-house , and that he pray'd for her in his Heart. She added that talking of the Matter at another time, he said, the Gentleman had a brave Scarlet Cloak, he wish'd he had left it behind him in the Coach; upon which she ask'd him why! would he have kept the Gentleman's Cloak? That he answer'd, then he must have come after him and he would have lead his Fair, and added, if he had not come for it, it would have been brave, it would make him a brave Suit : To which his Brother-Coachman and fellow-Servant reply'd, that it would have made him a Bean Officer for King George; to which he reply'd, Ay, he should want nothing but a Sword This was confirm'd by his Fellow-Servant in Court. Upon which the Court wondered at his forgetfulness of so many remarkable Passages deposed by his Master, mistress , and a Fellow-Servant, bid him recollect himself; but still he would remember nothing. The Court then told him, perhaps he having given his Master Shilling instead of three, was the Cause of his denying it; but he caught to consider he was upon his Oath, and in a Matter of Moment, advised him in consider and speak the Truth: but still he denied it. The other Evidences that saw the Coach, when it came to Star-Court , deposed, they did believe him to be the Coachman, and describ'd his Clothes, which agreed to the Description; but still he obstinately denying it, Mary Roberts the Prisoner, that was carried in the Coach with Mr.Montens try'd out, that is the Coachman that carried us; he is the very Man, and had 3s for carrying us.

             came to his Master's House, telling him a Gentleman in such a Habit was Dead at such a House; that thereupon he ran away immediately, found it was his Master, he sealed up his Papers and things, and back and told the Family, they sent away for Mr. Bridges, a Surgeon and went away immediately to Simmerton's House. Mr. Smarts deposed, that he lodging in Mr. Mottem House, was told about 8 a-Clock in the Morning by William Limmer that a Soldier and another Man had brought the Message before related, he went down, enquired of Williams and Hutchinson , who told him the Story; he ask'd what he had about him; they said 4 Guineas, and about 4 Shi and 6 Peace in Silver, and some Halfpence, some Papers, but all was safe, it was a very honest House. Mr. Bridges deposed, that when he went he found the Prisoners there; that enquiring how it happen'd Mary Roberts said, that as she was coming with the Deceased in a Coach against St. Martins Lane be complained he was not well, desired her not to be affrighted, he was used to have fits, lean'd h is Head upon her Shoulder; that when she came to Mrs. Simmertons they got him brought in an put his to Bed, and that he never spoke more; that he viewed the Body, found a Circle about Bi Neck and a Bruise on the side of the Head, and several sses on the Breast and other parts of the Body; and said, it is plain enough how the Gentleman died: upon which Mrs. Simmerton cryed out, O Lord! I hope the Gentleman don't suspect that he has had soul play; telling a long Story of her Care and Management, saying the had sent for Two Surgeons; he acquir'd their Names, and was told one of them was Winnel , in such a Place, where they sent , but could never find him, nor could he ever hear there was a Surgeon of that Name, That upon some further inquiry Hutchinson stepp'd down Stairs, ran away, and has not been heard of by the Prosecutor since. Mrs. White deposed that Elip. Shepherd came to her that Day the Prisoners were apprehended, desiring to be entertain'd , telling her she need not be scrupal of entertaining her for she had Gold and Silver enough. Several Persons, and among the rest a Constable , appear'd in Court,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="171804230003"></xptr> and deposed , that Eliz. Simmerson had been very notorious for keeping a disorderly House, that there had been frequent Disturbances and crying out Murder.</p>
               <p>The Prisoners in their Defence pleaded as follows: Mary Roberts said, that as she was passing along near Ludgate the Deceased looked very hard upon her, and walking before her till he came over against St. Dunstan's Church, halted till she came up to him, and invited her into the Tavern to drink, but she refused; but afterwards waited on her to her Lodgings at Mrs. Simmerton's, that there they had 2 full Pots of Ale and Brandy, and then he said he had Buisness at the other end of the Town, and desired her to go with him; that they went to St. Clement's Church, where he call'd a Coach, and they went together to White's Chocolate-House, that he told her he must speak with some Gentlemen, and said he lik'd her very well, and to assure her he would not bilk her, left his Scarlet Cloak and Sword with her in the Coach, while he came again.(But this was contradicted by the Servant at the Chocolate-House, who was very positive that he had his Cloak on and pull'd it off, and laid it down while he was there.) That he staying there about an Hour and an half, she then sent the Coachman into the Coffee-house to tell him she liv'd a great way off, desired him to take his Cloak and Sword and discharge the Coach, and she would go home; but he sent her word that he would come in a Minute, and came soon after, that then he order'd the Coach to drive to TempleBar, that by the way as they were over against the New Exchange in the Strand he complained he was not well, and said, My Dear, don't you be affrighted, I am going into one of my Dumb Fits which I us'd to be troubled with; and leaning his Head upon her Shoulder, she supported him till she came to Star-Court, and then sent the Coachman to tell her Landlady to bring a Candle to the Coach, which she did, and that the Deceased remained speechless and helpless that they got a Soldier (

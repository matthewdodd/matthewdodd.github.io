             sworn. - I am an assistant constable at the Police-office, Hatton-garden: On Friday, the 24th of April, between seven and eight in the morning, I passed the prisoner at the bar in Smithfield, about half a mile from the prosecutor's; I observed both his pockets full of something; while I was looking at him, a piece of new cloth dropped from under his coat upon the pavement, which gave me some suspicion that he had stole it; I followed him to Cow-cross, and took him into custody; I asked him if he had bought that cloth this morning; he told me had; I asked him where; and he said, at the Bee-hive, in Holborn; he told me he lived in Red-lion-street, Clerkenwell; in going towards the Bee-hive, he told me it was of no use to go there, for he had not bought them there; I took him then to the office and searched him; I found a red waistcoat upon him, a shirt, and a neckcloth; I then asked him where he lived, and he said in Holliday-yard, Creed-lane; I found he did live there, and the prosecutor likewise; I learned the prosecutor was at work upon Ludgate-hill, and I went there, and he came home with me and missed the property; the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180105200042"></xptr>prisoner told me he had broke the box open with a hammer.</p>

               <p>I was employed by Mr. Sangster, on Monday, about the 2d or 3d of February, I waited several mornings in Milk-street, to watch. On Monday morning the 7th of February, at seven o'clock in the morning, I perceived a man come down the street, pass Mr. Sangster's door, and up a little court, which they call Godfry's-court, that goes out of Milk-street, he returned again very shortly, in the mean time, before he got back to Mr. Sangster's, Kirkhan came and opened the door, he came out of the door, took down one shutter, and the other man, who is the prisoner Whalley, went into the door, that was the same man that I had seen come down the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the man that went past the door and returned back again, was the prisoner Whalley? - I am. Kirkham took down one shutter and car<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190152"></xptr>ried it in; at that time the prisoner Whalley was in the house, Kirkham came out and fetched in another shutter, he carried that in and returned out again, and carried in two more; when he had carried them in I perceived the prisoner Whalley come out of the door, followed by Kirkham to the door, the prisoner Whalley came out of the shop with a bag under his arm, it was not full, but a considerable quantity of goods was in it, and it was a large bag. I immediately went and took hold of him, together with the bag, with the assistance of another gentleman, we took him to the Axe Inn. Aldermanbury, where we sent for a constable and examined the bag, where we found several pieces of muslin and some handkerchiefs; the bag was put into the hands of a constable, I delivered it there to the constable into his care.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take Kirkham into custody? - No, another gentleman took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the man any bag when he went into the shop? - No bag nor bundle, that I perceived.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I am for Whalley. This bag came out of the shop? - It did not belong to Whalley at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him carry it in? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Kirkham was in the shop at home when Whalley went first in? - Kirkham followed him in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the conversation that passed between them? - I was at the corner of Mountford's-court, not able to hear the conversation that passed between them in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. And when he went away with the bag, Kirkham followed him to the door? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. You had watched for four days before you saw Whalley? - Two or three mornings I had.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you attended the examination before the Lord Mayor? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whalley was there committed for receiving, I believe, the goods knowing them to have been stolen? - I cannot tell what he was there committed for.</p>

               <p>Sangster. One piece, I think, is my property, it is a piece of book muslin handkerchiefs, it has my private mark on it, it cost me upwards of forty shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you had it? - That I cannot be positive; the other pieces I cannot say that they are mine, only from the circumstance that they came out of my shop that morning, and I had the same in my shop, because the marks are not on them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You say that the piece that you can identify, cost a little more than forty shillings? - It did.</p>

               <p>The prisoner Whalley called three witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Kirkham. I leave it to the mercy of the Judge and jury; I have no witnesses here, I only lived with one master in Town.</p>

             I have known above this month; he came to my house about three weeks ago, and wished to lodge with me; since that time I understood that he had bought several parcels of goods, which he sold to me again. He came into my house to dinner, on the 5th of this month, and enquired whether I could lend him ten or twelve guineas or not; I told him I could not, but I could give him a draft to answer the same purpose, and he went and received it I suppose. He came home<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190154"></xptr>in the evening and informed me that he had bought goods at Mr. Sangster's to the amount of ten or twelve pounds; he then informed me he was very lame in his ancle, and could not go for them, and he desired me to go for them in the morning; I had to go to several trades people that morning, and I went to Mr. Sangster's first. My fellow prisoner, I never had seen my fellow prisoner before that morning; when I went in I enquired of him if there were not some goods left there by Mr. Simpson? he said there were, and he gave me these goods, and the draft that Mr. Simpson received of me I believe can be produced now in Court; and as for the goods I understood they belonged to Mr. Simpson, and by the papers, and the bills of parcels that were found on me, when taken, it can be proved I turned above one hundred pounds a week. I would wish to know whether Mr. Workman is in Court or not.</p>

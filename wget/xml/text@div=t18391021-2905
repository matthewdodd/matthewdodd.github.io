                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live at Brentford. Haines was my foreman, Parsons was ostler at the Castle Inn, opposite my house—last Wednesday morning, between six and seven o'clock, I went to Southall-market, and left Haines in care of my business—on my return, between eleven and twelve o'clock, my brother said something to me—I inquired of Haines what money had been taken previous to my brother's coming down—he said 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I asked what for—he said, for 1lb. 5oz. of beef-steak, which he sold to a bargeman, and 1/4 of a pound of suet, to Mr. Beacham—I said, "That can't be right, because it would come to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. "—he said he had forgotten, it was 11b. 1oz.—I asked if that was all he had sold—he said, "Yes "—my brother asked if he had sold</p>

               <p>any salt-beef—he said, "No"—I said, "How came you to bring it up before the time, from where it was kept?"—he said he had shown a piece to a person, but they did not buy any—I went over to Mr. Kelly's, at the Castle Inn, and made inquiries—I then went to Parson's house, and found some mutton, lamb, and beef-steaks there—I went home, and called Haines into the counting-house, and said, "Have you sold nothing to Mr. Kelly's ostler?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Recollect yourself, not any beef-steaks?"—he said, "No"—I returned to Parson's house, and got the meat, which, his wife said, came from my house, the beef, the steaks mutton, and lamb—I have other servants that serve when I am away, but they could not have stolen this—they were not in the shop—when I returned with the meat, I called Haines into the counting-house, and said, "This is a very pretty quantity of meat for 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—he said, "I hope you will forgive me, on account of my mother"—he was about to leave.</p>

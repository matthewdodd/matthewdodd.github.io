            . I am watch-house keeper, The prisoner was brought into the watch-house a little before twelve o'clock. He was brought in by the watchman. First of all, he wanted to give charge of Mr. Hindle, for an assault. Mr. Hindle had the watch safe before he came to the watch-house.</p>

            . I am a master grocer, in Guildford-street. Happening to read in the paper that the prisoner was brought before a magistrate for this charge, and having seen the transaction, I thought it my duty as a man to come forward. The theatre had broken up, and the prisoner and three or four men were quarreling with some girls. The watchman came up to disperse them, but they did not go on. Upon that he sprang his rattle. Then the prisoner and two or three girls walked on as far as the confectioners opposite the end of Bow-street. I turned my head for a moment, and in half a minute there was a row again; before I got close up, I saw the prisoner falling. Just as he rose the prosecutor knocked him down again; and while he was on the ground, shook him violently, and asked him if he wanted any thing more; because if he did, he would serve it out to him. I saw no watch in the transaction, nor was a word said about it then. Then the watchman came up; I was quite close to them, and the charge the prosecutor made, was, for ill using the girls, If any thing had been said about a watch, I must have heard it; but nothing about it passed,</p>

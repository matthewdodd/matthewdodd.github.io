            , a Soldier, coming by them, desired them to make way that he might come by, which they refused, damning, and swearing great Oaths; and the said Quoyne interposing, they made two passes at him, upon which the Deceased cried out; then they followed him, he running from them to save his life, and fell down upon him, and stampt upon his Breast, and Head, crying out, God damn him, is not the Dog dead yet? There were several other Evidences that gave the same Account, how that the Prisoners both pursued the said Quoyne, and Carter was seen to run him into the Belly, upon which he dropt down dead, and the blood gushed out at his Mouth by the force of Carter's trampling upon him; this was the Evidence for the King. The Prisoners were demanded what they could say in their defence; Carter said, That he being coming out of the Necessary House, he saw several of the Soldiers about Nichols with their Swords drawn, and he coming to his assistance, the Deceased struck at him with a Sword, to save which blow, he held up his Arm, and received a wound from him upon the same (which he shewed in Court); then he retreated to some adjacent Pales, and set his back against them, and then the Deceased coming after him, he drew his Sword to defend himself, which he called some Witnesses to arrest; Nichols alledged to the same purpose, how that the Soldier Casey challenged him to fight; and told him, that he deserved to be knocked off his Horse, for that his Horse stood cross the Gate-way, which hindered the Soldiers passage, which he had Witness to attest; and that there were almost 20 Swords drawn upon them at the latter end of the Fray; and if they had not made opposition, they might have been killed, &amp;c. So the Court directed the Jury, in point of the Evidence on both sides; telling them, That there was no doubt to be made, but that Quoyne was kill'd by the  hands of the Prisoners; but the Evidence was not full enough to make it Murther; So they were both found <rs id="t16930531-27-verdict128" type="verdictDescription">

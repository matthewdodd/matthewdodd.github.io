I have lived there thirty-one years; I live alone; my apartment is a detached building adjoining the Palace, in what is called Tennis-court-lane; it is within the walls of the Palace; I pay no rent for it; I hold it by permission of the Lord Chamberlain and the Office of Works - it has a separate entrance. On Sunday, the 23d of October, between twelve and one o'clock in the day, I was sitting by the fire reading, in what I call my sitting-room, on the first floor; the bell rang with a sharp pull; I got up out of my chair, went to the side-window, which looks into Tennis-court-lane. If I am at home on Sunday, I make<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270055"></xptr>it a rule not to answer the people, unless I know the people who ring; I saw two men, and not knowing them, did not go to them; I waited at the window to see when they went away, to be certain they were persons I did not know; and while I was watching I looked out at the other window, which looks towards the Palace - they rang again in about five minutes, with a sharp pull; I did not answer it, and presently afterwards heard a noise below - I listened attentively, and thought it was like a person trying to open the door; I listened more attentively, and was convinced they were trying to open the outer door; I came away from the window; there is a door on the top of the landing-place - that door leads into a small passage, and in that passage are two doors - the key of the door was outside; I gently opened that door, took the key out, shut the door, slipped the private bolt under the lock, and sat down again for a short time. I heard them forcing the door on this landing-place of which I had bolted and brought the key in, and perceived that they were trying to come in, and I thought they would come into the room where I was. I got up out of my chair, went to my sitting-room door, waited there, and put my finger under the bolt of the lock, to keep it fast - there was no key to that lock, the bolt was the only security. After standing a little while with my finger under the bolt, I heard a crush of the outer door, on the landing, forced - it came open; I then heard a noise against my room door, and saw a little instrument, like a chisel, appear through the edge of the door, and saw part of a skeleton key in the key-hole; and as that would not open the lock, it was withdrawn, and that, or another, made its appearance in the lock, and was withdrawn - then a third made its appearance, and after that, this instrument was tried higher up the door - it did not succeed; I then saw another instrument put in, and the point of that made me know it was my own screw-driver, which I had seen last on the stone-landing, outside this door, which enters into the passage - that would not open the door, and the first instrument was withdrawn - the screw-driver remained in the door; they made another purchase, the screw-driver was withdrawn, and put in again edgeways; several forces were given against the door, and at last it was burst open; they were about five minutes in getting the door open; I caught hold of the nob of the lock, opened the door, and said, "What do you do here?" I saw Lowe standing upright - he put his hands up, gave a turn round, and Roberts came out of a little room on the landing, which I have not described yet, and, as Lowe turned round, Roberts passed him, and went down stairs; Lowe followed him, and I followed Lowe immediately; they went down Tennis-court-lane, towards the barracks, at a bit of a run; I followed them, and before I met any body, Lowe stopped doubled his fist at me, and said, "You shall not pass;" (Roberts was on before) I said I would; he said, "You shall not pass; I said, "I will," and did pass him, and after that Roberts turned round, doubled his fist at me, and said, "You shall not pass;" I said I would, and got before him. I was going to give the alarm to the soldiers. They did not offer any violence to me as I passed them. I met one Adams, and said, "Two thieves have been breaking into my house;" they were near enough to hear it. Adams said he would take them, but they turned back from him, and went by a mason's shop, got on some stones on the tiling, and over that is a garden; they returned from the top, and came back again; Adams had got up after them; I had by that time got to some soldiers, and said to them, "Here are two thieves, who have been robbing my house, here they are;" and when they came down from the tiling, they passed Adams and me, and came among the soldiers, but they would not lay hold of them; they walked on to get out of the Palace, and then got into the barrack-yard; I lost sight of them at Hampton Court Bridge; I had given an alarm all the way till I lost them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. From the first time your door was burst open, till you finally lost sight of them, how long were they in view? A. I suppose above a quarter of an hour - I am quite sure the two prisoners are the men - I never lost sight of them for three hundred and thirty yards, and saw them in custody in about three quarters of an hour - I had seen Green before I lost sight of them - I knew them again when they were taken. On returning to my house I found two drawers had been pulled half-way out - I kept keys, and old springs, and smiths' tools in those drawers - a little box stood on the ground, with a key in it - three shirts, three neck handkerchiefs, and two pairs of stockings, which had been in that box, were pulled out, and laid on the ground by the side of the box - it was dirty linen - I had put some of it into the box that morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. I think you say your's is a detached house, but attached to the Palace? A. I mean to say it is attached to the Palace wall - it is a house by itself - there was nobody in it but me - it is a rule with me not to answer the bell on Sunday - I do not answer people out of the window, except I know them - I did not know whether, if I gave an alarm, they might not break in and do me a mischief - I could see nobody to give an alarm to - there are no sentinels about, except in the evening - I was a good deal alarmed and agitated - I was absent from the house about half an hour - I left all the doors open, but I got Adams to look after the house - I had not got out of the house many minutes before I saw him - he did not join in the pursuit, but went to look after my house - I found every thing right, but the dirty linen was moved - it was laid loosely down by the side of the box - there was not time to pack it up - it was a small box, about fourteen inches by twelve - I am a working smith - it was dirty linen, and old - it was as dirty as linen generally is - I intended to use it again when washed, but it was not my best.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Were you not reported to have a good deal of money in your house? A. It was understood so.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Does nobody live in the house with you? A. No; a woman comes twice a week to clean the apartments - there is nobody in the house but myself on Sundays at all.</p>

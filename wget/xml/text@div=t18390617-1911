About half-past four o'clock in the morning of the 22nd of June, I and my husband were in bed—I saw the prisoner standing at the head of the bed—I crouched down, and awoke my husband, who said to him, "Come out, and let me see who you are"—he came out, and my husband asked what he did there—he said, "I don't know, I have come up here, and lost my way in the dark"—my husband let him go—we then missed 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper money off the table—I went after him, overtook him, and gave him in charge—he was taken to the station-house, and I saw a dozen and half of pencils and 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper taken from him—the pencils were on another table when we went to bed, and the door shut—I missed a handkerchief off a chair, and a pair of stockings from the floor—the door fastens with a latch, and I had put a chair against it—I went to bed about half-past twelve o'clock—the door was open when I saw him.</p>

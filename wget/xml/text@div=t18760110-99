I am a cabdriver of 52, Vauxhall Bridge Road—on 16th December the prisoner hailed me at Charing Cross and asked me how much I would take him to Kensington for—I said "Two shillings"—he replied "That will do," and I drove him there—at the end of the journey he said "What is your fare?"—I said "Two shillings"—he said "You said half a crown"—I said "No, two shillings"—he gave me three shillings, which I put into my pocket—they were bad—I kept my eye upon him and looked for a constable—he returned to me and said "Where are you going to now?"—I said that I was going to remain to give my horse a rest—he offered me a shilling to take him to Earl's Court Road—he got into the cab and stopped at a public-house and at a baked potato stall, where I saw a police-sergeant and gave him in custody, with the three shillings.</p>

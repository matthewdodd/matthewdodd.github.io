                  </hi>. I am bailiff to Mr. John Wean, of Oxley-lane.

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Tooke, Hallows, and Price, solicitors, in London. I reside at Pinner—I am principally engaged in London, in the day time—the prisoner has been in my service some time, as bailiff—his wages for the last year and a half have been a guinea a week—his son was employed by me, at about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week—he had beer, and milk, and other things, besides his wages—his duties were general supervision; seeing that the men did their work—looking after the stock; and to sell the stock—if he did sell the stock, it was his duty to make a return of the money in the weekly account—I have all the accounts down to the time when he left—I was not much in the habit of going to the land; it was at a considerable distance from my house—I was in the habit of being furnished with papers of the kind I have in my hand—it was his duty to put down all moneys received in them; and if he received 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Golding on 30th Dec., he ought to have put it here—there is no account rendered of it; nor of Golding's beasts having been upon the land; nor of the grass having been taken by Mr. Golding—I have never received the sum of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long has the prisoner been your bailiff? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Six or seven years; his wages at first were 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per week—there was no understanding, that if more land was taken there should be an increase—at first there was a small garden to his house—I allowed his boy 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a week—his wife conducted the dairy—she had nothing—part of the land was let at one time—he has more now to look after than at first, perhaps about sixty acres more—he has now a guinea a week, the father 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the son 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—some time back, I took up the lime business—he had also to attend to that, I am not prepared to say the average that he had to pay weekly; it was sometimes 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in the year 1853, as much as 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. may have passed through his hands—I have examined his weekly accounts—I have no other books—there are not sums put down, without saying from whom they were received—the number of labourers he had to pay varied—the number of acres is about 250—his duty was to see to all the accounts, pay the labourers and workmen, and take care of the lime as well—he never denied that he had received the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; nor the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there has been something said by his attorney, about settling the accounts—there were no accounts to settle—he did not say if there was anything wrong, he was ready to make it all right—the only offer I have had, has been through his attorney—I received a letter from his attorney—I did not agree that the accounts should be looked into, and nothing further proceeded with—I do not know that the prisoner has expended sums that he has not accounted for—I do not know of 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to a Mr. Pugh, and 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to a Mr. Page, for oats—I do not know that there is 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., that he has not credited himself with—I have no accounts but the weekly accounts—I have not heard of this 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and so on—supposing the accounts had been correct, there would have been 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due to the prisoner—he has had garden produce, for taking away the garden from him—I have heard that he claims from me as much as 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

               <p>Mr. Trebeck. May it please your Lordship. Gentlemen of the Jury: In this case, the prosecution brings before you two persons, one of the name of Nathaniel Wood, and the other of James Knewland; it brings before you, likewise, the master of one of those shops, which the public have called auction shops; and it likewise brings before you, his servant. The charge stated in the indictment against them is, that they have committed a robbery upon the person of

            , by taking from her 1s. violently, and putting her in fear.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the circumstances of this case have been but too much laid before the public already; and as the prisoner's counsel have not the power of addressing any thing to you upon the facts, I have only just to entreat you, that any reports, or any circumstances which may have been brought before the public, may have no sort of impression upon your minds; I am persuaded they will not; but I know it is absolutely impossible for the most honest mind, not to receive impressions from stories they have heard and read.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, according to the old law, the definition of robbery, as far as I understand it, is, that he who takes from another, his money or goods violently from his person, and puts him in fear, is guilty of a robbery.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, since that concise definition of the crime of robbery, a variety of cases have been tried, and a variety of decisions have been had upon these cases; it has been determined, that there is no necessity for actual violence, and no necessity for actual existing fear, but that a reasonable fear of danger and constractive violence is sufficient to support this indictment.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, luckily for the public, a few years ago, a case came before this Court, upon which some doubt was entertained, the case went before the Judges, and luckily, I will say again, for the public, a larger definition, of the crime of robbery, was delivered in this Court, as the unanimous opinion of all the Judges; and, Gentlemen, left I should make any mistake in stating that definition of robbery, I will take the liberty of reading it to you."Hickman's Case, Leach 257. The true"definition of robbery is, the stealing, or taking, from"the person, or in the presence of another, property of"any amount, with such a degree of force, or terror, as"to induce the party unwillingly to part with his pro-"perty; and, whether the terror arises from real or"expected violence, to the person, or from a sense of"injury to the character, the law makes no kind of"difference."</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, having stated to you, what certainly now is the correct definition of the legal word robbery, I shall proceed to state to you what are the circumstances of this particular case, that you may sit those particular circumstances to the definition I have laid before you. Gentlemen: It happened, that on the 5th of this month, a young woman, of the name of Wilson, had got to that part of the Strand which is near Temple-bar, and near the door of one of those shops called Mock Auction Shops, was accosted, by the prisoner Wood, as I am instructed, with "Pray, Ma'am, walk in;" she said, she did not want to walk in, she wanted to go about her business; but getting her nearer and nearer the door, he hustled her, and got her into the shop. Gentlemen, you will judge what kind of alarm that was likely to excite in her; she went in, and the civility and attention of every person in the shop appeared to be directed to her; and she discovered a person in a box, like an auctioneer's box; a person, who was sitting at a table, asked her to bid; she said, she did not want to bid; he then said, "Oh, do bid, there is a person at your left-"hand, or your right-hand, who will bid after you;" and, in short, "you must bid, you must bid." She, by this time, was considerably alarmed; and to get rid of that alarm, and likewise to get her liberty, as she will tell you, she was induced to bid; she was under greater apprehension at this time than before; for, by this time, the prisoner Wood was in the shop, and had shut the door; the door was shut upon her, and she was confined in the room.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, she thinking that some person would bid, bid sixpence; upon which, the person in the box instantly knocked down the lot at 14s. 6d. Gentlemen, no bidding, that she knows any thing of, or, I believe, will be proved by any body, had taken place before; and it was knocked down at 14s. 6d.: then the prisoner Knewland, is introduced to you; for when that was done, he said, Ma'am, you are the purchaser; the lot is knocked down, and you must pay for it; she said, it was a great shame, to use a servant in that way, she had bid only sixpence, it was not her lot, and it was using her very ill; the man said, you must pay, or you must leave half-a-guinea, or the parcel which you have brought with you; if you do not, I will send for a constable; he immediately, then, pretended to send for a constable; and a constable, or a pretended constable, was sent for; during the time the constable was gone for, he said, if you do not pay this half-guinea, or leave the bundle, the constable shall take you to Bow-street, and from Bow-street you shall go to Newgate; then, a person, who pretended to be a constable, came in; and, I should tell you, now, Gentlemen, that that constable we have not been able to find: when he came in, the prisoner Knewland, immediately said, take that woman to Bow-street;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130135"></xptr>upon which, without making any enquiry into the charge, or what he was to do, he bustled about, and said, I am in a great hurry, I must have a shilling, that is my demand, and if you can settle it, if Mr. Knewland gives consent, my demand is a shilling, give me that and you shall go. Gentlemen, upon that, being alarmed, as she will tell you, by this whole transaction, and for the purpose of getting her liberty, and for fear of going to Bow-street, and afterwards to Newgate, she delivered a shilling to the pretended constable, and that is the shilling which these two prisoners are indicted for robbing her of.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, these are all the facts with respect to the robbery; and give me leave, now, to say, that I apprehend the law upon this subject to be this, that if you shall be persuaded that the prisoners at the bar, in conjunction with this person that obtained the shilling, did introduce strangers into that shop, and by means of menaces and force, to obtain money from them, putting them in fear, or with such circumstances of terror as I have related to you, that that will be a sufficient degree of terror to support this indictment, and that it will be perfectly immaterial, if you believe them to be in concert together, whether either of the prisoners took the shilling or not; that I apprehend to be the law upon this subject.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, supposing you should not be of opinion that there were such circumstances of terror and such circumstances of fear, in this case, as to satisfy the charge of robbery, still there remains a considerable degree of crime behind, that will be for you to determine upon; there still remains behind, the larceny, and if you should be of opinion, that these three men together, or either of the prisoners, or both, were present, when this money was taken away, and consenting to the taking, with an intent feloniously to steal that shilling, then they will be answerable, as I apprehend the law to be, for the case of felony.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I must now make one observation with respect to

            , the prosecutrix; - you will have only her testimony, with respect to these facts, and if those facts are true (and under the circumstances, I think you will be of opinion, that it was impossible you could have any other); as to the intention of the prisoners, you will be considerably assisted by the one other witness, who will be called to you, upon this indictment; a person of the name of Knight; for she after the transaction, was over, went to her relation, a person of the name of Knight, and desired his assistance; he returned back to the shop, and charged them with this robbery; upon which, some one person, I am afraid we shall not be able to establish who that was, but certainly some one who knew of the transaction, put a shilling into his hand, as if, by returning the shilling, that would cancel the offence that was committed before, but that certainly is not law. Gentlemen, this person looked at the shilling, found it a bad one, and he gave him another; he looked at that, perhaps for the purpose of seeing more accurately into the shop; having got the shilling, now, says he, I will shew you the way to Bow-street; he kept his word, and they were taken to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I have stated this at length, for this reason, that it has gone abroad, that this is a new case certainly it is a new case, as far as the facts go, but shall maintain, in case any objection should be taken that though these are new facts, they come within th reach of old law; you will hear the facts of the case-you will have the law laid down by the learned Judg who presides-and you will determine upon the facts according to your own consciences, agreeable to tha law. and the Country, I am sure, will be satisfied wit your decision.</p>

I then live in Milford-lane; I had been in Holborn, and wa going home through Temple-bar; I was walkin past the auctioneer's door, in the Strand, I don know the number, it is near Temple-bar; I wa stopped by the prisoner Wood; he said, pray ma'am walk in; I said no, I did not want to go in, I ha rather not; he said, walk in ma'am, and have look, there is no harm in having a look; upon that he shoved me pretty near to the table.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you walk in? - A. He shove me in; I saw some knives and forks upon the table there was a great company in the shop.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How many people do you think ther were? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Ten, or a dozen? - A. More than that; ther might be pretty near twenty.</p>
               <p>Q. Among them, did you see either of the prisoners? - A. Yes, the prisoner Knowland; he wa at my left-hand, at a little distance.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he doing any thing? - A. A young ma came forward to me with a knife and a fork, which he put in my hand; I said, I did not want it, would rather not.</p>
               <p>Q. That was neither of the prisoners? - A. I was not; says he, you must bid before you can obtain your liberty again.</p>
               <p>Q. When that was said, were either of the prisoners near enough to hear what was said? - A. Knewland was; I said, I would rather not bid, I did not want any thing; he expressed it again; I said, I won't bid, nor I would not have come it if I had not been forced; there was an elderly gentleman at my right hand, and the young man said pray ma'am make haste, you detain the company that gentleman who is near you will bid after you.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he point to any person at that time? - A. He did, to an elderly gentleman at my right hand, whom I don't know; then I found I was not to have my liberty till I bid.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you attempt to go away? - A Yes; but I was surrounded by the company in the auctioneer-room.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130136"></xptr>Court. Q. In what manner? - A. They stood round me; and said, I could not obtain my liberty till I had bid.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door shut? - A. At that time it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you bid? - A. When I found I could not have my liberty without bidding, and finding what place I had got into-</p>
               <p>Q. Did you bid? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How much did you bid? - A. Sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. What induced you to bid that sixpence? - A. Finding what place I had got into, and finding I could not obtain my liberty if I did not bid, I bid sixpence, thinking to obtain my liberty; when I had done, I was then turning about to come away, and was stopped by Knewland, and the other young man.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't mean the other prisoner? - A. No; then, before I had my liberty, the auctioneer knocked them down at fourteen shillings and sixpence; upon which Knewland said they were mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Knewland touch you? - A. He did not, then.</p>
               <p>Q. But he said they were knocked down to you? - A. Yes; I refused to pay for them; I told Knewland I had not got the money, neither would I pay for them; Knewland said he must have the money; they were knocked down to me, and he must have it.</p>
               <p>Q. Repeat what Knewland said? - A. When he knocked them down, he said they are your's; I refused to take them, and he said I must have them; upon which I said, I had not the money, nor could I get it; Knewland then said; he must have his money, they were knocked down to me; I told him it was a shame to take in any person in any such manner; I was a servant out of place, and I would not have come in if I had not been forced in; nor should not have bid if I not been forced.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time was the door shut; - A. It was not yet; I had a bundle upon my left-arm; Knewland said, if I could not pay all the money, I must either leave my bundle, or pay half-a-guinea till I could raise the remainder part of the money, both of which I refused; then Knewland ordered the door to be shut, and a constable brought; but, before that, Knewland said that I should go to Bow-street, and from there to Newgate till I could raise the money; then Knewland ordered the door to be shut, and a constable brought; which was done.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect, as well as you can, when Knewland sent for a constable, what he said? - A. He ordered the door to be shut, and a constable brought. to take me to prison.</p>
               <p>Q. During this time, where was Wood? - A. Wood came in when the constable came in; I did not observe Wood till then.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who shut the door? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body in this company the took your part? - A. I had no body but myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did no body take your part in the shop? - A. No; there was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did this constable come; - A. Yes; and when the constable came, Knewland had one hand upon my shoulder, and the other upon the bundle.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. When the door was shut, did any body express a desire to go out of the room through fear? - A. I did not observe that any body did Knewland gave me a shove towards the constable and said, now, here is the constable, take her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the constable enquire what the charge was? - A. Knewland desired him to take me to Bow-street, and from there to Newgate.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time, was Wood within hearing? - A. He was, when the constable came in.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was he to you? - A. Two or three yards from my right-hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take any part? - A. I did not heard that he did.</p>
               <p>Q. When the constable came in and that order was given, what took place? - A. The constable said, what is it to do? and Knewland repeated what he had said before, and the constable said, I must be paid for my trouble, I cannot stay, I am upon other business; I told the constable my situation that I had no money, neither could I get it; he said, then I must go with him, or otherwise give him a shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. When the constable said that, where was Knewland? - A. Where he was before, with one hand upon my parcel, and the other on my shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pay him any thing? - A. I did; I paid him one shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you pay that shilling? - A. Because I was in bodisy fear of prison, and did it through thinking I should obtain my liberty then, and I did then obtain my liberty.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us your reason for giving up that shilling? - A. Because I was afraid of prison, and thinking I should obtain my liberty.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had paid that did Knewland leave go your bundle? - A. Yes; the constable said, it Knewland had a mind to release me, he had nothing more to do with it.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had paid the shilling, did you go? - A. The door was opened to let the constable out, and as I was going out, Wood said, where would you come for the knives and forks; I made no reply to him, I was so glad that I had got my liberty.</p>

            , spinster, make an assault, putting her, the said Sarah, in corporeal fear and danger of her life, and 1s. the monies of the said Sarah, did violently steal, take, and carry away. My Lord, the evidence here goes, I don't say to prove no offence whatever, but not to prove the offence here charged.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I believe there is nothing which has been more lamented than the possibility that the construction of felony should be extended beyond what the law originally intended. My Lord, it has been apprehended, that some constructions of felony that have been taken up unadvisedly, have been acted upon; and certainly it has been lamented, that the old definition originally given, has been in any instance departed from, and if we depart from it in any instance, though in the smallest possible degree, we get further and further, till at last we lose fight of the old original line of common law, which is the only true line to go by. My Lord, this is an indictment for robbery. The definition of robbery is, taking by force and violence, and that force and violence, putting in fear constructively, for that has always been held to be something drawing apprehension for some personal safety, with only one exception, in which that proposition has been at all deviated from; an exception which one does not wonder nor lament that it is an exception from the general rule, which is in the case of that fear which is naturally brought upon a person, by the threat of an accusation of a nature too horrid almost to conceive. It has been held, that that would operate upon the firmest mind that could possibly he created; that the dread of such an accusation does so far amount to a dread of personal violence, that it is that kind of violence which no person can resist, which no person could repel the exercise of by the sacrifice of any property whatever; but, I take it, that the only violence here complained of, is a violence, as they say, to get money; and to get money under this sort of fear, a fear of imprisonment. Now, my Lord, I take it, a fear of imprisonment never was the contemplation of the law, under which the parting with property should amount to a robbery. My Lord, the indictment always charges, and what the intent of the law is, certainly is well col<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130138"></xptr>lected from the uniform and constant course of precedents; the uniform and constant course of precedents is this, that they did put the party in bodily fear and danger of his life, which shews that kind of fear which the law expected to be excited, and that kind of fear that operated upon the party to part with that property, which should constitute a robbery; the prosecutrix expressly negatives that her fear was of that kind; for, if we take the facts from which the fear arises, she says, they put me in bodily fear; not stopping there, which might be construed into robbery, but a bodily fear of prison are the very words made use of: she further says, that the threat was this-that the constable should carry her to Bow-street, and from thence to Newgate; that is to say, that he shall first of all carry her before a Magistrate, to make some complaint against her, the nature of which is not apprehended, but which is to grow out of the transactions there arising; refusing to accede to the contract, after having bid for the article; the threat is, that she is to go to Bow-street, and from thence to Newgate; by which, Bow-street, she seems perfectly to understand, was meant, that he should carry her before some Magistrate. Now, shall it be said, that the fear of being carried before any Magistrate, to have any complaint investigated, excepting only that which I have mentioned, so terrible in its nature, and which your Lordships have construed to amount to a threat of personal danger; can it be supposed, that upon any constant mind whatever, such a fear of being carried before a Magistrate, and from thence to prison, which never can prevail, unless it should be proper so to send the person, can it be supposed that this shall operate in constantem virem? Every loose apprehension is not to be considered such a putting in fear as shall make the person's life pay the forfeit, says Lord Hale, in many places; I need not recite the passages, because they are in your Lordship's memory: it must be such a fear as is to fall in constantem virem. Now, my Lord, I ask, what is this but a conspiracy? if all these facts be true, a gross conspiracy, certainly to induce a person, first of all to come into an auction shop, where she was not imprisoned, where the whole public were passing, the door not shut; this is the first beginning of the transaction: then there is a conspiracy certainly, to persuade a foolish girl, that she is to bid; very dishonestly, I admit, and very culpably, to persuade a poor foolish woman to bid sixpence, and then to make her pay for a lot of goods that were not worth so much; but there is no pretence, that it was any thing but a stratagem to induce her to purchase a lot of goods; for, when she was going away, they call to her, When will you call for your goods? it is not taking money from her by violence; the only thing attempted was, to induce her, by a conspiracy and plan, to purchase this article of goods. Then, my Lord, at the time this takes place, she parts with the shilling; it is a demand made by the constable; I do not mean to say, a legal demand, but a demand made by the constable, as a pretence of satisfying him for his trouble; and then he would let her go: but, my Lord, at the time she delivers that shilling, it seems, that it is to pay the constable for his trouble, upon going away; that therefore, the only fear she ever had upon her mind was, of being carried to Bow-street. We have had the case of Hickman alluded to, in which is that only exception, in which the law may be said to deviate from the common understanding of the common law, if it does deviate at all; and there, the Judges resolve, that such a horrid threat, as I have alluded to, is equal to any fear of bodily danger; but what is more, it says, the fear, if not a fear of life, shall at least amount to such a fear as should rather make a man desire to sink into the grave for ever, if possible, than to have such an imputation go abroad against him; but that is the only exception; and the Judges are speaking of the law, as relative and applying to that single case; I think, the fear there excited is such, that a person can never possibly shake of the evil; it is impossible to get rid of the evil. But what is the case here? Is it not possible to get rid of the imprisonment, by an appeal to the Country? to be carried before Magistrates, charged with no possible crime, nothing that can affect her reputation; nothing is alledged against her, that can lay the smallest stain upon her character; the threat was, to take her before some Magistrate, from whom we have a right to receive justice; but the man says, "if you do not give me one shilling, I will send you to jail;" I should like to hear some such case quoted from the common law, that the mere naked threat, of carrying a person to jail, without taking violently from the person; I mean the mere naked threat of carrying a person to jail, by which, and which alone, the party parts with his property, was ever ruled to be a highway robbery. I defy them to produce such a case; I am sure, that even the reading of your Lordships, or the reading of those who have sat upon the bench longer than your Lordships, never can supply such a case as that.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I remember a case, in which a bailiff had a woman in custody-says he, you shall give me something to drink; and immediately put his hand to her mouth, and wrenched a shilling out of her manuel custody; and he handcuffed her to another person; but here there is no such thing; the woman, from the sole apprehension of being carried before a Magistrate, has the shilling taken from her; and the only violence is, that which your Lordships must make a constructive violence; that the threat of being carried to jail, shall operate upon a person of a constant and firm mind, to make them, by that threat, part with money.</p>
               <p>Now, my Lord, with respect to the other part of the case, it is said, that if it is not a robbery, it is a larceny: why my Lord, I shall humbly contend, that it is a robbery, or it is no felony; it is certainly a bad offence, and the parties are likely to be severely punished for it, and nobody will lament it: but how is the definition of larceny to take place here; larceny is, a taking, against the will of the owner; but, my Lord, here is no taking, here it is an actual delivery; if that delivery is so far forced from the party, that he cannot help delivering it, it is the same thing as if you take it out of his pocket; and that will constitute a robbery, because you make him deliver that money through fear; therefore, I humbly contend, that there is no shade of difference between a violent taking, and a taking; it is a violent taking arising from these constructions, out of these facts; or it is nothing at all; it appears to me,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130139"></xptr>therefore. that there is no prteence at all, under these facts, for the charge of larceny.</p>
               <p>My Lord, these are the observations which I felt it my duty, in a case alledged to be new, and which certainly is new, to lay before your Lordship. I beg pardon for having taken up so much of your Lordship's time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. My Lord, I am also of counsel with Mr. Knowlys, in this case, for the prisoners at the bar, and I find myself in the situation, that those frequently are, who follow on such subjects, that there is very little left them to observe; the little, however, that occurs to me, I will trouble your Lordship with very shortly.</p>
               <p>With respect to the last part of the case, that Mr. Knowlys has alluded to, whether it is a larceny or not; it appears to me to be so clear, that it would be the most idle thing in the world to attempt to maintain, before so high a tribunal, that the taking any thing from a person, whether by violence or threat, is not a larceny; it can be nothing but a robbery, certainly.</p>
               <p>With respect to the other parts of the case, the two leading cases that we have, namely, those alluded to by Mr. Knowlys, go extremely beyond the present; one of them is the case of Gascoigne, in Mr. Leach's book, 234.</p>
               <p>Lord Chief Baron. That is an extremely impersect case.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. It is so, my Lord; but even there, it was of a person in custody; of a man who called himself a constable, who not only took the shilling out of her hand, but it was coupled with another circumstance, that he hand-cuffed her, and carried her to prison, without the authority of a Magistrate; and, in the course of their journey to prison, he took from her pocket other money, which he had heard rattle; and there, I find, it was the opinion of the Judges, that it was a robbery, because the Jury found, that the prisoner had shewn an original intention, to take all the money she had; that was a part of the finding; for, he not only wrested the shilling out of her hand while she was hand-cuffed, but shewed an original intention of taking all she had. My Lord, that case is so dissimilar to the present, that it is hardly worth observing upon, because, in the present case, I am not going to say, whether it is a conspiracy, or false imprisonment, to extort money, or what it is; it is sufficient for me, if I shew, that when carried to its utmost extent, it is not the crime with which they have charged the two prisoners at the bar; and they were so convinced of it, that they have since been better advised, and have got a bill found against them for a conspiracy and assault; for that is the only offence for which these men can be punished, if they can be punished at all; because, here your Lordship fees the only intention, in the party accused, was, to make her purchase goods, and that appears all through the case; for, the last thing one of the men said, was, when will you come and take away your knives and forks.</p>
               <p>My Lord, the other case is, that of Hickman, and, I believe, the principle of all the cases that have been decided under such circumstances, has been intended merely to have operation in one of these two ways, either parting with property from violence, or from a sense of injury to the character, which is rantament to violence, and perhaps involves every other injury a man can sustain; but, under neither of these descriptions, do the prisoners come; the latter is the only instance, in which such construction was ever put upon it; there is no other case whatever, in which the construction has gone the length of accusing of a highway robbery; but, in this case, it appears from the evidence, that all the threat was, the taking her before a Magistrate, and from there to prison; and, their being told afterwards, that they would shew them the way to Bow-street, perfectly shews, that she knew how she was to apply for redress; and your Lordship observes, this is a transaction, the whole of which passed while the door was open, close to Temple-bar, at twelve o'clock at noon; had she apprehended any injury to her person, the least noise would have brought protection to her; but, in the other cases that have been ruled, there has been no such protection at-hand; for, in those cases, instead of applying for redress, wishes to avoid the publication, and by that means, is shut out from all protection, that is always the case, where it is ruled to be a highway robbery.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I am very sorry to have taken up so much of your Lordship's time, after Mr. Knowlys has gone so very fully into it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Trebeck. My Lord, in answer to what has been said, by the learned gentlemen who are of counsel for the prisoners, I shall trouble your Lordship shortly, and answer them as fully as lays in my power.</p>
               <p>In the first place, what a bill found at the Clerkenwell Sessions for a conspiracy, or an assault, has to do with this, I cannot tell: I am sure it will be determined, that the question of conspiracy has nothing to do with it. I stated to the Jury, that unless they believed that these people were conspiring together, to effect this felony, these men could not be properly convicted.</p>
               <p>My Lord, it is said, that in this case there is no larceny; suppose two people go into a shop, one takes something out of the shop, and the other is in the shop close by, will it not be matter for the Jury to say, whether these two people were concerned in that taking.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Heath. The question is this-if there is neither fear nor violence, what is there to constitute a robbery; and if there is fear and violence, it is a robbery.</p>
               <p>Mr. Trebeck. My Lord, for arguments sake, I will take it, that there has been no violence or fear, then the question is, has there been a felonious intention in the persons, to convert that money taken from her to their own use, I take it that that is a question to go to the Jury for them to determine upon that intention.</p>
               <p>My Lord, with regard to the question of robbery, I have this to say, that what those cases are, which my learned friend has mentioned, that have been determined, and afterwards repented of I do not know; but this I know, that here is the determination of the twelve Judges upon serious consideration of what they should hold out to the word, to be the law of this land with respect to robbery; and that arising upon a very particular case, to which my learned friends have alluded; that of Hickman, for threatening an unnatural attempt; in that, they have laid down a positive definition; it is impossible for me to contend, that this case enters into every part of that definition: in the first place, is not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130140"></xptr>free-will and free-agency taken from this woman? - Was she so completely mistress of her own will that she was under no restraint, and gave it with her consent? - She tells you, she did not give it willingly, but that she gave it under the impression of terror. My learned friends contend, that there is but one instance of terror (and that is the instance alluded to in that case) which will supply the necessary averment in the indictment of viet armis; but that is not the case, by that definition, for that definition says, whether that terror arises from real or expected violence to the person; and, I would ask, in this case, whether there is not the most serious apprehension, that this person is going to suffer a violence to her person; namely, to be dragged from that house to Bow-street, and from thence to prison: is not that such a violence upon the person, as to create a sufficient terror, to induce her to part with her money, My learned friend, Mr. Knowlys, has said, it must be a fear that will operate upon the firmest mind; my Lord, I conceive, that the fear of a man is not to be tried by his nerves; but is this such a transaction as would cause a fear in the minds of mankind in general? - I contend, before your Lordship, that this woman being shoved into the shop, surrounded by a number of people, and threatened with being carried to jail, is such a degree of force as might create a terror, I will say, in all mankind; and if that was the degree of terror created, it is brought within the definition, in this case.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I am not driven to the necessity of entirely relying upon that constructive force, because, in this case, I have the real force; for if the Jury should be of opinion that these people conspired together, I say, that the force used by the prisoner Wood, and the force used by laying hold of, and detaining the person and the bundle, is such a real violence, that if that be couple with the terror under which she parted with her property, that there is real force; then if that be so, I have brought this particular case within the exact definition laid down in Hickman's case, sufficiently to support this indictment. My Lord, supposing there had been no threats to take her to Bow-street; I say, that taking her into the shop, and detaining her and her property, that that is a sufficient vi et armis, and a sufficient force to convict them independent of the other.</p>
               <p>My Lord, it was laid down in Donally's case, that the Court wished particularly to have it understood, that all these cases of robbery should depend upon their own particular circumstances; but having such a question brought before them, as that in Hickman's case, they say it is high time for the Judges to consider what is the law of the land respecting robbery; and having met and agreed together what is the crime of robbery, we hold it out to the world, that this is the crime of robbery, if any person obtains money, whether it is obtained through fear of real or expected violence, or a sense of injury to the character; this we hold out to the people of England as the law; and if a case comes within that, namely, that there is a reasonable degree of expected violence, by any mode, so as to take away the free-agency, and to make them give up their money, according to the definition in this case, unwillingly, then, I say, my Lord, it falls completely within that definition.</p>
               <p>My Lord, having considered what Mr. Knowlys and Mr. Const have thought fit to offer to your Lordships upon this subject, I have only this to say, that I certainly would not have troubled the Court, at this length, could I, by any ingenuity that I could use, discover wherein this case fails of coming within that general definition. If it be a new case, I am sure your Lordships will reserve it for the consideration of all the Judges; but I must own that I cannot myself see the distinction; and if I had been able to persuade my own mind that there was a distinction in this case, and that it did not come within that definition, I would not have pressed this case against the prisoners; but, from a conscientious discharge of my duty, I thought it right to trouble your Lordship with the observations I have made; I hope I have not transgressed the line of my duty.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I will trouble your Lordship with a few words, by way of reply. My learned friend has said, he would have the law laid down in this way, which seems to go to a length most enormous and shocking, indeed; he says, if a man takes away the free-agency of another, and takes away money unwillingly, that will constitute a robbery. My Lord, have we never heard of actions for obtaining money under durance, which my learned friend says comes under this definition. He says, what the Judges laid down in those several cases, to which we have alluded, are authorities in those cases only. My Lord, the definition that my learned friend takes, is a definition extracted from one of those cases, which, he says, are an authority to themselves, and to themselves only; but I will take the definition my learned friend has given me, and utterly deny, with confidence of success, that it does not come within either of those senses. Two ingredients are necessary, either a violence actually committed on, or expected to be committed on the person; or there must be that kind of injury to the reputation that will induce any person to part with money, just as any threat of personal violence would do. Now as to any injury that could arise to this young woman's reputation, no such thing is stated. Now let us see what was the dread she has swore she was under? The dread of imprisonment, for which God knows the law has provided an abundant remedy; and, thank God for it, because the moment I am carried before a Magistrate, that very moment the Magistrate will examine into the facts, and either scout them or put them into a mode of further investigation; and this is the only exception which I have pointed out, that has been ruled, namely, that under the circumstances to which I have alluded; the very coming before a Magistrate, and exposing the facts, amounts to all the personal fear, that putting a pistol to the head could have occasioned a man; because from that time, such a threat must leave an impression to the time of the dissolution of that man; that is the only case that has been so ruled. But according to the definition of my learned friend, it goes beyond example, because then there is no such thing as an indictment for extortion; when a constable takes me up, he destroys my free-agency; suppose the charge false-he takes me up without a warrant, and says, give me half-a-crown, and I will let you go; and he takes my money, will it be said, that any person upon earth could hope to sustain an indictment for robbery?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130141"></xptr>It is said, that violence was used at the time; I deny it; the violence sworn to is, that at the time the constable came in, he had his hand on her shoulder, and on the the bundle; but all the violence imposed or offered, was imposed or offered with an express qualification, that she was detained till she paid for her lot; and with that understanding upon her mind at the time, that is the only violence which they had in contemplation; and if she had sworn, otherwise, could she have been believed? because she has sworn, that except confining her, with intent to buy this bargain, all was civility to her; therefore absolute and bodily violence to her never could have been in the contemplation of the parties; it was, perhaps, to coax her to buy a bad bargain, but if that would not do, there is this threat made use of-if you will not pay for these goods, which you have so purchased, you shall go to prison. If that be robbery, extortion is at an end-conspiracy, accompanied with any sorce at all, is at an end-and there remains no one desinition of any species or mode, in which money can be got from a person with out their will, but what must turn out to be punished, however trivial the circumstances, with death, by the sentence of the law; and if it does go that enormous length, which I contend it does, I am sure the very going that length is enough to make your Lordship revolt at the argument my learned friend is obliged to make use of. I do not mean to contend that my learned friend means to strain the law, but only that he is set upon to maintain a certain point in argument that does go that length; that he would be the last person to wish should take place; but it is my duty to attack the arguments, and I say they do go that enormous length.</p>
               <p>My Lord, if the violence that my learned friend says is used, is not actually such as draws the money from the person, then there is no highway robbery; if the violence did not prevail, then the delivery of the money is voluntary and without fraud.</p>
               <p>Lord Chief Baron. You need not labour upon that, it was given by the woman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Then I contend, my Lord, that it does go that length; that the extortion of money, during imprisonment, conspiracies, and so on, cannot constitute any less offence in the party receiving that money, than in the enormous offence of highway robbery, subjecting the party convicted to the sentence of death by law. -</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Heath. This case is different from any former case. As to the cases that have been cited, they only go thus far-that to obtain money of a person, by accusing him of that which, if proved, would carry with it an insamous punishment, is sufficient to support an indictment of this sort; but it never has been decided, that merely a charge of imprisonment and extortion of money, in this manner, has been sufficient; however, the doctrine that has been laid down by the Judges, in giving their judgments upon the two cases cited, are very broad. It is necessary, to be sure, in all cases, and more particularly in the administration of criminal justice, the doctrines upon which the Judges proceed, should be clear and decided; and we are all of opinion, that this is a proper case to take the opinion of all the Judges; it will be necessary to take the opinion of the Jury upon certain facts, and after that is done, a case will be made for the opinion of the Judges.</p>
               <p>Knewland's defence. I have only to say, I never put my hand upon the woman, nor touched her money.</p>
               <p>Wood's defence. I stood as a weekly porter at the door; I never touched the woman, she went in of her own accord.</p>

               <p>Mr. Const. My Lord, we have some witnesses to character; but under such circumstances, I think it cannot be necessary to call them.</p>

               <p>Court. (To Mr. Fitzpatrick). Have you recorded the verdict? - A. No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen, do you wish to add any thing to the verdict before it is recorded?</p>
               <p>Jury. My Lord, we hold it as a combination.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you of opinion that the money was given under the impression of their carrying her to Bow-street?</p>
               <p>Jury. We think the degree of violence offered to her was more than threatening to carry her to prison; we imagine that at the time they talked of carrying her Bow-street and to Newgate, she did not know, at that time, the extent of the violence committed upon her.</p>
               <p>Court. Is that your opinion upon the whole of the case?</p>
               <p>Jury. The circumstance of Knewland's putting his hand on one of her shoulders, and the other upon her bundle, we think is more than merely to threaten to carry her to Bow-street and to Newgate, the extent of the violence of which she could not know.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you wish that to be added to the verdict.</p>
               <p>The Jury deliberated.</p>
               <p>Court. We will not trouble you any further, we will take the verdict as it is. (The verdict was then recorded).</p>
               <p>Tried by the first Middlesex Jury, before. Mr. Justice HEATH.</p>

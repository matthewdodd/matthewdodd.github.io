             one of those constables? - A. Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to any public-house there? - A. Yes, I first went to the Cock and Bell public-house with Coltman and a number of other constables; when I went in, I saw Corneilly taking a pint of beer from the bar; though I knew him, I thought it was not proper to take him when he was only in the act of taking a pint of beer; there were several loose idle characters, some of whom I took into custody, and others I took the neighbours' bail, and the publican's bail, for their appearance; I sent Coltman and four other officers to the watch-house in Old-street with five prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those five persons of the description of idle and disorderly? - A. Yes, they were so deemed at the Mansion-house the next morning; with the remainder of the officers I then proceeded to the Oxford Arms.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from the Cock and Bell? - A. It is in the same street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner, Corneilly, after you saw him at the Cock and Bell? - A. Not till he was taken, to the best of my knowledge, at the Oxford Arms; I saw Newman and several other characters that I knew to be reputed thieves, in a box in the tap-room; I saw Draper there, but I am not positive that I saw Taylor there; I am positive I saw Draper there, I had conversation with him. As I went by Newman, I heard him say d - n Bridgman, d - n the high-constable, which I took no notice of at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time had there been any disturbance? - A. No, not a word said; I passed on, and examined who and what the company were till I came up to Draper; the whole of the people in the house were very quiet, and Draper and I had some quiet conversation together; he told me I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180401110026"></xptr>knew his father, and many other expressions, it was quite a peaceable conversation; I told him as I was come to execute a warrant, I could not be partial at this time; I heard Newman crying aloud with bitter oaths against me by name and by office, repeatedly, very loud, and I turned round, and said, Jack, hold your tongue, or I will order you in custody.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Give us the expression he used? - A. Words to this effect: d - n Bridgman, bl - st Bridgman, d - n the high-constable, d - n all his bl - y traps, and several such like expressions, repeatedly, and d - n his bl - y liver was used several times indeed, that seemed to be the principal word among them; upon saying I would order him in custody, Newman rushed out of the box with great fury, as if he was going to commit some violence upon me, putting himself in a posture as if he was going to strike me, and used the same words again, d - ning and bl - sting in the same manner; he then turned round to the box where Draper was and several more of the same description, and said, you are all a set of bl - y fools to suffer yourselves to be taken; he then said, I would die first, or you ought to die first, I cannot positively say which; a confusion immediately took place; the house was upon that all up in a riot, some upon boxes, some one way, and some another; they began immediately to push about the officers, and broke away; I seized hold of Draper; his coat tore, and he got away from me at that time; he then ran up the side of a table in one of the public-house boxes; he then pulled something out of his pocket, which I have no doubt was a knife.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you see it? - A. He said, I will cut your bl - y liver out, and turned it over and over again, like a confused man; another officer struck him over the arm, and whether it was from being numbed or confused I cannot say, but he seemed so confused he could not get the knife open; I never saw the knife open; he rushed out of the box at me with the knife shut, and seized my stick; I seized hold of him again, and delivered him, as I thought, into the safe custody of two officers, but I saw one of the officers knocked down; he did not fall quite down, the seat prevented his falling quite down; then Draper made his escape; I then ordered Newman into custody, and took him down to Old-street watch-house. As we went along, he still exalted his voice very high with the same sort of abuse that he abused me with before, so loud that he might be heard half way down the street; when I got to the watch-house, I had but just turned myself round, when one of the officers informed me Coltman was cut; at the same time Corneilly was brought up by two officers with his hands very bloody.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what Corneilly said? - A. His words were just the same as the others, bl - st their bl - y liver, and repeatedly said, I wish had cut their bl - y liver out; though I have been fourteen years an officer, I hardly ever heard such horrid expressions as they used before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said by Corneilly how his hands became bloody? - A. He said some of the bl - y traps had cut him; I replied, I did not think that could be true, for I did not think one of them had a cutting instrument about them; I knew he meant by the word traps, my officers; one of them had a cutlass, but he was with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Corneilly give you any other account of it? - A. Not at that time, he did afterwards; he said, he had cut it with a bit of glass; I then ordered Newman and Corneilly to be handcuffed together, one for stirring up, and the other for making a confusion; the other five were in the watch-house before the affray happened; I was not positive that Taylor was there, from my own recollection; when Taylor was apprehended, I was sent for to the Public Office, and in the back room I said, Well, Master Taylor, you know me; no, says he, Sir, I don't know who you are; I asked him where he worked; he said, he worked for a person in Castle-street; knowing that street was near my house, says I, you work for a person in Castle-street, and don't know me; he said, no, he did not; says I, don't you know the Oxford Arms, in Whitecross-street; he said, no, he did not; I said, do you mean to tell me you do not know Hopwood and Draper, (Hopwood is a person who is not taken;) he said, no, I do not; says I, do you know Sadler; yes, says he, I know

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. I take it for granted, as you have described it, you saw Corneilly at the Cock and Bell, and did not see him afterwards till he was brought to the watch-house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him at the Oxford Arms, or with the the persons at the Oxford Arms? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is the Oxford Arms from the Cock and Bell? - A. It may be a furlong.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Newman extremely drunk? - A. I really don't think he was, for he neither staggered, nor any thing of the kind; he might be a little fresh, but he was not deranged in his walk at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you known him for some years? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180401110027"></xptr>Q. He was part of his life a fish-monger, and part a publican? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He had just before ceased to be a publican? - A. Just before the licencing day he had kept that very house.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not apprehend him to be one of the persons described in your warrant, as disorderly? - A. I should not have taken him up, but on account of his behaviour.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his wife coming in at the time he and you were talking, and saying, you fool, hold your tongue; Mr. Bridgman, don't mind him, you see he is drunk? - A. There was something said, and then he said, d - n Bridgman, who cares for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not his wife desire him not to speak to you in that manner? - A. I believe he knocked her down in his fury; he pushed her against the table, she did not fall.</p>
               <p>Q. He certainly had been drinking? - A. He was not stupid, he was able to walk very well.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is the watch-house from the place where Coltman was hurt? - A. About fifty yards; I cannot say justly.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not seen Coltman, and the party that were with Coltman, from the time you had sent them with persons in custody from the Cock and Bell? - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. You had kept the warrant yourself, I believe? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen that warrant signed yourself? - A. No, it was brought to me by one Dixon, an officer, sealed up in a blank cover, and a gentleman of my acquaintance was in the house, to whom I shewed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at all see Corneilly in company with Draper or Newman that night, or with the other prisoners? - A. No, I don't remember that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Draper went in just before you? - A. He must have gone in before me, because the landlord brought him a pint of beer; it must have been just at the moment.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Corneilly. Q. Did you find any knife about me? - A. No, I did not take him; he was brought to me at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Did you consider Draper as a person that would come within the idea of your warrant? - A. No, he was more properly a fence.</p>

            , Esq. sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are a Magistrate for the county of Middlesex? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as take that warrant in your hand, and tell me if you were one of the Magistrates that signed that? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that your hand-writing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And is that Mr. Turton's hand-writing? - A I believe that is Mr. Turton's writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any recollection if Mr. Turton was present when you signed it? - A. I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. It is a common case, I believe, when a warrant is signed by one Magistrate, to put it by in a drawer to be signed by the other? - A. That is the only warrant of the kind I have signed since I have been at the Office.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you no sort of recollection whether Mr. Turton was present when you signed it? - A. I have no recollection whatever of any consultation on the occasion, or of the circumstances.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the persons taken up were examined at your Office? - A. Yes, they were, I took the examination myself; I don't know that the circumstance of their examination can bring to my mind any thing respecting the warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it the inclination of your mind that it was signed by you and Mr. Turton separately? - A. It is; the warrant is put into the drawer after being signed by one Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. And is not signed in the presence of the first Magistrate? - A. It most frequently is.</p>
               <p>Q. And frequently not? - A. Not frequently.</p>
               <p>(The warrant read.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. This is dated the 3d of November; I believe, upon looking at the almanack, that is on a Thursday? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a day on which the Office was not open? - A. No, I did not attend the Office; I was attending the County Court.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore it might have been signed by you at a different place? - A. I cannot say.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You are a constable of the parish of St. John's, Clerkenwell? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect having been applied to by the last witness upon any occasion to assist him to execute a search-warrant? - A. Yes, on the 3d of November.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you accompany him to execute it? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you first go to? - A. We walked to several houses, and we went to the Cock and Bell, and afterwards to the Oxford Arms.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner, Draper? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him at the Oxford Arms? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him do any thing there? - A. Yes, I saw him draw his knife out of his waistcoat pocket; Mr. Bridgman said, he should go with him, and he said, bl - st his eyes, if he would; they had been talking some time before that; I then went to the table where he was, and immediately struck at him, and hit him over the arm; he then made a lunge at me over the table with the hand that the knife was in; I don't know that the knife was open, I don't think it was; I drew back, and received a blow from somebody on my shoulder,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180401110028"></xptr>which knocked me into the box on the other side, and then they all rushed out and escaped, except Newman, and he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoners, and tell me if you recollect having seen either of the others? - A. No, I cannot swear to Taylor; there was a man standing there with a pipe in his hand, very much like Taylor.</p>
               <p>Q. You went away with Newman, and saw no more of it? - A. I went to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed. Q. If you don't know whether the knife was open or not, how do you know he had a knife? - A. I saw him take a knife out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How near were you to him? - A. Close by him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any confusion or noise at that time? - A. Newman was making a noise.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are a constable? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you accompany Bridgman on the 3d of November to the Cock and Bell? - A. Yes, in Whitecross-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of the prisoners at the Cock and Bell? - A. I did not notice any body there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner, Corneilly? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see him? - A. I did not see him till he knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do at the Cock and Bell? - A. We took five prisoners to St. Luke's watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it agreed between Bridgman and you where you should meet afterwards? - A. Yes, at the Oxford Arms.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that said in the room? - A. Yes, Mr. Bridgman said it at the door, coming out at the door of the tap-room; we lodged the prisoners safe in the watch-house, me, Juniper, Wentworth, and another officer; we returned back down Whitecross-street, in the way to the Oxford Arms; instead of going to the Oxford Arms, we made a mistake, and went to the Three Jolly Butchers, in Whitecross-street; we found our mistake, and came out of the house again; and coming up Whitecross-street, near St. Luke's church, three men, Corneilly, Draper, and Hopwood, formed themselves in a line across the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us more particularly how they were standing? - A. Hopwood had a velveteen jacket and velveteen breeches on; he was on one side of the street, Corneilly in the middle, and Draper on the other side, with a rough light-coloured great coat on; upon our coming towards them, Corneilly swore he would have some one's bl - y life.</p>
               <p>Q. Before Corneilly had made use of that expression, had you made towards them, or used any endeavour to take them? - A. No, I did not see them till the very instant I heard him express the words; I then went towards Corneilly to seize him by the collar, but before I could lay hold of him, he knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive any blow while you were down? - A. Yes, several.</p>
               <p>Q. From whom? - A. I cannot say from which of them; I had one severe blow upon the hip, which I believe I received from Hopwood; the blow that knocked me down, was a very severe blow on the head; I believe it was with his fist; Draper struck me several times, I saw him strike me over Corneilly's shoulder.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Still with fists? - A. Yes, I did not see any weapon at all; when I was about half bent, I felt something prick my back; I thought it was like a pin in my linen; one of them said at that time, d - n his eyes, cut the b - r down, which I believe was Draper, but I cannot be certain, but it was one of them; Draper was upon my left hand almost the whole of the time; after that I got up, and collared Corneilly, and tore his coat; soon after that, Juniper, one of my brother-officers, came up, and knocked Corneilly down; I then found myself released, and I ran away down Banner-street; Hopwood ran down on the right hand side of Banner-street; and Draper, I believe, on the left; there was a gentleman and lady at a green-shop door; I asked them to let me come in, and sit down; I found myself very faint and sick; I went into the house, and said I was cut, and the gentleman said he would go with me to a surgeon; I put my hand to my back, and got my two fingers of my right hand into the wound, and then I found I was cut.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you first find yourself cut? - A. Not till I was faint and sick, I felt myself wet in my breeches; I went over to Mr. Smith, the surgeon, the corner of Banner-street, and had my wound dressed.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What time of night was this? - A. Between a quarter after ten and a quarter before eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. From thence, I believe, you were sent to the hospital? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you in the hospital? - A. I believe a month; I am now an out-patient.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell at all from whom you received that wound? - A. No, I cannot; but I believe it was from Draper; though, from the appearance of the wound, there must have been more than one man cut me; I have the coat here, (produces a coat and shirt.) Here is the shirt cut, and a mark with the point of a knife; just above the great gash where I received a wound in the waistcoat there is the same.</p>
               <p>Q. How many cuts are there? - A. Six in the coat, two in the left arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you wounded in the left arm? - A. Yes, under the left arm.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180401110029"></xptr>Q. Did you see Corneilly afterwards? - A. Before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, at any time, take notice whether Corneilly had cut his finger or not? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. At the time you saw Draper, Hopwood, and Corneilly, you were in the middle of the street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Corneilly was in the middle, and therefore supposing the others to be Hopwood and Draper, they were at some distance from you, one on your right hand, and the other on your left? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You first of all snatched at the person you supposed to be Corneilly? - A. Yes, after he had expressed these words, and then he knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q. From the moment of his knocking you down, to the end of the scuffle, you must have been in very great agitation? - A. I did not know that I was cut.</p>
               <p>Q. But from being beat? - A. I was in great agitation undoubtedly; I expected the officers to come up and assist me, which they did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not an opportunity of paying much attention to their faces? - A. Draper's face I was perfectly acquainted with.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said, you believed it was Hopwood that gave the wound? - A. I thought so, but I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you say, you think it was Draper? - A. I say, I believe he was one.</p>
               <p>Q. Whitecross-street is not a very light street, I believe? - A. No; but the houses were not all shut up.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that there were any shops open where you had the contest? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no warrant with you? - A. Mr. Bridgman had the warrant.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Do you recollect the night this search-warrant was executed, accompanying the last witness to the Jolly Butchers? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were coming out, did you hear any thing said? - A. Yes, I heard a voice say, a d - d set of bl - y thieves, we will cut their bl - y livers out.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you heard that voice before, or since? - A. Since; I believe it to be the same voice at Hatton-garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose voice was it you heard at Hatton-garden? - A. I verily believe it to be Corneilly's.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known him before that night? - A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. When you heard the voice, did you see any person? - A. I did not; after I heard that voice, I walked on a little further along the street, facing Banner-street; Coltman was a little distance behind me.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came opposite Banner-street, did you then see any person? - A. I did, I saw three.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they standing, or were they walking? - A. I saw them at the end of Banner-street upon Coltman; they were all three upon him in a very active manner; they seemed to be striking him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Coltman on the ground at that time? - A. No, he was rather on the stoop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you do any thing, upon observing that? - A. I did; I knocked Corneilly down upon the spot, and as he rose, I caught him by the collar with the left hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards let him go? - A. I did not; I kept him in custody till I took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Corneilly's hat happen to drop off? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he pick it up himself? - A. He did, with my leave, and when he put his hat on, he said, now I will surrender, and go with you, you bl - y set of thieves.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time were there any other officers with you, besides Coltman? - A. There were two at a little distance off.</p>
               <p>Q. Had either you or Coltman any sharp instrument with you? - A. Neither of us; I had a stick in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took Corneilly to the watch-house, did you examine his hand? - A. I did; his hand was cut just in the thick of his hand; it was quite a fresh cut, and bleeding.</p>
               <p>Q. As you were taking him to the watch-house, did you observe him make any particular motion? - A. He did, towards his breeches-pocket, but whether he dropped any thing, or not, I cannot tell; I saw nothing.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a constable of the parish of St. Sepulchre's: I went with Coltman to the watch-house with five persons who were taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. In coming back from the watch-house, did you see the prisoners, or any of them, and where? - A. Not coming back from the watch-house; we went into the Three Jolly Butchers, and upon coming out, I saw three men, but I cannot speak to their persons; one was a shortish man, another a middle-sized man, and the other a tall man; I saw them come from over the way, with horrid imprecations; I then saw them engaged with Coltman, they had got him down, and he was surrounded by the three men; I went up towards them, and when I got up, Juniper had knocked Corneilly down; then I found it to be Corneilly, and not before.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he was one of the three you first saw? - A. I am.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever discover who the other two persons were? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Corneilly say any thing, or do any thing, as he was going to the watch-house? - A. No, nothing particular, only when we took a prisoner, they always swore; I observed his hand cut, and I said, how was your hand cut, we have not cut it, for we have no sharp instrument with us.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you no sharp instrument? - A. No, none of us; he said he had fell upon a glass bottle, or something of that sort.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. I am an apothecary in Banner-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect, on the evening this unfortunate affair took place, seeing Coltman? - A. Yes, he came to my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as describe the state in which you found him? - A. When he was brought in, I observed a very considerable cut in his back, the length from eight to ten inches, from the right shoulder slanting downwards; the breadth took place from the gaping of the wound, it might be a quarter of an inch, or more.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the depth? - A. About a quarter of an inch.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you suppose it to have been done with? - A. A sharp instrument; I should suppose, a knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any other wound upon his back? - A. No; there were some bruises about his head; I dressed his wound that night, and he afterwards went to the hospital.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Have you got a coat taken off the prisoner Draper? - A. Yes, it is the same he had on when he was apprehended. (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Q. Does it appear to be torn any where? - A. Yes, the lappel on the left side.</p>
               <p>Bridgman. I have no doubt this is the coat that I tore, when I first seized him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Corneilly's defence. As to the cutting, I know nothing about it, any more than the child unborn.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Draper's defence. When I came out of the Oxford Arms, I made my way straight home, and did not hear any thing of the cutting till the next morning; I never absconded, knowing myself perfectly innocent of the affair.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Taylor's defence. I never was near the place at the time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Newman's defence. I was in the house, and had been drinking; I never was out of the house, till Mr. Bridgman took me out; I was taken to the watch-house a quarter of an hour before this man was cut.</p>

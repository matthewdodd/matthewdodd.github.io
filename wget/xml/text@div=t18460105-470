                  </hi>. I live in Stan gate-street, Lambeth—I keep a tobacco<lb></lb>nist's shop, and am a newsvender. On the 23rd of Dec. White came to me with a sample of tobacco in a handkerchief, he said he came from Black wall, and had got some smuggled tobacco—he asked me if I would buy a quarter of a hundred weight—he said it belonged to him and three more, he would let me have a quarter of a hundred weight, and I ordered that quantity—he came again by himself about five o'clock—he then left me for about five minutes, and came again with Whiteside, who was carrying this bundle, covered round with brown paper and corded—the prisoners were both together then—White said he had brought it and asked if I had a private room—White and I went into the back parlour, and Whiteside staid outside—White then pulled his knife out of his pocket, cut this hole in the package, and screwed out a part of the tobacco and gave it into my hand, and left a part of it in the hole—he said to me, "That is a tobacco equally good with the sample I showed you"—I said, "It is very good tobacco"—I gave it him back and he put it into the hole again—he then asked for the <hi rend="italic">tin</hi>, meaning the money (I was to give him three guineas for it)—I said, "I must see it weighed first"—he pulled out the steelyard out of his pocket to weigh it—I then made a signal to my little boy to get the police—he went and two policemen came in and took the prisoners to the station—I saw the bundle examined, and it contained sand and sawdust.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable L</hi> 113.) On the 24th of Dec. I was spoken to by a constable, and about five o'clock that evening I went to Mr. Ludlam's house—I saw Whiteside in the shop, and while I was there I saw the prosecutor come out of the back parlour—I told him I understood they had some smuggled tobacco, or words to that effect—he said, "They have a parcel, but I cannot say what it is"—White brought the parcel out of the par<lb></lb>lour—I asked Whiteside whether he had a license for selling tobacco—he said, "I don't want one"—or, "We don't want one"—I took him to the station, and asked where he got the parcel from—he said, "I shall not say anything about it, it is all right"—the parcel was examined at the station—it con<lb></lb>tained sand and sawdust—White told me he lived at No. 9, Chapel-street, Westminster, and Mr. Ash was the landlord—I went there the next day and found a pair of steelyards, a piece of sealing-wax, and some sawdust—White<lb></lb>side gave his address at No. 45, Orchard-street, and I went there—I found a basket which had contained sawdust, and some sawdust scattered about the room.</p>

I went with Revell to Mr. Ludlam's—he said the men had brought in, and offered to sell, smuggled tobacco—I asked White if he had got a license for selling tobacco—he said they did not want one—I saw White bring the parcel into the shop—I offered to carry it, and he said, no, he would carry it—we went to the station, and in going there the string of the parcel broke twice—he then gave me the parcel, and I took it to the station—it was found to contain sawdust.</p>

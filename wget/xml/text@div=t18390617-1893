                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Donovan of Shackle<lb></lb>well-street, Bethnal green—I was in the New Prison last sessions for want of bail—the prisoner was there also—I had a shawl, which I kept on the bed I slept on—I recollect the prisoner leaving one Saturday morning, and after she was gone I missed my shawl—this is it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you let it to them both? - A. Yes; he made the bargain for it, and they both came into it the same day.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason to doubt whether they were married? - A. She said, before the Magistrate, that it was not her husband.</p>
               <p>Court. There is a defect in this indictment: it is an indictment for stealing in a lodging-room, let by contract to William Whitaker and Sarah his wife; the contract was made by him only, and therefore the prisoner must be acquitted.</p>

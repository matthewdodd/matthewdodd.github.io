                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife, and live in the high road, Tottenham—on the morning of 28th May I went to bed from twenty to twenty-five minutes past twelve—I went to sleep—on awaking there was a strange noise in my throat; it was blood proceeding from my mouth, which was full of blood—I called to my daughter—she came to me—I got out of bed and went down stairs; when I awoke I saw my husband; he was in the bed or outside, I could not say which; there was no one else in the room, except my little boy, three years old—a doctor was fetched—I sat in a chair, under the window—my husband was afterwards fetched down stairs—I believe he asked what was the matter—I told him he knew what must be the matter—he said I must have fallen out of bed—when I awoke I found my face and head bleeding; I can't say how it was done—my eye was pouring with blood—I have no idea how it happened—I was asleep at the time—I did not fail out of bed; the bed is the usual height—I did not inflict any of the injuries upon myself; it was impossible I could do it—my husband has threatened me, but I believe he was not quite right in his mind when he did so; he has threatened to take my life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How lately before had he done so? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not that day; we had been out for a walk, and were very comfortable all day—he has been away at a lunatic asylum for a month—he came home a fortnight last Friday, I think—I lived with him before he went to the asylum—drink was the cause of it—it brought on <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—he is a marine store dealer by business, a general dealer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> In January I had <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> very bad; I was very ill, they did not expect me to live, and the same doctor was attending me that attended my wife—in February I went into Hertfordshire for a week—when I came home I found my wife very dull in spirits—I asked her what was amiss—she said nothing—she scarcely spoke to me for days—I said I was sure there must be something—at last she said, "Will you forgive me if I toll you?"—I said, "Yes"—she said, "I took too much to drink, and during the time the man Edward Cruise took advantage of me and seduced me; I hope God will forgive me, for no one on this earth can; I</p>

I was servant to the prisoner—on the morning of the 28th May Miss Walker fetched me—I went, and saw Mrs. Walker sitting in a chair, near the washhouse door, covered with blood, which was pouring from her head, cheek, and nose—I made her bed the next day—there was a great deal of blood on it, on the left-hand side, where she slept—I have heard the prisoner threaten his wife—I have heard him say he would cut her throat, and all manner of things, when he has been in a passion—about a fortnight or three weeks before this happened he asked me for a bayonet—he did not say what he wanted it for—I had taken it up stairs from underneath his bed, and put it in a tin, where some whalebone was kept, at the top of the house—after I had attended to Mrs. Walker and bathed her face, I went up stairs to see if the bayonet was there, and it had gone from the place where I had hid it—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I hid it because Mr. Walker was so strange I did not know what to think.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Tottenham—on Tuesday, 28th May, about half-past one in the morning, I was called to see Mrs. Walker—I found her sitting in a chair in the back room, covered with blood—there was a deep wound on the bridge of the nose and under the right eye, and three on the upper and back part of the head, on the right side; the wound on the nose was the most extensive, it penetrated and wounded some arteries, which bled and awoke her—the blood ran into the gullet—I cannot say that she was in danger—such an instrument as this bayonet would inflict such wounds—the bayonet was shown to me that morning, and I found a few blood stains on it; they looked fresh—it was quite impossible that she could have inflicted the wounds herself—I have known her six or eight months, her character has been very good indeed—I sent the prisoner to the lunatic asylum—I stated that before the Magistrate—the prisoner's statement about his wife being unfaithful to him I put down to hallucination, under the peculiar state of his brain—he threatened to destroy her two or three times, on different occasions—at the time I sent him to the asylum he had given her a black eye, and he tried to strangle her, and threatened to cut her throat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that in a fit of morbid jealousy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I ex<lb></lb>amined him in connection with Dr. Gardner, the assistant physician to the lunatic asylum at Clapham, and we decided that he was in an unsound state of mind and dangerous to his wife, through this morbid state of mind—the history of his case would go to prove that his brain is pecu<lb></lb>liarly susceptible—he has been wild and odd for years past—then he took to drink and had delirium tremens, which did not yield to the usual reme<lb></lb>dies, showing the predisposition to irritability of the brain—when I got him over the delirium tremens he promised to be very careful in his con<lb></lb>duct, but he very soon recurred to drink, and then he got into this odd state of mind over and over again—Dr. Gardner said he was not fit to be at large—one of the symptoms which goes to prove insanity is, that he threatened his wife's life over and over again before other persons, and also his daughters, whom he used to love so much, and the young man was to go as well—his jealousy was entirely unfounded.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-Sergeant F</hi> 14.) I was present before the magistrate when Thomas Pratt, police-constable 311 A. was examined—this signature to this deposition is his and also this one, which was taken on the remand—the prisoner had every opportunity of cross-examining Pratt—I saw him to-day at the hospital—he is ill in bed—the surgeon is here—(<hi rend="italic">Pratt's deposition was here put in and read as follows</hi>;—'At four o'clock on the morning of the 1st of January I was on duty in Northumberland-street, Strand, and hearing some one walking in Brewer's-lane, adjoining, I went there to see who it was—at first I could see nobody, but on turning my lamp on I found the prisoner lying upon his face in some mortar, under one of the railway arches—I asked him what he was doing there I—he scrambled up, and I then saw he was very drunk—he told me he had lost his horse and cab—at this time sergeant Lambert came up, I told him what the prisoner had said and he went to look for the horse and cab, and shortly after Lambert re<lb></lb>turned with them, and he told me to take the prisoner to the station-house—I did so, and he offered me money not to take him there—we walked together to the top of the lane, and there he turned round, and gave me a very severe kick on my thigh—he then walked about fifty yards, and then asked me if I was going to take him to the station, I replied I should—he then said I'm b----if you shall, and at the same time kicked me as hard as he could upon my shin, and knocked off a piece of skin as big as a two-shilling piece—he then threw himself down in a door-way—I stooped to raise him up, and as I was in the act of doing so, the prisoner struck me a violent blow by the side of my right ear on my head—I did not at the moment know I had been wounded, but the blood flowed profusely and quite saturated the front of my coat—I then found I had been stabbed—I after-wards saw that one of the figures upon my collar and the letter A had been cut—the sergeant then came up and with other assistance the prisoner was taken to the station-house.' <hi rend="italic">Second examination—Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> 'I did not say on my first examination that the prisoner was mad drunk, I said he was very drunk—he told me at this court, in the gaoler's room before the examination that a gentleman had given him a quart of whiskey and that he was mad drunk.—<hi rend="smallCaps">THOMAS PRATT</hi>.")</p>

I was on duty at Brewer's-lane on this night—I saw the prisoner there, he was drunk—he said that he had lost his horse and cab in the archways—I told Pratt to detain him there and I would go and look for the horse and cab—I found it under one of the railway-arches at Charing Cross—I led it back to where I had left the prisoner and Pratt—I told Pratt to take him to the station, I saw he was very drunk, and I would lead the horse and cab up myself—the prisoner went very quietly into the Strand and then became, very violent—he commenced kicking.

               <p>threw himself down in a doorway—I saw Pratt stoop down to raise him up—I stopped the horse and cab and went to his assistance—I then perceived that his coat was saturated with blood, and blood was running down by the side of his face—the prisoner's face was also bloody—I said to Pratt, "Good God where is all that blood from"—he said, "I don't know whether it is from him or from me"—I did not see anything in the prisoner's band at that time, he was so violent—I held him down until after I thought his temper was cooled, I then asked him if he would go to the station quietly, and he said he would go with me, but he would not go with Pratt—I then directed Pratt to take the horse and cab up to the station and I would endeavour to get the prisoner there myself—he went for a few steps with me—at that time Baker, No. 122, came up and caught hold of him on the left side—the prisoner then commenced kicking Baker on the legs—he raised his right hand and I saw that he had this knife in his hand (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), there was blood on the knife—I noticed that at the time—I called Baker's attention to the knife, we took it from him and took him to the station—I then examined Pratt and found he was wounded just above the ear.</p>

I am house-surgeon at Charing Cross Hospital—on the morning of 1st January I was called up to attend to Pratt the constable—I found him suffering from a wound near the right ear, about a quarter of an inch in length, it was a wound that a knife would inflict—I saw the knife at the police-court—there was a good deal of bleeding—he has recovered from that wound—he had an abrasion on one of his legs, the skin was taken off—it afterwards turned out to be a serious wound—he came into the hospital some few days after the injury was inflicted and he has been there since—he is now confined to his bed with that wound—the skin was taken off about the size of a florin—I can't give any opinion how long he will be there, it may be for some long time yet—it came to a very large wound afterwards.</p>

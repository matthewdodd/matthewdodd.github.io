                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Durrant, and reside at 362, Gos-well-road—on the night of the 26th December I went to bed at 12 o'clock—the house was safe at 11—I got up about 8 next morning, went down stairs about 9, and found that one of the shop windows was broken, and one had been forced open—I went into the kitchen, and found that the window had been forced from the top to the bottom—I was living in the house—the shop is at the back of the house—it is used as a shop—I have seen the prisoner once before—the top of the kitchen window was fixed; it had never been opened, but it was forced open; that was in the area—the cellar door below was open so that anybody could step on that, and get down—I was not shown a hammer by the police-constable, or anything else—the things had nothing to do with me.</p>

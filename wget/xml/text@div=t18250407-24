I had these three sovereigns and the change; I sat up till half-past four - I then said I should he down for an hour; I took off my trowsers, put them under my pillow - so other person came into the room, as I bolted the door; I did not awake till just after day light; the prisoner then was gone - my trowsers were removed, and laid across the bed; there was no money in them. I am quite certain it was there when I put them under the pillow - I saw her that morning at the watch-house - when I awoke I knocked at the door, the landlady came up; I asked her if she had my money, she said no, but the woman who had been with me had gone out, and given her 5 l. to let her go out - when I got to the watch-house the constable asked me if I had lost any thing but my money; I said no - but when I came to look I missed a duplicate from my pocket; he showed it me.</p>

            . I am watchman. I was calling the hour of five in Wellington-court when Mrs. Donovan, the landlady of this house, gave me charge of the prisoner on suspicion of having robbed Thompson; I took her to the watchhouse, and found a sovereign and 16 s. 6 d. on her; we afterwards found 5 s. more on her person. - I saw Thompson between eight and nine o'clock - he then appeared quite sober; he accused the prisoner of being the person who had stolen his money; she denied the charge, and said the sovereign was given to her by a gentleman at the Wrekin-tavern in Broad-court, Drury-lane - she had an apron round her shoulders, as she was going to the watch-house, but when she got there, she denied having it, the constable found it round her waist.</p>
               <p>JULIA DONOVAN. I keep this house No. 7, Wellington-court; I have known the prisoner for several months - on the morning she was taken up, between two and three o'clock, I was waiting for my lodgers to come in, the prisoner came in with Thompson; I shewed them into a room on the one-pair front; they took it for that night only; I charged them 2 s., for it - I went out to get change for a sovereign and brought in half a pint of gin, and a pint of beer - they came to 1 s., 9 d., - I had some of the gin with them; I then left them and no one else went into the room. About five o'clock, the prisoner wanted to come down, and I told her to go to bed again, as I did not want to let her out while the man was asleep; she went up stairs again, but came down and said</p>
               <p>"Here is 5 s. for you to let me go" - I would not take it; I heard the watchman crying five o'clock and I called him and gave charge of her - my husband got up, and went to the watch-house with her; the prosecutor did not get up till between eight and nine o'clock; he then asked me if he had given me his money to keep for him - I said No but the woman was in custody When the prisoner left my house she had an apron round her shoulders.</p>

            . I was constable of the night. This prisoner was brought to the watch-house; I found 11 s., in her hand, which she laid down on the table, and said they were the man's change, and that was all she had - the watchman then intimated that she had some gold about her; I then searched her, and found five shillings in her pocket; I then saw her put her hand very quick to her mouth - she appeared to be trying to swallow something - I stopped her, and she put a sovereign out of her mouth into her hand, I got it from her; she had a duplicate in her hand, which she said belonged to the man; but the sovereign did not, as a gentleman had given it to her at the Wrekin-tavern; I saw the apron on her shoulders, and when the prosecutor came he said he had lost his apron; I then asked her for it - she denied having it; but I said I would search her again if she did not give it me - she then stooped down and took it from under her</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder. My yard is in Market-street, St. John-street-road—I had some lead there on the 23rd of February—my attention was drawn to it, and soon after the prisoner was taken—the lead is in an open yard—there are gates—I have seen the prisoner before, he has come to ask for work as a labourer—Ii believe this lead to be mine, but I cannot swear to it by any mark—I have a partner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter. I saw the prisoner go out of the yard, and followed him—I saw he had something wrapped up with a handkerchief—I asked him what he had there—he said, some lead—I asked him to let me look at it, which he die—I asked him where he got if from—he said, "From Mr. Payne's, at Islington"—I asked if he would come back to my master's—we met my master, and he said the best way would be for me go with the prisoner to Mr. Payne's, which I did—and it was false—prisoner then stated that he had it given him by some person in the street, but he did not know who.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the Angel on this night—I went to the bar parlour a little after eleven o'clock, with the expectation of taking Mr. Pain's supper up stairs according to promise—I saw the prisoner at the shelf, with his arms extended—I said, "Halloa!" and he immediately dropped his arms—I said, "Where is Mrs. Pain?"—he was very much confused, and could not answer me for a moment—he then said, "Up stairs"—I imme<lb></lb>diately left him—I did not perceive him with anything—I went up stairs, and he followed me—he was much confused—I have known him some time, and I sever saw him so confused in my life—he bid Mrs. Pain good night, and said, "If anything is the matter I will come"—when I saw him in the bar parlour there was nobody else there—I did not ask him why he was looking on the shelf—when he was taken he asked me what he was taken for—I said, "You know what you are taken for"—he was taken about ten minutes past twelve o'clock that night, near his own dwelling, in Clerkenwell.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a publican, and live in Broad-street, Ratcliff the prisoner was in my service about seventeen days. On Thursday, the 4th of November, I was at dinner in the bar of my house—in consequence of information I went into the tap-room and saw the prisoner with a bottle of brandy in her hand—I asked her what she had got—she said, "Nothing"—I took it out of her hand, and said it was a bottle of brandy—she said, "Well, sir, it is of no value," and put her hand into her pocket—having lost a good many articles while she was in my service, I supposed she might have something in her pocket—I called Mrs. Harrisson, and she stopped by her while I called a policeman—I gave her into custody—I found the cellar door open and the key in the lock—I had locked it myself, and hung the key up in the bar—I believe this brandy to be part of my stock—I have compared the quality—the prisoner had no business with the key—I never let her go into the brandy-cellar.</p>

I was at Mr. Harrisson's tap-room on the 4th of November, and saw the prisoner come in, light a candle, and go down into the cellar—I could see the cellar from where I was standing—she remained there about a minute and a half or two minutes, and came up again with a bottle and a candlestick—she covered an apron over the bottle—something was dripping on the floor, as if the bottle was full—on her going into the kitchen I told Mr. Harrisson, who was in the bar at dinner—I did not see what part of the cellar she went to—I believe the coals are kept there.</p>

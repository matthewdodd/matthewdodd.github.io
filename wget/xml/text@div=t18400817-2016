In consequence of a written communication, I made application in July to the police—Pollard was not then known to me—Hardwick, a policeman, was stationed in Ormond-yard—he has since shown me 4 bottles of wine, which I believe to be my property, from its being the same sort as 1 had in my cellar—I saw a fifth bottle, but there was nothing to identify it.</p>

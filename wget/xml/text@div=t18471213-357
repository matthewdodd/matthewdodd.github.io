                  </hi> I am the wife of James Hicks, of Hammersmith. Twenty years ago I made up three packets of twenty sovereigns each—I placed them in a wooden box, which I put into a canvass bag—about seven years ago I removed from my house, and removed my bag and box—Gregory was born in my house—I brought him up from his birth—I heard something, and went to my box, where my sovereigns were—I found it empty, with the top wrenched off—I had seen if safe perhaps about twelve months since—I asked Gregory what he had been doing—he fell on his knees and said, "Pray, mother, forgive me"—the money has never been found.</p>

Eliza<lb></lb>beth, indeed, you ought to be ashamed of yourself; you have brought me into a pretty mess; you have brought me here innocently"—he said, "you know all about it—I told you where I got the money from."</p>

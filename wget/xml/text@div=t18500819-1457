                  </hi>. I am a sergeant of the H division of police. On 25th June the prisoner was a constable in that division—I saw him on duty be<lb></lb>tween two and three o'clock that morning, in Plummer's-row, Mile-end New-town—he appeared to me the worse for drink—I told him he was the worse for drink, and he must go to the station with me, that he was not fit to be on duty in the street—he immediately took his staff out, and said, "You b—b—, if you lay your hand upon me I will knock your b—head off"—at the same time he had his staff over his head—I advised him to put his staff in his pocket—after some time he did so, at the same time he said, "I have a knife in my pocket, if the staff will not do, I will use that"—I got Kelly, another constable, and he and I took the prisoner to the station, and put him in the charge-room, adjoining the inspector's room—I went to Mr. Forbes, the inspector, and while there I heard an altercation in the charge-room—I went in and found the prisoner there, and the constable Moseley—I think no one else was there at that time—the prisoner had this knife(<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)open in his hand—Mr. Forbes came in, and Moseley told him that the prisoner had a knife in his hand—Mr. Forbes told him to give it up—I believe at that time Jarrett, another constable, came in—the prisoner was standing in the middle of the room with his back against the window—they tried to persuade him to give the knife up—he said, "No," he should not, and if either one offered to touch him, or any b—Englishman, he would rip their b—guts up— White, another constable, came in, and just as he entered the door, the pri<lb></lb>soner said to him, "White, you are a b—rogue"—White had not spoken to him—they closed round him by degrees, White, Moseley, and Jarrett, and Mr. Forbes was standing close by—the prisoner said, "Stand off; the first b—Englishman that touches me, I will rip their b—guts out"—at the same time Moseley was going to lay hold of his right arm, and he made a thrust at him, and caught him in the left thigh, he struck right and left at any that came near; but we got him down, and after a great deal of trouble I got the knife out of his hand—I got the flap of my coat cut by it in the struggle—I saw that Moseley was wounded, he laid down, and we undressed him, and I saw blood flowing from Mr. Forbes's wrist.</p>

I was at the station on the night of 25th June—there was a few words between the prisoner and sergeant Jackson as to whether he was drunk or not—the sergeant went into the inspector's room, leaving me with the prisoner—after he was gone the prisoner pulled the knife from his pocket—I saw Moseley come in, and after<lb></lb>wards White and Mr. Forbes—we were some minutes trying to persuade the prisoner to put the knife away—he was drunk—he could distinguish one from another; he called us by our names—he said to Mr. Forbes, "Mr. Forbes, I respect you as a gentleman; I would not injure a hair of your head"—Moseley and I then closed in on him, to endeavour to take the knife from him—Moseley had his truncheon in his hand, saying at the time, "If he does stab at me, I may ward off the blow with this"—he did not use the truncheon to him at all—the prisoner said he would have his b—y guts, or any other b—y Englishman's that dared to lay a hand upon him, and when he aimed the blow he said, "Stand off, Moseley, or I will have your b—y guts"—Moseley and I then closed on him—he said that as he was making the blow at Moseley—the blow lighted on his thigh—he said to me, "Jarrett, I am stabbed"—we then got the prisoner down, and Moseley was endeavouring to get the knife away, but before he could fix his arm down he still kept jobbing the knife up at any of us indiscriminately—I did not get wounded at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the divisional surgeon. I was called to the Leman-street station, about three o'clock in the morning of 25th June—I found Moseley lying on his back with a deep wound on the outer and fore<lb></lb>part of the left thigh—it was about three inches in length, and I should think about an inch and a half in depth at the centre of the wound—it was an oblique wound—I did not ascertain that there was any other wound at that time, but when he was undressed at home I found a small very unimportant wound in the arm-pit—the serious wound was that in the thigh—it was a clean incised wound—it was not free from danger, though there was no large artery implicated—it was not in a dangerous part—had it been the ianer part of the thigh, instead of the outer, it might have reached the femoral artery—it was about a fortnight before it healed—I have attended him ever since—he is now too ill to be examined—I cannot refer his present illness to the wound simply—on the third day after this outrage he had an attack of inflammation of the lungs, and that has been of a very serious character—he has been delirious for some time—that would not result from the incised wound, decidedly—it might be caused partly by the outrage, and I rather think he was exposed to a draught of cold air afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> But he had had some disease of the lungs of old standing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not aware of that.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Exposure to cold might have produced the result in the lungs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might; it was very hot weather, and his bed lay next a window, and I rather believe it was kept open constantly, and his being obliged to keep quite still, from the wound, I think might account for it—the nature of the wound rendered it necessary for him to keep quite still—it was not necessary to sew it up from its situation; it would adhere without sutures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate was read, as follows:</hi>—I believe this to be a plot laid for me altogether to get me into trouble; on that morning I met a young man in Plummer's-row, and he asked, me if I would call him; he went some distance with me, as if to show me where to call him, and he took a bottle from his pocket and said he had been enjoying himself with his friends, and had a drop of gin left; he pressed me to take part of it, and after he asked me two or three times I did take some of it; after he went as far as Lyon's Foundry, he said, "Are you an Irishman?" I said, "Yes;" he said, "I wish I had the hanging of every b—y Irishman in London," at the same time he threw the bottle away, and turned down Charles-street into Greenwood-street; I lost my senses directly afterwards; I have a slight recollection of the sergeant coming up, but I have no recollection of what happened afterwards, till I found myself handcuffed at the station next day; I then did not know where I was till I called to the</p>

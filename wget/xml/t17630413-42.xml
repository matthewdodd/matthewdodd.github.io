We came up together in the vessel as far as Earith, then he, I and others went on shore and left our things on board. When we came to Limehouse, the master of the vessel said, the prisoner had carried two chests on shore, and paid him for the carriage.</p>

He directed us where to go to find the prisoner; when we came there, the prisoner produced the chest, it had been uncorded, and the things gone out. He owned he had taken it home, and paid half a crown for the freight of it, but said he had not opened it.</p>

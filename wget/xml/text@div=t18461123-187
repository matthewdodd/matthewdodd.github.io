                  </hi>. I live in York-road, Lambeth. The prisoner was my apprentice—on the 18th of Nov., about one o'clock, I left him in my shop, and went down to dinner—just before I left I put into the till a shilling, a half-crown, and a sovereign—I had been but a few minutes down when the prisoner called me to a man who came with blue ink—I had three bottles, which came to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I took the key out of my pocket, unlocked the till, and the shilling I had left there was gone—I said to the prisoner, "Now I have discovered the thief" (I had lost a considerable sum of money before)—I said, "Where is the key to my till? What have you done with the shilling?"—he said, "I have neither key nor shilling"—I searched his pockets, and found some plums, but no shilling—the seat he sat on had a great quantity of things stuffed in it—I opened it, and I found a letter addressed to his mother—I said, "I can bear this no longer," having lost so much, which he was aware of—I sent for a neighbour, who is a parochial constable—he came and searched, but nothing could be found—he searched the seat, and close down by the pri<lb></lb>soner's heel I discovered a purse—I said, "Here is the secret—here is the key and shilling"—the key was taken out of the purse and applied to the till—it</p>
               <p>fitted the lock—I then said I could account for the valuable property he brought in from time to time, which he could not have purchased—he had no wages.</p>

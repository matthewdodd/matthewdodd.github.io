            . I am a gardener. I saw Parmington about a quarter past four o'clock on the 7th of February, while I was at work in my garden, which comes down to the ditch, at the side of Mr. Winsor's garden; he had one duck in his hand, and called to Smith to make haste - Smith then held a bag open, and Parmington put the duck in; that was the last duck which was put in - they then went round the corner. I sent round to Mr. Winsor, and went round the garden into Saville-row - I took them myself - I had seen them before about the place.</p>

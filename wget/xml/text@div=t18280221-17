On Wednesday morning, the 13th of February, at seven o'clock, I was called by my apprentice, and in consequence of what he told me, I got up, and examined my premises; I went to my shop, and found it in a very confused state; I found the warehouse window had been broken open - the warehouse leads from the shop; it is under the same roof as the dwelling-house: I found the warehouse shutter broken open - it appeared to have been broken by a centre-bit; the window was open - it is a window that slides back; anybody who broke the shutter open, could push it back: I found the warehouse in a confused state - the things all laying about; I missed two sides of bacon, three Cheshire cheeses and some loaves of sugar, out of the shop: the till was broken open, and a sovereign, about 30s. in silver, and 4s. in copper taken out - they were there overnight, and the till locked; the till and money were gone - I missed a drum of figs from the shop window, and two loaves of show sugar; I missed from the warehouse some curd-soap, some sugar, half a tub of butter, and two new sacks; and from the shop, two pair of scissors, a bacon-knife, and a quantity of shot: the sacks were marked"F. Tootell, Edgware;" I missed a leg of mutton from the cellar adjoining the warehouse: I do not know whether the apprentice's things were in the shop; I also missed some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210027"></xptr>harley-sugar, and 3 lbs. or 4 lbs. of tobacco. On the afternoon of the 13th of February, I went with the constable to search Weedon's house at Finchley, and found nearly a side of bacon laying on the floor, which I identified as my property - he was not at home, but his wife and children were: I knew the bacon by having myself cut a piece out of the shoulder a month previous: I had seen it in the shop the evening before, between five and six o'clock; on looking up the chimney, I found a loaf of sugar with my private mark on it, made by my apprentice: I left the constable to search further, and saw him find some figs in a box, in the same room; the drum was not found - he found some barley-sugar in the same box, and a piece of Dutch cheese in another box - there was some tea in a cannister, on the mantel-piece; I went out, and in three or four minutes saw Weedon coming towards his house - I secured him, and gave him to the constable.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you go to bed last, at night? A. Yes, and am quite sure the window was fast. The piece which I cut from the side of bacon, was sold before the robbery.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Tootell. On the 13th of February, I got up about seven o'clock in the morning, went into the shop, and found it in the state I have heard my master describe, I alarmed him. I had a blue coat and hat hanging in the warehouse, the night before - there was an oil-skin cover to it; the hat and coat were missing; I missed two sides of bacon, which I had seen hanging in the shop the night before: I had not noticed a piece being cut off the shoulder; I found the warehouse - shutter broken off at the corner, and the window open - the warehouse and shop are under the same roof - any one who broke the shutter could push the window back with his hand; the shutter appeared to have been bored with a centre-bit and then broken off. There was snow on the ground, and I traced footsteps from the house up the garden to the summer-house; at the corner of the garden there appeared footsteps of three or four persons - they were quite visible. I found a quantity of sugar laying in the path, and some in a tub by the side of it, in the path. I found a Japan tea cannister empty, in the summer-house - it was in the shop the night before; there were two cakes of curd-soap in the summer-house - I cannot identify them, but we had curd-soap in the shop. I then traced the footsteps up the field adjoining the garden, up to another summer-house at the end of the field, and in that summer-house, I found my blue cloth coat, laying on the floor - there is a sort of cellar under the summer-house; I got down there and found half a tub of butter, with a little green bag over it, sticking to it, without any string - that bag did not belong to master; I had seen the half tub of butter in the warehouse the night before. I traced the footsteps down as far as Brook-lane, which is in the road from Finchley, towards Edgware; some paper was shewn to me in master's shop after Weedon was apprehended, which I can be certain was in the shop window the night before, I had enclosed a show loaf of sugar in it, there was a mark of my own making on it; some Dutch cheese was shewn to me, which I can swear was in the shop the night before.</p>

            . I am constable of Edgeware, which is five miles from Finchley. On the 13th of February I accompanied Mr. Tootell to Weedon's house, on Finchleycommon; I found the bacon in the bed-room up stairs, laying on the floor, by the window, in four pieces; there was a loaf of sugar up the chimney - Mr. Tootell pulled it down; I took it from him - it had a paper round it; there was some figs, and some harley-sugar in a box; and, in another box, some linen and Dutch cheese, which I showed Mr. Tootell; he went on the road, and in three minutes took Weedon, and delivered him to me.</p>
               <p>JAMES TOW. I am constable of Hendon. I accompanied two other officers to search the house of Waters, at East Barnet. I found some barley-sugar and tea in a handkerchief at his house - there appears about a quarter of a pound; I afterwards apprehended Waters - he made a communication, and in consequence of what he said, I searched the house of Godfrey on Finchley-common, and found some tea there, in a cannister, on the chimney-piece - it is mixed tea - there is about a quarter of a pound; I found some chisels and a net there; he is a labourer, not a carpenter.</p>

             (a prisoner). I know both the prisoners; I saw them both on a Tuesday night - I do not know the day of the month - it was a snowy night; I went to see them at Weedon's house - his wife and children were there; Godfrey went with me to Weedon's house, and another person went with us - it was between three and four o'clock in the afternoon; Weedon said, "Will you go and take a walk?" Godfrey said he did not care; then said Weedon,"We will walk over to Edgware if you like:" we all four went, and got to Edgware about seven o'clock; we went into a barn, and laid down - that was a little after seven; I do not know the prosecutor's premises - if I was taken there now, I should not know them again; we staid in the barn till about a quarter past twelve o'clock, when all four got up and went out - we went across the fields (before that the other man and Weedon quarrelled); we were going to a shoe-shop at first, but we did not - we went to a grocer's shop, as Weedon took us to the wrong door (there was some hay in the barn - Picton took that); Picton and Godfrey got the shutter open, and got in - I do not know what they opened it with; Weedon and I staid in the privy at the time - I do not know whether Godfrey had any thing in his hand; Picton had a centre-bit; I did not see the shutter broken - I heard them at work at it; they got in between the top of the bar - Picton and Godfrey got in; they went into the shop, and put some moist sugar out to us; Weedon stood with me; then he put out some butter, tea, cheese, and bacon, and then they brought some figs and loaf sugar; and then they brought the till out, with 1s. 6d. in halfpence in it.</p>
               <p>Q. When the things were got out, what became of Picton and Godfrey? A. They came out; they put the things up, and went home.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did you go? A. Across the fields; the house was broken into behind, in the garden; we went round the garden-path, and returned the same way; there was a little bit of a place at the top of the garden, and we put all the things down there as we got them out - we left some moist sugar there; that is all I know: we went down the field; there is a summer-house at the end of the field; we put half a tub of butter there, and threw a blue coat in at the window of the summer-house - I do not know where the butter was put; Weedon put that in; Weedon put a little<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210028"></xptr>green bag in his frock-pocket, when he first went out - I should know it again; we all went home.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you go home the same way? A. Yes, the same way as we came; Weedon went to his house, and we went down to Godfrey's; Picton brought a leg of mutton out to the window, and gave it to me; I took it up the garden with the rest of the things; we eat it when we got home - we dined off it - it was dressed at Godfrey's house on Finchley-common; Weedon came down to Godfrey's house, and fetched some barley-sugar, and a little tea from there - we had taken it there; Weedon carried the bacon and other things to his house himself, when he went home at first; and the other things were carried to Godfrey's -(looking at the bag) that is the bag Weedon had in his pocket; Picton, I, and Godfrey, went to Godfrey's house - Weedon went to his own house.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. When did you turn evidence? A. I told this before the Justice the first time I was there; I wished to save my own neck.</p>
               <p>Prisoner WEEDON. Q. Do you say that bag is mine; I have got one just like it? A. I will take my oath that is the bag he put into his pocket when he came out.</p>

               <p>WEEDON'S Defence. I did not break into the house, nor tell him to go to Edgware; the bag which I have got, is at home now.</p>
               <p>GODFREY'S Defence. That man said he would swear to any thing to get any body off; he said he would take an oath for any thing, to screen any body. I was at work on the road to Finchley; some things were found in my house; he said he would take this oath that he found them in the road. I am innocent - I was at home, and in bed at the time.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. You say the things were taken to Godfrey's? A. Weedon took a side of bacon, and a loaf of sugar, to his own house - it was about a quarter-past five o'clock in the morning; I do not remember his taking any thing else; the other things went to Godfrey's - only one loaf of sugar was brought to Godfrey's - that remained there; I was never in trouble before in my life - I never quarrelled with Godfrey.</p>
               <p>Prisoner GODFREY. He took me before Dr. Owen, for striking him; if I had been guilty, I could have gone away - I heard of it, but went home, and went to bed, after Weedon was taken; I was not taken till Monday last.</p>

I know the prisoner - I have frequently seen him about the neighbourhood, and in my shop, before this. On the 26th of January, about half-past six o'clock at night, I was going out, it was then dark. I saw the prisoner, in company with two others, on the opposite side of the way, standing at the corner of Lime-street, looking over towards my shop. My window having been frequently cut, I suspected them, returned, and cautioned my young man to be on the look out. I went away, called on the constable, and told him. I returned home about ten o'clock, found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181902170014"></xptr>my window broken, and the property taken. I saw the prisoner at the watch-house - he denied it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. NORTON. Q. Was not the window broken at the time - A. There were several cracks, but no hole in it. My goods were tied to a tape, and that tape tied to a bell, to give notice. I saw the window a minute before I went out, it was cracked, but had no hole in it. It would require a small degree of force to push it in.</p>

            . I am a constable. I had been at the prosecutor's house, watching, for fourteen nights. On the 26th of January I was there, and stationed myself in the house, behind two rolls of green baize, so that I could see what passed at the window. I saw the prisoner come to the window three times in the course of five minutes. He came close to the window the first time, put his hand against the square of glass, and went away; he came a second time, put his hand against the glass again, and I saw a piece fall in. He went away, came again a third time, put his hand into the window, through the hole where the glass fell in, and began taking the handkerchiefs. When I saw his hand in I went out and took him. Just as I got to the door the bell rang, as the handkerchiefs were tied to a tape, which was fastened to the bell. I ran out, and saw the handkerchiefs hanging out of the hole - he had pulled three handkerchiefs through the hole - he was then about two yards from me, walking away very deliberately. I secured him immediately, and took him into the shop. I am sure he is the man who put his hand in and took them out. He could not have got them away without breaking the tape. He said he knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The glass dropped when he put his hand against the window; it had been starred six different nights, in six different places - the glass was whole, and not loose - I examined it everynight, there was no hole in it; the piece would not have fallen out by putting a hand against it, if it had not been for the place he cut that night. There are five gas lights in the shop, and one over the window. I was within three yards of the prisoner.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. West. About half-past eight o'clock in the evening I went to the window to take the things out, and saw the prisoner standing near the window, looking down at it, where it was cut. I had seen the pane of glass at twilight, it had been cut then, but was not cut across as it was when I saw him looking in; I kept my eye upon him for about half a minute, and while I turned my head round to what I was doing the bell rang, I looked up, and saw him spring from the window, I still kept my eye on him, and never lost sight of him until he was taken. I went out of the door - he looked hard at me. I am sure he is the person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. There were only silk handkerchiefs in that part of the window.</p>

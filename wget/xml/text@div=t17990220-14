             sworn. - I live in Prince's-row, Lambeth, I am a cow-keeper; the prisoner was my servant, and had lived with me about four or five weeks; he did not attend to his work, and the last week that he lived with me he worked but one day, that was Monday; Tuesday he did not come to his work, and on Wednesday I meet with him in High-street, Lambeth; he called after me, and asked me for his wages: there were two shillings due to him; I said, you shall go without your money, because you won't work your week out; he said, he would summon me, then we parted; and on Saturday afternoon I met him about the same place, and I asked him whether he had received money enough to summon me for his wages; he said, no, master, if I had, I would not summon you; then I told him if he would go up to my yard and clear the sties and stable out, that I would pay him his wages and give him a pint of beer before he went: yes, master, says he, and thank you too; and I gave him a pint of beer before he went out of the house; accordingly he went and did his work; and the next morning, Sunday, he came of his own accord, and cleaned them out, and then I gave him half-a-crown and a pot of beer, and told him, if he would come up that day he should have a dinner, but he did not come to dinner; on the Monday, about twelve or one o'clock,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200015"></xptr>Greenhill came to our house to know if I had missed any thing; I then missed the saddle; it had been to be mended, and was come home; I did not see it again till I saw it at Hicks's-hall, Greenhill produced it there; I am sure it was in the stable the Saturday before, and on the Sunday the prisoner was in the stable; the saddle was marked W G, it was an old one that I had bought; there were no stirrups or girths to it.(The saddle was produced in Court, and deposed to by the prosecutor).</p>

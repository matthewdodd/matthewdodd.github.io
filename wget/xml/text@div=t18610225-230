                  </hi>. I am the wife of Francis Chantry, of 2, Spring-villas, Ealing—on Monday evening last, 18th February, I was in Regent-street between seven and eight o'clock—I went from there to the Circus, and across from the Circus down Oxford-street, down Vere-street, across Wimpole-street, exactly opposite Vere-street chapel—just at the corner of Wimpole-street I was attacked by three boys—one of them, I can scarcely tell which, I was so frightened at the time, gave a pull at my umbrella—I held it very tight, and the next moment it was snatched out of my hand, and the boys ran away—I turned round and saw the three boys—the handle (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was left in my hand—the three boys were running very fast when I turned round—in half a minute afterwards a witness brought one of the boys, asking me if I had lost anything—and I showed him my handle, and said I had lost my umbrella—Frederick Salter was the one he brought to me—the prisoners are like the boys that I saw—I cannot swear to them—they are about the size and general look—I should say they are the boys—they are like them exactly, but I did not see their faces—the value of the umbrella is about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 73, Great Titchfield-street, and am a porter in the employ of Messrs. Nicoll and Co. of Regent-street—last Monday night, the 18th, between seven and eight o'clock, I was in Regent-street, near the corner of Argyll-street—I observed the three prisoners following a lady—I fancied they were up to no good—my attention was drawn to them—I followed them to the Circus—she crossed the Circus at Oxford-street, and went along Oxford-street to Vere-street, the boys still followed—I followed them closely, two or three times looking at their features, so that I should know them if they were <hi rend="italic">up</hi> to anything—I was as close to them as I am to this gentleman (<hi rend="italic">the foreman</hi>)—then they walked on to Vere-street—the lady turned up Vere-street—I crossed on the opposite side—she turned to the right to go into Wimpole-street—I crossed the road immediately, and at the corner of Wimpole-street and Henrietta-street the three lads made the attack upon her—they rushed towards her—I could not tell what they took</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186102250017"></xptr>
               <p>from her until I took one of them to her—the three ran away—I captured the little one, and took him to the lady to know what had been stolen from her, and then I gave him into the custody of the police-constable—I saw the other lads next morning, as near half-past ten o'clock as possible, at the police-court—I identified them there—I gave them into the custody of the constable—they were at the corner of Weymouth-street and High-street, game standing at the corner of a public-house, about fifty, sixty, or a hundred yards from the police-court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do I understand you to say you were as close to the prisoners when they were following this lady, as you are to that gentleman at your right hand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was—not at all times, two or three or perhaps four times—after I first recognised them the furthest that I was from them was about ten yards, previous to crossing Vere-street—I do not swear to ten yards—it was the length of crossing Vere-street, which might be perhaps more than twenty yards—I was, I might say, within fifteen yards of the lady and the prisoners, when they rushed upon her, or I might say twenty—I had sufficient light to see the attack, but not to identify what they took from her—it was a dark corner—I rushed across the road after them imme<lb></lb>diately—they had begun to run when I came up—I distinctly saw the three run away, and one I took hold of—I did not see the lady carrying the umbrella before the prisoners attacked her—I did not see any umbrella at all after she was attacked.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, D</hi> 76). On Monday evening, the 18th, between seven and eight o'clock, the prisoner Frederick Salter was given into my custody by the last witness—the lady stated the charge, that she had been robbed of her umbrella—the boy said he had just come from Clerkenwell, and was going on a message to his father, who was at work somewhere—I said, "Where does your father work?"—he said, "I don't know the name of the street"—I then took him to the station-house, and when he got there he said he lived at 28, Dudley-street—he stated nothing more—next mor<lb></lb>ning the witness gave the other two lads into my custody—I told them what they were charged with—they said, "We know nothing at all about it, we were at home sitting on our door-step, from six till nine o'clock"—they both gave the same address, 28, Dudley-street.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was that address right? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—when the last witness first came across the road with the lady, he had hold of the little boy by his jacket—he said, "I followed this boy and two more all the way up Regent-street—I saw the other two attack the lady, and I have inquired what she has lost, and she said her umbrella"—next morning he came to me in Court and said, "The other two boys are outside in High-street"—he did not say, "I saw two boys who were like these two"—nothing of the kind.</p>

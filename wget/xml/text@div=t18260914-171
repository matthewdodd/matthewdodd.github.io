I was in Munster-place, Regent's-park, on the morning of the 19th of August; two men passed me, one of whom had a sack on his back, and the other was helping it from his back to his head; they went some distance, and I called a private watchman and another man to follow - I stopped them near the watch-house, and gave them in charge to the two men, while I went and brought out the watch-house-keeper; when I came back the two men were gone, but the bag was there- and I saw the prisoner running round a corner - I pursued and took him; I am quite sure he is the man I had seen before with this bag, which contains these articles - when I first stopped them I pulled the bag down, and said "What have you got here;" they said it was nothing to me, it belonged to their master; this broken chissel the watch-house-keeper found on him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk, and reside at 5, Ebor-terrace, Stoke Newington—some years ago I became acquainted with the prisoner when he held a situation at Messrs. Laurie and Lee's, Doctor's Commons, and our intimacy lasted about twelvemonths—he then went by the name of Henry Bedford—I lost sight of him three years—he then called upon me in Ebor-terrace—he said he had a considerable amount of property through the the death of his uncle, Admiral Harcourt, of Swinton Castle, Yorkshire, and that he had changed his name in consequence from Bedford to Harcourt—he did not give me any card, but he left some about—he said he was about furnishing a house in Belgrave-square, and that until it was ready he should like to reside with me—he said he had been staying at Long's Hotel—I consented to take him in, and he shared my bed—on the night of the 23d February I lent him a coat, which I have never seen again—we went to bed that night about 12 o'clock—I had a watch and gold chain, which I put under my pillow; I had also a purse with about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—the purse was in my trousers-pocket, the silver in my waistcoat-pocket—I had also three pistols, one was a breach-loader, the others were small—they disappeared some days before—I missed them in the course of the week before the 23d—the prisoner came about a week before that day—on the morning of the 24th I was awoke by my landlord—I looked for my watch, chain, and money, and missed them—the prisoner bad gone without my knowing it—the coats were taken out of the hall—I communicated with the police—I went to Luxmore's, the pawnbrokers, with Sergeant Smith, and saw my watch and chain—those (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are mine; so are the pistols, and one of the great coats—I never gave the prisoner any authority to take any of those things.</p>

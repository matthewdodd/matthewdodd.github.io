I asked his name and searched his room, and in a coat which laid on the bed, which he said was his, I found a 1 l. note - (looks at one) - this is it. He said,</p>
               <p>"I suppose you have got what you wanted, you have no occasion to trouble yourself any further." I made further search, and by the side of the bed I found three other 1 l. notes wrapped in brown paper - (looks at three) - these are them. He said,</p>

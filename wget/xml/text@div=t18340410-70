               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where were you walking to? A. Up the East India Road - I turned into the fields, but not with the prisoner - she came after me - I had had two or three glasses of grog, but I was sober - she thrust her hand into my trowsers pocket - I did not catch hold of her, as I had not missed my money - I said I did not know how much I had lost till I got home - I did not say I had lost six sovereigns - I did not know whether it was six or four - I told the policeman so - I did not say that if she would confess that she was the girl who robbed me, and give me half the money, I would forgive her - it was done in a moment almost - it is a place where there are a great many women of the town - I saw her searched - some silver was found on her, but no sovereigns - when she thrust her hand into my trowsers I heard something jingle; I thought it was my watch - I was not sure that she put her hand into my pocket - I forget whether I told the magistrate that I heard something jingle - I hardly know what was taken down - I believe I signed it - as we were going to the station-house, she said if I would let her go she would give me the money - she then said if I would go to her sister she would give it me, or make it up to me - she pointed to a street, and said she lived a little way down there - I do not recollect that she gave three addresses as to where her sister lived - she did not say that she lived in Salmon's-lane.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you went into the fields, was there any communication between you and her? A. No; not the slightest.</p>

             (police-constable K 202). I went after the prisoner, and found her about half-past two o'clock, rather in liquor - she asked to speak to the gentleman - I told her to speak out - she said, "If you will allow me to go to my sister, I will make the money good, that I have taken from you" - I found 6s. 4d. on her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you ask where her sister lived? A. No; I did not, because she told so many different stories, without my asking her - she was in conversation with the prosecutor - she at first said her sister lived in Salmon-lane - she then said her sister lived at the back of Mr. Belton's, close to the East India Docks - she then said her sister lived near the Royal Duke - she stated these three different places to the prosecutor - I cannot tell what he said - I did not tell the magistrate that she stated these three different places - I thought it was not worth while.</p>

             (police-sergeant K 10). I was on duty, when the prisoner was brought in, in custody, about three o'clock that morning - the prosecutor charged her with stealing some sovereigns; he thought four; but he could not say - she said she had never seen him - he was sober, but she was intoxicated - I think she might be able to pick a pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was she so intoxicated that a sober man might have prevented her from putting her hand into his pocket? A. I should think so - it was about three o'clock when I saw her.</p>

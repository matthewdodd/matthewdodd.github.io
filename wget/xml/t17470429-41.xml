               <p>West. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you know nothing more of his stealing of it than his owning that he took it? Have you any thing more? Where was it that he owned it?</p>
               <p>West. He owned it in my House.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any Promise of Mercy made to him to induce him to own it?</p>

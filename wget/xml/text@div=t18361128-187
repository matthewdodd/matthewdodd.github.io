                  </hi>. I am a stage-coach proprietor, and live at the Globe in Deptford Lower-road. Poole was my horse-keeper—he was with me about three months the last time, and was previously in my service—in consequence of suspicion I and Bradshaw watched, on the 22nd of Novem<lb></lb>ber, in an omnibus close to the stable door—Poole came and began his work, and in about half an hour Hawkes came down—in two or three minutes they came up the yard—Poole said to him, "This is a pretty time to come in the morning—it is time I had my dram long ago"—they went out, and returned in about ten minutes, and went down to the stable—Poole took a sack out of loft, put some hay into it, and threw it down in the yard—Hawkes put it on his back and came out of the yard—we watched him into his brother's shop, and caught shooting the sack down—it contained a mixture of hay and clover—I have every reason to believe it was part of mine—I had seen the sack empty in the stable the night be<lb></lb>fore—the contents were worth a shilling.</p>

I was with the prosecu<lb></lb>tor, and saw Poole come in about five minutes to six o'clock—shortly after, Hawkes came on the premises—they both went away for about five minutes, and then returned—Poole went up into the loft with a sack, put the fodder in, and brought it down to the yard—Hawkes took it up—we followed him to his brother's premises, where he emptied it down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's sister, and the wife of Joseph Tanner, of Carshalton, Surrey—my husband is a coachman—about twenty-three years ago I was living in the county of Cork, Ireland, and was present when the prisoner was married to James Haggerty, at the parish church of Kilmagron, by Mr. Townsend—I never saw them living together as man and wife, and it is ten or twelve years since I saw them together, if not more—I saw James Haggerty six years ago, if not more—no one was with him—I do not know where he has been living, or when they last lived together.</p>

Of your own knowledge, they have not lived together for fourteen or fifteen years. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the prisoner was only sixteen when she was married—it was entirely against her consent, so much so, that they had to drag her into church—she lived with Haggerty about two months, and was obliged to leave him, in consequence of his brutal ill-usage—he was a shoemaker—she afterwards came to England as a domes<lb></lb>tic servant, leaving her husband in Ireland—that was very shortly after the marriage—he afterwards found her out, brutally ill-used her again, and she was obliged to leave him again.</p>

On 15th March, I received the prisoner in charge from Eli Nathaniel Dixon, who charged her with bigamy—I took her to the station, and asked her whether she was married before—she said, "Yes," and pointed out James Haggerty, and said, "That is my first husband"—I produced a certificate which I received from the first husband, after the examination at the police-court (<hi rend="italic">There being no proof in whose writing this was, or where it came from.</hi>

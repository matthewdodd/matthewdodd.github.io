On 1st January, I saw the prisoner in Upper Street, Islington, and, in consequence of information, I went up to him and caught hold of his left hand; another officer took his right hand—I said, "What are you doing about here?'—he made no answer—I said, "What have you got in your pocket?'—he resisted very violently, and attempted to get his left hand into his trowsers' pocket—I got mine in first, and took out this parcel containing six half-crowns, wrapped in tissue paper—I said, "This is bad money; I shall take you into custody"—he said, "I know nothing about it; I have picked it up"—the coins were wrapped separately in tissue paper.</p>

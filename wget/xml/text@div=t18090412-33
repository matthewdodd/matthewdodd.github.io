               <p>Q. Do you know where she went to - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts is the water closet situated with respect to the kitchen - A. About three or four yards from the kitchen; the kitchen is under ground and the water closet is level with it; it is for Mrs. Mitchell's family, but not for Mrs. Standey's.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was she absent before she returned to the kitchen - A. I believe about twenty minutes; when she returned into the kitchen, she went to the dresser; there was a great discharge of blood run from her; we made no observations to her, nor did she say any thing on the subject; she sat down by the fire; a little while afterwards she got up, she went away to go to bed in the upper room; between seven and eight o'clock in the evening I went up stairs into her room; she was in bed.</p>
               <p>COURT. That is the room where you and her sister and herself had slept the night before - A. Yes; I did not say any thing to her then; she slept there that night; when her sister and I went to bed, her sister asked her how she did; she said better. I got into bed and her sister; I did not hear any thing more.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. What time did you get up in the morning - A. Her sister and I got up about seven o'clock on the Monday morning; she got up shortly after, she took breakfast with the sister and me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said upon what had past - A. No. She left my master's house between eleven and twelve o'clock, she went out with her sister.</p>
               <p>Q. Now recollect yourself and tell me whether or not any thing else passed between you and the prisoner after the prisoner returned, when she got up to leave the kitchen to go up to bed - A. I laughed, and she said if I was in such pain as her I should not laugh.</p>

Yes, and I took it to her in the water closet, because she was poorly: I found her there very weak and ill; she said she had a dreadful discharge in the water closet. On the Thursday I examined my sister trunk at her lodging, I found some baby linen.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you next go into it - A. Monday morning, about eleven o'clock; I then found the pan half full of water; I threw more water in, because I thought it would wash it away. In about a week after, when the plumber had been to rectify the place, when I washed the floor, there was a place covered with mud, I took a knife and scraped the mud off; I observed a very large place of blood; then I told my mistress.</p>

Yes, near a fortnight after the 19th; my observation was, that the child had been born on the floor, because there were stains of blood on the boards; the marks were almost apparently of the child's head and legs.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. There was blood in a round shape and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120026"></xptr>in a long shape - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of seeing the child, of which we have been speaking today - A. On the 23d of March I saw it at the public house in Wilmot street.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe, from the appearance of the child, whether it appeared to have come at its full time - A. Yes, I am certain of it, from the nails and all other appearances; I examined it minutely. I observed under the left arm pit a great laceration, which appeared to have been done with some blunt instrument; the upper part of the body had changed considerably from putrefaction. I cannot take upon me to say that the child was born alive. I called in two medical friends of the neighbourhood; I went with these gentlemen and examined the child again; I can only say the child went its full time. The laceration, if the child was ever alive, was after life terminated; the placenta was connected with the child, no ligature had been made upon the navel string, the umbilical cord was not tied or disengaged at all; the placenta of the child and the umbilical cord had not been separated.</p>
               <p>COURT. What conclusion do you draw from that fact - A. Supposing the child to have been born alive, no ligature having been made on the umbilical cord, had the child been born alive, must have soon expired from the loss of blood.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You found the body of the child and the placenta connected by the navel string - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not that just what you would expect to find if a woman had been delivered sitting on a water closet, and all would have fell down the water closet together - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the laceration under the left arm certainly had been caused by violence, it had the appearance to you the same that a poker would have made by working it down the water closet - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>MR. COOPER. Q. You are a surgeon - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the child at the public house - A. I did, in company with Mr. Faythorn. The child was in a putrid state at the time I saw it; the child came at its full time by all appearance. I cannot take upon me to say whether it was born alive or no; the after birth was attached to the child, it had no marks of violence, excepting the laceration of the arm pit, which I take to proceed from the poker that was used; we made no experiments upon the lungs, that is quite exploded; I examined round the neck, I saw no particular appearance round the neck.</p>

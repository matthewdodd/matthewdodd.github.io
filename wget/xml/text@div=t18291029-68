            . I was foreman at my father's manufactory - he died on the 20th of October; the prisoner was a <rs id="t18291029-68-deflabel380" type="occupation">cook</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. What wages were due to her when she left? A. A quarter of a year, 3l. 8s. - there was 10s. 6d. due to a cash account which she had laid out besides - the family never borrowed money of her; I never borrowed 6d. of her - I borrowed about 3s.; she pawned her shawl for her own use to drink, not for ours; the 10s. 6d. was for things she had bought in the course of the week for the family - when she asked for money it was given to her; she never to my knowledge pawned things for our family; her wages were paid the day she was committed - there are twelve of us in family; we were in rather embarrassed circumstances; none of my brothers or sisters are here - they say they never authorised her to pawn things.</p>

            . I was present when the prisoner was searched; I think seven duplicates were found on her - there was one for a sheet and shoes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.What are you? A. A coal-merchant, and Mrs. King's brother-in-law; the family were not in circumstances to require aid from the servants; I should conceive the witness borrowed the 3s. for himself; although the prisoner at first said she pledged for the family, when I said that was easily proved by bringing Miss King and her face to face, she then said she had pawned to lend her brother and somebody else half a sovereign each.</p>

               <p>The prisoner, in her defence, stated, that she was in the habit of lending the family money to purchase articles, and that she had pawned the property to procure beef steaks for them.</p>

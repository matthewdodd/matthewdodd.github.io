                  </hi>. I live at Bay Braham, in Cambridgeshire. On the 14th of Dec. my house was broken into—the persons got in through a larder window—I lost, among other property, a considerable quantity of plate, two dozen knives, two dozen forks, and a number of books—since the 26th of Feb., two books, seven knives, and thirteen forks have been produced by the officer—they formed part of the property stolen from my house that night—the books are a copy of "Milton," and the "Life of Christ."</p>

The prisoner came there about a fortnight before this circumstance, to ask for work; he assisted us three nights in the business, and then my master sent him after a situation; he did not come again till Tuesday evening, the 9th of August, and as a favour wished Mr. Burnet to let him work with us till Saturday, to learn a little, that he might be better able to go into his situation. Mr. Burnet allowed him, and about half-past eleven o'clock that night, when I came to work, he was down in the bake-house - I said</p>
               <p>"How do you do, John?" he said,</p>
               <p>"How do you do, Sir." I asked why he did not return on the day he left; he said, he did not like to trouble my master. I proceeded to work - and after that offered him a sack apron to assist us in making the dough; he said,</p>
               <p>"No, happen to make it your self." I accordingly helped my fellow-servant Robins to make it, which took rather better than half an hour; and after I had washed my hands, I turned round to him, and said</p>
               <p>"John, I don't think you are very fond of work, and that won't do - for in London, bakers work very hard;" (it might then be about twenty minutes past twelve o'clock;) he said, he liked work very well. I said, I thought, by his refusing, he did not; and that is all that passed. I then jumped up on the board, took up half a pound of meat, which I had bought, and some bread and beer, which master allows us, and said "John, will you have some meat?" he said,</p>
               <p>"Ah, thank you." I accordingly made room for him to sit down by my side, which he did; I gave him about half my meat, he eat it and drank with me - Robins sat on the other board. After I had done, he removed from his place, and wished me to lay down, and said, he would mind time for me; I said, I did not particularly wish him to sit up, for I should be sure to awake - he said he was not tired, and would sit up; I said,</p>
               <p>"I suppose you are fresh, as you have not been at work, and may sit up, if you are disposed, but I don't wish it." He asked at what time he should call me; I said, if he was awake, he might call me at half-past two o'clock. I laid down, covered a sack over me, and went to sleep - it was then about one o'clock - I slept till about twenty minutes past two o'clock, when I was awoke, by feeling some person cutting my throat - it was perfectly dark, for the candle was out; there was only me, him, and Robins in the place - I jumped off the board, and jumped against some person, who kept cutting at me, and just as I jumped off the board, I received a cut in the hand, and when I got my hand up to my throat, I felt the blood and the wound, and received a cut over my hand and finger. I called out Murder, and continued to struggle with him, as he continued to struggle with me. I felt that it was the prisoner, and could tell him by the feel of his body; he was stout, and I knew that it was not Robins, for he was calling for assistance. We struggled together for about five minutes - I was calling out all the time, and at last I threw him down, and fell uppermost upon him; I got up directly, and attempted to escape up the ladder into the shop - he was close behind me; I turned round on him, and felt a razor in his hand, and took it from him, and by so doing cut my arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no talking all this time - A. I was calling out, but he never said a word; he was catching his breath very hard, as if out of wind. As soon as I got the razor out of his hand, I attempted to make my way up the ladder into the shop - I got one foot on the ladder; he tried to pull me down, and when he found he could not, he ran upon a level behind me. I threw up the trap with my hand and all this while was calling out, and just at that moment, he endeavoured to put his hand into the left side of my neck, where it was wounded, and by so doing to tear the wound wider; he never said a word. I was calling as loud as I could all the while, and when I got into the shop the watchmen were knocking at the door, hearing me cries. He still continued to tussle with me, till he saw my master on the stairs with a candle - he then ran down into the bake-house, but before my master came down, I could see by the light from the lamps in the street that it was him, and swear to him, as the shutters do not go to the top of the windows; he went down into the bake-house, and was brought into the shop by the watchman, a very few minutes after, from the back-yard - he could not have got there without going through the passage, and up the coal place. My master let the patrol and watchmen in. The patrol asked him how he came to do it; he said he did not do it - that he was reaching for the razor over my head to cut his nails (it was in the paste-board box,) and after he cut them, was putting it up again, and it fell down, and cut my throat. During the three days he was there before, he used to lay down, and sleep very sound without any covering whatever, on the bare boards of the bake-house - this was a fortnight before.</p>

            . I was in Mr. Burnet's service. On the 9th of September Wetton and I had slept in one bed-room<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100062"></xptr>till half-past eleven o'clock, then went into the bake-house, and saw the prisoner there; Wetton asked me to make the dough along with John, the prisoner - I declined making it with him, because I knew he could not make it so well as Wetton; so Wetton and I made it; we might be half an hour or twenty minutes about it. He then asked John to come and have a bit of supper with him; he said, Yes, and supped with him on the same board, and I had my supper on the other side of the bake-house, and after supper Wetton was going to lay down - I had to get some coals, and when I came back, I sat on the board, and took a pipe of tobacco; they were then still eating - some rats came from under the trough; Wetton threw a knife at them; then Wetton went to sleep. I did not hear the prisoner say anything to him. I went to sleep, and was awoke by Wetton crying Murder; I kept on saying,</p>
               <p>"What is the matter with you, are you mad," thinking he had awoke out of a dream; but I found him and the prisoner skirmishing together - it was quite dark. Wetton went up the ladder, and the prisoner behind him, and I after him. Wetton said,</p>
               <p>"Murder, for God's sake come down Master, for I am murdered" - he said so frequently. I did not know that it was the prisoner, except from knowing that nobody else was there. My master came down in his shirt, with a light - I saw then that it was the prisoner who was struggling with Wetton. When the light came he went down into the bake-house, and I heard him crawling up the coals, next the bake-house, to get into the yard - two watchmen came in, and went with me into the bake-house, with a light - we could not see him; so we went into the yard, and there found him. One of the watchmen brought him in; he was charged with attempting to murder Wetton, and said he did not do it, that he had been paring his nails, and was putting the razor up again, and it fell out of his hand, on Wetton's neck. I saw Wetton covered with blood.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you drank together - A. We had three pots of small beer, among us, not porter; a pot each.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was it usual to keep the razor open - A. It has no handle; it was in a box, on the ledge, on the brickwork - it could not be seen by anybody; it had been left there by a servant who was gone. I did not hear the prisoner say a word. I was so frightened, I rendered no assistance - I did not know what to be about. I really do not know how I got off the board, or what I did or said, I was so alarmed. We have no handkerchiefs in where we lay down. Wetton was covered with a sack, but his neck was not covered; he had his shirt and drawers on. The razor was not exactly above his head; it was quite blunt.</p>

            . I am patrol of Castle Baynard Ward. I was alarmed by the cries of murder, and went to Mr. Burnet's house as quick as possible. Another watchman was at the door before me. I heard a scuffle in the shop, and heard Mr. Burnett's voice, and heard a voice saying,</p>
               <p>"He has cut my throat with a razor." I sent the watchman to one door, and told him to let no one out. I stood at the other, and knocked. Mr. Burnet opened it. I went into the shop, and saw the prosecutor all covered with blood. I could hardly see a bit of him but what was bloody. He was holding a cloth or handkerchief to his neck. I went into the bake-house, as they said the man was there, but he was not. I came into the shop, and the prisoner then stood there. They pointed him out as the man who had done it. He said nothing. I asked what induced him to commit so wicked or so rash a deed. He said he did not do it.</p>
               <p>"Why," said I,</p>
               <p>"there is nobody else to do it but you." He said,</p>
               <p>"I was paring my nails, and the razor fell on his neck." I asked how he came by the razor. He said he found it in a box on the shelf, over the board which they make the bread on, and it fell from his hand when he was cutting his nails, and he pointed to his fingers, to shew me that he had been cutting his nails, but I cannot say that they had been cut. I looked round, and saw the blade of a razor laying on the shop counter. Wetton said in his presence that it was the blade of the razor he cut him with, and that he forced it out of his hand. The prisoner said nothing that I recollect. I took it up, and kept it. (Producing it.) I took him to the watch-house, returned, and assisted Wetton to the hospital.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were the prisoner's hands bloody - A. Yes; and his shirt; there was a great many marks of blood over his body. The razor was very bloody.</p>

            . These persons were in my employ. About half-past two o'clock, in the morning of the 10th, my wife awoke me by saying there were cries of murder in the bake-house. I pushed up the window, to see if it was not in the street, then ran down with a light, and when on the stairs I saw Wetton standing at the bottom of the stairs wholly covered with blood. I enquired the cause. He said 
               <persName id="t18230910-120-person1234">
                  John

             bad attempted to cut his throat, as he laid asleep on the boards. Hogan was then about two yards behind him. I took him by the shoulder, called him a villain, and asked his reason for so doing; I do not recollect that he made any answer. I pushed him down stairs into the bake-house - a lodger brought me down the key; I opened the door, and let Scanlan in, and sent him into the bake-house, telling him to take the prisoner to the Compter. I asked Wetton if there had been any altercation between them; he said none. The prisoner was not present.</p>
               <p>MR. HURLOCK. I am a surgeon. I was called to attend Wetton, on the 10th, between two and three o'clock in the morning, at the hospital, and found he had received a very extensive wound in the neck; the cut was of considerable extent; but very superficial, not deep at all; no material part had been divided. I observed no tearing or laceration - he had a small wound higher up the back of the neck, a small one on the shoulder, and others on the fingers; he had three or four wounds, none of which could be the result of an accidental fall of a razor; had the wound on the neck been of any depth, unless immediately stopped, it would have been attended with death; it occupied a full third of the neck.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I took the razor out of the box. cut my nails with it, and in throwing it up again, it fell on his neck - I made a leap off the board, and knocked out the candle with the side of my head; I made a grasp to catch hold of the razor again. He leaped off the board, and caught hold of me, and knocked me down; and when I caught hold of the razor, I let it go.</p>

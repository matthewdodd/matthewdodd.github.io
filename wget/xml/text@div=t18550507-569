                  </hi>. I am a former, and live at Chingford Hatch, in Essex. On 18th April, I saw the two prisoners at the back of the Warren, between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon—they walked up towards Mr. Fenton's, who is a farmer at Chingford—his house is close by the Warren—I saw the prisoners run after the fowls—one flew away; the other they chased, and Field knocked it down with a stick, and one of them, I think it was Field, picked it up, and carried it away in a handkerchief—they went away together up the road towards Chingford-green—I was about a quarter of a mile off.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, N</hi> 346). I am stationed at Chingford—I received some information about 4 o'clock in the afternoon on the 18th—in consequence of that, I went with a brother constable after the two prisoners—I apprehended them at Edmonton, which is about two miles and a half off—they were' together—this fowl was lying on the ground close to them, tied up in these two handkerchiefs—I told them they were charged with stealing a fowl from Forest-side, Chingford—Camp said he picked it up at Chingford Hatch—my brother officer took Camp; I took Field—he was very violent, and escaped from me; I caught him again—he was very violent, and I was forced to use my staff to him—I asked Camp where his pocket handkerchief was, and he said it was along with the fowl.</p>

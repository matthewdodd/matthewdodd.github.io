I sleep in a room over the seed-room - there is a drying-ground between it and the dwelling-house. On Sunday, the 10th of February, about half-past eight o'clock at night, I left every thing safe, and returned to the room about twenty minutes after nine o'clock, and found a pane of glass, broken, the sash screws undone, and the sash was not shut close down; there was a ladder placed so that a man could get up to the window; it was brought from the barn. I found my chest broken open, a great coat, two coates, a nankeen coat, and a pocket-book taken, and a pearl eye-glass. I am sure they were all there at half-past eight o'clock; the window was then shut down and screwed.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Bow-street. On Monday morning, about two o'clock, I was in East Barnet-lane, about two miles and a half from Mrs. Lewis's. The prisoners came up towards me, with another man; I was standing at the top of the lane. I took one of them, and my partner the other. I said,</p>
               <p>"What have you got here?" they both said,</p>
               <p>"Working clothes." They threw their bundles down, and a pump, and ran away on my saying I must see what they had got - the third man got away. I took Day - he said,</p>
               <p>"You had better let me go." He kept learing over his shoulder; - I said, if he moved an inch, I would run my cutlass through his body. I handcuffed him, I never lost sight of him - I produce the bundles. I think the man who got away had the property. We found a large crow-bar at Andrews's house.</p>

            . I was with Best on the Monday morning after the robbery; his account is correct; I believe the man who escaped had the bundle - they were all in company - I afterwards went to Andrews's house, to make a search, and found him there. I saw the crow-bar - it might be used in digging gravel; I dug up part of a pump in the garden, which corresponded with what they left behind; the metal of it corresponds in colour. Day had it on his back. I am sure Andrews was one of them; he was two or three minutes in my view. When we took him at his house, he said he had nothing to do with it, and was only walking up the lane behind them. I am sure they were all three together, and two women were with them. They all tried to escape.</p>

             a sword, and my wife pulled me back saying,</p>
               <p>"Don't go there, for murder will be done;" and in the morning the parties came to my house and took me.</p>

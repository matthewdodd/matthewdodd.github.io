                  </hi>. I live at Lille, in France—I know Belon—on the 14th February, 1871, I was appointed agent of the Banque Comptoir, Financier Anglo-Francaise, at Lille—I produce a copy of that appointment, certified—the original letter containing the appointment is in possession of the Court of Assize at Lille—the prisoner was director of the Banque Comptoir Financier Anglo-Francois, 376, Strand, London—I received circulars and saw placards on the walls relating to the business while at Lille, and I was instructed to treat and negociate advances with Belon in London—before I received my appointment, I had no interviews with Belon in London—from time to time, I received securities in Lille, and transmitted them to the Banque Comptoir Anglo-Francais in London—in my business transactions at Lille, I became acquainted with a gentleman of the name of Calier—Calier called upon me on the 16th of April, 1871—I had some conversation with him—I received a written order from him to negociate some securities for him in French rentes, and I afterwards sent a letter to him—subsequently I received in money from Calier 10,352 francs on the 19th of April, and I gave a receipt for it—I sent it to London, to the director of the Bank Comptoir Financier Anglo-Francais—it was a registered letter, containing ten French bank notes, dated 24th April, 1871, addressed to "M. Director Belon, in London"—the bank-notes were sent on behalf of Calier—I received a letter back from Belon, dated 25th April, 1871, saying: "We have received by post, this morning, your cover containing ten bank-notes for 10,000 francs"—Belon was to have sent me stock in French rentes for the money; but I never received any, and I never received back from him any of the money that I had sent to him to buy the stock for Calier—in consequence of that and other transactions, I was arrested at Lille; but I was subsequently liberated by the French authorities on ex<lb></lb>plaining matters—prior to my being taken into custody at Lille, Monsieur Calier had called upon me from time to time for the delivery of his securities—I had applied to Belon several times to deliver them, but he never did so—as soon as I regained my liberty, I came to London, and I went to the Comptoir Financier in the Strand—I saw Belon, and I had some conversation with him on matters connected with the Comptoir Financier—I mentioned to him the rentes that Calier had instructed me to buy for him, and I asked him for</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 7, Denmark-street,-St. George's-in-the-East—on Sunday, 23d July, between eleven and twelve I was going home along Cannon-street, the prisoner came up to me from a doorway, knocked me down, and kicked me on the thigh, there was another man with him—I got up and ran away and they came up to me again and tripped me tip a second time and kicked me when I was down—I got up again and found I had lost my purse and 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I pursued the prisoner about twenty yards and a constable caught him, my purse was safe in my waistcoat pocket, about five minutes before—I was sober.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, H</hi> 189). On Sunday, 23d July, I saw the prisoner running in Cannon-street, and the prosecutor following him—I pursued and overtook the prisoner, he took a back street—I held him till the prosecutor came up and he gave him into custody for knocking him down and robbing him of a purse and 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the prisoner said he knew nothing about it, that he only ran away because another man struck him—I have not found the purse or the money—the prisoner was sober.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> As I was going down Cannon-street on this Sunday evening, a little the worse for liquor, I met that young man and knocked up against him, he came after me with another man and was going to strike me. I turned round, hit one of them and ran away, and the policeman took me, the prosecutor gave me in charge for insulting him, not for rob<lb></lb>bery, he said he had lost some money.</p>

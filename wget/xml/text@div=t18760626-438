On 8th June, in consequence of information I received, I went with Detective Allison to the corner of Castle Street, King Street, Long Acre—I saw the prisoner with eight or twelve others come out of the Horse and Groom—the others came towards me—I went up to the prisoner, and as soon as I touched him, he threw down a packet—he struggled to get away, and said "I did not do that, I know nothing at all about it"—I took him to the station—the packet was undone there by Allison, and it contained nine counterfeit florins, each with a piece of paper round it—when I took him another man ran away—he said "Why did not you catch the other man running away?"—the other man was 30 or 40 yards off.</p>

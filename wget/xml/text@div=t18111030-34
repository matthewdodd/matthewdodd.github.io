            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the 16th of October, on board a ship in the West India Dock, I searched him, I found nothing upon him at that time. I told him that I had a warrant to apprehend him for robbing a man of two watches, and some money; the prosecutor was with me, he pointed him out. The next day I was going to search him again, he gave me a duplicate out of his pocket; he said he would leave him a monthly note to make good the watches and the notes he had lost, if he would let him go on board a ship.</p>
               <p>Q. to Harris. Look at that duplicate produced by Willan, is that the duplicate of that watch - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Willan. After that he was taken before the magistrate there the prisoner promised that he would pay the money if he would let him go. The magistrate asked him him if he had any means of paying him he said his captain would give him a monthly note for the payment of the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing taken down in writing that was signed by the prisoner - A. Yes, this is the prisoner's signing, it was read over by the clerk to him, and I saw the magistrate sign it.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Look at that watch - A. It is my watch, I know it, I bought it eight months ago; the case has an old spring, it will not keep fast. This is the watch that was in my chest, it was taken at the same time with my two notes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor was with me in my confinement, he said he would make it up if I had any money, last Monday.</p>

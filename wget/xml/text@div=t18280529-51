            . I lodge in this house. On Tuesday night I was at supper in the tap-room; the two prisoners came in, and entered into conversation with me, respecting Mr. Goodwin - I am not certain of their coming in together; they were strangers to me; Nelson particularly entered into conversation with me, saying he had been in Goodwin's employ, and how glad he was that he was doing well - he inquired particularly concerning what lodgers there were, and how they were let out in the morning - I said Goodwin let them out himself, I believed; Nelson asked if there was any back entrance, and if - Goodwin had any private room; I answered them every question, thinking they were his friends; they came again next night, about eleven o'clock; I do not know whether they were there before that, but I happened to be in the same box, opposite the entrance of the tap-room; we had a pint of beer, and about half-past eleven o'clock the company all departed; I moved from the box facing the front passage, and sat by the fire; Nelson immediately got up out of the box where he sat, and went, as I thought. towards the front door; Lawrence followed him; Mr. and Mrs. Goodwin generally go round the house; they came into the tap-room saw nobody but me, and went down to lock up the house; I went to bed, but was afterwards called up, and found the prisoners in custody; I knew them to be the same men. I had told Goodwin on Tuesday what an excellent character they gave him; I told them where he slept and everything - I gave them all the information I could.</p>

I am a constable, and was fetched to the house soon after twelve o'clock; I found the prisoners in the back yard together, and took them to the watch-house; Nelson endeavoured to escape - a candle was found in Lawrence's hat; I returned to the premises, and found two large clasp knives and a penknife; the point of one knife was broken, like a glazier's knife, to cut glass; in the other part of the yard, where the prisoners had been concealing themselves, I found a phosphorus-box, with matches, a screw-driver, and a small bit of candle, and near that spot a small crow-bar and hammer.</p>

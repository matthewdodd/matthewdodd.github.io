                  </hi>. I am in the linen trade, and live at Leeds; I came to town to obtain a situation. On the 28th of May I spent the evening with a few friends, and on returning home across Cheapside, about half-past twelve or one o'clock at night, the prisoner came and took hold of my arm—we walked together down Queen-street—we stood together at the corner of St. Thomas Apostle, and I found her hand in my trowser' pocket—I felt in my pocket, and found my purse was much lighter than it was before—when I was out, at five in the evening, I had 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I know my money was safe when I left my companions—I had been having some<lb></lb>thing to drink, which I paid for—my impression is, I had about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but I cannot swear to a few shillings—I was intoxicated at the time—I am confident I had money in my purse, but cannot say what amount—when I counted my money after this, there was three half-sovereigns and two shillings—I cannot swear what I had before I felt her hand in my pocket—I cannot positively swear I had more than that when I left my friends—the prisoner was taken almost directly—I cannot say I was sober enough to know what passed—my purse was not taken, but the money was taken out of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a City policeman—the prisoner was given into my custody about one o'clock—I took her to the station—I asked if she had any money, she said, "No"—I told her to give up all the money she had about her—she said she had none—the clerk requested her to jump—she jumped three or four times, and two sovereigns and two shillings fell on the ground—she was not searched, there being no female there.</p>

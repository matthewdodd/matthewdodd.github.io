                  </hi>. I am clerk of the checks in the Custom-house at the London Docks. The prisoner was an extra weigher—amongst other duties, he was employed as weigher in the tobacco-warehouse—tobacco is bonded there till the duty is paid, and it is taken out—it is packed in large hogsheads—in the early part of March, in consequence of information, I paid attention to the tobacco-warehouse—on 4th March I was at the warehouse—the prisoner was there that day, in the tobacco department—that gave him access to the tobacco that was there—I observed him leave the tobacco-warehouse, and thought he appeared rather bulky—I gave Shain some directions; in consequence of which he went after the prisoner, and soon after<lb></lb>wards I went from the warehouse to No. 3, Christian-street, to the house of a man named Inch—I found the house in possession of an officer named Bridges—the prisoner was not there; he was in custody—his wages were 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day when working—the duty on the tobacco found on him would be nearly a guinea—he bore an excellent character.</p>

On 4th March I was near the tobacco-warehouse, in company with Mr. Morgan—I saw the prisoner come out about eight minutes past twelve o'clock—he appeared very bulky—I saw him join Inch in a public-house—they drank a pint of porter—I then followed the prisoner to 3, Christian-street, where Inch lived—Mr. Bridges was there—he took the prisoner into custody, and handed him to me—he said he had got some tobacco, but he did not wish to say where he got it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am principal warehouseman of the tobacco, in the London Docks. There are warehouses in the docks appropriated to the Crown, for the reception of tobaceo on which duty has not been paid—they are under the Crown locks, and under the charge of officers appointed to watch them—two of those warehouses are over the wine-warehouses—this tobacco is very much damaged by being pulled about and handled, but it is not to be called damaged tobacco—it has not been injured by wet or otherwise.</p>

I was in the neighbourhood of Inch's house, on 4th March—the prisoner was given by the inspector to Shain, and from him to me—I took him to the station, and found on him this tobacco, weighing 6 3/4 lbs.—it was chiefly in his waistcoat, and in the waistband of his trowsers, and some in his pockets.</p>

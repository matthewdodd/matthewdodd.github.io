On the 13th of June I went out, leaving a teacaddy in my kitchen down stairs; it contained the money stated - there is a private door, at which the prisoner goes in and out; on my return I saw him coming out at that door - I went in, and saw the tea-caddy in a washing-tub, broken open, and all the money gone from it, but three farthings - I pursued, and asked him to come back; I brought him back - he asked if his wife was at home; I told him No, and then told him my suspician of him - he swore, and said that all the money he had was his own, and that was the truth; I gave him into custody - he then threw out some silver; the officer said he had some more, and in pulling it out, the half-sovereign came out with it.</p>

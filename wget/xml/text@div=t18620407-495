I live at the Star beersbop, Webber-street, kept by my nephew, George Kingsmills—on Wednesday night, 26th February, Green came in with another person whom I could not swear to; but I believe it was Tarvoul—I am quite positive as to Green—he asked ma for some ale—I served him, and he gave me a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece—I had not sufficient change, and I sent Mrs. Carpenter for change for it, and she brought me change—I gave her the crown piece, and gave Green the change; and the two men, and two others who had come in after them and had a pint of ale, went away together—on the following Saturday Mrs. Carpenter gave me back a crown piece, which I found was bad, and afterwards gave it to the constable Collins—I next saw Green, I think, four or five days after the 26th February, in the Holly Branch public-house—I pointed him out to the policeman—I would swear to him.</p>

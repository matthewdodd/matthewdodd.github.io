On the morning of 25th September, about half-past 2 o'clock, I was in Fleet-street, Bethnal-green—I saw both the prisoners by the cellar flap of the Ram and Magpie public-house—I saw Devine with the cellar flap in his hand—there was no part of his person in the cellar—I had not seen him before—the prisoners looked and saw me and came towards me, they were at first about forty yards from me—Devine came on the same side as I was, and within half a yard of me—I turned my bull's-eye on his face and I saw distinctly that it was he—I let him pass me and I went to the cellar flap—I saw it had been removed—I then ran back and saw both the prisoners together, they were returning to come back—they went to a public-house, the King's Head—I saw them both go in and I went down in front of the public-house and stood in a door way—I saw Jeffreys come out every two or three minutes, he looked one way and another and then the landlord told them to come out that he might close his house—when Jeffrey came out, he looked about to see if he could see me, and he went back to the cellar flap again—I went towards him and he immediately made his way up Church-street—I followed him and took him in custody—when he went to the flap he stayed two or three minutes—I disturbed him and Devine walked away—I took Jeffreys to the station—then went to the public-house and saw the flap had been moved—I saw the landlord and went inside but could not see any one—I was ten minutes before I could get in—I went to the back but I could see no one—there were two bolts to the cellar flap—they had been drawn and the flap had been forced open—my brother officer took Devine about a week afterwards—I am satisfied he was the man.</p>

I keep the Ram and Magpie in Fleet-street, Bethnal-green—on the morning of 25th September, I was called up by the last witness and went in the cellar; I saw the spirits had been moved—there were marks of a boot or shoe, and some buttons of trousers were found—the value of the spirits which had been moved was about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the back part of my house was open and there was a man in the cellar—he rushed up the cellar stairs, broke the lock off the cellar door, unbolted the back door, got out and got away; this was at the back of the house, but the flap was at the front.</p>

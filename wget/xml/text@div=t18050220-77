               <p>Q. How far up Rupert-street were you from Coventry-street - were you half way up from Coventry-street? - A. No, not so much as that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he coming up Coventry-street? - A. Yes.</p>

Have you not said there would be a reward of twelve pounds from the parish, and forty pounds besides, and upon the oath you have taken, have not you, upon that ground, offered to take sixteen pounds of any body? - A. No; there was a gentleman with me and he wanted to give me a sum of money; I told him I could do nothing in it.</p>
               <p>Q. My question is whether you have not offered to take the sum of sixteen pounds? - A. No, they wanted me to take a sum of money, how much was not mentioned, to the best of my knowledge; I told him I could not do any thing at all with it, I did not wish to appear against him, it was disobliging my master.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you offered to take money and goods, or any thing else besides money; twelve pounds and a pair of boots? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Do you know the names of any of these people that came after you and offered you this money? - A. One is Smith or Clarke, I cannot say exactly.</p>
               <p>- WILSON sworn. - Smith, an inhabitant of Rupert-street came to me to take the prisoner into custody, and when I came I found Slade with him; he desired me to assist him, which I did; he laid hold of one side, and I the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the last witness Chaunt there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had hold of the prisoner at that time? - A. Slade; there was an altercation at that time; Chaunt was close to him, and a gentleman brought the boy over with the bundle that he was robbed of and took care of the boy that he should not lose it again; I took him to Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who the gentleman was? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Mr. Pooley. Q. What do you know it by? - A. I know it by its being dirty, that is all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was coming down the end of Coventry-street and I heard the cry of stop thief; I saw a man cross with it; that is all I can say.</p>
               <p>Wilson. He said, after he had been confined, that if the two Saffron-hill lads had been with him he would have cut his way through all the mob; I heard him say that.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you had any conversation with Chaunt himself, at his own house? - A. I was there, and when I went there he told me himself, that he was the same day down enquiring for me, on the former part of the day; he said, we have been to day with the bill, and we have not found it; he said, if you come to morrow morning, before eight o'clock, and give me ten pounds and a pair of boots, as you are in the shoemaking line, I wish to make a flaw in the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that? - A. When we went with the officer to find the bill; he said, we know how to make a flaw in it, if not, his life lies in my hands; I said, I cannot positively say I shall be with you in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you he would send his wife? - A. Yes, and his wife did call last night; his wife was with me on Monday night, and last night his wife called about seven o'clock in the evening at my house; I was with him last night was a week, and then he said he should expect sixteen pounds, after that, he said he would take twelve pounds; he said the parish that he was taken in gives twelve pounds, and there was a forty pound reward; there were two people with me heard him say, that if he should be convicted he should be entitled to forty pounds; he said the boy saw nothing about it, nor knows nothing about it, it all lies to me.</p>
               <p>Q Are you sure that passed from him to you about the forty pounds and the twelve pounds? - A. Upon my oath; he cannot deny it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When did you first know any thing of Chaunt? - A. When the prisoner sent to me, and told me he was in trouble; that was the first time that I knew any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon that where did you go? - A. He said there is a man that laid hold of me, by the name of Chaunt; he lives in little St. Andrew's lane, he is a bridle bit maker by business.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Chaunt? - A. I did; I asked him what this man was in trouble about; he said, I took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180502200065"></xptr>hold of him, he was running along the street; I do not wish to hurt the man, I can get out of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you offer to give him any thing? - A. No, it was his own words.</p>
               <p>Q. How often did you go to his house? - A. Three times in all, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear it was no more than three times? - A. It might be four times that I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. It might be more? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you go to Chaunt's house four times for? - A. After he told me the business, he told me he would not appear against the man if I would give him sixteen pounds; I never made any bargain with him.</p>

               <p>Q. I want to know what you went after him first for? - A. To hear what the man had done, I was entirely a stranger to the business; then in invited me to come up there.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you went up to spend the evening, and not on business about the prisoner? - A. I only made enquiry of what the man had done.</p>

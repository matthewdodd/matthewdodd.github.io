                  </hi>. I am a music publisher. On 4th Nov. Buck, who was porter to my printer, came to my house—I watched him—he went out with two reams of music paper on his shoulder—I crossed over to the railing in Sobo-square—he looked back to my shop several times—he turned down an archway—I went on to his masters and waited till he came—I opened the door to him—he had only one ream of paper—I said, "What have you done with the other ream?"—he said he had dropped it in the mud and would go back and find it—I said, "No, it is not likely; you will come in and tell me what you have done with it"—he said,—"Pray have mercy on me?"—I said, "Tell me what you have done with it?"—he hesitated a good while, and at last agreed to take me to where he left it—he took me to a grocer's shop in Crown-street, kept by Huddert—I said to Huddert, "Do you know this man?"—he said, "Yes; I have bought a small quantity of paper of him"—I said, "Where is it?"—he said, "I have not paid for it"—he threw it down, and said, "There it is"—I called a policeman, and the prisoners were taken to the station—we came back to the house and found a quantity of paper which I believe to be mine—it has been made up into bags—it is music paper, not grocer's paper—I was a good deal excited.</p>

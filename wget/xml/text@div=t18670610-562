               <p>drawn up to be loaded and unloaded in a passage which is no thoroughfare for carts—on Monday evening, May 6th, I was at the South-Western district office; I received information, and saw the two prisoners and a third man loitering about the office—on the arrival of the cart, when the bags were taken out, I saw Shannon go up to the cart and come back and go into the lobby; he then went to the cart again, lifted up the lid, and walked away—a few minutes afterwards he went into the lobby again, came out, turned round instantly, and walked away—some one came out of the office and stood at the door, and almost immediately the driver came out, got on the cart, and drove away—on the following Friday evening I was there again, and saw the same three persons loitering about; Shannon went and stood by the wheel of the cart, as if he was making water—he went into the lobby of the office again, turned round, and instantly came out—I then left the office, after giving instructions to a police-officer, and as I was is Chapel Street, round at the back, I saw the two prisoners with the other man—Shannon had a mail bag under his arm; the two officers came almost immediately, Rumbold seized Shannon and Smee seized Neville—Shannon threw the bag down down, and the third man ran away as fast as he could—it was the bag made up for Fulham.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Who was the third man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know—I have seen him once since, in Cheapside; I went to look for a policeman, and he was gone—this place is a thoroughfare—there was no one specially told off to look after the bags—Shannon appeared to have been drinking, from his violent manner of attacking the policeman, but he was not drunk—I heard the name Blackie mentioned.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable attached to the Post Office—in con<lb></lb>sequence of information, I was watching at the South-Western district office on the evening of 10th May—the mail cart came while I was there, but twenty minutes before it came I saw the prisoners loitering about—when the cart drove up, the bags were taken out, and about five or ten minutes passed; two or three mail bags were then brought out by a porter and placed in the cart, and Shannon immediately walked into the lobby turned round sharp, took out a bag, placed it under his arm, and walked away through a court as fast he could; when I next saw him he was about 200 yards from the office in Palace Street, Neville was on one side of him, and another man on the other, walking with the bag under his arm—I seized Neville, and Rumbold seized Shannon, who threw the bag into the road and put his leg round Rumbold, and both fell in the road—he struggled very violently some few minutes, but we ultimately took them to the post-office, where they asked Rumbold what they were charged with; he said, "With stealing that mail beg from the cart"—Shannon said, "Well, I suppose it is all right; you have got me to <hi rend="italic">rights</hi> this time"—he was very violent and excited, and said that he would not be searched; I saw a knife in his right hand—I assisted Rumbold in searching him, I got hold of his left hand, and he dropped the knife into his pocket, and said, "I can do nothing now my weapon is gone"—Rumbold took it out of his pocket—Neville said, "Never mind, Shannon, it is all right"—that was the first time I heard the name of Shannon—he called out again when we were going into a cab, "Never mind, Shannon, it is all right"—there was a third man, I know him by sight, that is all—I had seen the prisoners</p>

               <p>together before on three or four occasions round by the office, watching—I asked Neville if his name was Blackie, as I thought he was the person who had been pointed out to me in the street by name.</p>

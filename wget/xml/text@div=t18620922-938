                  </hi>. I am a labourer at Miller's farm, Shepherd's-busb—on 18th August last, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the two prisoners siting close together on some stones—I was breaking stones—they were passing money from one to the other—I was about ten yards from them—the Princess Victoria public-house is about a hundred yards distant—I went there, said something to the landlady, and stayed there—after a few minutes the prisoners came in—Mahony threw down a shilling, and called for a pint of beer—I saw the landlady double the shilling up, and she kept it and gave it to the policeman as soon as he came in—nothing else was done with it—the police were sent for, and I saw the prisoners taken in custody—they drank the beer together.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Kelly. Q.</hi> How much beer did we have to drink in that house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Only one pint while I was there—the landlady bent the coin up as far as it was then bent—I saw you sitting on the heap of stones for twenty minutes, I believe you sat on the side and looked at me as I was making the road—you tossed up a shilling to see which should go into the public-house first—I saw you toss it up, and I immediately went to the landlady and said, "There are two <hi rend="italic">smashers</hi> about, and you look out"</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Walter Boyer, who keeps the Princess Victoria public-house—on 18th August, I saw the two prisoners in the bar there—I heard what the last witness said—it happened just as he stated.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Kelly.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Kelly's Defence.</hi> I met this young man, and knowing him by his dealing in the same goods as myself, we came part of the way together. I sat down on the stones to have a smoke, being tired, and he said, "Will you come and have a drop of beer?" He took me to the public-house, called for a pint of beer, and paid for it. I found the landlady would not take the coin, as it was bad. I put it in my mouth and said, "It is bad." I saw no more of the other money till the next day at the station-house; that is the only public-house I have been in with him. I know nothing of what money Mahony had, and I cannot account for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Mahony's Defence.</hi> I met this man about half a mile this side of the woman's house. I gave him some tobacco, and asked him to come and have a pint of beer. I went and put down a shilling; the landlady said it was bad. This man picked it up and I put down a two-shilling piece for the beer, and she gave me a shilling, a sixpence, and four pennyworth of half-pence change.</p>

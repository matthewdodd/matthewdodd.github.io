On the 19th of October, about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, the two prisoners came into the shop; I am certain of them both; Gardner came twice that day. On the 20th, about the same time, they came again; I recollected them immediately - they asked to look at a watch which they had seen the day before; Gardner said he wished to have it - he left 5s. as a deposit, and was to call in a few days for it. I am certain of them both; Gardner gave his name as West, and after they had paid the 5s. they were going out together - they turned back short, and left the door a jar; Gardner then asked to see some watch-chains, which were in a glass-case by the side of the window; he paid me 2s. 6d. for the chain, and went suddenly out of the shop; I directly missed a case from the counter, containing fifteen gold watches, and about seven silver ones; the case had been put on the counter twenty minutes or a quarter of an hour before they came in; no other customer or stranger had been in the shop besides them, only a relation of Mr. Grant's. The case of watches was safe on the counter when the prisoners came in, and was within their reach; no one came in while they were there: I missed it a few seconds after Gardner left the door. The watches cost upwards of 400l. I immediately called the boy up, and ran into the street after them, but they were out of sight. The case was brought back to Mr. Grant's, by a ticket-porter the next day - I am sure it is the one which had the watches in it - here it is. I found Gardner in custody about a fortnight ago; I was taken into three different rooms, where there were thirty or forty persons - nobody was pointed out to me. I was told if I saw him to take no notice, but the moment I saw him the impression was so strong I immediately touched him on the shoulder. I saw Jones on the Friday following, at the Mansion House, among others, in the Justice room, and pointed him out to Mr. Cope, the marshal.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Was not Jones at the bar, under charge? A. I do not exactly know where the bar is; several people stood before him; he stood at a bar, among five or six other persons; I was not told I should see him. I was sent for against a person suspected to be the man; he was brought in after I got there, but I did not see him brought in, norin charge of any officer. Mr. Alexander Gordon, a relation of master's, came in a quarter of an hour before them. I had seen the case while the prisoners were in the shop; there was something singular in their appearance; Jones had a fustian coat. I know him by his face; his dress was very different when he was taken.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did Jones appear to you, at the Mansion House, to be in a more forward situation than the others? A. No, my Lord - three or four stood in the same line; and when I first saw him I did not know it was a place for persons in custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Has your master any partner? A. No, nor any other Christian name. The case has a glass top; the watches were loose in it. I was behind the counter when they went out. The shop door is five or six feet from the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not the watches flap against the glass? A. They might, but if carefully handled I think a watch would not come against the glass. I suppose I was ten feet from the door - Gardner was very close to me at the counter, and intercepted my seeing Jones passing - He had a fustian frock coat on; I do not think the case would go into their pockets; he might put it under his frock coat; my back was to the door - it was broad day-light. Crown-court is two doors from our shop - it leads to Water-lane, and has two passages leading out of it. The case was not broken at all when it was brought back.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was your back towards them? A. Yes - only while I turned round to take the chain out of the glass-case; my back was then towards both of them; I only showed him one chain, and while I turned my back to get it Jones left the shop; Gardner remained, and paid for it. I had not time to put the cases in the window - there were four cases on the counter.</p>

            . I am porter to Mr. John Threader, a hatter, who lives at No. 74 Fleet-street, next door to Mr. Grant. On<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160007"></xptr>>the 19th of October, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, I was cleaning the windows outside the shop, and saw two young men standing at Mr. Grant's window; Gardner was one of them. On the 20th I was again cleaning the windows, and saw Gardner with another person, whom I thought was the same I had seen before; they stood about the door; I saw them go into Mr. Grant's shop - I went in to breakfast, and saw no more. I afterwards saw Gardner in custody, at a public-house opposite the Mansion House, and was sure he was the person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. This was between eight and nine o'clock? A. Yes, and the same time on the 20th. I went to breakfast in less than five minutes after they went into the shop; I might be twenty minutes at breakfast, and heard of this loss directly I came down, after nine o'clock. Gardner had a black body coat on, and the other a fustian coat, with pockets on each side; I cannot say whether it was buttoned; there is a court next door but one to Mr. Grant's. I do not think it possible for Gardner to put the case into his pocket.</p>

            . I am shop-boy to Mr. Grant. On the 19th of October I saw two persons, like the prisoners, come into the shop - I did not see their faces, and cannot positively swear to them; they left the door open, and I shut it by Bannister's order. I did not see them on the 20th, but was called up about twenty minutes to nine o'clock, and the case of watches was gone. I had left the shop about half-past eight; it was then on the counter, and contained watches. I saw the prisoners when they were taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You saw two men, whose faces you did not look at? A. I saw one of their faces, but did not take notice of them; the alarm was given before nine o'clock, I think - there were more cases on the counter, but they are of a different shape to this; I had dusted them, and know how many there were; when the alarm was given I looked and missed this one. The watches laid in the case, with a leather under them, but none on the top - they were not fixed; they would slide down if the case was turned up end-ways; it must be carried flat to keep them safe: they all had glasses.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Are all the cases in the shop alike? A. No- they are all moveable; some of the others had watches in them.</p>

            . I have been a ticket-porter at Fleet-market three years, and live at No. 3, Five-foot-lane. On the 20th of October, about nine o'clock in the morning, I picked up this case, with a bit of leather and paper by it, in Five-foot-lane, Old Fish-street, stuck in the window bars of Messrs. Yates and Hancock's premises, outside the window, by the area-grating; it must have been put there by somebody outside the house; it is a darkish place. I took it home, and at eleven o'clock that day took it to Guildhall, and was told to keep it till it was advertised. I took it to Mr. Grant's next morning, in consequence of what I saw in the paper; I left it there till to-day, and have now brought it here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How far is this place from Mr. Grant's? A. It is about three minutes walk - it is by Bread-street-hill. I am sure it was before nine, for the clock struck when I got in doors - it is not a public place, but it is a thoroughfare into Thames-street.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>What age are you? - Sixteen the 15th of last June.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - I live with my father and mother.</p>
               <p>What is your father? - He is in trade, he lives with his mistress, Mrs. Adams, an ironmonger.</p>
               <p>Where do your father and mother live? - In Rose-lane, Spitalfields, No. 3.</p>
               <p>Did you live with your father and mother at this time? - No, Sir, I lived at Mr. Cox's, at the Black Horse and Trumpet, the corner of Lemon-street.</p>
               <p>How long have you known the prisoner? - I knew him no longer than while I lived at Mr. Cox's, he was a customer; I lived there in November, it was the 23d of October that he committed the rape.</p>
               <p>What is he? - He is a <rs id="t17821204-26-deflabel130" type="occupation">waiter</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17821204-26-defend299 t17821204-26-deflabel130"></join> at Miss Brown's Hotel, which is near to Mr. Cox's, and is right opposite.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any particular acquaintance with him before this? - No, my Lord, I never spoke to the man, any further than to give him his beer, and what he asked for; I never had any particular correspondence with him in my life.</p>
               <p>Tell us what you have to charge the prisoner at the bar with? - On Wednesday night, the 23d of October last, the prisoner came and had some beer, I do not know what time that was, but it was at night, and afterwards he left the house, he had three pints of beer and three pipes, he and another man.</p>
               <p>Had you any particular conversation with the prisoner during the time that he and this other man was at your house? - No, I had nothing to say to him.</p>
               <p>Had he any thing to say to you? - He did not speak to me indeed; between ten and eleven he came and ordered a pint of beer, I drew it, and there was nobody to take it, and I carried it to the Hotel, and he met me in the passage as I took it.</p>
               <p>What did he say to you? - He said nothing, but took the pint of beer out of my hand, and by main force he took and dragged<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178212040036"></xptr> me along to the parlour that comes into the street, that parlour that fronts the street, and he fastened three doors upon me.</p>
               <p>What doors were these? - There was a door in the passage, and a door that is right fronting this parlour door, and the parlour door; he threw me down while he lay with me.</p>
               <p>What did he do? - Why, Sir, he laid with me, as I suppose a man lays with his wife, as I was told, Sir.</p>
               <p>You must be more particular, you must say what he did to you? - He took me in and threw me down, and put my petticoats over my mouth, and his hand over that, while he lay with me.</p>
               <p>You must say particularly what he did, you are young and unexperienced, perhaps it may not be that thing that you suppose? - He lay with me in the room after he had thrown me down.</p>
               <p>What did he do to you particularly? - He lay with me as I suppose a man lays with his wife.</p>
               <p>You must say particularly, you must describe it, because the man's life is in hazard; he must not be convicted on your supposition, you must describe it; say particularly what he did; it is perfectly necessary you should say what he did? (No answer.)</p>
               <p>Why do not you say what he did? - Why, Sir!</p>
               <p>You must say what he did; perhaps on your account it may not amount to a rape, therefore you must speak particularly; you cannot tell whether it is a rape or not; that is the reason why you must be particular; it is necessary you should say what he did, and therefore it will not be wrong or improper you should say it; if you do not say it, the man must be acquitted. - (No answer.)</p>

               <p>What did you feel? What did he do? - I felt a great deal of pain while he lay with me: he unbuttoned his breeches while he lay with me.</p>
               <p>You must say particularly what he did? - He put his t - g into my body while he lay with me.</p>
               <p>What his private parts? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Did you perceive any thing come from him? - Yes Sir I did.</p>
               <p>How long was he about this? - I cannot justly say, it might be half an hour, or it might not be so long.</p>
               <p>Did he do it more than once? - I do not know that he did any thing more than once.</p>
               <p>Did you struggle? - Yes I did struggle, and I cried out, but I could not make any body come to my assistance.</p>
               <p>Could you struggle more? - I struggled as long as ever I could.</p>
               <p>Was it half an hour before he got his ends of you? - No Sir, I was in the place I believe about half an hour altogether.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay in the place after he had got his ends of you? - He took and dragged me out, took and led me over to my mistress's door.</p>
               <p>When you came to your own door did your mistress observe any thing? - After he had led me over the way he told me, if I divulged it to any body, when he met me he would use me ill.</p>
               <p>Then you did not tell your mistress of it? - Not the same night, because I was so bad and so frightened; but I told my mistress the next day, she was busy, and that I did not tell her.</p>
               <p>When did you tell your mistress of it? - I told her on the Thursday night, the next night as she was standing at the door.</p>
               <p>How soon after your coming home, after the prisoner had had his ends of you, did you see your mistress? - I saw her directly, and I gave her the money for the beer.</p>
               <p>Then you did not go up stairs before you saw your mistress? - She was down stairs.</p>
               <p>How much time was there between the time the prisoner quitted you in the street, and the time you saw your mistress? - I saw my mistress about six minutes after.</p>
               <p>Then you who had been thrown down, and used as you have told us, had only six minutes to adjust yourself and come into your mistress's presence, and she did not observe any thing that had happened; how was that?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178212040037"></xptr> - She was in a hurry: I told my mistress of it the next night; and I told

             the house maid of it the next day about dinner time, she is not here; she is the maid at the Hotel.</p>
               <p>Did you speak to your mistress first about it, or your mistress to you? - I spoke first; the prisoner was standing at his door with a pint pot in his hand, my mistress was standing at her door, and I went to the green-stall, and my mistress said she could not think what he stood at his door with the pint pot in his hand for, she said she supposed he was going some where else; then I up and told my mistress in what manner he had used me, my mistress said she could not help it, she is here, and on the Saturday morning my mistress discharged me, and told me that the clerk at Miss Brown's Hotel desired I should go away.</p>
               <p>You used to go there often? - Yes, when the boy was out of the way I was obliged to go; I came away on the same account.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. You was dragged into this room I think you say my girl, and it was a front parlour? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who was in the back parlour pray? - It is a double house and they were all backwards.</p>
               <p>Was there nobody in the next room? - I did not hear any body.</p>
               <p>You resisted for a long time, you must be pretty well tumbled, your cap and your clothes? - My hair was up, my handkerchief was tumbled.</p>
               <p>And your petticoats were tumbled a little? - It was out of the binding.</p>
               <p>Only out at the binding? I am afraid you did not make much resistance? - Yes I did, I hallood out, and begged of him to let me go.</p>
               <p>You never told Mrs. Cox that night, I think you say? - No.</p>
               <p>Why not pray? - Because I was frightened.</p>
               <p>What, did you go up to bed directly? - No, I staid up about three quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>Did you tell your master that night? - No.</p>
               <p>This is not the first thing of the kind that has happened to you I believe? - I never knew a man before.</p>
               <p>But you have been ravished before, have not you? - No.</p>
               <p>No! why pray do not you know Mr. Kirby? - I did live with Mrs. Kirby, and she was in the country; and her husband did try, but he did not do any thing.</p>
               <p>But I believe though you charged him with it, and the poor man was frightened, and I believe you made him pay for doing nothing? - My mistress gave me half a guinea, and she told me that was to pay for tumbling my gown.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live at No. 78, Lower Marsh, Lambeth. On Saturday, 25th April, the prisoner came to my shop and bought some meat—it came to five pence or seven pence, and he tendered me a counterfeit florin—I broke it in two pieces—I gave him one piece, and the other fell on the floor—my shopman, Curtis, said to me, "Examine that crown piece that you took just now"—I looked in the till and found a counterfeit crown—I followed the prisoner and overtook him, and brought him back to the shop—I said to him, "Where is your <hi rend="italic">pal</hi> that passed the bad crown piece just now"—he said, "I have no <hi rend="italic">pal</hi>"—I said, "Where is that bad florin"—I took his hand, and took from it the piece of the bad florin which I had given him—I gave him into custody—I returned from the station and examined the shop, and found the other part of the florin on the floor—I had received the crown piece five or six minutes before I received the florin—it was paid in purchase for some pieces of meat which came to five pence or seven pence—I gave change for it, and put the crown in a bowl in the till—I gave the pieces of the florin and the crown to the officer.</p>

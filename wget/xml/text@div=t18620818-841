I picked up the things, and when the policeman said, "What have you got there?" I dropped the bundle and ran a few yards. The policeman took me, and charged me with stealing them. There was nothing then in the pocket; when he brought the prosecutor an hour afterwards they found 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the pocket. I know nothing of this robbery. What has become of all the other money? I did not know they were stolen.</p>

               <p>SACK PARMENT. I am a Lascar; I was cook of the Lady Casmer, East Indiaman.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner - A. A Malay.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see a Malay and Sidah do any thing - A. Yes, I saw Sidah roasting a potatoe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did a quarrel arise between them about a potatoe - A. Yes; the quarrel began with them both; one said it is mine, and the other said it was his; at last they began fighting; the Malay took his shoe, and knocked him; Sidah, after being knocked by the Malay, he set off. The Malays wanted to tie up Sidah and flog him.</p>
               <p>Q. How many Malays were there at first - A. Seven or eight. They took him to tie him up; they did not tie him up; they said they would fight.</p>

               <p>Q. Who talked of fighting - A. The Malays. The prisoner said, what do you want; come along, and fight. All the Sidahs were quiet, but when the Malays came out against the Sidahs then they began fighting.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they fight - A. Yes, the Sidahs had sticks, and the Malays had knives and scrapers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what the prisoner had - A. The prisoner had a Batavian knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stay to see them fight - A. I saw the fighting; I ran away into my own room. The Sidahs came into the same room where I was sitting.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181309150043"></xptr>Q. What did the Sidahs come into that room for - A. To hide themselves from flogging.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the man that is dead come into that room - A. Sidah was sitting in that room; he ran away first. The Sidahs shut the door; the Malays got in at the window. Abdulah got in at the window. When the Malays came in, the Malays beat the Sidahs with their sticks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Abdulah do any thing - A. I saw him stab Sidah with a knife upon his belly. I saw him stab Sidah with the knife with my own eyes.</p>
               <p>Q. What nation are the Sidahs - A. Madsgascars.</p>
               <p>MR. CRESSEY. I am a pupil at the London hospital. I was there when the deceased was brought in. The deceased had a wound in the belly, on the right side of the abdomen, which extended into the cavity; likewise a wound in his right loins. I attended him until his death. He died in two days.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the cause of his death - A. The wound in his belly; it appeared to be done with a knife. He was brought in a dying state. He had received a mortal wound.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. We were fighting. I do not know who stabbed the knife.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to William Humphreys, who kept the Pine Apple public-house in Hungerford-street, Strand. On the 1st of March, 1839, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the bar—a man, very much resembling the prisoner, came to the bar and asked for some bread and cheese and beer—I served him—while he was eating it, another man came in and went into the tap-room—I went in after him—he did not join or speak to the prisoner—I was away from the bar about three minutes—I left a tin cash-box in a little drawer inside the bar—I had seen it safe about a quarter of an hour before—I had not left the bar from the time I saw it, till I went into the tap-room—a person could reach it by leaning over the counter—when I returned, the man resembling the prisoner, was gone, and the cash-box also—he had only taken a small portion of his bread and cheese and beer, and left the rest—the drawer was a little way open—there was four sovereigns, four, half-sovereigns, and about 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the cash-box—I immediately gave on alarm, and went to the door—I saw Kinsman, and told him what had happened—I have never teen the cash-box again.</p>

                  </hi>. On the day of the robbery, I had charge of a gen<lb></lb>tleman's horse and chaise—I observed the prisoner walking up and down Hungerford-street, facing the prosecutor's house, and saw him peep through a hole in the shutters several times—as soon as some men came out, the prisoner went in—I saw him come out in about five minutes with the cash-box under his arm, and run away—I saw him again six months after the robbery, but he made his escape before I could see a policeman to give him in charge—I have known him five years, and have worked for him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-sergeant. I received information at the station-house in Bow-street, on the 1st of March, 1839—I saw Kins<lb></lb>man that afternoon at the prosecutor's—I tried to apprehend the prisoner, but was not successful till the 5th of this month, when I took him at a beer-shop in Pocock's-fields, Islington—Kinsman went with me, and re<lb></lb>cognised him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The prisoner is proprietor of that beer-shop, is he not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I understand so—I inquired for him at pretty well all parts of the town, but could not hear the least of him—I found him at the beer-shop, in consequence of information I received—I had been out days and nights after him—I looked for him in Covent-garden market, but not latterly, he was a greengrocer, and dealt there—I never saw him there—I would not undertake to say he was not there—I was never able to find him—Mr. Humphreys is confined to his bed.</p>

Gentlemen, the indictment charges this man, and two other persons with this offence, and it will be necessary to prove in order to bring the prisoner within this law, that there were three men of them, and therefore though the other two are not apprehended, and whether we shall be able to apprehend them, I cannot say; yet it will be necessary for you to take into consideration, the case of the other two; but if the facts come out as they are stated to me, there will be no doubt of their guilt, any more than of the prisoner's: the prisoner, and those two other persons, are belonging to a place called Corsham, in Cornwall; a place noted for persons of the description of the prisoner; they had been seen loitering about Ringmore, which was not the place of their abode: on the first of August, one

Woodhouse ran to fetch the other officer, and before they returned, these three men, the prisoner, and May and Randell, ran off with the liquors which the officers had seized; they returned again, and swore they would have the remainder; upon which Toy took up a bag of tea, and these three men followed him; they forced open the parlour door and took the tea from him, and carried it into the yard where Woodhouse was, who endeavoured to get it away from them, upon which Randell struck him a violent blow with his bludgeon on the temple, which brought him to the ground, and rendered him totally insensible; upon this Toy came up, and he began to be very active, and he with a bludgeon with several claws sticking out of it, by which I suppose is meant, they are the roots of the stick, not any iron fixed into it, as I suppose, but the wood so pointed as to make excresences, and sharp ones; he made a blow at him with this, and that took off the brim of his hat; Toy came and rescued him: the three smugglers then became more violent; they swore they would have all the things; the officers told them they should not; and the officers finding they were determined to preserve the things went away: it is upon this act you are to determine whether the prisoner is guilty. Gentlemen, it is not for me to make any observations, but such as naturally arise out of the direct case; I do not wish to inflame your minds; the question is a question of fact; what the law is, his Lordship will<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230080"></xptr> explain; and upon applying that law to the facts, as they appear to you, will depend the verdict you are to give: all I can say is, that if the prisoner is guilty, he is undoubtedly a very proper object of justice; and unless these prosecutions are carried on with effect, wheresoever there is a fair and proper example, it will be impossible the revenue of this country should much longer escape destruction.</p>

            , near Ringmore, called the parsonage house.</p>
               <p>Did you make any search at this parsonage house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What happened in consequence of that? - I first went into a barn, and searched it round, and I found a bag of tea concealed under the floor, about half a hundred weight, I found nothing else in the barn; next I turned round a corner of a hay-loft, I examined it and there I found ten casks of foreign geneva, I tasted one of them.</p>
               <p>In what situation were these ten casks? - They were concealed under the hay, in different parts of the loft, upon this I removed some of them from the loft into the yard.</p>
               <p>Where were Valentine and Woodhouse at this time? - I had lost them for sometime they came up to me, and I told them it was very difficult work to remove all the casks; I went into the house, and desired to have assistance in removing the rest.</p>
               <p>Did they come and assist? - They did.</p>
               <p>When the liquors was so removed into the yard, what passed then? - Then we agreed that Woodhouse should stay there, while Valentine and me went and searched further, he was to stay in the yard with the liquor.</p>
               <p>Did you make further search? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What was the consequence of that? - We went into a field of barley adjoining the house, and soon after we got into it, Valentine found another cask of liquors in the field.</p>
               <p>Court. What liquor was it? - We supposed it was gin, we did not taste it then.</p>
               <p>Did you after? - Yes, we had it, it was geneva.</p>
               <p>Did you find any thing else in that field of barley? - Some little time afterwards, Valentine found a half hundred bag of tea, and soon after we found this last bag of tea; we heard a noise of some person calling, we soon understood it to be the supervisor, Mr. Woodhouse.</p>

               <p>What distance was you at this time from the yard where Woodhouse was left? - I believe it was a quarter of a mile, we returned to Woodhouse; we met the supervisor at the field gate adjoining the yard in a very great hurry, we all three went back to the yard again.</p>
               <p>Court. Who was in the yard when you came back? - I think there was the supervisor and a neighbouring man, there were no strangers there; I think there was a man standing at a little distance.</p>
               <p>What, was the labouring man to assist Woodhouse? - I do not know what Woodhouse had said to him, he was not called there by Woodhouse, he came himself first of all, from hearing a seizure was made, his name is Hall.</p>
               <p>When you all three came back to the yard, what did you do? - We meant then to remove these goods from the yard into the farm-house.</p>
               <p>Did you proceed to do so? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What passed on that? - I carried in the last bag of tea myself, and as I was entering the door with this tea, I saw three men at a distance coming to the farm house.</p>

            , as I understood their names to be since, I have seen them all before, but had no great acquaintance with them.</p>
               <p>Court. Where did you see them? - Directly opposite the farm-house door, they came over a stile and run directly after me.</p>
               <p>Did you see them coming over the stile? - I cannot say I saw them coming over the stile, they were just by the stile, they might be over, there was no other way for them to come but over the stile, that was about a hundred yards from the house, they pursued me into the house; I carried a bag of tea into the parlour on the left hand, and shut the parlour door.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you shut the door of the house? - No, I shut the door of the parlour, there was no bolt to the best of my remembrance, I put my knee against it, and kept it as long as I could.</p>
               <p>What did these three persons do? - They forced the door open upon me, and I asked them when they came in, whether they meant to murder me, for by their threats before they broke in, I expected they would; they made use of a deal of ill language that I cannot repeat, open the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230083"></xptr> door you b - g - r, and all the names that they could.</p>
               <p>What did they say they would do? - Murder, or something of that sort.</p>
               <p>What sort of language was it? - Threatening language, I was terrified or else I could have kept the door longer, my strength was gone through fear, but I did not open the door myself, they forced it open, then the prisoner said I should not be hurt, provided I would deliver up all the goods, for the goods were theirs, and they would have them.</p>
               <p>What became of the bag of tea and the goods? - The bag of tea was taken out by one of them, it was laying on the floor in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Had these men any thing in their hands? - They had bludgeons in their hands, large sticks.</p>
               <p>Court. Tell us what you mean by these sticks? - The stick that the prisoner had in his hand, was a stick with a large head to it, about three feet long.</p>
               <p>How thick was this stick? - A pretty large stick, with a big head.</p>
               <p>What sort of a head? - It was a big head, out of which there seemed to be several claws.</p>
               <p>Court. Were there or were there not claws, do not tell us of seeming? - There were something that projected out about an inch long, they seemed to be sharp to the best of my remembrance; the others had sticks and bludgeons, one of them had a stick and bludgeon, and one had a long stick and a short one.</p>
               <p>Court. What sort of one was the short one? - They call it a bludgeon, I believe the other was a walking stick.</p>
               <p>Are they usually called bludgeons? - Yes, Randell had the walking stick, and the short stick, May had a stick in his hand, I cannot remember what sort of a one it was.</p>
               <p>What sort of stick was it? - It was a large stick.</p>
               <p>How large? - About the size of a common walking stick.</p>

               <p>Was it as large as this? - Larger than that.</p>
               <p>How long was what you call a bludgeon? - About half the length of this, and I believe three times as thick as this.</p>
               <p>How much thicker than that stick, was the stick that May had? - It was thicker than that, but I cannot tell how thick.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you observe the stick that May had in his hand, so as to be sure in giving us an account of the size of it? - I remember him to have a stick in his hand, but I cannot tell the size of it, I cannot say whether it was thicker than that or not, I was very much hurried at the time; after some little time, I followed them into the yard, and Woodhouse was in the yard; I observed Rundell and Woodhouse have the bag of tea between them, Rundell would have it, and Woodhouse said he would lose his life sooner than he should have it, I then told Woodhouse I would stand by him.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner present at this time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were all three present at the time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What passed upon this? - Soon after I saw Mr. Woodhouse knocked down by Rundell.</p>
               <p>What did he knock him down with? - With a long stick, I believe it was one or other of the sticks, but I believe it to be the long stick.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts did he strike him? - Upon the temple, he was insensible for some time, and as soon as he came to himself he shewed the mark; after Woodhouse was knocked down, there seemed to be a general scuffing, and the prisoner made a blow at me with his bludgeon, that was the bludgeon with the claws, he missed my head, and cut down the brim of my hat, (The hat produced,) the hat has been sewed and worn since, but it has not been torn further; it is just the same as it was, it hung down on my shoulders, as soon as the blow was struck.</p>
               <p>What passed after this? - I attempted to catch the prisoner's stick, and I did get hold of the best end of it, some little time, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230084"></xptr> May jumped to his assistance; I had hold of the big end of it, and in the scuffle I fell, I had a tuck in my hand, and they attempted to take the tuck from me, but Valentine came to my assistance, and they could not get it from me, they quitted me, and then I got up; I then went towards the prisoner with my tuck, I told him I would make the best use of the weapon I had, if he attempted to strike again.</p>
               <p>What became of the liquors and tea? - The remainder of the liquors and the tea we stowed after some time, the bag of tea was then there in the cart by us, and some of the geneva.</p>
               <p>What became of the liquors? - We got horses after some time, and carried them off.</p>
               <p>Did you carry the whole? - We carried off eight casks out of the eleven, I do not know what became of the other three, I did not see them carried away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. Mr. Toy, you had each of you a tuck I believe? - Not all of us.</p>
               <p>How many of you had tucks? - I had one, and Woodhouse had one.</p>
               <p>What arms had you before you got the supervisor's tuck? - I had it to search with.</p>
               <p>So all this contest was about the tea? - The contest was first about the liquor.</p>
               <p>How long was it after you made the seizure of the geneva before Woodhouse and Valentine came to you? - I cannot tell, it was some time.</p>
               <p>Then you and Valentine went into the field, and there you made a seizure of some more geneva? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You left your seizure in the care of Woodhouse, while you went into the field? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now you have said the prisoner made a blow at you, what sort of a stick was it with? - A common Devonshire walking stick.</p>
               <p>This was a very uncommon one? - It was a very dangerous weapon, I would not be struck with it for five hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>No, nor I with a common walking stick, you have told us that Rundell had a stick and bludgeon? - Yes.</p>
               <p>A bludgeon is infinitely shorter and much thicker? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now did you ever, in the course of your life, see a bludgeon three feet long? - I do not know, I look upon the stick that the prisoner had, to be a more dangerous weapon than a bludgeon.</p>
               <p>May be so, so was your tuck stick you know; how much milk punch did you drink after this business was over? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Why who drank the milk punch, the three officers, and the three smugglers? - I did not sit down to drink, I drank none in the house.</p>
               <p>Did you drink it in the yard? come, come, it does not make much difference, however you did drink a good quantity? - I do not know what quantity, they offered me several times, and at last I did drink some.</p>
               <p>You do not know what became of the other three casks? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How soon after the information was the prisoner taken up? - I really do not know.</p>
               <p>I will help you, was he taken up till January? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you apply to any Magistrate for a warrant against this man? - We acquainted the board with it, and waited the board's directions.</p>
               <p>In what month was the indictment preferred? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Was not it in the September sessions? was you present at the time he was apprehended? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you dine together? - No.</p>
               <p>Woodhouse did? - I cannot tell that.</p>
               <p>Yes you can, where was he taken? - At Kingsbridge.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that he and Woodhouse had been dining together that day? - I do not know, I have heard it from Woodhouse, that the prisoner and he had been dining together the day before.</p>
               <p>You cannot tell me how long it was after<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230085"></xptr> the seizure, that Woodhouse came to you? I cannot say, it might be half an hour or rather more.</p>
               <p>I think you say, you run your tuck against his breast? - I put the tuck against his breast, but then I only told him that in case he struck me again, I should make use of it.</p>

               <p>Do you know the Christian name of that man that was called Rundell? - I did not know his Christian name, nor I did not know Inch's Christian name.</p>
               <p>But was that the prisoner at the bar? - I should know him again if I was to see him; I have no doubt but it is the same person, I am sure it is the same person; I returned back to Ringmore town, and received a message from Mr. Valentine, as I think by a little girl, to request us to come to him at the parsonage house, where one Creswell lived; I saw May and Rundell again in a mead ow, where they were making hay; Valentine and me went in consequence of this message, and when we got there Toy was taking some casks out of a barn into the yard, and after I came, I saw three or four taken out, they were all put together in the yard, a small distance from the door that goes into the hay loft, or barn; there were ten, I supposed them to be gin, I did not taste them, they had slings about them, they had the appearance of smuggled casks; I am sure most of them had slings about them, and I believe they all had.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the purpose of the slings? - It is to tie them together, to hang them on a horse.</p>
               <p>Is that the usual method of carrying geneva and spirits? - Yes, Sir, it is very customary so to do; they travel sometimes twenty, thirty, or forty horses together.</p>
               <p>Do fair dealers carry them so? - They call themselves fair dealers, we call them smugglers</p>
               <p>No, but how do the fair dealers generally convey their liquors? - They generally convey them on horses, there are very few waggons in the county.</p>
               <p>What did you do after this? - It was agreed that I should stay by these casks that were saved, and that Mr. Valentine and Toy should go into a field adjoining and search for more, they went and I staid in the yard about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes; Valentine found a cask before the prisoner came, and a little time after came three men, which were the prisoner, May, and Rundell, into the yard to me, they had sticks with them.</p>
               <p>Describe the stick the prisoner had. - The prisoner had one with a very large head, larger than the sticks that the others had.</p>
               <p>How long might it be? - It might be as long as this (a common walking stick.)</p>
               <p>Describe the thickness of it? - The thickness, it might be thicker than this, there might be three or four prongs, it was the natural growth of the stick, and so cut off, I do not think those prongs were put in, he had no more than one stick, Rundell had two, a short one, a kind of bludgeon,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230086"></xptr> and a long one besides, one of them was the some sort of stick as the prisoner's, Rundell's walking stick was with a round head, the other was much shorter, and I apprehend it had no head, I believe not; May had only one stick, it was a kind of a walking stick with a great head to it, the other had a kind of a round head, it was different to this gentleman's stick, it was a common walking stick with a round head.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you look upon that as an improper stick for yourself or any other person to walk with? - Any person might use it as a walking stick, such as a country farmer might walk with.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Attorney General. What do you say to this?</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. I do apprehend, that this act of parliament certainly does require not only the act to be done, but that the persons doing it should be assembled to the number of three, and that they should be armed with offensive weapons: the question is whether the offensive weapons must be of such a nature as cannot be applicable to any other use but that of offence? now if that is not the construction, there is no weapon but what may be used as an offensive weapon; or whether the legislature meant by this that the weapon which they carried out must be upon the face of it, an offensive weapon: but I should apprehend it might be left to the Jury, whether these men did carry these sticks offensively: to be sure if they had not attempted to have made use of them offensively, it might be too much to say, they were armed with offensive weapons; and though in a case of life, I wish a mild interpretation, yet a stick thicker than this, is a weapon that in my opinion may be made use of to great offence: I contend the construction of this act of parliament is, that they must be so armed, with fire arms or any other offensive weapons, which being used offensively would endanger the life of the man.</p>

               <p>Court. Hand up the act of the 19th of

               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, it cannot be necessary for me to trouble the Court at all on this point; because I am perfectly convinced, that on reading the act of parliament, the Court will hardly hold what never entered into the brain of any mortal man, which is, that a common walking stick, far inferior to that which the countrymen of Devon walk with, far inferior to the sticks which the macaronies of this town used constantly to walk and to ride with, should be deemed an offensive weapon.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. When we look at the preamble of this act of parliament, it makes it perfectly clear, and recites, that whereas divers resolute persons have appeared in great gangs, in different parts of this kingdom, carrying fire arms, or other offensive weapons; then it says, in the conclusion, to the great terror of his Majesty's peaceable subjects, in defiance of the law; now I do not conceive myself, it can come within the common idea, that persons with common walking sticks can infuse all that terror into his Majesty's peaceable subjects, it should be such as the law calls dangerous weapons, for you have that epithet annexed; besides all the people must be active, and armed according to the true intent and meaning of this statute; therefore I think the indictment is not supported as to the two first counts, and with respect to the third count the law is not in force, for the act on which that count is founded, is verbally repealed, and it is made a misdemeanor; therefore myself and my brothers think the prisoner ought to be acquitted.</p>

            , I hope it will make an impression on you, that you have been tried with the utmost care and impartiality, though you have been removed from the county where the offence was committed, and brought to trial in a different county, yet you have been treated with the utmost lenity: I am in great hopes this will make an impression on you, and that you will yourself, and impart it to those unfortunate persons, May and Rundel, that assisted you, to leave off those pernicious<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230087"></xptr> practices: you was very near being met with upon this indictment; and as it is not possible for any man to act with more honor than Mr. Woodhouse has done, and though it is said, that you have thrown out threats and menaces of doing him an injury, I hope you are now sensible how extremely well that gentleman has behaved here.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never did threaten him, nor never will.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. He would be a very ungrateful wretch if he did. Are you, Mr. Woodhouse, under any serious apprehensions?</p>
               <p>Woodhouse. I hope he will not behave improperly, the prosecution was directed against him by the commissioners of excise, it is not an act of my doing; I have no objection to his being discharged.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Will you promise never to molest him? - Yes, Sir, I never will.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. If ever you do, you shall certainly be prosecuted with the utmost rigour for any thing of this sort.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Walker. Or May, or Rundell, or the rest of them.</p>
               <p>Court. I will take the opportunity of saying to this prisoner, that leaving this and all acts of parliament out of the case, when the crown is entitled to a revenue, and a particular mode of collecting it is established, though there was no act of parliament that provided a particular penalty for the obstruction of it, yet (and I am in the hearing of two very learned Judges, who will instruct me, or set me right, if I am mistaken) there cannot be a possible doubt, but any obstruction of officers doing their duty is punishable, and a very great misdemeanor: therefore remember, Inch, to what you have been exposed now for what you have done, and what you still remain exposed to, and let it be an additional reason for the regulation of your future conduct. - Let him be discharged.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lords and Gentlemen of the Jury, I humbly thank you.</p>
               <p>Tried by the first Middlesex Jury before Mr. Justice GOULD.</p>

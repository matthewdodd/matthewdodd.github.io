               <p>MR. WALFORD conducted the prosecution.</p>
               <p>MR. AARON CROSSLEY SEYMOUR. I live at Dublin, and am not in any business. In September last, I was in England, and lodged in Upper Bryanston-street; I am married. Mrs. Seymour was in England with me; on the evening of the 6th of September, we had drank tea with a friend in Lower Bryanston-street, which lies between Portman-square and Oxford-road, and is, I should think, not fifty yards from Oxford-road; I set out from there to go to see a friend next door to the Middlesex Hospital; I meant to take a coach. I met the prisoner at the corner of Bryanston-street, in Portman-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet, or did he overtake you - A. We came to the corner together - he asked what o'clock it was - it was quite dark, and was between eight and nine o'clock; I told him the time as near as I could, without taking out my watch; he remarked that it was a fine night, and walked by me; no further conversation passed; he continued to walk by my side, and when I got into Oxford-street, I stood on the pavement searching for my eye glass, to see if there was a coachman on a coach-box, and while searching for my glass he asked if I wanted a coach - I said I did - he then said he believed I was a stranger in London, and he would get one for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you a stranger in town - A. Yes; I had only been here two days - I was here some years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. A good many years ago - A. Yes; he asked what direction I was going in - I said towards Middlesex Hospital; he said he was going in the same direction, and begged I would allow him to take part of the coach, and he would pay his share; I said I would pay for the coach, and if any accommodation to him, he was at liberty to go as far as convenient - I thought it would be ungenerous to refuse just at that moment. He pointed out a coach on the stand, which happened to be the first - we walked towards it, and before we said any thing, the door was opened; I cannot tell who by, but it was not the waterman usually on the stand; I stepped in first - the prisoner delayed in coming in, and said something to the man who opened the door, which I did not hear, and immediately stepped into the coach, which was shut up in a moment - the door was shut so very quick, I had not a moment to direct where to drive, and the man did not apply, as they usually do, for money. The prisoner placed himself between me and the door, and immediately gave the direction towards Marylebone Church; not knowing immediately where Marylebone Church was, I said,</p>
               <p>"Is that in my direction?" - he said it was; the coach drove up Portman-street, which I had come down, into Portman-square; if it had turned to the right in the square, it would take me to Middlesex hospital - I knew that from the map - but I saw it go up to the west side of the square, and immediately objected, and said it was taking me out of my way; he said it was not - at this time the coach was going on rapidly; he said he only wanted to go to the street a little above the square, and then the coach would go on with me; I said I was in a hurry to go to Berner's-street, and he must either leave the coach, or I would, and get another; he said there was no necessity for my leaving the coach, as he meant to drive to Marylebone New Church, and then to the watch-house; I asked what business he could have at the watch-house; he said he meant to commit me for malepractices; I immediately put my head out of the window and called to the coachman to stop - and then saw a man on the box with the coachman; the prisoner begged I would not make a noise, as we could get out quietly at Marylebone Church; I was alarmed at what he had said, and having seen two men on the coach box, I said I would not stay another moment - I again called the coachman; he did not hear me, I suppose; the prisoner put his head out on the other side, and said something, what I could not hear - he spoke to one of the men on the box - the coach was at this time just passing the garden of Montague House, I opened the door and jumped out, being much alarmed, and ran down the west side of the square, and saw no more of him that night; I turned to the south side of the square, and along Edward-street, to Middlesex hospital. And on the 12th or 13th, (I don't know the day of the week), I saw him again about four o'clock, in the afternoon, at my own door in Upper Bryanston-street, just as I was knocking; he said he had now found out where I lived - expressed himself dissatisfied at my having treated him so shabbily about the coach; I told him my leaving the coach was unavoidable, as I expected either to be robbed or murdered - that he had imposed on me as I was a stranger; the door was at that moment opened by my servant - I said I would be in, in a few minutes; I was unwilling to bring him into the house, and we walked up to the top of Bryanston-street. He told me he was a hard-working man, and that I was a gentleman - and said,</p>
               <p>"Now, you shall pay me well, or I will expose you to the world;" I asked him how - he said he knew himself, and that he was an ironmonger living in Adam-street, (there is Adam-street close by Edgware-road) - that his name was

            , and he was well known in the neighbourhood; I remonstrated with him on the impropriety of his accusation and demand.</p>
               <p>Q. What demand had he made - A. He had said he would be paid well or he would expose me - he said he must have 50 l., or he would expose me to the world. I reasoned with him - and told him he could neither have principle, honour, nor humanity, to extort money from me, and he must be conscious that he was extorting it; he said he did not want to talk about things of that sort, he must have the money - he became very loud in his demands, and threatened to expose me to the first person he met in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever say what he would expose you about - A. Nothing more than malepractices; he was loud in his demands - I became very much alarmed and thrown off<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182210230027"></xptr>my guard - I said I had not such a sum of money, and could not afford to give it him; he said he would take 20 l.; I said I could not give him that neither; he said he must have it; I replied I could not give it - he then asked what I could give him; I said I had 10 l. in my pocket; he swore with an oath, he would not take that; I do not recollect what the oath was; he said immediately after that he would take that, if I would give him something more, but he would not take 10 l. alone as he had sworn it; I said I could get him a couple of sovereigns perhaps, and begged him to wait in the street. I returned home, went up stairs, dinner was on the table - I told Mrs. 
               <persName id="t18221023-36-person431">Seymour</persName>
             I should be back in a minute; I got two sovereigns out of my desk, went down and gave them to him - (I had given him the 10 l. note.) He went away, swearing in a very solemn manner, that I should never hear of him, or see him any more.</p>
               <p>Q. About how long were you in the coach with him on the 6th of September - A. I think not five minutes, we did not go more than four hundred yards; I certainly did not take any indecent liberties with him - nor was I guilty of any malepractices towards him. I parted with my money from very great alarm and apprehension of his exposing both my person to danger, and my character to injury.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by ADOLPHUS. Q. You were in town only two or three days before this happened - A. I came to town on Wednesday, and this happened on Friday - it is nearly four years since I was in town before.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not been in London at all during that interval of four years - A. For two days I had - that was about a month before this transaction - I then came from Cheltenham. I only came to see my brother who was in a bad state of health; I lived in Dublin.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you lived much in England, during the four years, though not in London - A. I have, at Brighton, Bath, Cheltenham, and Tunbridge - I lived at those places for the first two years of the four - but for the last two years I have been out of England, except the times I have mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you living in London four years ago - A. I was about eight months in the neighbourhood of Bedford-square - I lived in China Mews, Tottenham Court-road. I was never in any business; I knew very well how to call a coach for myself - but was not at all acquainted with the streets in the neighbourhood of Marylebone; I was once in Regent's-park, four years ago. The person I wanted to call on by the Middlesex Hospital, was Mrs. Ward, No. 39, Berner's-street. I had no acquaintance with the prisoner till he spoke to me. Oxford-road was not my nearest way - but I went there for the purpose of getting a coach. I did not take the number - and did not see a creature passing to call to for assistance; there might be people passing, but I did not see them. I mentioned this circumstance to nobody between the 6th and 12th. Montague House is at the North West corner of Portman-square - I had never been by there before, but have walked there since.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 12th or 13th, did he say any thing more than that he would expose you - A. For malepractices, he said nothing more. There was not a man-servant in the house. I did not attempt to secure him, or desire help.</p>
               <p>MR. WALFORD. Q. Was the coach stand the nearest to Lower Bryanston-street - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever go to Adam-street to look for an ironmonger named Townsend - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your reason for not calling for assistance on the 13th in the street, it being day-light - A. I felt very much alarmed, and saw a man pass by in Bryanston-street, while I was talking to the prisoner, and the prisoner nodded very familiarly to him, and laughed - and he passed twice again while we were talking. When we were in Bryanston-street, he said his mother had left him an estate in Ireland, which he expected to get when he was of age - that it amounted to 3,000 l., and he wished to go over to get payment of it, and had not the means, and threw himself on me to enable him so to do - and after that he threatened if I did not give him the money he would expose me. I have been married nearly five years.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after the 12th or 13th, did you communicate to any one about what passed - A. I cannot exactly say - my wife spoke to me about it about the 2d of October.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How was the prisoner dressed, when you took him into the coach - A. Entirely in black, but being night I could not distinguish whether it was good black - he appeared to me well dressed. I am sure it was on Friday, and not on Sunday night.</p>

            . I keep the house, No. 28, Upper Bryanston-street. On the 5th of September last, Mr. and Mrs. Seymour came to lodge with me. The prisoner came to the house several times - the first time was the 2d of October, about eight o'clock in the morning; I let him in; nobody was with him; he requested to see Mr. Seymour; I said he was not at home - he said he had better not deny himself, for he had been twice denied before, and if Mr. Seymour would not see him, he would fetch an officer; he went away for about five minutes, and brought a young fellow with him, and said that was an officer, and that he was one himself; the young man said nothing; I requested them to come in and speak to Mrs. Seymour - (Mr. Seymour was out); he was very turbulent, and I requested Mrs. Seymour to come down to see him. He said he wanted 28 l. from Mr. Seymour, that he had received 12 l. at one time, and 10 l. at another. Mrs. Seymour came down - I was present, and shewed her into the front parlour; I stood in the passage; the prisoner took out a short stick, and said he was an officer - (the other man did not come in at all.) I could hear what passed, as the door was open; he said his business was secret; he could not tell Mrs. Seymour what it was on any account, and said he would be there at 12 o'clock next day; this was on Thursday, the 2d of October; I believe it was 11 o'clock before he left. Mrs. Seymour saw him twice after that in my presence. He was taken up in the passage of my house, on the Tuesday after; he had called several times in the course of that time. He told me on the Monday before he was taken, that he was a watchmaker, named Townsend, living in Adam-street, that he was a very respectable young man, and very well known; he came several times. On the Saturday I saw him, and spoke to him - he said he understood Mr. Seymour was a man of fortune, and bore a very good character, and married a rich heiress, and he was surprised he could not pay him the money he had promised him; he said he would inform Mrs. Seymour if he did not pay him - and desired to speak to her; I called her down - she came to the door, and desired to know what he wanted; he said he could not inform her, it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182210230028"></xptr>would make her miserable for life, and blast Mr. Seymour's character - he said nothing more, but went away. On the Monday after, I met him in Oxford-street, between eight and nine o'clock at night - he spoke to me; I said I could not stop to speak to him in the street; he said he wished me to inform Mr. Seymour he should call on him in the morning; I desired him not to call to annoy Mrs. 
               <persName id="t18221023-36-person433">Seymour</persName>
             any more, for it was very unpleasant to me and her; he said he was in great want of his money; he was going to Ireland; that his grandmother was dead, and he could not go without the money - that Mr. Seymour was guilty of crimes not worthy of a man; I asked how he became acquainted him - if it occurred in Ireland or since he came to England; he said in England; I asked how he knew it; he said he called a coach in Oxford-street; I asked if Mr. Seymour had insulted the coachman; he said No; he called a coach, and took a person in it with him.</p>
               <p>Q. He said a person, not himself - A. No, a person; nothing more passed till next morning at eight o'clock, when he knocked at the door; I saw him in a minute, and showed him into the front parlour, requesting he would not see Mrs. 
               <persName id="t18221023-36-person434">Seymour</persName>
             any more, as it would be very serious and he would be taken up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. They came to you on the 5th - A. Yes; from the Park-hotel, where they had been only one night; they came from Cheltenham; they went to drink tea every evening at a relation's in Lower Bryanston-street; I think the lady's name is Rogers.</p>
               <p>Q. He said his business was money, and it was a secret affair - A. Yes; he did not object to my being present. Mrs. Seymour requested me to go in.</p>
               <p>Q. You told him he would be taken up if he came, and yet he did come - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. On Wednesday, the 2d of October, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, (I think), Mrs. Kendall called me down. I saw the prisoner; he said my husband owed him 50 l., I said it must be a mistake, he said it was not; I asked what it was for, he said it was a great secret; I said I knew nothing about it, but if it was the case, if he would call next day at twelve o'clock, if the money was owing, Mr. Seymour would settle it; he went away. I requested information might be given at the police-office; and about four o'clock that day, the officers came, but the prisoner did not come. I did not see him again till about seven o'clock on Saturday evening; I was in the parlour, and went out to him and asked his business, he said he wanted 28 l. of Mr. Seymour, and if he did not get it he would injure Mr. Seymour's character for ever; I replied, that his character did not depend on him; and he said he would ruin my happiness for ever by the disclosure, and that he would write me a letter by the next morning, stating the whole particulars; I received no letter. I did not see him again till the Tuesday morning following, which was the 8th of October; when he came, I went into the parlour and called Mrs. Kendall in and my own servant; the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"Now Ma'am I will tell you all. Mr. Seymour is guilty of crimes unworthy of man; I have two coachmen to prove it; they say they will prosecute me, as I know where he lives, if I don't prosecute him, and I have given them 20 l. each, and I am a ruined man if I don't get 28 l." I offered him 10 l. if he would sign a paper never to molest Mr. Seymour more, (Mr. Seymour came into the parlour while I was making the offer, I think,) he said he would not sign the paper as he should get himself into a scrape, and said he would not take the money except he had a witness of his own; Mr. Seymour offered him 10 l.; he said, at last, he would take the money of Mrs. Kendall at the hall-door. We had two officers ready looking out for him. Mrs. Kendall had the money ready to give him at the hall-door, when Clement's, the officer, came and took him.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. I apprehended the prisoner in the passage of No. 28, Bryanston-street, on Tuesday, the 8th of October. I had attended on Wednesday, the 2d of October, Thursday, the 3d, and Monday the 7th, for the purpose of taking him, by the prosecutor's desire. As I took him to the office, he began to speak to me of his own accord; he said,</p>
               <p>"Oh, he is a bad one." I asked in what respect; he then said,</p>
               <p>"About five weeks ago, I was walking in Seymour-street, about half drunk; and the prosecutor came up to me, took hold of my arm, and asked if I would go and have something to drink; I refused, saying I had been drinking before" - that they walked together until they came to a coach-stand in Oxford-street, when the prosecutor called a coach, and they got in and drove up Portman-street, across Portman-square, and when they got into Gloster-street, the gentleman put one hand across his neck, and the other into his breeches - that he directly called to the coachman to stop, with intent to take the man who was on the box with the coachman, inside, and then drive to Marylebone watch-house; but before the coachman could stop, he jumped out and ran away; that he never saw him after for a fortnight, and then he was drinking at Buckland's public-house, Bryanston-street, and saw the prosecutor go up to the next door; that he ran up to him, and collared him, and said,</p>
               <p>"Now I have found you, I'll go and fetch my father, and you shall be exposed for what you did to me in the coach the other night, and left me to pay for the coach" - that the prosecutor begged of him to be quiet, and he would give him anything to be quiet, and say no more about it; that he then went in, and brought out a 10 l. note and two sovereigns, and gave him - that he at first refused to take it, and threw it down on the stones, but afterwards took it and went away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he repeat the same before the Justice - A. Part of it. I believe it was not written down. One Kelly was sent for, who made a demand on the prisoner. I believe it was not taken down. I was present all the time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You searched the prisoner's apartments - A. Yes. He told me he lived in Cutler-street, Oxford-road - I went and searched his lodgings there, and found a pocket book in a chest of drawers, containing a quantity of pawnbroker's duplicates. Some things which I found were afterwards delivered up to him.</p>
               <p>MR. WALFORD. Q. How much did Kelly demand of the prisoner - A. I cannot say whether it was 3 l. 10 s. or 4 l. The prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"I do not owe you a halfpenny," and repeated it several times - Kelly persisted in it, and it drew tears from the prisoner, and at last the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"You want to extort money from me, the same as I have from this gentleman," pointing to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182210230029"></xptr>Cross-examined. Q. He directed you to his lodgings; how long he lived there you do not say - A. Only from what I heard. I am sure he did not say, you want to extort money, the same as I am charged. I rather think he told me he had lived in Adam-street, but am not certain. He did not say what he was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have to say that when I accosted Mr. Seymour in the street, he pushed his hands away from him, and said,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake don't expose me. I will give you any sum you want." He walked across into Paddington-fields, where it is private. I told him I did not want money, for if my father knew it he would sacrifice me and him too. He insisted on my having money, and said that money was more object to me than my character - I took it up, and went away with it. Besides that, he says it was on Friday night when he first met me - it was half-past ten o'clock on Sunday evening. He accosted me, and asked me what it was o'clock - (I had a watch which Clements has.) He walked with me to the corner of Adam-street. I did not know he was going to state it was Friday, or I could have brought a man who saw him speak to me on Sunday night, at half-past ten o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my mother, Caroline Osborn in Clement's Inn-passage; she keeps a tobacconist's shop. About four o'clock on the 9th of October I was in the back parlour—we heard a noise—in the shop—I went in and saw the prisoner with his hand over the counter he was leaning entirely over—the till was there—he asked if I could tell him of a person named Williams—I said, "You have robbed our till"—he ran out—I looked into the till, and the shilling and sixpence which had been in it was gone—my sister followed him—he was brought back—ray mother was willing to let him go, but the policeman would not let him go—I am sure he is the person.</p>

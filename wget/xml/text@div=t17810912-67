               <p>On Wednesday, the 13th of June, I had been to Deptford, to receive some money. In coming home again; I crossed the water. I came up Gravel-lane, to Ratcliff-highway. There I took a coach. Going up Cannon-street road, I thought it was a dangerous place. I put my money under the coach seat.

Stewart got in at the coach-door, on the off side: the other, I think, was Vandersall; but I cannot be positive to him, though I am to Stewart. Stewart said, D - n your eyes, your watch and money, or I'll blow your brains out! I said, I had neither watch nor money; I had been upon a party of pleasure, and had spent all. He said, D - n your eyes, that shan't serve your turn; I will search. I had in my left-hand pocket a cork-screw, and some halfpence: the cork-screw was taken, whether any of the halfpence were or not; I do not know the number of them. Stewart then lifted up the cushion of the fore seat, and searched under it. He said to me, D - n you, sit back, or I'll blow your brains out. I said, You have searched me; I have neither watch nor money; what money I had I spent upon a party of pleasure. They said they would search me, and bid me get up. I then took the money up in my left-hand. Stewart said, D - n you, you have bid it in your hand. Then I dropped it into my pocket, and with my left hand got hold of Stewart's right hand, in which he held his pistol. I struck him over the head, and threw myself down out of the coach upon him. I said,

Then the other came to the coach, and cried out, D - n you, now blow his brains out. He shot at me, but missed me. The third man then left the horse's head, and came and cut me with a hanger. These are the clothes (producing a coat with eight or ten cuts in the shoulders); I had wounds in my shoulders corresponding with these cuts. Stewart desired me to loose him; but I kept my hold. Upon this, I called to the coachman to come down, and said, I would take them. Upon that, they ran away. Stewart, I believe it was, left his hat behind him.</p>

It was at a house kept by Wall, this man's father. Afterwards I met him, and asked him what sort of pleasure he had at the fair. He said, very good.

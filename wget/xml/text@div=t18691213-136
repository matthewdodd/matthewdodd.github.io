I am assistant to Mr. Wood, a surgeon, 54, Union Street, Borough—on Friday morning, 3rd December, between 9 and 10 o'clock, the prisoner came in and asked for a plaster for his side—I gave him a plaster, and he gave me a shilling—I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—put the shilling in the till, and about half-an-hour after I placed all the money in the cash-box—the prisoner came again in the morning for some liniment—I gave him twopennyworth, and he gave me a shilling—I gave him the change, and put the shilling in the till—I asked him whether the plaster did him good, and he said he was much better—had to pay 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. away, and one of the shillings was returned as bad—I then examined the money in the till, and found another bad shilling there—about 3 o'clock in the afternoon the prisoner came again for some more liniment, and gave me a bad half-crown—I then charged him with giving me the bad shilling—he made no answer—I asked him if he had any more bud money—he took out two good half-crowns, showed them to me, and put them back again—I gave him in charge—on the way to the station the errand-boy handed me another bad shilling, which he had picked up—I gave the coins to the police—if the plaster had been applied it would have left a mark.</p>

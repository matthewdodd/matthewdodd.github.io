King and Co.—this receipt for the sum of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. paid by Kellinglay and Co. to Mr. King, is the prisoner's hand-writing—we had customers of that name—it is dated 26th December, 1860, and signed James Tite—Messrs. King are printers and engravers, in a considerable way of business—the prisoner came into the employment in October—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the agreement that was made at the time he entered—as soon as it was made he started off on his journey to collect orders—there was no mention in the agreement one way or the other as to his receiving money—the first intimation I had of his receiving money, was from Mr. South—it would be his duty if anyone handed cash over to him, to remit it to us—it is the duty of travellers to do so—it is the ordinary part of a commercial traveller's duty—we did not complain of his receiving money after he had gone on his journey—I received a notice from Mr. South, that money had been paid to the prisoner—I communicated that to him by means of this letter—(<hi rend="italic">This was a letter dated November 16th 1860, requesting the prisoner to account for the money received from Mr. South</hi>)—he did not answer that letter—he answered a subsequent letter which we have looked for everywhere but cannot find it—I remember the contents of it—he commenced by saying that it was a fact he had received the money, but trade was so bad he could not possibly get on just yet, but it would be all right if I kept it close for a day or two, and he would remit the money—I afterwards received this letter from him, marked "private"—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated Leicester, November 23d, 1860, complaining of the badness of trade, and begging the witness to let the little matter stand over until he came to town, it contained an invitation to the witness to join him in Devonshire, and requesting him to far<lb></lb>ward him a cheque for</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.)—I wrote him another letter, telling him that it was urgent, and that he must settle the matter, this is the letter—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated November 24th, 1860, it informed the prisoner that the matter might be kept open for a week, but that he must settle it by that time</hi>)—I refused the invitation in this letter—I said it was not my custom to accept the invitations of travellers—I wrote to him on 19th December, "Unless I hear from you by return of post I must acquaint Mr. King with the whole transaction"—on 21st I received this letter from the prisoner (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>) "Derby, December 21st, 1860—Dear sir—after my wife's serious illness, I have come on here, to spend the Christmas with some friends—from here I shall leave for London. Will you kindly in the mean time, send me your private address, and say if a Devonshire goose will be acceptable—write to me at the post-office Derby"—I received another letter the same day, stating that the goose would arrive; and I wrote an answer refusing it—I received another letter on 27th December, asking me to meet him at the Cathedral coffee-house, at three o'clock—I went there and saw him—he had not got the money with him—he said it would be all right, that I might rely upon him without fail, that it would not be more than two or three days at the most, but he would not compromise me in any way, and the money should certainly be handed over—on the 30th December, I received this letter from him, stating, "My friend will arrive to-morrow, faithfully—I will then come in and hand the money over to you"—on the 31th, I received this letter from him, stating that he was going to meet his father-in-law,</p>

               <p>that afternoon, at the Paddington station, and that he would remit the money or bring it on—when we found that other money had been received we issued this circular to our customers—this circular was sent out that evening, (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"January 3d, 1861—We regret to have to inform you that James Tite, who was allowed by us to take orders on commission, has been dishonestly collecting money for us; this is to caution our friends against paying him money; we do not know where he is to be found"—I did not see the prisoner again until he was in custody—a telegraphic message was received from Maidstone, on the morning of 4th January, that he was in custody there—I went to the railway station and met him coming from the station in custody—he was taken to the police-station—as we were going along in the cab he handed me this account of the sums received by him; it contains the three sums in the indictment; neither of those sums have been paid over or any portion of them—they would be paid to me, as cashier—he has not done anything towards accounting for those sums, except giving me these papers,—he handed over this cheque for 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he had received at Maidstone a day or two previous—when he handed me over this balance sheet, he said, "I am going to Queen-street; I will make it all right, I have not done anything wrong, here are some cheques for you—here is one I have received from Maidstone"—that is on a different account, not at all connected with these three sums—while Mr. King was deciding whether he should give him in custody or not, the prisoner said he could see it was all up with him directly he saw the circular.</p>

                  </hi>. I am eleven years old, and live with my father and mother, in New-court, George-yard, Whitechapel. I never saw the prisoner before last Sunday fortnight, the 14th of Feb., when I was playing with ano<lb></lb>ther boy at the end of George-yard—I was running after the other boy—the prisoner was standing by and hit me—he did not hurt me—I stopped and said, "You had better be quiet, Sir"—I cannot tell what answer he made, but another boy came up to the prisoner, and hit him for having hit m—then the prisoner hit me again in my body—I then made a kicd at him, but did not kick him—I tried to kick him—the prisoner then took a white<lb></lb>handled pen-knife out of his waistcoat pocket, opened it, and stabbed me with it—he held the blade down and the handle upwards, and struck down<lb></lb>wards—it struck my arm near the shoulder—I called out that I was stabbed,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cork-cutter, and live in Montague-street, White<lb></lb>chapel. I was going down Wentworth-street on this Sunday, and saw the prisoner and two other boys—I saw Harrington standing before the prisoner, opposite George-yard—the prisoner's back was towards me—I was about twenty yards from him—they seemed to be talking together—another boy ran up Georage-yard, ran to the prisoner and pitched into him right and left—he struck him—he was a big boy—he made another attempt at the prisoner—the prisoner retreated back, and he did not hit him then—the same boy retreated back, and Harrington rushed at the prisoner and tried to strike him, and to kick him at the same time, but I do not think he did—the prisoner then struck Harrington with his right hand, and hit his arm down—his back was still towards me—I could not see anything in the prisoner's hand—I called out, "Oh you cow<lb></lb>ardly rouge, two of you on him at once" (meaning on the prisoner)—in about half a minute Harrington said, "Oh I am stabbed in the arm"—he ran to me on the pavement—I took off his jacked and saw the blood flowing—the prisoner ran up to him, took up the smock-frock and put it to stop the blood, and expressed very great contrition indeed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When he retreated, did you see him as if taking any<lb></lb>thing out of his pocket? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—there were three boys altogether—one did nothing, but two of them were on the prisoner—I had never seen any of them before—a boy rushed out of George-yard, and went right to the prisoner, and then the prisoner started back—he did not make a blow at him—he put him<lb></lb>self in a <hi rend="italic">sparring</hi> position, but did not strike at him.</p>

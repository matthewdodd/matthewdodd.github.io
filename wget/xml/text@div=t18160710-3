             M'Manus was scouring something with salt; it was a mettal white when I first saw it, round, and in the shape of a shilling; she was rubbing it with salt; there was a great many of them all in a body, about forty in a cloth, and she was rubbing them all together; William Mulvey was doing nothing, only he went out for some cream of tarter; he staid about a quarter of an hour. 
               <persName id="t18160710-3-person77">Margaret</persName>
             M'Manns said, there was no cream of tarter in the house, and asked him if he would go and fetch any; he said, he would, and she gave him some halfpence; he went, and on his return, gave it to her, saying there was an ounce, and telling her to be careful of it. He then sat himself down, or laid himself against the bedstead, and did not do any thing else. Catherine was there; but she was doing nothing but aiding and assisting in getting warm water, and they were washed in it by Margaret, after they had been rubbed in salt and dried in a cloth; then they were put into a cloth, and rubbed with cream of tartar again; Margaret did that. Nothing else was done to them by either of the other prisoners. She then washed them again in warm water, and then dried them in a cloth again; from that she put them on a hot iron, and put some blacking on them while they lay, one by one on the iron. Then she rubbed them between her thumb and finger, and put them away. Then I had the first six that were finished, and gave her the two eighteenpenny-tokens; Margaret gave them to me. Catherine took the money for them. I then left them; I went to the officers in Tottenham-court-road, Mr. Burton and Mr. Craig: I went to the public-house where they were; I knew they were there, because I left them there. I gave the shillings to Burton. I went into Mulvey's lodgings with the officers; we knocked at the window, and the door was opened by

            . I am an officer of Marlborough street. I know the last witness. In consequence of information she gave me; I gave her directions to act under my authority. I furnished her in the morning of the 11th of May, with two eighteenpenny-pieces; before that, I searched her, and ascertained that she had no other money, neither good, nor bad. Craig was in company with me. Craig, she, and I, went towards Shropshire-place, Pancrass-street; I stopped at a public-house at the corner of the street; the woman went away; I sent her. I stood there better than half or three quarters of an hour before she returned; we then went to Mulvey's house; I then told Mrs. Mulvey I must see what she had about her; and she said, do you think I have got any bad money about me, with that, she took out of her pocket three eighteenpenny-pieces, a shilling, and three halfpence, and jinked them on the hearth stone, and said, you hear they are good. I then told her to give them to me. She did, and I found two of the eighteenpenny-pieces were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181607100006"></xptr>the two which I had given to the last witness to purchase these with. I then searched her pockets; but she had nothing else. I then searched the room; I found two papers of cream of tartar, and a quantity of blanks of the size of a shilling, in an unfinished state; four were the size of a shilling, and four the size of a sixpence; they were pinned up in one of the bottom corners of the window curtain I then searched the table-drawer, and found two files with brass in the teeth of them; I found a pair of scissors, but there is nothing on them. I also found a quantity of clippings of copper in a little bag; I found a bottle on the shelf, with nothing in it, and I found an old tea-pot, with a quantity of salt in it; and in the room, I found a quantity of rags, some wet and some dry; they are stained with something; I found a little tin pot in the cupboard, which had a strange smell; I found a small stamp with the letter A upon it. I found nothing else. Craig and I conveyed the woman to the watchhouse. I locked the door, and took the key in my pocket. Before I left the room, I saw a boy of the name of Rowley; he and his father went to the watchhouse. I locked the room door, and fastened the window. We returned in the course of a quarter of an hour, we found the room as I had left it. While we were there, I saw Rowley and his father; Rowley's father gave me twenty-nine counterfeits, and the boy gave me one. I afterwards saw 
               <persName id="t18160710-3-person83">Margaret</persName>
             M'Manus on the next evening, about ten o'clock; I saw her at the corner of East-street, Paddington-street, at the watering-house. I have applied this punch to several of the finished shilling, to some of those which I received from the last witness, the mark on them appears to be such as is made with this punch. I have applied the punch also to those given me by Rowley's father, and the mark is the same, and I believe it to be made by that punch.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Margaret. Was I in the house when you first came, I came in for my bonnet?</p>

               <p>Witness. I did not see her at first; but when I turned round, I saw her.</p>

               <p>Examined by the COURT. I had marked the eighteenpenny-pieces with a small cross on their edges.</p>

               <p>WILLAM CRAIG. I went with Burton to apprehend the prisoners; I went in company with the two last witnesses to the house in Shropsh re-place. The woman knocked at the window, and the man rushed out. I was behind, and could not see if a blow was given to Burton; Burton told me to secure him; I went after him, and as I was going down the court, I saw the window opened, and a quantity of things like shillings thrown out; I was busily ingaged with the man, whom I took, and was bringing back. I searched him, and found five three-shilling pieces, two shillings, and some halfpence. I took the man to Pancrass watchhouse. I then returned to the prisoners's lodging alone. I found these blanks in the table drawer, some not round. In a box at the other end of the room, I found a paper with seven pieces of mettal in it. In different parts of the room I picked up pieces of sand paper, more immediately near the fire place, which appeared to have been used for working mettal; I found also a pair of scissors, pinchers, and a hammer, which are all slightly discoloured with mettal.</p>

            's Defence. About six o'clock on this said Saturday evening, the prosecutrix came in and sat down; I don't think Mulvey was there. She asked me for some of these shillings, and asked me for six of them, and I told her, she knew I had none; and then her sister said, Poll, I have got plenty, and then she returned to me, and gave me two eighteenpenny pieces; and I said, what do you give the money to me for; and she said, if my husband knows I have got money, he will get it from me, and I don't like to take it home; and at that same time, I returned them on the table, and she said, she must not take it, as her husband was very scarce always in giving her money. Then the sister after that, know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181607100007"></xptr>ing she owed me eight shillings, which I lent her to go and see her husband, who was on board the Hulks, contrived to give me the two eighteen-penny-tokens; and the moment: Mrs. Harbour saw me put the money in my pocket, she goes out, and fetches in the officers, they laid the plan of bringing these things into my appartment. I never took the money from her, but received it from her sister; she herself has been convicted, Mr. Powell knows, of uttering bad money, and does it stand to reason, that if Margaret sold these things to her, why not pay her the money.</p>

               <p>Mr. Powell. Re-examined. Mrs. Harbour came to me voluntary, and without any imputation against her; I had no charge against her at all; she was acquitted once, as only being in company with her sister, who was uttering bad money,</p>

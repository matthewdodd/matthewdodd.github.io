                  </hi> I deal in horse, and live at No.7, South Wharf-road, Paddington—on a Friday, about a month or five weeks before I was at the police-court, I was at Smithfield—I had a grey mare for sale—I did not sell her—I saw James Cooper, and ordered him to take her home.</p>

                  </hi> On the 2nd of July I was in Smithfield, and saw Mr. Thomas—he had a mare for sale—it had been there from the morning—in the evening, when the market closed, he told me to take it home—I had seen the prisoner in the market, I had known him for twelve months—I saw him again afterwards, and asked him if he would be so kind as to lead the mare on a little way for me, and I would overtake him—I went towards King's-cross, and saw John Hoare, with two mares—one was Mr. Thomas's, it was the one I had given the prisoner to lead, and the one Mr. Thomas had given me to take home—I asked Hoare for her, he gave her to me.</p>

                  </hi> I live at Reading, and deal in old horses for the knackers—on the 2nd of July I saw the prisoner with a brown mare and a grey one—I had seen him before—he asked a man standing by me if he would buy one of them, and afterwards offered them both for sale to me—he told me he had exchanged one on that day, and one on Thursday—he said he should sell them at some place or other that night, as they were of no use to take down to the country—I gave him 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the two.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>Q. Did you in July lose a lamp - A. I am not certain of the time, I believe it was in July, 1808.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your lamp - A. In the passage within the house; the porter told me it was stolen, I looked and saw it was gone. About a fortnight afterwards, I was coming through Old Round Court in the Strand, I saw my lamp on a table in a broker's shop; I went into the shop, told Mr. 
               <persName id="t18100110-51-person466">Bradley</persName>
             the broker, it was my lamp; he described the man he bought it of, he said, he gave two shillings for it. I gave him the two shillings for it, and took the lamp home, and I never heard any more of it till yesterday was a week. The broker came to me.</p>
               <p>JOHN BRADLEY. To the best of my recollection, it is about eighteen or twenty months since the prisoner came to my shop with this lamp; I bought it of him for two shillings and sixpence, it was afterwards claimed by Mr. Harrison, he desired me to point out the man; I told him I would, if the man ever came again. Accordingly, last Friday but one, the prisoner brought two sugar glasses, I got information from him where he was to be heard off, I let Mr. Harrison know, I have no doubt about the identity of his person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in the House of Correction at the time this lamp was taken away.</p>
               <p>THOMAS AMES. I am principal assistant to Mr. Ayres, at the House of Correction, Cold-bath Fields. The prisoner was sentenced from this court in June, 1808, for six months, he continued till the 31st. of December. I believe the books of Mr. Newman will prove that he was in custody on the 31st. of May.</p>

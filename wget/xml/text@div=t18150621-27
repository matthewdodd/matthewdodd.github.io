I never missed any property, but have been informed that I was robbed. On June 16th, the prisoner came to me in the front watchhouse, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181506210014"></xptr>asked me to lend him the knot for Mr. Harris; I told him by all means. In about ten minutes, I went into the back warehouse, where he was to purchase some casks to go away, but he was not there. I asked the foreman, where he was and he told me that he was gone to tell the carman to fetch the cart. In about a quarter of an hour, I went again into the back warehouse, to ask if the cart was come; it was not come, and I just stopped back into Beech-street, to ask the reasons why it was the carman told me he had seen none of my men that morning. In coming home if I had the prisoner at the bar, with a knot on his shoulder. I asked him, where he had been he told me he had him carrying a parcel for Mr. Harris. I told him, I did not mind his doing a little job for a friend, but I did not like him to go at that early in the morning, when he was wanted at home; I said to him, some how I don't think any where for Mr. Harris; he told see her hand. I immediately slept to Mr. Harris; and he had neither to go well the that morning. I went back and if you will tell me the truth you have taken any thing or not out of the warehouse, that was then said I have taken a small cask; of I said, well if you have shew it will forgive you, he said, it was.</p>
               <p>COURT. You must tell us anything that happened in consequence of telling you would forgive him if he confessed. When did you next see him - A. I did not see her I took the officer to. We found him his house; we brought to the place where the property was found I did not know where the property was till four hours after would be better The property was a cask of between one hundred and one hundred and a; it was worth between forty shillings and two guineas, and the cask did not be worth more than sixpence.</p>
               <p>KENNEDY. I am an officer of Worship-street office; I apprehended the prisoner between one and two in the afternoon, of the 16th of June, by the desire of his master; his master came to me, to fetch me to apprehend him. The man was in a house in the City; and I am a Middlesex officer; and I did not chose to act in the City; he did not live in the house; we met him coming out; he said, there was no property in the house. The master insisted upon my searching; I did, but found nothing belonging to him. The prisoner then took me to Bunhill row, St. Luke's in company with his master, and at the door of a public-house, called the Brew-House the cask was standing; he pointed the cask out to me; he told me it was his master's property. I have had it in my possession ever since. Have it.</p>

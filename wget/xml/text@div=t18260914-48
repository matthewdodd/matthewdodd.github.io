               <p>WILLIAM HEAD JOHNSON. I live at Enfield. On the 16th of June I sent my servant Brereton to town, with a grey mare - he was to take it to Smithfield and deliver it to Mr. Wignell, the agent there, for sale; he was only to sell it himself if he was offered a price on the road, and not to take less than 8l. for her. He returned between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, and brought neither the mare nor money; I saw it, about eight days after, in possession of the officer, and knew her well again - I conside her worth 8l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Do you know the prisoner? A. He is a stranger to me.</p>

I was to take it to Mr. Wignell, the horse-dealer, to sell; the lowest price was 8l.; I had liberty to sell her on the road if I met with a customer; I overtook the prisoner about three miles before I got to town; I knew him and said "How do you do, Jem?" he was on the footpath; he said "How do you do?" and came by the side of the mare - he asked me if I was going to Smithfield; I said Yes, and asked if he was going; he said he was, and asked whose horse that was; I said it was master's, Mr. Johnson's; he asked if I was going to sell it; I told him I was taking it to a horse-dealer at Smithfield (I did not mention his name), and that master told me if I could get a price for it on the road to sell it; he asked the price - I told him 8l. was the lowest; he said he thought it would not fetch that; he went with me to the Ram inn, at Smithfield, where I put the mare up; we then walked into the market; he said he would go and have a pot of beer - I went and had part of a pot with him; he said "I have got a sovereign, and do not wish to change, if you will pay for the beer I will treat you when I get change" - this was about twelve o'clock; he said "I can shew you a fine place, where there are a great many second-hand clothes; we took a walk round there - it was a long-lane, near Smithfield; we then came back to <placeName id="t18260914-48-crimeloc288">Smithfield</placeName>

I walked about till three o'clock, then took the mare from the stable to the market, and walked her round to get a customer; the prisoner was with me several times, and when a gentleman was talking to me about buying her, he came up, took her, and walked her backward and forward; he took her up, with my leave, to trot her, to shew the gentleman; I do not know that gentleman; I took her from him again, walked her about the market, and this man, who afterwards bought her of Field, bid me 5l. 10s. for it; I asked him 9l., and got as low as 8l., and just as I was going to turn away with the mare, I said "Will you give 7l.;" I said that just to see what he would give; Field stood close by- this was between four and five o'clock - I loitered about till half-past five, when Field came and asked if he should trot her up and down the market - I had hold of her then, and said he might if he liked, and, if asked the price, to say it was eight guineas; but he must see me before he sold her; he took her away - went up the market - I stopped in that place about five minutes, and then, as he did not come back, I walked up the market after him, but could not see him - I expected he was only walking about the market to shew her - I had given him leave to do nothing else - I told him he must see me before he sold her - I saw no more of him - I went all round the market, saw Mr. Wignell, and told him what had happened; I kept looking about for him for two hours, but could not find him or the mare: I saw one Ellis, who lives at Enfield-chase, and told him the story; I at last went home and told my master. I afterwards found her at a public-house in town, took her home, and master has sold her since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You first spoke to the prisoner? A. Yes - I have known him some time. I believe he is known at Enfield; he does not live near master. I do not know the man's name who I first offered it to; one man bid me 6l. for it - the prisoner was not with me then. - While I was talking to another man, who asked me the price, the prisoner came up. I do not know whether the other man's name is Jude. The prisoner did not ask 8l. for it.</p>
               <p>Q. You told him he was to sell it for not less than eight guineas? A. No; I told him to say eight guineas was the price, but he must not sell it before he saw me; if he had sold her, and brought me eight guineas, I dare say all would be right; I dare say master would not have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140037"></xptr>said any thing, but my orders were that he must see me before he sold her; he was not with me all the time I was in the market; he went away, and came several times; I did not ask him to walk the horse about; he asked if he should; I knew his name, and used to see him two or three times a-week. I do not know much of his character - I never heard any thing against him.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you give him authority to sell her without coming to you? A. No; he lived at Enfield, and master lived at Bush-hill, not half a mile from him; I told him I lived with Mr. Johnson.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he come to you before he was taken up? A. No; I looked about for him, but he could never be found at Enfield.</p>

            . I am a constable of Enfield. In June last I heard Mr. Johnson had lost a mare; I sent Pye after the prisoner, and on the Thursday following he brought the prisoner to me at Enfield; I knew he was a labouring man, and lived at Enfield. I took him to the Mansion-house, and on our way to town he asked if I thought it would be of any use for me to go to Mr. Johnson, to try, if he got the money whether he would make it up, and if so I was to go to the prisoner's father - I told him I thought it would be of no use; he said he had sold the mare, and after he had sold her he went into Smithfield to find the lad who he had her from, but could not find him; I asked if he had got none of the money - he said No, he had got into a brick field with some girls, and there lost the money among them - he said he had sold the mare to Jews, who lived near Reid's brew-house, for 5l. odd, and did not know the name.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he say he had sold it to a Jew or Jews? A. To some Jews - to a Jew.</p>
               <p>Q. I am told he said to Jude? A. No; he said "To some Jews;" I swear he did not say Jude; he said they lived near Reid's brew-house, Saffron-hill; I said the brew-house was in Liquorpond-street. I went to Isaac's, in Laystall-street; I got his direction at the Mansion-house - I do not know who wrote it.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. When he said he sold it to Jews, was he speaking of one person or more? A. I considered him as speaking of two; he said to some Jews.</p>

            . I am a constable. In June last I received information of the loss of this mare, and a description of the person. I went to Hertford, and received the prisoner in charge at Ware, on the Wednesday after the robbery. I found him at his father's house - his mother-in-law answered the door; I asked for James Field - she said he was not there; I insisted on going in, and found him concealed under the furthest bed in a room which had two beds; I told him I took him for stealing Mr. Johnson's mare, of Bush-hill; he told me to hold my tongue, for he did not want his wife to know any thing about it; I said no more till we got out of doors - he then began to say he had sold the mare to a Jew, near the brew-house on Saffron-hill, for 5l. 15s., and that he had come back to Smithfield with the money, and from there went to a brick field, and there lost it with a girl - from there he went to Kingsland-road, and rode down the same evening, by coach, to Hoddesden, and intended to return Mr. Johnson the money, but could not raise it again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He did not tell you where the horse was sold? A. He said to a Jew, near the brew-house, and that I knew where the brew-house was.</p>

            . I am a Jew. The prisoner sold me this mare, for 5l. 15s., in Smithfield, a little after five o'clock; he took it home to my house, in Liquorpond-street; he took it through the passage into my yard; we made the bargain opposite Long-lane; Brereton was not present. I paid the prisoner for it when he brought her home. I went back to Smithfield again that afternoon, as a young man asked me to go with him - when I got there I happened to see Brereton walking about there, and asked what he was looking for - he said after a mare - I told him I had bought it, and got her at home; he said I had not - I told him I had, and left him my address - the same mare was afterwards taken away by Johnson, on the 26th of June.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This was about five o'clock in the evening? A. Soon after; I had seen them both walking together all the afternoon, and bid 5l. for it - in the presence of both; the prisoner wanted 6l.; I offered 5l. 10s. to Brereton; the prisoner wanted 6l., and he(the prisoner) said Mr. Johnson had told him to take 6l. for it; Brereton asked would I give 7l. - I said I could give no more.</p>
               <p>Q. He appeared willing to sell it for 7l.? A. I suppose so. I afterwards went up to the prisoner, and asked him if he would let me have it for the money, as I was going home - he was walking up and down; this was about three-quarters of an hour after I had seen Brereton; I was five or ten minutes with him the last time; there appeared no hurry in his conduct. The mare has been resold since for 6l., as I have heard.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. At what time did you bid Brereton money for the mare? A. A little after three o'clock - I offered him 5l. 10s.; he asked if I would give 7l.; the prisoner was present. I saw Brereton up and down Smithfield for two hours; he was not present when I bought the mare. I knew Brereton had the sale of it - I asked who it belonged to - he said to Mr. Johnson, of Enfield.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What part of the market did the sale take place in? A. Opposite Long-lane; Brereton asked me 9l., and then said would I give 7l.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. After selling him the horse I took him to the Bear and Ragged Staff, public-house, to receive the money; he had not got it, so I took it home; he called a man to look at it, who said if he had given more than 4l. 10s. it was too much; I said I would take it back if he liked; Brereton had said if I could sell it he would give me half-a-crown.</p>
               <p>JURY to HENRY BRERETON. Q. You was to deliver it to Mr. Wignell? A. Yes; but Mr. Wignell told me to get a customer for her, as he had to find another horse for master. I did not promise the prisoner any thing to sell it. Wignell did not tell me to take less than master told me.</p>
               <p>Seven witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

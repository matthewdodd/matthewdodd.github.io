               <p>TWO OTHER COUNTS, stating his intent to be to disable him; or to do him some grevious bodily harm.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS conducted the prosecution.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BULLOCK WATTS. I am the prisoner's brother. Previous to the 26th of April last we had been involved in law transactions; there had been a Chancery suit. On the 26th of April he called, under the idea that I owed him some money, and he demanded money of me - I told him I owed him none, and that he, at least, owed me 150l.; but he rather came to borrow 100l. of me; his wife was on my right-hand, and he on my left; I was making a reply to his wife, and heard the report of a pistol; I saw the flash, and heard a wizzing noise by the side of my head- he was within four feet of me at the time - I heard the report, turned round, fell on him, and clasped my arms round him; he was at that time pulling out another pistol with his left hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you happen to see the first pistol at all? A. Certainly - it was in his right hand; I immediately called my servant, and I grappled with him across the room; the servant immediately came to my assistance, and so did his wife; we overpowered him: I believe I said he was a vile wretch - he muttered something, but I do not recollect the particulars; I saw him searched, and two other pistols found on him besides the one he had fired; I cannot myself say whether they were loaded - they were not tried in my presence. I believe for the last twelve or fourteen months he has been decidedly insane; he was secured, and handed over to the constable.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. Where do you reside? A. In Chapel-street, Pentonville - I am an attorney.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not this unfortunate man conveyed all his property, in trust, to you and others? A. Yes, to four trustees.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath can any one of those trustees act besides yourself? A. Yes; Winifred Watts was the acting trustee; I have got the instructions for the deed here - it was executed in March, 1827, and about a fortnight or three weeks after that I was sent for to his lodgings in Amwell-street, and the landlord told me he had been laying in a fit for some hours; a surgeon had been sent for, and attended him: some days after that I was sent for, and found him in bed in violent fits - Dr. Farr was called in, and I believe said he was decidedly insane.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after the deed was executed did you place him in the hands of Wheeler, a person accustomed to keep insane persons? A. I believe a month or six weeks after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell Wheeler to get the deeds and papers from him before he took him? A. No; I told him to get them from him, because he had hawked them all about London.</p>
               <p>Q. You say other trustees besides yourself have acted under the deed - have you not filed a bill to compel them to act? A. To prevent his wasting his property, it certainly was done; by the advice of all his family; his family were defendants in the suit, but they were friendly defendants, and they desired us to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. In that bill have you not charged them with a conspiracy? A. It may be - Mr. Russell filed the bill; I have never seen it. I stated to the Magistrate that he was insane.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not then secure his person and not bring him here? A. If I had secured him, and taken out a commission of lunacy (as I have done since) I should have had greater reflections from his family.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say the commission of lunacy was issued by your recommendation? A. I mean to say I made an affidavit for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not make this affidavit because the Chancellor required to know why you proceeded against your brother, and had him in prison at the time? A. Certainly- I was not examined under the commission of lunacy; I offered some evidence to satisfy the Chancellor why I prosecuted him. I was present when the Inquest was held; I did not insist on being examined - I said they ought to examine me; I was partly examined - I believe I was sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Why, you are an attorney, you must recollect whether you were sworn? A. I do not recollect it at the moment; they did not take my evidence - they refused it; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182807030004"></xptr>was asked several questions, but they said my evidence was so contrary; two other gentlemen proved he was insane when they saw him in the country - they thought that was sufficient.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not all his property conveyed to you, and you were to have 100l. a year, or something out of it? A. No- the deeds and every thing were given up to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you not insisting on the validity of that deed? A. No otherwise than securing the property for his family, and prevent his hawking them about London; I have made no attempt to establish the deed, except the Chancery suit I have named. When I turned round to speak to his wife he was not quite four feet from me - I was not looking at him when the pistol went off; I was turning round - the ball went into the ceiling, not immediately over my head, but just on the right-hand side; the ceiling is about seven or eight feet high; it happened in the kitchen, on the basement story; my servant came to say they were there, and while I went into the parlour they had descended into the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. As he stood so near to you, would there have been the slightest difficulty in hitting you if he had meant to shoot you? A. I believe he did not fire directly, but that the pistol went off as he was raising it up.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You believe he did not fire at you? A. Yes; as he was raising the pistol it went off, I think - I saw the flash - the ball was afterwards found in the ceiling, not over my head, but just in front, to my right.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Might it be done accidentally? A. That is a question I do not know how to answer.</p>
               <p>MR. PLATT. Q. Do you mean to say you cannot say it might not have been accidental, when your own brother is in charge? A. It might have been so; I do not know that he always carried pistols about - I have heard he did so very frequently.</p>

               <p>Q. Do not you know that he had a delusion about passing a place where they killed horses, and that he expected to be thrown into a caldron? Q. I never heard of it till now.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many pistols had he? A. Three; but I did not see the other two: I think from the noise I heard, that the ball must have passed within three inches of my head; he was suffered to go at large- my servant came in on hearing the report; she is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time the pistol went off, did he appear cool or angry? A. He appeared in a trembling condition - his wife blamed him for his conduct; he muttered something, but I did not hear what; the servant had then gone for a constable.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord, in 1802 I was churchwarden of Yeovil, and received a letter from the Lord Bishop of Bath and Wells, (the late Bishop) to look into the charities of the town, the church and charity lands; and in consequence of looking into them, has caused all this trouble and difficulty; the present Bishop in 1805 took it up - I was up in Langham place before his Lordship, and then this Tom, this brother of mine undertook the case, to carry it on, saying what a good partner he had, (Mr. Russell) and they would carry it through, and get my expenses; the church books have been in my debt 613l. ever since; they came to Yeovil, he was to recover it for me, and he drove me out of my mind, and drove me about the country - I have been dreadfully ill used, he pretended to take me up, and to go and put me into a madhouse; I had no peace nor rest for my life; he drove me to Bath, and after that, he persuaded me to sign a deed - after I signed the deed, they took away my property, all my goods and furniture, and every thing; he turned out my wife and family, and distressed them; I have five children and always took care of them, and never troubled anybody - I have been an honest industrious young fellow; he has pitched on all my family, and pitched on me at last, and distressed my children and wife and me; I have been worse than death for years; I knew no more what had been done than the dead - it is a hard case, he has been a very great deceitful man; he deceived me, and made so many deceptions, and drove me out of my mind; he would come one day and say one thing, and his partner come next day and contradict it; I have been like a shuttlecock kicked about from one to the other - I do not know where his partner is, but he is a man who has treated me shamefully, it is a disgrace to the law to have such men in the profession.</p>

            . I have been in the habit of attending lunatics for a great many years; I have seen the prisoner four times - the first time was the 29th of April last; I remained with him about twenty minutes - quite sufficient to ascertain the state of his mind; I say he is of unsound mind - I could not form an accurate judgment whether it has been of long duration; it appeared to me a disease of some standing, certainly; I can say certainly, for a month or two; I have seen him three times since, and examined him on all those occasions, and have not the least cause to alter my opinion - I conceive him at this present moment to be insane, and should say it is not at all likely that he will ever recover; I was examined before the jury on the commission.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and reside at Pentonville. I was called to attend the prisoner in February 1827, and found him suffering from a violent hemorrhage from the nose, in consequence of a termination of blood to the head, which was very probably caused by great excitement of the mind; I attended him again on the 12th of April 1827, in consequence of his being seized with an epileptic fit of a most violent description, and found him in one of those fits.</p>
               <p>Q. Are persons afflicted with epileptic fits, when they come to any age likely to become deranged or idiots? A. I believe that is the usual tendency, these fits are frequently precursors of that affliction; in April 1827, he was decidedly insane, and I considered the fits to be the cause of it - I gave it as my opinion in a very strong manner to the family, that he should have a person to look after him, or something very unpleasant might be the consequence.</p>

I have known the prisoner from a child - I always considered him a very respectable, intelligent, and prosperous man, kind to his wife and family; I have known him till about Easter 1827 - in October 1826 I visited him at Yeovil, in Somersetshire; he was living with his wife and family - his conduct then was very different to what I had observed before; I made my visit as short as possible, conceiving him to be labouring under an insane state of mind; in Easter 1827 I visited him in Amwell-street, Pentonville - he was then in the care of a keeper, and appeared to me as deranged as he possibly could be; he came to my house a week or ten days afterwards, to my great surprise and regret, for I considered he ought not to have been suffered to come; his wife, who was with him, stated that she could not keep him in, for he was desirous of dining with me - he played with the meat and vegetables; and I considered him very malicious.</p>

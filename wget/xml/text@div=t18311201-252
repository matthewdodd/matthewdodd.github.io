The prisoner came there on the 26th of November, to look at some shirts; I showed her some - she bought one, and went away; she came back in about an<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010111"></xptr>hour, and said it did not fit; I showed her some more, and while I was serving her I saw her take one from the counter, and conceal it under her shawl; she then asked if we had any children's things - I said Yes; she looked at some but said they did not suit her; she was then going out - I told her she had something: she said she had not - I brought her back, and took it from her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you known her before? A. Yes, as a customer; the shop was not particularly dark - this could not have happened by accident; it was under her arm, not in her lap - I believe she has things in pawn with us now.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

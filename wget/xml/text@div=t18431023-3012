                  </hi>. I have a rope-ground at Poplar—William and Ann Hankin lived in a cottage near me. On the 20th of Oct. I missed some fowls—in he evening I called at William Hankin's cottage, and told Ann I had lost my fowls—she declared she never saw anything in her house belonging to me—I looked round the wash-house, and put my hand into a rabbit-hutch—she smiled, and said, "Now are you satisfied, Mr. Wright?"—I said nothing—shortly after some boys brought me four fowls—I went again to William Hankin's cottage with the boys—one of them said, "This is the house, Mr. Wright, and that is the woman I bought them of," pointing to Ann Hankin—she totally denied it—I said if she did not know about it, her husband did, and desired the officer to fetch him from a cow-barn—Ann Hankin then said to one of the boys, "There is the money," offering him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and begged me to look over it—on the Monday morning I found a copper warming-pan, and a piece of floor-cloth and canvas at William Hankin's house.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Do you mean to swear to the man? A. I am convinced it is him, but still from caution, I do not swear to him - it was dark, but there were lamps, and I was near to one of them - I only saw him for a minute or two by the light of the lamps. I do not think I am mistaken with respect to this man - I could know him for seven years afterwards - I had supped with a friend, that evening, after I came off a journey from Bristol - I was not intoxicated - I had taken three or four glasses of white wine.</p>

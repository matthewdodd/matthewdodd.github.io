                  </hi>. I live in Bermondsey-street. The prisoner was in my service for about four months—her mother lives in George-court, Russell-street—my wife gave the prisoner a half-sovereign, in my presence, to buy some meat she returned in about three quarters of an hour—I asked her what she stopped so long for—she said "I have lost your half-sovereign"—I said, "you must go and fetch it, or I shall give you in change"—she said, "I cannot find it"—I dressed myself, and when I came down I heard that she had said she had given it to her mother—I fetched a workman to go to her mother's—I asked her mother if she had received a half-sovereign from her daughter that morn<lb></lb>ing she said she had not—she went for her husband, and when he came I asked him if he had received it—he said, "No"—I went to the station, and told the policeman—the prisoner behaved well before this, and has been with me four months and a half.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable M</hi> 101.) I received charge of the prisoner at Mr. Bossard's house, I searched her, but found nothing on her—she told me she had wrapped the half-sovereing in a piece of paper, and given it to her mother, who lives about thirty yards from the prosecutor—I did not go to her present—they are poor people—I called on her mother yesterday, but she denied her name, and I could not find her—the father was in work at the time of the robbery, but has since gone into the country.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Layton, in Essex. On the 3d of October I was returning home with Mary Newcome, from Mr. Clark's, on the Forest, at about half-past one o'clock in the middle of the day—at Phip's-cross, in Essex, the prisoner, Edwards, came up to me—he said nothing, but pulled at my black silk bag, which I had over my arm—he pulled at it, but did not get it away from me; the string was twisted round my arm—when he could not get it, the prisoner, Fitzpatrick, came and pulled at it—I did not know any of the prisoners before—Fitzpatrick got it from me by calling out for a knife—I then let go of the bag.</p>

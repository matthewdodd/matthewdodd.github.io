                  </hi>. I am a furnace-man, and live at 1, Montague-place Plaistow-marsh—on Saturday night, 11th January, I was in the Walmer Castle public-house, at Plaistow-marsh—I went there about a quarter past 11—the prisoner was there—he had a <hi rend="italic">bother</hi> on the other side of the bar—I was on the private side of the bar, and I got on a seat to look over, and saw my brother and the prisoner fighting—the prisoner had a knife in his hand; a knife that is always open, like a butcher's knife; not a clasp knife—I got over and went to get my brother away, and in the meantime the prisoner stabbed me in the right thigh—I got hold of him round the neck, trying to pull him away, and be stabbed me in the thigh with the knife—I got my brother away as quick as possible, and the prisoner went outside—I went out as quick as I could—my thigh bled—I had no chance of saying anything when he stabbed me; I was pulling him backwards from my brother, and then he stabbed me—I was in front of him—we were both, as it were, in front of him—I did not say I was stabbed, as I did not know whether I was stabbed—he <hi rend="italic">jagged</hi> the knife backwards and forwards eight or nine times, and cut two buttons off my waistcoat—the prisoner was to liquor at the time—he was mad-like—he did not know what he was doing—he had the knife between his fingers, and <hi rend="italic">jagged</hi> the point at me eight or nine times—it was only a little bit of the blade—I tried to stop him—they were all hitting and fighting together—there were about fourteen or fifteen of his countrymen there, Americans, or whatever they call them—there was a general row—after I was stabbed I got out as quick as I could—I did not</p>

I took the prisoner into custody on 11th January in front of the Walmer Castle—he was the worse for liquor—I got this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from a sheath in his side—there was blood upon it—I told him he was charged with stabbing Joseph French and Frederick French—he denied doing it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I went to this place, and I got there in liquor with a lot of shipmates, none of my own colour. There were some white men there, seafaring men. The second mate of our ship did not like me aboard the ship, and those men were set there to beat me. The door was shut up, and there was only me and one coloured man in the house. I was struck in the face; I was blinded, and could not see; they beat me. I ran into the taproom; some one had put the light out, and I never heard anything about this till after. A man came and took me by the collar, and led me out. I went and found the door still fast, and I went back into the tap-room; and three young fellows came up to me, and said, "Here he is now," and struck me again in the face, and pommelled me as much as they liked. I then went out in the street, and stood in front of the Walmer Castle for about ten minutes; the policeman came up to me, and said, "I will take you in charge for stabbing two men." I said I had not stabbed anyone, and he took me off to gaol. There were fifteen men there, but none of my colour. I never drew a knife at all; my knife was at my side, and no one saw it till I pulled it out and gave it to the policeman.</p>

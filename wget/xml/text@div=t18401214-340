               <p>On Saturday night last, about twenty minutes before ten o'clock, I was walking with a friend up the Uxbridge-road—two women came up and took hold of our arms, and asked us to go into the park, which I did, but my friend did not—I went in with the prisoner, who had taken hold of my arm, and she put her hand into my pocket—I knocked her hand out again—I then took my watch out of my pocket, and put it into my trow<lb></lb>sers' pocket—I then put my hand into my waistcoat pocket, and missed two half-crowns which I had had there—I did not say anything to her till the policeman came by, when I said she had robbed me—she said, "What a lie!"—I gave charge of her—in going to the station, the policeman saw her row something away twice—he called another policeman to come to him with his light—he found one half-crown, but could not find the other.</p>

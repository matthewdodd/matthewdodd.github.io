                  </hi>. I live at 10, Slade's-place, High-street, Deptford, and am a carpenter, and also paid agent to the Royal London Friendly Society, 51, Moorgate-street—on 23d April last, the prisoner entered my service as a clerk, at 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—his duty was to collect moneys and enter them on the receipt cards kept by the members, and also in a collecting book which he had for the purpose, and to deliver the moneys he had received during the day, to me at night—I subsequently increased his wages to 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and after that to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—he remained in my service till July last—he did not pay to me on 26th June, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received from Charlotte Smonton, or on 5th July, 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received from Mrs. Scotter—the week he was given into custody I asked him if he had received it, and he denied it—he has never paid me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., received on 6th July from William Haggerty—I am answerable to the Society for the money that is received.</p>

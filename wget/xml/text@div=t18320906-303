On Sunday, the 26th of August, a little before four o'clock, I left my house fastened up, and left nobody in it; I returned a little before seven, and found the window broken, just where the hasp catches; the window was open - I had left it fast; I saw two foot-marks by the window, and missed my money from the mantel-piece, and my metal watch, which hung at the bed-head; the prisoner has been in my cottage several times for his beer - he pitched hay for my master.</p>

            . Last Sunday fortnight, between four and five o'clock, I was going with Mr. Harris' two sons, and saw the prisoner peeping round the haystack, against Cook's barn, which joins his house - he was about twenty yards from the house; when he saw me, he came out, and said,"Master has not taken all the hay up;" I said No, he had only taken two loads - he stopped a bit, and then said, "It is fine, and I shall go on to Finchley;" he went by Cook's, within two yards of it - the window was shut then.</p>

            . I am a Police-inspector. The prisoner was brought to the station-house; I told him he was charged with felony, having received information that this house was broken into, and that Stamp had seen him near the house - he said he was no farther than Hampstead-heath, near the Castle, on the Sunday of the robbery - I repeated that; he still denied having been further than the Castle; I asked him to account for the money he had; he said he had been at work at Kilburn the preceding day, and received 2s. 6d.</p>

               <p>Q. You told her it would be better for her if she confessed? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Nor your wife? - A. I cannot say. (Produces the duplicate); I went to the pawnbroker's, and saw it there.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you must not tell us any thing that she said? - A. She gave my husband the ticket.</p>

               <p>Brown. Mrs. New could not swear to it at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mrs. New.) I had no doubt at all about it, but I did not swear to it.</p>
               <p>Q. But you now say you believe it to be your sheet, from the mark of the B upon it? - A. Yes.</p>

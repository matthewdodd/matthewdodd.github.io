                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Joseph Haslett, of Woolwich. On Thursday night, 28th Nov., I closed the shop between ten and half-past, and left, as I thought, everything secure—next morning, on coming into the shop, between eight and nine, I found some toe-marks on the shutters, and a small mark which had been on the corner of one of the handkerchiefs was outside—there was a hole in the fanlight which had been broken previously, that was enlarged enough to admit a man's hand—I missed from the window three woollen shirts, some silk and cotton handkerchiefs, and some braces—the goods were in such a situation that it would be impossible to reach them from the hole in the fanlight, with<lb></lb>out the use of some instrument—on the Monday following 1 saw some of the missing property—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are a portion of them—I know the prisoners by seeing them lurking about the premises—I saw Williams on the evening prior to the robbery.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a second-hand clothes shop, at Green<lb></lb>wich. On 29th Nov., about one o'clock in the day, a person, who I believe to be Williams, brought a shirt and two handkerchiefs to me; I believe these are the two handkerchiefs, but am not quite certain, as I saw them so short a time—I did not take sufficient notice of the person to be able to swear it was Williams, as my sight is very defective; I believe he is the person, and said so next day—he said he had some articles for sale, which he did not want—I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for these three—he came again shortly after, with a silk handkerchief, which I refused to buy—Crouch, the policeman, came in shortly after, and I gave him the things I had purchased.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 118). On 29th Nov. I saw the two prisoners on the Greenwich-road, between twelve and one o'clock—Williams had a bundle on his left arm—I followed them, and saw Williams go into Hitchcock's shop—Jones waited for him outside—they then went to the Eight Bells public-house, and had some gin—Williams then went back to Hitchcock's, and came out with a handkerchief tied round his arm; he gave it to Jones, who put it into his pocket—I followed them, and asked what they had sold—Williams said, his own property—I asked where he got it—he said he had bought it three months ago—I had my doubts, and told him he must go the station—on the way, Jones shifted from the left side of me to the right, about four doors from the station—I searched him, and missed the handkerchief which I had seen in his pocket about a minute before—I went back to the place where he had shifted from me, and there found it in an area—I found on Williams 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2 1/4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and this string, with a fish-hook attached to it—Williams said these three handkerchiefs were his, he had bought them three months ago—they are quite new—Jones said that he met Williams on London-bridge, who asked if he knew where he could sell the things, and he took him to a place at Deptford.</p>

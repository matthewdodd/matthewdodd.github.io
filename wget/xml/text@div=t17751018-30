            . I waked about, eleven at night, with the noise of the thieves breaking into my room; they had a candle in their hands; they broke open a large desk; they took a quilt and several other things out of my room; they went out of the room, and I heard them jump out of a front room window; I gave the alarm. When I came to examine, I found there was a square in that window broke, and the sash that used to fasten down by a nail; but the square having been broke, they could get a hand to the nail, and open it. I conclude the thieves got in that way.</p>

            . About half an hour past eleven o'clock, I heard an outcry from this house; I heard some things fall, and I found the prisoner almost under the prosecutor's window, upon his knees, hurt, as he pretended, by three men knocking him down. I found a quilt tied up in a handkerchief by him, and a hat; and an hour after I found a chissel lying in the street. The prisoner was so lame he could not walk to the watch-house; his thigh was dissected</p>

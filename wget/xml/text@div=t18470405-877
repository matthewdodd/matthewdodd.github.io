                  </hi> I live at Bromley's-buildings, and am employed at Brooks' wharf, Thames-street at times—the prisoners were fellow-workmen there—on 3rd March they said they had a few waste rags, and asked me if I would take them home, and make the best use I could of them—they said they would leave them for me next morning—both prisoners spoke to me about it, and both told the same story—Bartlett spoke to me about it first, when we were at work together—in the course of the day they said they would give me something after I had sorted them; they did not say what—next morn<lb></lb>ing I went to Brooks' wharf, and saw a person, who I took to be Mills, in the gallery—I cannot swear it was him, as they all dressed so much alike—I did not see that person do anything—I saw Bartlett on the wharf—they had told me the day before where I should find the sack—I picked it up in Brooks' Wharf-lane—I carried it along, and was stopped by the policeman.</p>

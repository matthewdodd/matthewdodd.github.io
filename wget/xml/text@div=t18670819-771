                  </hi> I reside at No. 2, Langdon Cottages, Kew Bridge—on 9th July I was in Fleet Street a little before twelve o'clock at night, near Chancery Lane—I was in the road hailing an omnibus—before I reached the omnibus five men came up, four held me, and the other tore my watch from my pocket—the prisoner is one of the men—the chain of the watch broke—the men ran away—I cannot say what prisoner did, but he was one of the five men—I could not say whether he was the one who took the watch—I saw the police officer stop him.</p>

I was in Fleet Street on the night in question, and on coming out of Hen and Chicken Court saw a mob of people—I immediately ran across the road, and the men ran away—four of them ran up Chancery Lane, and the prisoner ran towards Temple Bar, where I stopped him—I said, "You have stolen a gentleman's watch"—he turned round and made use of some foul expression, and said, "Leave go of me"—he kicked me on my ankle, and tried to slip his coat; two sergeants came up at the time, and he was taken—it took a deal of trouble to get him to the station—I took from his pocket a handkerchief and necktie, but no watch.</p>

               <p>On Friday the 3d of this month, having information that halfpence were making at one Davis's house, in <placeName id="t17830115-53-crimeloc306">Tower-street</placeName>

               <p>Court. What, is Davis a <rs id="t17830115-53-deflabel307" type="occupation">taylor</rs>

               <p>Prisoner. Upon that gentleman's oath, where were these pattern cards found? - In the first cellar which joined to the vault where this press and flies were found, and where the cloaths basket was.</p>
               <p>- CARPMEAL sworn.</p>
               <p>I went to this house, I stopped in this parlour first.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know whose house this is? - We understood it to be Davis's that he was a Taylor, and dealt in buttons and cloth and what not, a salesman; when we got into the parlour there was his wife and he standing near together, and I saw his wife shuffle, as if she wanted to put<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178301150083"></xptr> something out of her pocket ; and I immediately caught hold of her hand, and in her pocket, I found these 4 papers of halfpence wrapped up; they are 5 s. papers; that is the usual way of putting them up; here are more halfpence that were in a drawer in the same room; we were informed that they were to sup on a hare and the next day they were to go to work, and in the parlour we found the remains of the hare, and in the cellar was the hare skin hanging fresh (The hare skin produced.) I was in the parlour when Jealous asked him who he had let the cellar to; he did not know nor his wife; either he or his wife, then immediately said, his name was Smith; Jealous then asked him, who the keys belonged to, he said, they were his; Jealous then said, that one of the keys unlocked the cellar door; I went into the cellar, and found the press fixed, and a great quantity of halfpence in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Where did you see the card with the patterns? - In the locked place where the press was; they were laying on a table.</p>

               <p>Produces the dies: I was there and saw the press; there was a whole apparatus compleat for coining.</p>
               <p>Look at these halfpence found in the man's pocket. - They were struck off the dies we found there; they brought me word down, that the prisoner said, he let the cellar to one Smith: here are three of the halfpence that were made from that die; and all these were coined from that die; these were the dies that were found in the closet, where the large quantity of 5 s. papers were; I never saw such a quantity before.</p>
               <p>And you have seen a great many? - I have; there were an hundred 5 s. papers.</p>
               <p>They sell them six for a guinea, do not they? - Yes, they were laid up in sixes.</p>
               <p>Court. Are these counterfeit halfpence! They are; I should suppose the copper of these is worth ten-pence, or ten-pence halfpenny a pound; at the Mint, they pay sixteen-pence, or sixteen-pence halfpenny a pound.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I am rather struck with awe, that I can hardly vindicate my own cause in this awful assembly, but as far as truth will go, I will endeavour to throw a little light on this affair. I kept a house in the mercery and haberdashery business, in Meard's Court, Soho; it was too much, I determined to quit it; I took this apartment, I agreed for four shillings a week, and then by the quarter: I put up a bill to let the kitchen, and two men came and looked at the apartment, and my wife let it for half a crown a week; this I can prove by a person that was present at letting the apartment to a man, who said his name was Smith, but which it afterwards turned out was not his name: I told the man instantly when he asked me, that it was let to a Mr. Smith. The witness says I am a taylor, I deny it: the street door stood always open, and I was in the same dress I am now; the keys were mine, and if one of them opened the door it is more than I knew: my wife has since seen the man in the street that I let the cellar to, and his name is Chamberlayne; she dodged him to his apartments, he told her to come in two hours; she went in one hour, and at the end of the street she saw a coach and goods hanging out of each side of the windows; before she could get at this coach, they drove off, she took another coach and drove after it, it drove somewhere towards ton: my wife is big with child; the coach stopped at the top of St. John-street stopped short of it, and did not proceed after them only to see where they went into; presently the Leicester and Nottingham waggon came up, and these goods went into that waggon, and she came up immediately with the woman: the coachman told her,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178301150084"></xptr> that the husband was to meet his family up at Highgate, and when they came to Islington, the waggoner hearing the story, insisted upon their getting out, and he turned the goods out into the street, and would have nothing to do with the family any further; when she came to Highgate-hill one of this man's sons had been to warn him of my wife's coming: so she came back and informed me, I immediately wrote a letter to Justice Wright myself, and sent it by a porter to inform him of the man's real name, and where he was gone; I offered to be at two guineas expence, and that my wife though in that situation should accompany any person; they made scorn of what she told them, and she came back and informed me; I thought they would have pursued as they could not have been gone further than twenty miles. In this situation I am innocent as the child unborn, respecting the manufacturing any thing of that sort, my business is quite different.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you by these halfpence that were found in your room? - I am much obliged to your Lordship, quarter-day coming on, as the man came frequently up and down, she asked him for the rent, he gave her these halfpence, she objected to them at the time, he told her he had no other money, and if she would endeavour to take them, when he returned he would take them again; I believe she had about twenty shillings worth, he had been eleven weeks the Tuesday before Christmas day: the halfpence that were found on me (I had no more than six-penny worth) I took a few to put off. They took all my money and kept what they pleased. I can prove that any business is quite a different way, that I never knew any thing of coining.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any witnesses to prove that this man had the possession of this place? - Yes, my Lord.</p>

               <p>Prisoner to Mrs. Marsh. Do you recollect any thing about any person coming about an apartment that I had to let? - I was there at the time in Tower-street, when a man came and knocked at the door, and asked if there was an apartment to let, I told him there was a kitchen, I did not go down with him, Mrs. Davis went down with him, there was a bill on the side of the door to let a kitchen; this was sometime in October about the middle: Mrs. Davis desired him to call at 8 next morning, as Mr. Davis was not at home; he seemed very anxious to have it, and said, he would give half a crown a week: I never saw him above once after that. The prisoner took a garden at Bethnal Green, and there was a bright key belonging to it, I cannot swear to the key, (the key shewn her) I do not think the key of the garden was so big as that, (looks at the other keys) that is more like it.</p>
               <p>Court. Which was the key that undid the door? - This lost.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner called three witnesses who gave: him a good character.)</p>

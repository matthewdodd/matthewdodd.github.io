               <p>I saw the prisoner come out of the front garden of Arthur Cottage, Park Street, Hackney Wick, and go up Horner Road—I noticed that the ground floor window was wide open; it slides up—I went after the prisoner, and asked him where he lived—he said "Hackney Wick"—I asked him if I did not see him come out of a house in Park Street a few minutes before—he said no, but I might have seen him talking to a female there—I said that be would have to go back with me—I went to take hold of him, and he threw his arms up—I do not know whether he touched my heels or whether I overbalanced myself, but I fell backward and cut my head, and he got away; I ran after him a little way, but he got over the rails into Victoria Park—on 23rd November, about 5.30 p.m, I followed some one to a public-house in Prince Edward Road—I got another constable and stood at the door, and the prisoner came out with two females, but as soon as he saw me he stepped in again, but came out in half a minute or a minute—I told him I was a constable, and wanted him for committing a burglary at Arthur Cottage, Hackney Wick, on the 2nd of the month, at 1 a.m.—he. said that it was a mistake—when I went back to Arthur Cottage, I kicked up against this clock by the gate where the prisoner had come out, and picked it up—I then called up the prosecutor, who missed the clock.</p>

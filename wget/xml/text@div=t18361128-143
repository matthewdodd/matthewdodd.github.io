                  </hi>. I live in Osborne-street, Whitechapel, and am a plant-broker. The prisoner is in the habit of attending sales—on Monday evening, the 28th of November, between nine and ten o'clock, I was loading a cart at Crown-court, Fleet-street, with a steam-boiler and large leaden cistern—this was the waste pipe of it—the prisoner was there—I went to fetch my horse and cart—I returned, and one of the men told me something—I had bought this waste pipe—I had seen the pri<lb></lb>soner about there very busy, and took him I did not want him.</p>

                  </hi>. I was employed at this sale, and while my master was gone for the cart, I saw the prisoner there—he sad "I may as well take this lead out and put it into the cart"—I said, "Very well"—I put it into his hand, and he took it into the court, and walked away with it—I did not see him again till he was at Guildhall—I gave him the lead be<lb></lb>tween nine and ten o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Red Lion-court, Fleet-street, and am a publican. About nine o'clock on Monday, the 28th of November, a man came into my passage—the prisoner is something like the man—he left some lead with me—he came in and passed through the passage rather quicker then he ought to do, as though he was going into the back yard—I said, "What he you want?"—he said, "I only want to leave this for a mo<lb></lb>ment or two, while I get a half a pint of beer"—I said, "You cannot leave it here"—he said if you doubt any thing, my name is so and so, mentioning some name—he left lead with me, and two men called the next day, and said something to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I know nothing of it—I went to get a drop of porter at the Green Dragon, and this gentleman said that I had stolen the lead, which I had not—I received the lead, and left it in the court, which I was desired to do.</p>

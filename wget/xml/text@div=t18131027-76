               <p>Q. When did you lose any lace - A. On Tuesday, the 5th of October, about half past three o'clock, the two prisoners, Smith, and Thorn, came into our shop, and wished to look at some broad lace; I shewed them some of different breadth; there was none that suited them, they went out, saying, that they would call again if they did not suit themselves. Directly after they were gone the officer came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the other prisoner - A. I never saw the other prisoner. The officer, Johnson, came in, and asked me if I had lost any thing; he said, they were shop-lifters, he suspected them. I looked over the box; I missed one piece of lace: I saw the piece of lace afterwards.</p>

            . I am a City officer. On the 5th of October, about ten o'clock in the morning. I saw the three prisoners in Bunhill-row; in consequence of seeing them altogether, I watched them from ten o'clock in the morning until three o'clock in the afternoon; they went round Piccadilly, and Bond-street, into Oxford-street; I saw Smith and Thorn go into Mr. Serivener's shop, and Williams staid outside of the door; directly they came out, I went in, and asked the shopman if he had lost any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181310270053"></xptr>thing. When they came out of the shop, I saw them give Williams a signal, which gave me suspicion that they had robbed the shop; I followed them into the market, a short distance from the house; they went into a public-house in Oxford-market; they there went into the back yard of the public-house; by their going in so quick I had strong suspicion that they had got something; when they came out of there, I made them all go into the parlour; I then began to search them. In searching Smith, I believe this handkerchief dropped from Williams; I picked the handkerchief up, it contained three carde of lace. I could not discover from whom it fell; they stood close together. I believe it fell from Williams; the handkerchief contained three cards of lace; I sent for a coach, and took them to Mr. Scrivener's door; I made the shopman come to the coach. I asked him if he knew any these cards; he said, he did; they were his master's property. I am confident it did not drop from Thorn.</p>
               <p>Elleby. I know the cards of lace well; they are the property of Mr. Scrivener.</p>
               <p>Q. Has Mr. Scrivener any partner - A. He has not. There is no other shopman but myself. Mr. Scrivener was not in the shop at the time.</p>
               <p>Williams's Defence. When we were taken in the public-house parlour, there were two or three women sitting there, and two or three men; the officer searched us, he found nothing; after we were searched the property was brought forward; I knew nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence. I am the only the person that is guilty, the others knew nothing of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a seaman, on board a ship lying in the London Docks. I met the prisoner in a public house twelve months ago—we slept in the same room—I cannot tell the exact day—I never knew him before—I went with him to another public house near the Docks—I took a handker<lb></lb>chief out—I had three sovereigns and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., tied in a corner of it—the prisoner could see it; he was by the side of me—I took it out to pay my reckoning, and at that time I separated the silver from the gold—after I took it out I put it in my waistcoat pocket—the prisoner snatched the handkerchief sud<lb></lb>denly from my pocket—he ran away, and kept running from one street to another, on purpose to evade me—he got away—I saw him again last Monday evening—I have been in the mean time to Alexandria—when I met him, he said to me, "I think I know you, we sailed together"—I said, "No; but I knew you twelve months ago; you robbed me of three sovereigns"—he put his hand in his pocket to take out a knife to stab me, but he had not one—he ran away; a companion of mine stopped him, and an officer took him in the Docks.</p>

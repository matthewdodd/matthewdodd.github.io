            . I was in the back parlour, and saw what took place - what my wife has stated is correct; the prisoner pushed me down, and endangered my live - I have felt the injury ever since, and so has the man he knocked down afterwards; I held the crown-piece fast in my hand, and ran after the prisoner, who was brought back to my shop - the officer has the crown-piece.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CUTTRISS (Police-constable C 24). I took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>JOHN FIELD. These crowns are all counterfeits, and the two produced by Tennant are of the same mould.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I gave her a good crown-piece, which she weighed - I thought I had change enough, but I had not; gave her the same crown-piece again, and her husband brought two bad ones from the parlour - I shoved him from the door, but I was in liquor; when I got to the corner, there was a man whom I shoved down - my hat fell off, and I returned forty yards back for it; I was then taken back - all these other people have come against me since - I never was at their shops.</p>

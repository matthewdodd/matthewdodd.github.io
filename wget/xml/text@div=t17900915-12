               <p>I am a smith; I am servant to the prosecutor; he lost the things in the indictment out of the shop on Friday the 15th of July, between one and two o'clock; I did not see the prisoner take them, I saw him drop it from his shoulder into a cart, about seven or eight yards from my master's house; the prisoner is a dustman; he took out ashes from the shop; as soon as he tumbled the basket into the cart, I went up to the cart; I took the three nail tools out of the cart; I found nothing else in the cart; the hammers were found afterwards; I have had the nail tools ever since. (Produces them.) They were not missed till we examined the shop, and then we found one tool missing; we did not look for any others; I can swear to all the three.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. You had known this man before? - No.</p>
               <p>He came to take away the dust; and his man, Chillery, was with him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Chillery filled the dust, and this man shot it into the cart? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You saw it immediately it was shot? - Yes, and I told the justice I thought he was innocent, and I think this man is innocent;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150027"></xptr>I let this man go, and took the other man; I believe he never saw it.</p>
               <p>Court. After what this man has said; it is unnecessary to go on.</p>

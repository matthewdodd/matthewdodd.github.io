                  </hi>. I am a master block maker, and live in limehouse. I have a mast yard there—it is ended on one side by the river, it has a frontage of about thirty feet, which is formed by shutters which are open by day, and shut down at night—there is no other entrance to the yard, only from the street, which is secured by bolts—my dwelling house is over the yard—the yard is the ground floor of my house; I go up stairs from the ground floor—under my room there is a counting house which is approached by stairs out of the yard or ground floor—the door of the counting house was not kept locked—if a person got into the ground floor, they could get to that counting house—on Friday, 16th Nov., I went over my premises a little after 10 o'clock at night—they were all safe—we went to bed at a quarter past 11 o'clock—we heard a noise at a little after 12 o'clock, like one of the shutters falling down, and my dog made a great noise and barked—I lay and listened, and heard another noise—I got out of bed, and looked out of the window—I could not see anything—I went to bed again—I concluded that the noise I heard was at the Salt wharf adjoining—I went to sleep and heard no more about it till the morning—directly the men were let in I came down between 7 and 8 o'clock—I found the door open at the bottom of the stairs, and in the counting house the desk was broken open, and the things all strewed about—I missed the roller comb, and brass roller, and other things; a dress coat, and a pistol which I had never seen—it had been in this case—it was sent to me by the captain of a ship—the case had been locked—I found it forced open, and nothing in it.</p>

I was on duty about half a mile distant from the prosecutor's premises, about 10 minutes past 6 o'clock, and saw the prisoners and another man cross Salmon-lane at a very quick walk—I thought they had something wrong, and went another way and met them at the corner of Wilson-street—Sherman was carrying this bag, which was weighty—I said, "What is this you have got here?"—he said; "Go to——y"—I said, "If that is the answer you give me, you and me will go to the station, if you hare no objection"—he said to the other two, "Come here, you b——rs"—they closed on me—I fell down, and got kicked several times—I was compelled to let go my hold of Sherman's jacket—I grasped his arm as long as I could, till the hold I had broke away—they all ran away—here is the piece of his jacket that I had in my hand which tore from the jacket when he got away—I ran after them into York-square, where I lost sight of them—I returned to the bag, and found in it a quantity of brass rollers, and brass cap facings—this was on Saturday mornings—on the following Tuesday, about half past 8 o'clock, I was in company with my inspector, and Mr. Thomas, very near White Horse-gate—I saw the two prisoners passing round by the public house—I ran down by the side of the <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi> and laid hold of Sherman</p>

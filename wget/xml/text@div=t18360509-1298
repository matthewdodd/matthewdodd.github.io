                  </hi>. I am a port butcher, and live in Chichester—place, Gray's-inn-road. On Thursday, the 14th day of April, between six and seven o'clock in the evening the prisoner came into my shop for a penny black-pudding—I served him, and gave him the change for a shilling—the instant he was gone I found it was bad—it was the only one I had—I went and gave it him back—I had bitten it—I found him about forty yards off—there was another one with him—they were eating the black-pudding, and in conversation together—I asked where he got it—he said he borrowed if of a baker; and if I came home with him he would give me the full amount—I would not—I returned and saw the policeman—we went and found him in Liverpool-street, just at the back of my house—they saw us and ran—the officer caught the and the other—they were taken to the sta<lb></lb>tion-house, and then we went back to the place where they were taken, and found the shilling that was offered to me, in the road knew it by my biting it—that was after they were discharged, as morning was found open them—the instant they saw us they began to run, and on the spot I found the shilling.</p>

The prisoner boarded and lodged at my house for five months; he paid me nothing all the time, except 10s. - I applied to him for payment about the 22nd of December - he said he was afraid he should not be able to procure me money, but if I would take a bill from his friend Howell, who I had often seen at my house with him, he dare say he would stand his friend; I said, as Mr. Howell appeared a respectable man, and as he said he was an East India merchant, I had no objection to take the bill - he brought me one for 10l. a day or two after; this is it (looking at it) - it was accepted at that time; the prisoner endorsed it when he gave it to me, and I paid it to Mr. Howell, my butterman, (who is a different person,) three or four days after - on the 3rd of March it was returned dishonored; the prisoner had continued at my house all that time - I took the bill to No. 8, Great St. Helen's, where it is addressed, and found that

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not Mr. Howell appear exceedingly intimate with the prisoner? A. Yes - I told the prisoner the bill was dishonored, and sent one Burly with it, and the prisoner to the house of a lady of rank in Brook-street; I and the officer waited at the corner of Brook-street till they returned; the prisoner came back to us - he knew the officer was with me.</p>

               <p>Q. Now, you seen very hard of hearing - perhaps he may have requested leave to write your name, and you might have made a mistake, and said Yes? A. Such a thing might happen - he bore a very good character.</p>

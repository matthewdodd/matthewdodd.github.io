                  </hi>. I am a private in the Royal Marines, stationed at Woolwich—the prisoners are comrades of mine—on Tuesday morning, 15th January, I got up about half-past 6—I was the first up in that room—After I lighted the gas I saw a lot of small biscuits on the floor, and I said, "Halloa, where have all these biscuits come from?"—there was no answer—that was not the room occupied by Lancaster and Harling—I saw Lancaster afterwards on that morning, and he told me if I was to go up into a room and look up on the shelf over the door, I should see a bag of sugar—he did not occupy the same room as I—he asked me to make away with it—I told him I should have nothing at all to do with it—a little time after that I vent on guard—I saw Lancaster again the next morning—he followed me oat into the passage from the kitchen and said, "Wilson, you are coming off guard and I am going on guard, and I want you to see Harling for me"—I said, "Well, what do you want?"—he said, "I want you to tell him to make away with the silk handkerchiefs and silk, that there may not be a bother about it"—I said, "What silk handkerchiefs?"—he said, "Why don't you know?—I said, "No, I do not know, I should only like to"—he said, "Don't you know that I broke into Butler's lobby the other night?"—I said, "No, this is the first I have heard of it"—he said, "Yes, I did intend to break into it on the ball night, but it was not quite convenient"—I said, "I can't stop to hear any more, I must go back as they will be relieving the guard," and I went away on guard again—when I came off guard I saw Harling—I told him that Lancaster told me to tell him to make away with the handkerchiefs and silk—Harling said, "What do you mean, what silk handkerchiefs?"—I said, "Well, I don't know, you ought to know the best, he told me to tell you"—he then said, "Well, I have got the silk handkerchiefs and the silk, and I am going to make away with then to night"—on the following morning I was in the passage and saw both the prisoners there—Lancaster had just come off guard and I was going up stairs—Lancaster said, "Weil, Harling, have you made away with those silk handkerchiefs and silk?"—he said, "No, I have not, I can't take them out now, because there is a stopper on the gate"—Lancaster made answer, "Well, then, the best thing we can do, to do away with them, is to burn them"—Harling said, "No, let us put them in one of the tanks"—that was all I heard.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Lancaster's Defence</hi>. On the night of 14th Wilson and I and Harling were out drinking in the town till about half-past 8. Wilson broke a bottle of rum, and Harling left us and wished us good night, telling a recruit who was there to stop behind. He said, "Lancaster, there is something I want to do to-night, and I hope you will come up into our room and have some rum, and we will go down and put it all right. I went up into the room about 9 o'clock and had a share of the bottle of rum, and Wilson was sitting on the bed with his comrade. I said, "I am going down." He said, "I will be there in about half-an-hour." I went and watched there till about 10 o'clock, when Wilson came down. He said, "Now, Lancaster, Butler is away, I want you to come with me and break into his room; I know there is money in it." I said "Very well, we will go." Somebody came by, and I said, "Go and get into your bed." Wilson said, "No." I went with him to the sergeant's lobby. He took off his jacket and told me to hold it at the door; he took a large tile and broke the door, went in, and picked out four handkerchiefs and a new blue handkerchief, and put them into his own room; he brought two pieces of silk which he gave to me. Next morn<lb></lb>ing he came and said, "Lancaster I have got half-a-crown out of the recruit</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186101280075"></xptr>
               <p>to get some breakfast," and told me to go to Derby's bag and get some ham. I did so, and he said, "You take and cook it for breakfast". It was then time to mount guard, and Wilson said, "You can sell them handkerchiefs, and spend the money; that will do till we come off guard." I asked Harling if he would come down the town and have a game at cards; we did so, and I said, "Harling, I have a couple of pieces of silk here, I want you to sell them, I have had them in my bag ever since I came home." He did not know where they came from. I am guilty, but Harling is innocent, Wilson was the other man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Harling's Defence</hi>. On 14th I was walking round the town of Woolwich and Wilson and a recruit asked me to go and have some beer with them. I accompanied them part of the way to the barracks and wished them good Bight On the Tuesday, about half-past 2 in the afternoon, Lancaster came and asked me to go out and have a game at cards with him. I did so; we then went to an eating-house, and afterwards, at Lancaster's suggestion, went to a low part of the town, and he pulled out the handkerchiefs and asked me if I could sell them. I asked whose they were, and he said he had had them in his bag a long time. I had not the remotest idea that they were stolen. I gave them to the girl, who brought 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. back. I never attempted to conceal what part I had taken in the disposal of the property.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Harling</hi>. On the day I was given in custody Ward came and asked me to give her 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I said if I felt ever so wiling I had not the money. She said, "Well, I will come up and see if I cannot do you a good turn before the Magistrate in the morning," evidently intending to do me harm. She swore that I went on 17th or 18th and offered the property for sale, when it is known that I was confined in the guard-room on that evening; she afterwards swore that she had never seen me before in her life to her know-ledge. Wilson states that when Lancaster delivered the message to me he saw me in the kitchen; is it not highly improbable that Lancaster should leave my side and go to this man and get a message and deliver it to me; why not deliver it to me in the kitchen?</p>

I entrusted him to sell goods for me, and to receive the money for my use. On Saturday, the 22nd of February, I sent him out with fancy trimmings; he was to bring me back the money for what he sold.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you before been to the customers to desire them to take notice of what he sold them - A. Yes; I suspected him. When he returned on the Saturday he gave me an account in writing of what he sold; he told me he received two shillings of Mrs. Hartley, and that was all he paid me; instead of that, Mrs. Hartley paid eleven shillings and nine-pence. He told me he received only two shillings of her, and that is all he put down in this paper; it is his own hand writing. I had information that he had received more. On the Monday morning I taxed him with it; then he told me to make out my bill of what he had robbed me, and he would pay me.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Hind - A. Yes; I have dealt with him some time. I knew the prisoner was servant to Mr. Hind; he has frequently sold me goods. I paid him for them on Saturday, the 22nd of January; I bought a card of buttons, they came to two shillings. I paid him nine shillings and nine-pence besides the two shillings. The nine shillings and nine-pence was for some articles sold to me before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It was through distress I did it; I thought of making the money up, and paying my master on Thursday.</p>

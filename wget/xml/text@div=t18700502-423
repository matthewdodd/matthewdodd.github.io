                  </hi>.

                  </hi>.—I am eight years old, I live at 7, Crown Court—On the Monday afternoon I saw the prisoner strike a match on the box and throw it on the straw—it all caught light, and he ran away—I heard him ask Jenkins if he would fight him, and also to light the straw.</p>

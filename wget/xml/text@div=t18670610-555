                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife, and live at 9, Pembroke Place, Earl Street, Kensington—about 9 o'clock on Saturday evening, 25th May, my husband met me in the street talking to a young man—he told me to come home—I was obstinate against him—he said if I did not come he would make me—of course then I felt more obstinate, but at last I went home—he told me to undress and go to bed—I would not—I was beginning to take my things off, and he began tearing them off and hit me two or three times in the side with his fist—he did not do anything with my clothes—there was no fire in the room, only a candle burning on the table—I don't wish to press the charge against him, of course I was in fault—ho hurt me at the time—I did not feel it much afterwards—my little boy was in bed at the time—there was a little mark on my face—he hit me there with his hand—it did not knock me down—I was not able to stand at the time—I went down stairs and went into a neighbour's house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Stephen Pan ton—I live in the same house with the prisoner—about ten o'clock on the night of 25th May I heard a noise in the prisoner's room—I heard his wife cry out, not is alarm or terror, but merely the words, "Don't, Jem," or words to that effect—they became quiet after that—I afterwards went into the yard for some water, and saw the prosecutrix there nearly naked; she complained of her husband ill-treating her—I lent her some clothes, and went for a policeman—I was present next day when she was examined by a doctor—her face and neck was bruised, and she complained of her side; but there was no apparent bruise there—I believed her to be perfectly sober, what little I saw of her, but I saw so little of her that I could not say one way or the other.</p>

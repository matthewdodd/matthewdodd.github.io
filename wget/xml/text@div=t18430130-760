                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live in High-street, Shadwell. The prisoner was in my employ about sixteen months—in consequence of something in the week previous to the 9th of Jan. I agreed with Mr. Barrett to mark a half-crown—about ten o'clock on the 9th of Jan. I went down into my shop and asked the prisoner to account for what money he had taken—he said 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for a pair of boots, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for a pair of shoes, which had just gone out—I said, "Has there been nothing else sold?"—he said "No"—I said, "You sold a pair of slippers for half-a-crown at nine o'clock"—he said, "Yes, but you had the money for them." I had been called down at ten minutes past nine, and there was a customer in the shop, who bought a pair of slippers for half-a-crown—I had got that half-crown—I said, "Yes, but you sold a pair exactly at nine"—he denied it—if he had sold another pair at nine, and bad received half-a-crown for them, he was half-a-crown short in the money he had accounted to me for—I told him that when I came down at five minutes past nine I lifted up the lid of the desk, and in a back place, where money never was kept, I saw the edge of a half-crown—he said, "I suppose you put it there"—I said, "No, but I will tell you how it came there"—I told him for a long time I had suspected he was robbing me, and for the last few weeks I was quite sure of it—he denied it—I said, "Have you a half-crown about you?"—he said, "Yes"—he then threw down two half-crowns and two shillings on the counter—I told him that the half-crown with which the slippers were purchased was marked, and on taking up one it was marked—I sent for Mr. Barrett, and in the prisoner's presence asked him if he knew that half-crown—he said yes, it was the one marked.</p>

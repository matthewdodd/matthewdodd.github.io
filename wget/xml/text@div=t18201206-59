            . I am a constable. I was in Coleman-street, opposite Ingram's house, and saw Aldridge at the door, Cohen was walking backwards and forwards. Aldridge came to the door, Cohen crossed over, and went in with an empty bag under his arm. I then saw him come out with something in the bag, I followed and took him about twenty yards off; I said,</p>
               <p>"What have you got?" he said,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake, what shall I do?" I said,</p>
               <p>"You should have considered that before." I took him into the shop, and found he had two hats; he said he had bought them of the boy for 4 s., I asked him what he did with the one he had the day before? he said he gave 2 s. for it, and had sold it. I told Aldridge to call his master - he said he sold them to him for 2 s. each. He went up apparently to call his master, but ran out at the side door. About an hour after he was taken he said he had bid the money in the privy; I found 4 s. on a beam there. He said in Cohen's hearing, that was the money he gave him.</p>

               <p>Mr. Wright in his Defence pleaded, He had been employ'd by the Prosecutor's Family in general to take Care of him, and keep him as a Person disorder'd in his Senses; and some Instances were produc'd of it, as particularly his having wounded the Mayor of St. Edmund's-Bury, that he (the Prisoner) had treated him well, and as other Lunaticks; that there was no five Guineas in his Purse, or taken from him, and call'd Dr. Monroe, who visited him at his House, who declar'd, that he did believe him to be disordered in his Senses, and had known him to have been so for some time.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner desir'd to enter into his Defence, and call'd his Witnesses; but the Court being satisfy'd upon the Evidence of the Prosecutor, did not think it necessary; after a full hearing of the Matter, the Jury <rs id="t17300828-86-verdict439" type="verdictDescription">

               acquitted
            </rs> the Prisoner; and he afterwards apply'd to the Court for a Copy of his Indictment, but the Court did not think fit to grant it, because it would be no Benifit to him to sue a Lunatick.</p>

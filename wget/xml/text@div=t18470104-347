                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Thames police-constable.</hi>) On 3rd Dec. I was passing a marine store-shop in Fox-lane, Shadwell—I saw some iron in a scale in the shop—I went in and looked at it, in the presence of Baldwin, the shopkeeper—I made some enquiries, and went to Mr. Richards—he went with me to Mr. Baldwin's and I took away some iron—in consequence of what I heard I took the prisoner, Brown—I told him I must take him to the station for selling some iron to Mr. Baldwin, the property of his master—he said the foreman told him to take it, he did not know he was doing any harm—that he had received 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and Raddon had received 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I went to the coal-whip<lb></lb>pers'-office</p>

               <p>and apprehended Milton—I told him he must come to the station with me for giving the men some iron to sell, his master's property—he said he did give the men some iron, he thought it was old rubbish and no good, and it was lying in the way—I took him to the station, he said if he had known it before he would have seen Brown, and had it settled—after that Raddon came to the station—I told him I must detain him, for taking some iron to Mr. Baldwin's to sell—he said he did take some there, but it was under the foreman's direction—I asked him if he received 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said be did, but no one was to know it was for that.</p>

I contract with the coal-whippers'-office for lining the shoots—this iron is precisely the same sort as we use for that purpose, and it is in the shape of that which I supply the Commissioners with—I cannot swear it is mine—the prisoners were all in my employ, and Milton acted as my foremen</p>

                  </hi>. I am an attorney, practising occasionally in the County Court, at Lambeth. I was instructed by Mr. Couling to appear for him in this action—I was instructed on the same day, when he came into Court—I remember Mrs. Henley being sworn, and this document being put into her hand—after she had made her statement, I cross-examined her—I asked her whether that was the signature of the deceased, George Bennett—I think I put another paper over part of it, or doubled it over, so as only to show the signature and the figures, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not let her see the body of the document on the first occasion—she said she did not think or believe that it was his signature—I believe she said she believed it was not—I then showed her the whole of the document, reminded her that she was upon her oath, and I asked her whether she would positively undertake to swear that it was not his handwriting—she said, "I will"—the Judge also, I believe, at the time cautioned her, and said he should take a note of her evidence—he appeared to write, and I believe he did—I asked her whether she had seen the deceased write, and she said she had, frequently—I then asked her whether she would undertake to swear whether she knew whose handwriting that was, still keeping the receipt before her—she said she could not—I asked her whether it was like the deceased George Bennett's—she said it was not—I then asked her whether she had heard from the deceased that Couling, the then defendant, had paid the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at that time—she said</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185410230137"></xptr>
               <p>she had not, and she was sure he had not paid 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or she had called on him, and he had promised to pay her—I then asked her whether she was present with the deceased when he had borrowed 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., on a Saturday night, stating that it was for the purpose of getting a joint of meat—she said she did not remember it, and she was sure he never had it—I pressed her upon that, and believe that was the last question I put, and she still denied all knowledge of it—the question I asked her was, whether she would persist in swearing that she was not with him on the Saturday night when he had the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to purchase the joint of meat, and she said, "I will"—I believe the date of borrowing the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was mentioned—I have no memo<lb></lb>randum of my questions—several documents were handed to the Judge in the course of the case, and I believe these now produced are the same—they were impounded by order of the Judge.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The receipt which was pro<lb></lb>duced by you was impounded? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe it was; yes, it was, I have no doubt about it, now I am reminded—I had no doubt before—what made me hesitate in saying so was, that of course I did not see the documents that were impounded; they were some distance from me—I might, and I believe I did, object to the impounding it—I did not suggest that it was very much like charging my client with forgery—I simply objected because my client was entitled to move for a new trial, with a view to his having access to them; it was more for matter of arrangement with the Court for that purpose—I did not say a word about forgery—I will undertake to swear to the words used by the defendant, although I did not take them down—to the best of my memory I have given accurately the words she used—I will undertake to pledge my oath that I have—I have not knowingly made a mistake in a single expression—I believe I could swear I have not; I will swear it—if you mean by "an expression" a single word, of course I will not undertake to say that—I produced the receipt, and put it into her hands—I either doubled it up or put another piece of paper over it—she saw the signature and the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and then she said she did not believe it was Mr. Bennett's handwriting—that was her exact answer; I remember that she gave very precise answers—her words were, "I believe it is not his handwriting"—I said at first it was either "think or believe"—I am sure it was not "think"—I have been refreshing my memory since I have been in the witness box—I am now sure that the word was, "believe"—I then exhibited the whole of the document to her, and said, "Mind, now you are upon your oath; do you positively swear, or persist in swearing, that that is not the deceased, Bennett's, handwriting?"—that was the first question I put to her after showing her the whole of the document—the words I used were, "Mind, you are on your oath; will you positively persist in swearing that that is not the handwriting of George Bennett, the deceased?" and her reply was, "I will"—I am quite sure of that—the whole of the upper part of the paper is admitted to be in the handwriting of Couling; I believe it is his handwriting, but I do not know; I did not see him write it—I do not remember that I heard him swear it was his; I do not think he did; I do not think he was asked the question.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But he told you this was his handwriting, did he not; before you cross-examined my client about it; I suppose you learnt whose handwriting this receipt in reality was? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I put my question as to the signature; I think the other part is in Couling's handwriting; I think he told me so—I believe he told me so—I do not know it—I do not remember that he did tell me—I have no doubt that it is his handwriting—I have a doubt</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185410230138"></xptr>
               <p>whether he told me so—I do not know whose writing the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is at the bottom—I have no belief about that—I do not believe that Mr. Couling told me whose it was—I simply cross-examined as to the signature of George Bennett—I called Couling as a witness, and put this into his hands—I did not hear him swear that this 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was in his handwriting—now I come to refresh my memory, I think he did swear that the body of the receipt was his handwriting—I am now quite certain that it is his writing—of course I believed him—I then asked the defendant, "Have you not heard from the deceased that Couling paid the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—she said, "I have not;" she said nothing more than that—I then asked her whether she was not present when the deceased, Bennett, borrowed 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the purpose of getting a joint of meat on the Saturday night; she said she was not, and she was sure he never had it—I will pledge myself to the accuracy of the words as nearly as possible—the words I used to her were, "Do you re<lb></lb>member being present when the deceased, Bennett, borrowed 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of Couling, for the purpose of getting a joint of meat on a Saturday night?" and her answer was, "I do not; and he never had it"—I am an attorney—I am not certificated this year—I decline to answer the question whether I was practising in the County Court without a certificate.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I observe that the receipt is in a different ink, or rather the "George Bennett, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." is in a different ink to the upper part of the receipt; is it in your power to explain that in any way? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have two conductors, my sons, and they are in the habit of going into my room to make out their bills at night when they come in, and I invariably keep two or three ink stands and pens in my room, and I offered to forfeit 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if the County Court Judge would send one of the officers to my place, and did not discover that fact at the time; I do not know whether Bennett did write with a different pen to me or not—I was sitting in my chair with my back to the fireplace, and after writing it I threw the pen down, and whether he took up the same or not I cannot say—I know the defendant Mrs. Henley—I knew her by the name of Henley—I had no reason to believe, before I went to the County Court, that these first receipts were not the writing of Mr. Bennett; I supposed they were—I took them, and handed them to the Judge—Mr. Bennett always brought them ready written—I never, to my knowledge, saw Mr. Bennett after he had the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I remember a transaction about 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that must have been after the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; perhaps five or six days after—I met him as I was coming from my house; the defendant was with him; it was on a Saturday night, I think the 24th or 25th Feb.—he said he was going to my house to see how I was getting on—I said, "I am just going over to the Elephant and Castle," and he walked with me and the defendant; and as he passed a butcher's shop, he said he should like a joint of meat, but he had not got any money—she was with him at the time—I said if 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. would get a joint of meat, he could have it—he thanked me, and said it would, and I paid the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the presence of that person (<hi rend="italic">the defendant</hi>)—this was in Feb.; I think the 25th or 26tb; it was on the Saturday following the Monday that he had the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he did not buy the joint of meat in my presence—I thought he was going immediately to buy it at the butcher's shop, but he said he could do bettor at Clapham,</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What advantages were you to get by advancing the money before it was due? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was in consequence of his not pressing me at the commencement of my lease, when I had got five men at work—I agreed to pay a quarter's rent that was owing by the man that left the premises, in order to get possession—I was six weeks before I moved any goods, in doing the repairs—Mr. Bennett called upon me for the quarter's rent; I said; "Do not press me now, I am laying the money out upon the premises to get my horses in; if you want your rent a month beforehand, or any part of it, you may have it;" and that I take it was the cause why he came to me as he did—I went into the premises at the half quarter, in July, 1853; I had possession before that, but I moved my horses in then.</p>

I lent Mr. Ben<lb></lb>nett, in your presence, to buy the meat;" and her reply was, "Oh, yes! I know that"—(I had particularly requested Mr. Lyons to ask her that, when he called for the rent)—that was all that passed with her—she said she should not take the balance then, that I should hear from her again—I offered her the balance, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that was not including the 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the hurdles; that was a different transaction—Mr. Bennett had told me that he had got some hurdles which would just suit the front of my place, and I agreed to give him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them, and half a crown for the cartage, and I paid him that 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the presence of Sharland—I never saw Miss Henley any more until the summons came—I was present in the County Court when she was exa<lb></lb>mined—I saw the receipt put into her hands, and heard her asked questions about the handwriting of George Bennett—after looking at it some time, she said she did not believe that it was his—I stood behind my solicitor, and I said, "Ask her positively, she is on her oath;" and he did so, by my direc<lb></lb>tion—I think, to the best of my recollection, he said, "Your believing is out of the question: you are upon your oath; do you swear it is not?" and she said, I do"—I told my solicitor to be particular in asking her if she</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185410230143"></xptr>
               <p>recollected anything about my giving Mr. Bennett 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in her presence, to buy a joint of meat—by my direction he put that question to her, and she said, "No"—he then said, "Do you swear that also?" and she said, "Yes, I do"—I think his words were, "Do you positively swear that also?" and she said, "I do"—nothing more was said about the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was when she called at my house for the rent, that I told her about the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; that was at the latter end of April.</p>

Q.</hi> You paid 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. into Court, did you not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—I did that because I had no receipt, and from her summoning me for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—after seeing Mr. Bennett's receipt, I thought she would deny the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., because I had no receipt—I went into the house in July, but I had to pay a quarter's rent previous to June, because the house was locked up, and the man had gone away, leaving a quarter's rent due—I paid it; it might be six weeks after—I was much better off in Feb., and was able to advance the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to my landlord—I would always do so if I had it—I was prudent enough to take a receipt—I have three ink bottles at my place; there may have been different sorts of ink in them; that I think would account for the different colour of the ink—I bought two bottles the other day, and tried them both—I think that I used one bottle, and he the other—there are three or four pens—I took the paper on which the receipt was written, from the desk; it was lying there when I went in with Mr. Bennett—I did not tear it from any other piece of paper—I took it up and wrote a receipt on it; there was no stamp on it when I took it up; I put it on before I wrote it—I did not make a third line of the receipt, instead of over it, because I have heard that you must disfigure the-stamp—that is the reason I put the date on it—I did it on purpose—I understood that I was bound to do so—I never wrote any receipt for Mr. Bennett before—I believe that there will be plenty of proof that he was a very good writer—I wished him to write the receipt, but when I came to inquire, I found he was in the habit of doing it with tenants and ail manner of persons—I did not begin with the date, I put the date on as I wrote it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Just look at it; did you put the date after you had written the remainder of the receipt, or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think I put it after I wrote the words, "Rent due, March—1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for hurdles;" and then I think I put "Feb. 20."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do not you see that "11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for hurdles," is written over the stamp? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is written along the line; I thought it would be quite proper to put the date on the stamp—I saw the attorney hand this paper to Mrs. Henley; he doubled it down in my presence—I applied for anew trial, but did not get it—I produced an affidavit of my wife, and one of my own also—on the trial I swore that, to the best of my belief, I could not recollect that anybody was present when the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid, and that I did not believe that anybody was present when Bennett signed the receipt—my wife is here now—having failed in obtaining a new trial, I paid the money—an execution was put in on my goods, but I paid it—I never declared that the goods belonged to some<lb></lb>body else—I did represent that part of them belonged to Mr. Rutland; I thought you asked me about the whole of the goods—it was not with a view to prevent their being seized in discharge of this claim, certainly not; I have got 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of property on the premises independent of that—I mean to represent that Mr. Rutland did not claim the whole of the pro<lb></lb>perty on my premises—there was an interpleader action, and the case was to come on for trial at the County Court—it was not until then that the money was paid in by Mr. Rutland—Mr. Collier saw Mr. Rutland for Mr.</p>

               <p>Bickley, as his attorney—Mr. Bickley is my attorney now; Mr. Collier is his clerk—I do not know whether Mr. Rutland had claimed too much the officer will know that—they were not seized for Mr. Rutland, but I owed him 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I had borrowed of him five years ago, to furnish a house which I had taken in the Brixton-road—I do not know whether Mr. Rutland would have taken such a little as 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he was good enough to be my referee to Mr. Bennett—I have got 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of property to pay it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then why was my client obliged to go to the Court? why did not you pay it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I thought it was an illegal thing, and I did not wish to pay it without being forced—the seizure did not satisfy me that this woman's claim was right—I paid 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver for the hurdles; I paid it all at the same time, in a public house called the Black Prince; I think it must have been in the beginning of Feb., about the 6th or 7th—I had the hurdles about a week before; I do not mean Feb. in this year; it must have been in Dec. last year; I swear that—I paid them within a week of having them; I paid for them in Dec. last year, if I had them last year—it must have been Feb. 1854, that I had them—I will swear that it was not Feb 1853, and that I did not have them in Dec. 1852; it was after I had taken possession of the house, which I had not done at that date—I paid for them about the 7th or 8th Feb., and took no receipt—I paid for them all at the same time—I have had no other bill of sale existing; I am sure about that—I have had one distress in my house before; it was from Mr. Crockley, a hay salesman for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I proved that the clover was thrown on the dung hill—the order was given to pay the money at a certain time, and I paid it; there was no execution there—it is ten or twelve months ago—no little inconveniences have arisen on the subject of the poor's rates, nor has any execution been put in for any rates whatever—I have lived in the parish forty years, and there is not a rate collector but would take my word.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has he got a bill of sale on some, of your property? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I sold them to him—a portion of his property was seized under this execution; that is what I declared to be Mr. Rutland's property—I did not declare my own property to be anybody else's, to avoid a debt—I acted under legal advice in resisting this execution, and found that I bad to pay for it pretty highly, and for this prosecution also, and all out of my own pocket—the debt to Mr. Rutland was 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of property; I have two omni-buses, and twenty horses—it was the household furniture that I assigned to Mr. Rutland, but only about half of it—I did not know Mr. Bennett in 1852—the payment for the hurdles, was made before the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was advanced—the payment of the hurdles at the Black Prince was made in the presence of a person named Sharland—excepting the execution I have mentioned, and the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I defended, no claims for money has been made upon me—I have been twenty years an omnibus proprietor.</p>

               <p>he paid the money; he was the claimant—he did not claim the whole of my property, only such things as were seized—I thought that the woman had acted badly, and I did not feel anxious to pay Mr. Bennett.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any reason to put Mr. Rutland to inconvenience in having his things taken? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was not at home when the men came—I came into the premises in July (<hi rend="italic">looking at a receipt</hi>)—I had to pay back rent—this receipt is for rent due in March—I was there six weeks before I paid any rent—there was half a years rent due in June—I paid in June the rent due at March; I paid it before I went into the premises—I have been in the habit of advancing money to Mr. Bennett since I have got the place repaired—I have gone to people two or three miles off, to stop executions being put into his place—this receipt is for rent due up to Christmas; 1853—Mr. Bennett has been obliged to press me for payment—up to this time I had not been in the habit of paying my rent in advance—I have a niece of the name of Thyrza Knight, and when I came home from the County Court, at the end of April, she said, "Uncle, I heard her admit about the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—she did not go with me to the County Court, but the second time; when I moved for the new trial, she was present, and when I came home she said, "Uncle, I heard her acknowledge about the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."</p>

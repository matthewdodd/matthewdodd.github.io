On the 5th of May the prisoner bought several things at my shop, which were to be sent to No. 91, Moffat-street, City Road. He came again on the 10th, and had other things, which came altogether to 12 l. 1 s. 8 d. He told me to come on Thursday morning, the 14th of May, at ten o'clock, and he would pay me. I went, and he was out. I was told to call again at three, which I did; I called again at nine o'clock; and saw him. He said,</p>
               <p>"I cannot settle your bill, unless you change me a 30 l. note," I said I could; he then said he could not settle with me until the next morning at ten o'clock. I went again - he put me off till three, I then saw him in his back parlour - he asked me if I had got change for the 30 l. note? I said Yes. He told me to write the receipt. He took out his pocket-book, and said,</p>
               <p>"I have not got my 30 l. note here, I must go up stairs for it." I had put two 5 l. and eight 1 l.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181905260040"></xptr>notes on his table with the receipt. He took them up, and went up stairs with them. At the same time his shoemaker, who was there, left the room - I remained alone. Instead of returning into the parlour to me, he ran straight out of the house. I followed, and saw him run out of the side-door of the Crown and Sceptre, public-house - I stopped him, and asked him for his 30 l. or my 18 l. He said,</p>
               <p>"My good fellow, you shall have your 30 l. note in fifteen minutes, if you will go with me to the King of Prussia, public-house." I went and waited about twenty minutes; he sent for somebody, the person returned, and said he was not at home - I waited there an hour. I had occasion to leave the place for about a minute; on my return I found he was gone. I ran to his house and several other places, and in about half an hour I found him in the garden of the King of Prussia; I asked him for my 18 l. - he said,</p>
               <p>"My good fellow, you are frightened at your own shadow! it is of no use for you to have your 18 l., you will have the whole presently." He had a bill for 29 l. in his hand, and said if he were to give me this bill he should be under an arrest. He put it on the table, I said,</p>
               <p>"That is of no use to me." I returned with him to the Crown and Sceptre. I saw a friend, and beckoned him over. I got an officer, and gave him in charge. He was searched at Worship-street, after a great resistance - my notes and receipt were found on him, but no 30 l. note.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you agreed to take any thing in exchange for the 18 l. but the 30 l. note - A. Nothing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did he not give you the bill - A. No. I had no idea of discounting the bill for him. I did not take it up. I neither drank nor sat down with him.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for to the Crown, public-house, in Moffat-street, and went to the prisoner's house in Moffat-street; I told him I had been sent for to apprehend him for robbing Mr. Bryant; he asked me to produce my authority. I produced my staff - he asked for my warrant. I said I had none. He threatened me, and pushed me out of the house. I went for assistance - he came into the public-house, and I took him into custody, and took him to the office; he resisted very much, and said, as there was no magistrate on the bench he would not be searched, and what he had about him was his own. I at last searched him, with assistance, and found a pocket-book, with twenty-eight duplicates, a bill of exchange for 29 l. 14 s., and Bryant's receipt for 12 l., in it.</p>

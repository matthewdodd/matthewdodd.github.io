                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Tyler of 64, Farringdon-street, watch<lb></lb>maker and jeweller—the prisoner was in his employ about six weeks—he came to his work on Monday, 20th June—we had a case in the window where rings were, and about eleven o'clock I missed a ring off a card—I had before that found a ring on the floor, off another card—when I missed the ring, I asked him if he had seen anything of it—he said, "No"—my boy was in the shop—I went into the parlour afterwards and on looking through the window, saw a ring in the prisoner's hand—that was not the one I had found on the floor—he was looking at it—I went into the shop—some one came in to have a hand fitted on to a watch, which the prisoner was doing, and during that time he had the ring concealed between his fingers—he had a file in the other hand—the person stayed about a quarter of an hour, and after that I said to the prisoner that I had seen a ring in his possession and I must have it—he said that he had not got it, and I said, if he did not give it up I would send for a policeman; and he gave it to me—he was going to sit down to work, and I said he should not do any work till my husband came home—I called up Mrs. Cohen and they persuaded me to have him searched—I sent for a policeman, and during that time he tried to conceal another ring—Mrs. Cohen said, "He is going to conceal something else"—I looked under his hand and there was this other ring under it—the value of them both is about 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's son, and am fifteen years old—on 20th June I was in the shop—I had seen these two rings that morning on a card in the shop—my mother came in and said in the prisoner's presence that she had found a ring on the floor—she afterwards said she missed one—the prisoner said that he did not have it, and knew nothing about it—I recollect my mother going into the parlour and coming back and finding a ring on him—Mrs. Cohen was called up—something was said about searching him, and I was sent for a policeman and could not find one—when I got back, there was a policeman inside—I had not given the prisoner authority to take these rings—I had given him authority to take one a few days before, and this is it—the price of it is 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had borrowed 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of him, part on Tuesday and part on Friday, and told him that I would pay him when my father returned from the country—I recollect selling him a chain for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave the money to my father.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you remember selling the prisoner any brooches or letting him have any brooches to sell? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; it was an Albert chain that I sold him for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I remember purchasing a pipe—my father gave me the money, I did not borrow it of the prisoner, only 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the price of it was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have no recollection how long before this day it was—my father was at Finchley; that is where we reside—when he was away I was mostly in the shop—he authorized me to sell things; I had not to consult any one—I had money of my father's at that time, but I never liked to touch it because it is put down in an account—the prisoner did not say to me that the rings had better be replaced as my mother was inquiring about them, and I had given them to him—he did not say, "Why do not you tell your mother about them?"—I cannot say whether I had been out of the shop; I might—I arranged the window at 8 o'clock that morning, and the rings were missed about 11—there was a case to cover these things; we have to slide them along—the window is about a foot and a half deep—the prisoner works opposite the window, opposite the other side of the counter—he was alongside of me when he returned the ring to me—he serves customers when I am out of the shop—the price is marked on all the goods—he took two brooches the night before, to show to a young lady—he brought them back next morning and said they did not suit—he asked me to let him take another one—I said, "No, my father will be up from the country this morning and he will let you do it"—he did ask me to let him have another ring to show to this young lady—my father did not come up that morning, not till the next morning—any one in the room could see the prisoner go to the window—I remained in the shop after my mother discovered the robbery.</p>

On Thursday morning, the 10th of May, at half-past six o'clock, I missed six sheep, which I had seen between five and six o'clock the evening before - they were in some fields which I rent, in the parish of Cranford, in Middlesex. I had one hundred and fifty-six sheep all safe there the night before; they were in different lots - the six missing were, four of one sort, and one of each of another sort; they were four ewes, a Lancashire, and a South-down. On the 17th of May I saw the whole six again, at Westall's livery stables, Curtain-road; Garton and Armstrong, the officers, showed them to me, and I claimed them. I had one hundred and fifty left. I could not find any where that they could have crept out - but I saw the marks where a cart had been backed up, close to the paling, and a piece of the paling was broken off. I examined the sheep in the Curtain-road, and am quite certain they are the same - they are store sheep, and worth about 9l.; I saw the prisoner at Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. What sort of a field were they in? A. A pasture field - there are three fields, which open by gates, for them to run into; they are parted from the road by hedges, gates, and palings - two of the fields join the high road - the bedges were very close; a hare could not get through. I counted the sheep at night myself; they were alive when I found them - my father is living, and he is the same name as my own, One ewe had two brand marks. I know them by their description and species - there was none like them in any of the adjoining parishes.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live at No. 45, Turk-street, Bethnal-green. On the 10th of May, about nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to my house; I did not know him before; he said Mr. Green had recommended him to me; he wanted me to kill half a dozen sheep for him; I knew there was one Green, a cow-keeper; I said I would go and look at them first - he said they were at the back of Bethnal-green church, near Hare-street-fields, and that he had bought them of his brother, at Beaconsfield; I went with him to see them, and found them in a yard of a house in Hare-street-fields - I looked at them, and asked what he gave for them - he said 1l. 8s. each; they were worth that - I said they were not fit to kill, they were not fat enough, but I would kill them - he said he thought they were fat enough for the neighbourhood; I was to kill six, and take five of them to market for him - we went and had some porter together; I did not kill them - I was to go again the same night, but did not - I saw Armstrong, the officer, on Friday, and told him, and on that night I went to the prisoner again - he and Green, and another person or two, were waiting in this yard for me to come and kill them; I had not been there two minutes before Armstrong came in, and asked me, in his presence, whose sheep they were; I said "They are mine, I am going to kill them;" Armstrong said, "Where did you get them from?" I said, "You must ask that man that question, I have got them to kill;" he asked the prisoner, who told him he bought them of Mr. Reeves, of Woburn, in Buckinghamshire; Armstrong secured him; I assisted in driving the sheep to Westall's stables, in the Curtain-road, near the office, and on the 17th I saw the same six sheep delivered to the prosecutor, at Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you keep a butcher's shop? A. Not now; I am a jobber - I have not kept a shop for twelve months - I kill sheep at the owners' houses - I knew Armstrong before; I went to him on Friday - he did not come to me - the prisoner told me they had come from his brother, at Beaconsfield - I think I told the officer directly he said they came from Woburn, that he had said they came from Beaconsfield - Green had told me ten days before, that he thought he could recommend me to a job - I have not seen him here - there was never any particular intimacy between us - I had never seen the prisoner before - neither Green nor I were taken into custody - I said they were mine and looked at the prisoner sideways - he did not deny that they were mine - I do not know how I came to say so - it came out all at once - I had given information to Armstrong.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. Butt came to me on the 11th of May, and in consequence of his information, I went with Attfield, another officer, to a house in Hare-street-fields that night - I found Butt, the prisoner, and Green, in a back yard of a house, with these six sheep - Butt had hold of them - I asked him whose sheep they were; the prisoner heard that - Butt said "They are mine, I am going to kill them;" I asked who he was going to kill them for, and he pointed to the prisoner; I asked the prisoner how he came by them; he said he bought them of a man named Reeves, of Woburn, in Buckinghamshire, and paid 28s., a-head; I asked if he had a receipt for the money - he said Yes, but his wife had got it; I took him to the office - I let the sheep remain a day or two with Green, as I knew him - he works at the gas-works opposite; the officer and he then drove them to Westall's livery-stables, Curtain-road; I delivered them over to Green; I can identify one of them, which is here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you mark it? A. No; it was cut, it is like the same; they were not in my care more than three-quarters of an hour; Green is not here.</p>

            . I am drover to Mr. Rogers, and saw the sheep three or four times a week; I took the hundred and fifty sheep to market on Wednesday; I do not exactly know how many I took, but am sure these six were among them; I saw them again on the 18th at the stables; Mr. Rogers showed them to me; I knew them all again; they are part of the sheep which I took to market on Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Butt swore before the Magistrate that I had these sheep shut up in the house, and that he was to kill them, and take five to market; that is not what I said; I told him to inquire if the market was up, and let me know, and as he did not come on Thursday evening, I thought the market was not up; my brother-in-law's name is Reeves; he lives at Woburn, near Beaconsfield; I had taken their shop to open as a butcher's; I had saved a little money while working with Mr. Arnold, and took this shop and parlour of Green; it was not ready to be opened, but Green persuaded me to open it on the 9th; I set off on Sunday to go to buy some sheep of my brother, who is a dealer; I got into conversation with a man on the road, near Southall; he said he had some sheep to sell, and could suit me without going so many miles; he said if I would go to a public-house at Hayes, he had some sheep; I went, and stopped till nine o'clock; it was quite dark, and I did not know the road before; he took me to a field where he had some sheep, which he said were his own; he had six in a fold in the corner, which he wanted to sell for 30s. a head; I gave him 28s. a-head, and brought them home; I had plenty of time to have put them out of the way if I had known they had been stolen, but I drove them home through the open street, and kept them from Thursday till Friday without altering any marks; I entirely depend on Divine assistance to instruct me in the way to go on; I have been teacher in a Sabbath-school, where I lived in great joy and peace; but I have lately failed in business, and have not attended a place of worship as I ought to have, and through backsliding from the Almighty I have been suffered to fall. Butt has done this more to injure Green than me; the man I had the sheep of said if I was asked who I had the sheep of, I need not tell; I told Armstrong, on the second examination, how I had been led away; I did not know they were stolen; these things are facts; my friends are twenty-eight miles from town.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Swindle Hurst, a tobacconist, of 117, Clapham Road—I served the prisoner with half an ounce of shag at 9 p.m. on the Derby day—he gave me a florin; I gave him the change and put it in the till where there was no other florin, and only six shillings—two or three minutes after he had gone I took the florin out of the till, it was still the only one there—I took it to the Dorset Arms, which is 40 yards off, and saw the prisoner go in there—I asked for some ale and gave the florin in payment, thinking it was a good one—the landlord gave it back to me broken, and I found it was bad—the prisoner was in the bar, and I said in his hearing that he gave it to me—he said nothing, and was given in custody with the pieces of the florin.</p>

I am a licensed victualler, of 198, Lambeth Road—on Wednesday evening, 5th June, I was at the Dorset Arms, the landlord is a friend of mine, and I was serving customers—Mr. Quirk came in about a quarter to 9 for some gin in a bottle, and gave me a florin—I tried it, found it was bad, broke it in the beer-engine, and gave the pieces to the landlord—while I was there the prisoner came into the private bar at the Clapham side.</p>

I keep the Dorset Arms, Clapham Road—Mr. Wick stead, who was assisting me on the Derby day, showed me a broken florin about 8.45—I returned it to Quirk, and immediately afterwards the prisoner tendered a bad florin to my barmaid—I took it from her and told the prisoner it was bad and put it on the counter saying "Have you any more?"—he said "No"—I said "I think you have" and jumped over the counter, took hold of him, and threatened to lock him up—Quirk came up and said "This is the man who gave me the bad two-shilling piece—the prisoner said nothing—I gave him in custody—I do not know what became of the florin—two men came in with him; they went away—I saw them speak to the prisoner.</p>

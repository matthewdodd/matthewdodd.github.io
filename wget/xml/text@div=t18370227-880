                  </hi>. I am a cow-keeper and deal in hay, and live in Church-street, Greenwich. The prisoner was in my service as hay-binder, and left last Monday week—I have a part of a stack of hay at Brockley Wood—in consequence of information, I sent for the prisoner, last Wed<lb></lb>nesday, and told him I had information of his selling my hay, and I had sent for a policeman to give him in charge—he said, "Well, master, I know</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183702270185"></xptr>
               <p>I have done it, and I will pay you if you will give me three weeks to pay it in"—I never authorized him to sell my hay—I never received any money from him for it—I gave him in charge immediately.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Printer.</hi> When I first went to work for him, he came to me and said, I must make the most of the hay—he said some was worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a load, and some 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and said, "Perhaps you may get rid of two or three loads for me"—a few days afterwards Mr. Willoughby asked if it was for sale—I said, "Yes, at 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he offered 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and to fetch it himself, which I agreed to. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I never authorised him to sell any hay—I never had any conversation with him about the price—I never told him to get rid of it—there is not one word of truth in what he has said—he never told me he had told it, till I charged him with it—on Sunday he told me a man named Skates wanted two loads—I said, "Very well, I shall see him on Monday."</p>

On the 27th of February I went to a stack of hay near Brockley Wood—I saw the prisoner there, and laid, "Is this hay for sale?"—he said, "Yes"—he asked 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a load—I said, it was too much, and agreed to have a load at 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. after having half a load I said, "Give me a little bill, and I will pay you"—I had fetched the half-load away in two quarters—the prisoner delivered it—it was already cut—he helped to load it—I paid him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, and he gave me a bill, which was made out at the Dartford Arms about 300 yards off—he was loading another cart for Blackheath at the time—the landlord made out the bill (<hi rend="italic">read.</hi>)</p>

On Wednesday, the 1st of March, 1 apprehended the prisoner at Lewisham—on the way to the station-house he said he had sold the hay and received the money, and in coming home he got into a wagon, and supposed he had lost the money—I asked him what sort of a wagon it was—he said he did not know—he did not say it was a coal wagon till he got to the station-house—I found no money on him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a market-gardener, and live at Plumstead, in Kent. I rent a cottage there—the lead in question was taken from the cottage—I did not miss it till the officers brought it to me, this day week—I looked at the roof of the cottage then, and found it stripped of the lead,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Tuesday, the 23rd of January, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was on duty in Woolwich, and received information—with the assistance of my brother officers, I went and found the three prisoners in the New-road, Woolwich, all three together—I took William Fabling into custody, and on him found these two pieces of lead—I told him that I took him into custody on sus<lb></lb>picion of stealing it—be said be supposed so—I took him to the station-house, searched him, and found on him a knife—the lead appeared to have been cut, and the knife appeared to have cut lead—be stated at the station-house that he had found the lead—next morning I went over to Plumstead, and found the lead had been taken from an uninhabited cottage there—I found the whole of the covering of the shop-front and door gone—I com<lb></lb>pared the lead with the places, and it tallied exactly—there was 56lbs.—my brother officers took the other prisoners—they were with me—Warden took Hoare—Richard Fabling ran away, but was shortly afterwards taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer. I was with Chittenden when the prisoners were seen in New-road—Chittenden apprehended William Fabling—I went up to Hoare and said to him, "What have you got here?"—he seemed rather bulky—his smock-frock stuck out—he pulled his smock-frock up, and these two pieces of lead dropped from under it—this was about a mile from Plumstead—it was about seven o'clock in the evening—I said I should take him on suspicion of stealing—he said he supposed I did think so—I took him to the station-house, and on searching him found a knife in his pocket—I cannot say whether it had cut lead—I fitted the lead next morning to the premises, and it tallied exactly—he said he picked it up—Richard Fabling ran away when we took the other two—when I first came up to them they were standing still, near a marine store dealer's, right opposite the, door—I know such shops buy lead.</p>

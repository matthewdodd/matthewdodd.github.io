The prisoner lodged at my house five weeks; the first three weeks he lodged in the garret; for about a fortnight he lodged in the two-pair-of-stairs room. On the 12th of December I missed the things mentioned in the indictment, (repeating them) they were taken out of a tea-chest, which was in a box that was kept locked; they were both broken open; I missed the goods and money at about eleven or twelve at night; the prisoner had went up stairs about an hour before, to go to bed; he came down stairs again; the outward doors were locked; we found this tea-chest broken open, lying in his room, with a trowel, and bricklayer's apron near it. The prisoner went out of doors that night, and never returned again.</p>

               <p>I am the wife of the prosecutor. I had the key of this box; about an hour before I had been up stairs to fetch down two guineas worth of silver for a customer and I carried up two guineas with me; I looked into this box, there were then eight guineas, two guineas I carried up, which made ten guineas, and thirteen shillings and sixpence in silver in the box; when I found the tea-chest above stairs there was sixpence left in it, and a shilling was dropped in the room; I counted the money; I saw at that time the mourning ring, the tea-spoons, and tea-tongs. As I was going up stairs, about eleven at night, in order to shew a man this room, I met the prisoner coming down stairs; I said, Lord, I thought you had been a-bed long ago! he said, yes, ma'am, I was, but I was d - n - n dry, I must get up to have a pint of beer or some water; he went down stairs, took a pot, opened the door and went out with a pretence to get some water; I went up stairs with the other man into this room; I saw the tea-chest there, but took no particular notice of it; soon after my husband called out, take care every thing is safe, for I have been robbed, the box is unlocked; I said I had locked it; I went-up stairs; I found the outer box broke open, and the tea-chest taken out and broke open, and robbed of its contents.</p>

               <p>I owed them a little money; they let me whitewash the tap-room cieling, kitchen, and a club-room cieling; I paid off three shillings by working; I owed them nothing then. The occasion of my leaving them was, they let the room for eighteen-pence a week to another man; that was the reason of my leaving the house. When I lodged in the garret I got a violent cold; then I moved down and did not like to move up there again. I first lodged in the garret, then came down to this room.</p>
               <p>Court. What was the prisoner to pay for that lower room? - One shilling a week; I told him till I got a lodger for that room, he might lie in it as it was a better room; he had it at the same price.</p>

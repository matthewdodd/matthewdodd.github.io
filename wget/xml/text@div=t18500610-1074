                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother Matthew; we are linen drapers and carpet-warehousemen, at 83, Whitechapel-road. On 3rd June I was in the warehouse, about five in the afternoon, Myers and a policeman came to me, and I went with them to 32, Went worth-street, Whitechapel, to a bedroom on the second-floor—I found the prisoner Hartley there, and a man who is not here—there were two or three persons there—Clark showed me some carpet, which he took out of a bag—I believe it to be ours—there was about fifty or sixty yards, cut up in separate pieces—some was on the floor—it was all one pattern—there was eighty or a hundred yards in the morning, but it would be cut during the day—Hartley said, "We bought the carpet, and paid a good price for it"—she afterwards said, "We will pay for it"—I had claimed it then—I do not, of my own know<lb></lb>ledge, know of the loss of any carpet—Leatham, the warehouseman, does; he is not here—I have no doubt of this carpet having formed part of our stock—it was eighty or a hundred yards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an oil and colourman, and live at 64, Wentworth-street. On 22nd May I was with Morgan, in the Whitechapel-road, about nine or half-past, and saw him take a roll of carpet from the pavement in front of a shop—I helped him to carry it to 9, White Bear-court, White-chapel, where Roach lived—we took it to his room—he was there—we told him we had taken it from a shop in Whitechapel—he said he knew where he could <hi rend="italic">put it away</hi> for us—he cut off three pieces, about twenty yards, which was taken to 32, Wentworth-street, by Roach, Morgan, and me—they went in; I stopped outside a considerable time—Roach came out and called me in—I went in and saw Hartley, a man, and some young people—Hartley took a purse from her pocket and took out 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which she gave to the elderly man who we found there—he said that was all the money he had got that night—he gave it to Roach, and said if we would come round in the morning with the remainder of the carpet, he would buy it of us—we all three came away, and next morning we took the remainder, and saw Hartley and the same elderly person, who gave Roach 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a pot of beer, for the carpet.</p>

On the 7th of May I went to bed about half-past eleven o'clock; I sleep in a parlour behind the shop - the house has a shop, a back parlour, then a first floor, and a little room at the side of it; there is a window to the staircase - I do not recollect whether that was shut or open; I was disturbed about two o'clock, and thought it was the wind rattling in at the staircase; I listened - it was still for a moment or two; I then got out of bed - there is no door - I sleep nearly opposite the staircase window; I looked round the corner of my bed, and saw a man standing before me- he was on the stairs; I immediately called out loud, and saw him go out at the window, which is about eight feet from the ground - I think he jumped into the yard of the next house, which was under repair; there is a wall between the two yards, about six feet high - I ran up to the second floor front room, to call my father, and saw him coming down stairs; I did not see the man's face - it was moon-light, but I was so frightened I did not observe whether he had a hat on.</p>

            . I rent this house. On the night of the 7th of May my family consisted of my brother-in-law, my wife, the maid-servant, my son, and four other children - I went to bed last, about twelve o'clock; the staircase window was secured by a shutter and two iron bars across; the back and front doors were fastened, and the windows were secure; I was alarmed by my son calling out, and making a very great noise - I burn a light; I got up, lighted a candle, and went down to the first floor - I got a poker, and went down into the shop, but did not discover any thing gone; I did not observe the window, as I came down hastily, but on coming up I found the window-sash drawn up to the top, the shutter removed to the outside, and laid on the tiles of the privy, which is nearly on a line with the window - I went down to call the Police, and by the time I opened the door they had taken the prisoner; they brought him into the house; there is a wall between mine and the next house, which is a public-house under repair - it is empty; a man could get into that house without difficulty from the court, and from there into the yard; the wall is five or six feet high - he could get on that, draw up the window, and put up the shutter, which was inside, by lifting up the bar with an instrument; part of the shutter would come forward, and he easily removed, neither the bar or shutter were broken - the sash had not been hasped - I have a good many clocks and parts of watches in my shop; I missed nothing - I knew nothing of the prisoner before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you the last person up? A. Yes; I fastened the shutters and doors myself - I found the prisoner in custody of Clark, I believe; they said they saw him come out of the door of the empty house - something was said about his coming out of my door; I said No, my door was shut - I believe it was a Police-man said he saw him come out of my door; I do not know his name - there were other Policemen there.</p>

            . I am a Police-man. I was coming out of Cranbourne-street and crossing Castle-street, about a quarter past two o'clock in the morning, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I went down St. Martin's-court, and heard a cry of Murder! I tried to force the door open next to Mr. Grant's; that is a small haherdasher's shop, which I believe belongs to his house, and is between his door and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270014"></xptr>the empty house; while I was trying to force that, I saw the prisoner running from the door of the empty house - I followed him down the street into St. Martin's-lane, up Cecil-street, into Castle-street, till he was taken by Howlett; I lost sight of him for a moment only, as he turned from Cecil-street into Castle-street - he had no hat on; nobody but myself was following him - I turned the corner immediately after him; I swear he is the man who ran out of the empty house - he had his hat on when he came out- he dropped it in St. Martin's-court; I found this hammer laying in the court, close to the cellar flap of the empty house - the cellar was open; it is an old shutter, which had been fastened with a nail or two - they could get into the cellar, and into the back yard, out of the back door-way; there was no back door to the doorway.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always given the same account of this? A. Yes - I never said he came out of the prosecutor's house; I am the only Police-man that saw him come out - I am certain the prisoner is the man; I did not tell the prosecutor I had seen him come out of his door - nor did he say I must be mistaken, for his door was fastened - I do not think the prisoner was searched at all; I saw him taken - there is a shop between Grant's and the empty house; Dean was the sergeant of the section - he was not in the watch-house that night to my knowledge; he might come in without my seeing him - page searched the prisoner, but not in my presence.</p>
               <p>MR. GRANT. The haberdasher's shop is divided off from mine, and let to another tenant, who secures his shop inside, and comes through my shop to go out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is there a door from their shop to yours? A. There is; I tried that door after this happened, and it was locked I am sure - I saw the person lock it.</p>

            . I am a labourer. I was going through St. Martin's-court, and heard a cry of Murder! proceeding from Grant's house - I told the Police-man, who was close behind me; he came up and put his foot against Grant's door, and in the mean time I saw a man run out of the next door, or the next door but one, I cannot say which; as the haberdasher's and the other door are close together - Clark the Police-man directly ran after him; I followed him, and saw a man drop a hat in the broad part of St. Martin's-court; I picked it up, and kept it till I got to the watch-house - I stopped in the court till Clark brought the prisoner back; I marked the hat, and delivered it over to Bates.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not see the prisoner come out of Grant's house? A. No; I was in the shop when the prisoner and Clark were there - I have no recollection of Mr. Grant saying it was impossible he could have come out of his door, for it was fast; we were all sober - I was going to Covent-garden-market; I am sure the Policeman was trying with his foot to get in at Grant's door, and not at the haberdasher's.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not examine the prisoner's shoes at the watch-house? A. Yes; I saw the mark of the heel of a shoe in some mortar in the adjoining house - his shoes did not fit or agree with that mark; I did not examine the empty house that night - I was not called in till between four and five o'clock.</p>

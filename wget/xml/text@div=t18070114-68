               <p>Q. You deal with Mr. Smart the baker. - A. Yes, I am in the habit of paying for my bread on delivery, except the prisoner could not give change, then I paid the next day. On the 12th of December, Mr. Smart sent a bill of fourteen shillings and three pence farthing, which I was very much surprised at, knowing that I did not owe for a single loaf; I am sure that I paid him for every loaf of bread that he delivered.</p>

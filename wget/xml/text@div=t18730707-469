On the evening of Whit Monday, about 10. 30, I was on duty in Newton Terrace, Westbourne Grove—I heard a noise and a shout from people, and on looking round I saw a Hansom cab coming at a very furious rate, and several persons running—the cab was about five or six yards from me when it passed me—the driver was whip<lb></lb>ping the horse when he passed me—it was going at about twelve or fourteen miles an hour, galloping, coming from London and going towards Bayswater—the accident had occurred about ten or twelve yards before he got to me—I had been standing there for about ten minutes—I had not seen any other cab pass just about that time—I ran after the cab and halloaed, and asked him to stop—I came up to him at the corner of Rich<lb></lb>mond Road, where he was stopped—I told him he had run over some one in Westbourne Grove—he said "I don't know whether I have or not"—it was the prisoner—he was drunk.</p>

               <p>when he passed me—there is a cab rank above there, about 20 or 30 yards from where he was stopped—I say the prisoner was drunk, because he could not stand upright when he got down from the cab—he could not stand still—that is my reason; I have no other reason—I did not hear him ask a gentleman for his card—I was present at the inquest; the Jury returned a verdict of "Accidental Death."</p>

On the evening of Whit Monday, I was on duty at the bottom of Norfolk Terrace, Westbourne Grove, at a special point—I had been there about half an hour previous to this, and hearing a great noise down Westbourne Grove, I looked that way, and saw a Hansom cab coming at a most terrific rate, galloping up Westbourne Grove, towards me—I rushed across the road—there are about three or four lamps at that point, and as the driver saw me coming across, he pulled the horse and cab up Richmond Road—that slackened the pace of the horse, and I rushed forward and caught hold of it as he turned; at the same time three or four men jumped on to the cab to help me stop it—when it was stopped a lady and gentleman got out of the cab—they seemed very excited—I told the cabman to get down, he got down directly and came to the near side of his fare on the pavement, and said "Will you please give me your name and address, Mr. Cuff"—Mr. Cuff then helped the lady out, and said "I shall pay you your fare, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I shall have no more to do with you"—the prisoner said "Mr. Cuff, will you give me your name and address, I have got into some trouble, and I hope you will help me out of it"—Mr. Cuff said "I shall do nothing of the kind, I shall pay you your fare, and if the police want my name and address they shall have it," and he gave it to the last witness, at the same time remarking to the driver "Whatever punishment you get you richly deserve, even if it is six months'; it is a mercy that me and my wife were not dashed to pieces, as the cabman almost dashed into a carriage in Oxford Street, near Great Portland Street; we were coming at a terrific rate and almost came into a carriage, and also into an omnibus in Westbourne Grove"—the prisoner was under the influence of liquor at the time—a gentleman came up and said "That is the cabman who has knocked down a man and a child in Westbourne Grove, I have put them in a four-wheeled cab and sent them to the hospital"—I Said to the prisoner "You hear what that gentleman says?"—he said "Yes"—I said "I shall have to take you to Paddington Police Station, and charge you"—which I did—I charged him with being drunk, furiously driving, and also knocking down two persons in Westbourne Grove and running over them—he replied "I lost all control over the horse"—I took the number of the cab; it was 2, 591.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cab driver, I drive my own cab and two horses—I live at 10, Colville Mews, and have done for ten years—I did not know this horse till yesterday; I saw him out yesterday in Princes Street, a lady got out of the Hansom through the horse kicking, she was very much frightened, and I took her in my Hansom to the Burlington Arcade, and the man walked along with the horse there.</p>

                  </hi>. I know this horse that went out with the prisoner on Whit Monday, I was working for Mr. Simmonds at the time—the first time that Brown brought him home it broke the shafts; that was two or three days after Whit Monday—after the accident it was turned out into the grass field—I took it out on 17th June, and it was brought up the day before yesterday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cab driver and live an 13A, Belgrave Road, Notting Hill—on Whit Monday I was on the Richmond Road rank—I saw the prisoner driving a cab; as he passed me he was pulling his horse as hard as he could; it was going about four or five miles an hour, he checked it at the corner, as it was going round the corner; he was not whipping it, the whip was in the socket.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw him coming just about fifty yards from the corner, he stopped just as he turned round the corner—the number of my badge is 2, 413.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). I did not see the horse whipped—I did not see a whip used just prior to the accident—I did not see him whip the horse at all—I did not notice the man being in liquor when I was agreeing for the fare, if I had I certainly should not have engaged him, having my mother</p>

               <p>and my little boy with me; the man was on the box, he did not appear to me to be intoxicated—I really should not have noticed if he had whipped the horse, because my mother was so frightened that I had great trouble to keep her in the cab—I did not notice what the man was doing—I know that he was going at a most tremendous rate—I could hot say whether the whip was used at the time the horse kicked, I do not remember seeing him whip the horse—we were going at a tremendous pace just prior to the accident, the man must have had a tight rein at the rate which the horse was going, or I should imagine the horse would have been down—it was both trotting and galloping, sometimes trotting and sometimes galloping—I have no reason to doubt that the man was sober, as I say I thought he was or I certainly should not have engaged him—it appeared to me that he lost control over the horse in Westbourne Grove—when I got out of the cab I said that if he were punished he would deserve it, even if he had six months', at least I might have said so; perhaps I said it out of fright, because I was frightened; I hardly know what I said at the time.</p>

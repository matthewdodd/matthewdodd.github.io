               <p>You are wife to the last witness? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Give the Jury an account of what happened in your shop concerning these two men? - About the 20th of September last, these two gentlemen came into our shop, and they asked me, if the gentleman was within, I said no, and the tall one said I am sorry for it; I said is it any thing very particular; he said no, he wanted some glass; I told him, if agreeable, I could serve him; he said very well, they told me they wanted some fashionable punch glasses, I shewed them some low ones, and they said they wished to have the others; then they told me to reach some decanters, we agreed for the price of both, then they asked me for some large goblets, I reached them some and they agreed for them; then the young one said, that is not the business we came for, he asked me if I had any plated tea-spoons; I said yes, they said their servants were neglectful when they carried six-penny-worth of brandy and water, or rum and water into the coffee-room, they seldom got their spoons back again; I looked them out some, and they measured them, for they said it is so offensive to a gentleman when a spoon<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200025"></xptr> slips in; the young one said, there is a pencil case you said you wanted; with that I went behind the compter, for they made me reach down the highest things I had in my shop, and I drew out out a glass containing various goods; he asked me the price, I told him seven shillings and sixpence; he said he would give seven shillings provided the screw was good, he asked me if I had a pencil, I told him no, he desired me to send for one, he said he had no sixpence, I sent for one, and it was put into one of the glasses amongst the rest of the goods, then he pulled out a silk handkerchief and wiped his face: I had a great suspicion of them from their first coming in, when he took up the handkerchief I saw a bit of a vacancy in the case, but not knowing how my spouse had placed the things I could not be certain, Mr. Artz looked me very hard in the face, and he said, Madam, here is a little box that was taken from that place; I said, Sir, I ask your pardon, I was not looking at that; he then desired me to reach down a pair of mandarin figures, I would not reach both because I thought I saw a hand near my glass, I said to my little boy, in Hebrew, my dear, take care, for I am frightened to death: I can tell no other particulars, no further than I could not positively tell what had been in the shew-glasses, had I laid it out myself I could; I asked them for their direction, they gave it me, they told me it was Vintineer's-hotel, Carlisle-street; I told the child to run to the door and see which way they went, and he run, and they were out of sight; immediately I took out the drawers and looked them over, I could not tell what was lost: the tall gentleman says to me, come this way I want to look at some basons, I went from behind my compter to the further end of my shop, I got upon the stool and I reached some basons, and while I reached them, the sash on this side I heard move, I turned shortly, and that gentleman stood close to the sash, there hung four watches, I immediately missed a watch, I

             the sash close again, I said to my little boy I certainly do miss a watch, when my husband came in, I said to him look over the drawer, and at the sash, I am afraid I have been robbed, he immediately missed a watch, a diamond ring, two gold seals, and a great many more things that were not brought up to the Justices; it was a watch with a silver face, and two picture rings I think. I set every thing down of the clothes they had on, even the different watches they had in their pockets, one had a plain watch, and the other had a gadrooned watch, I saw their watches, they took them out, and said one to the other, come Sir, it is time to go home to dress: after I gave the description they were immediately taken.</p>
               <p>Were they then brought back in your presence? - No Sir, they were not, I saw them at the Justices.</p>
               <p>Were they searched at the Justice's? - I saw them at the public-house opposite.</p>
               <p>Were they searched there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was any thing found upon them belonging to you? - I was not present.</p>
               <p>Court. What day was this? - About the 20th of September.</p>
               <p>They began by asking for your husband, did they not, Madam? - Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>What was the first thing they asked to buy? - The first thing was some punch glasses.</p>
               <p>Did they buy any thing? - They bought some, but I was not paid for any one thing.</p>
               <p>Did they take them away with them? - No, I was to send them home at four o'clock.</p>
               <p>How many punch glasses did they buy? - Six.</p>
               <p>Which of them bought the six? - Mr. Artz.</p>
               <p>Which of the two is that; - The tall one.</p>
               <p>Then one said to the other, that is not what he wanted? - Not immediately.</p>
               <p>What did they do next? - They bought more things.</p>
               <p>What things? - Decanters and goblets.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200026"></xptr>Which of them bought the decanters? Mr. Artz, they bought two pair of goblets, then they asked for some plated spoons.</p>
               <p>Was it Artz that asked for all these things? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did the other do all this time, did he do any thing himself, or only appear in company with Artz? - He seemed in company with Artz; he said, he had bought half a dozen knives and forks, and they did not prove to his satisfaction.</p>
               <p>Then you understood by the things that they bought, that Artz kept a coffee-house? - At first I did, but when they asked for so many things, and hauled the things over; I was affraid.</p>
               <p>What was the next thing asked for, after the spoons? - A silver pencil case.</p>
               <p>Was any of them bought? - Yes, one at seven shillings, they then asked to look at a pair of China mandarins.</p>
               <p>They then sent you to pull out another drawer? - Yes, the drawer where the pencil cases were.</p>
               <p>Was that drawer near you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When was it that you heard the glass move? - At last of all.</p>
               <p>Did Artz buy any thing? - Yes, the two mandarins, at twenty five shillings.</p>
               <p>What was you doing when you fancied the sash opened? - I was reaching down some blue and white pint basons.</p>
               <p>What was it struck you then? - The other Gentleman then advanced towards the sash, and I having a pile of basons in my hand, I could not turn to look, but I heard the sash move.</p>
               <p>By the other Gentleman, you mean Gore? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You shut the sash? - I shut the sash afterwards.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was opened by one of them? - I heard it open, it goes upon castors.</p>
               <p>Was it shut before Gore went towards it or open? - It was shut before.</p>
               <p>What was it you thought at that time about the watches? - I could not tell what; it was a front sash with various goods, I could not tell till Mr. Hart came home.</p>
               <p>Where were the rings? - In the drawer I drew out of the shew glass, where the pencil cases were; the spoons I fetched from the drawer.</p>
               <p>You described one of the men rubbing his face with a handkerchief, repeat that again? - Mr. Artz took out his handkerchief and put it upon the glass, and then took it off again, and I saw a vacancy; Mr. Artz then looked very hard in my face, and said, Madam, here is a box that came out of that place, I said, I ask your pardon, Sir, I was not looking at that; I was very much confused.</p>
               <p>They took nothing away nor paid for any thing? No, Sir, only left me this direction.</p>
               <p>What is the direction? - Vintineer's Hotel, Carlisle-street, I said you have not put the number of your house, he said there is no occasion for any number, it is the only hotel in the street.</p>
               <p>Were the things to be sent to them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Hand up the direction, how do you read it? - I never read it at all, I gave it to my husband, I think he called it Vintineer's hotel.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sheppard, Council for the prisoner Artz. What age is your little boy? - Between eight and nine.</p>
               <p>A clever boy? - He is kept to school.</p>
               <p>When Mr. Hart is at home, he serves, I take it for granted? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had he been out the whole of the day? - He went out about eleven.</p>
               <p>What time might this be? - About one.</p>
               <p>Upon your moving a chain, I think, in one of the drawers, Artz said to you, that something had been removed from there, a box? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You told him you were not looking at that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>They continued in the shop a long time after that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you went to the sash and restored it to its place, you missed a watch? - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200027"></xptr> thought so at that time, I could not tell rightly.</p>
               <p>You told the child so? - I did.</p>
               <p>How long after they were gone did Mr. Hart return? - I believe, to the best of my knowledge, about half an hour.</p>
               <p>You did not say anything to the prisoners? - By no means, not if I had missed all the goods.</p>
               <p>If you had laid out all the goods in the drawers yourself you would not have been able to have stated what you had missed? - Not in that confusion.</p>
               <p>Consequently as you had not laid it out you are less able to say what was missing? - Therefore I left it to Mr. Hart.</p>
               <p>Therefore you know only from the information of Mr. Hart? - Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Had you at that time any servant? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner Gore's Council, You have had the misfortune to be robbed before? - Yes, indeed I have, more to my sorrow.</p>
               <p>Very lately too? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Of some things of value which you could exactly ascertain? - I cannot particularly state them all.</p>
               <p>Then as far as your knowledge goes, whether those things that you have since found, were taken at the time that the prisoners were there, or not, you cannot say? - I am well convinced, the diamond ring I had in my hand on the Sunday morning, this was on the Monday morning; there was but one diamond ring.</p>
               <p>As you missed the watch immediately upon going to the place, you did not apply to a constable, or any of your neighbours? - No Sir, I did not, because I was not positive.</p>
               <p>They hung in the sash by a hook? - I believe they are hung upon the pevot.</p>
               <p>Will you venture to swear that they were not hung upon a wire? be a little cautious where mens lives are concerned? - I do not come to the court to take away mens lives, sometimes they are hung by the pendant or the wire, sometimes by the pevot, and sometimes by a string.</p>
               <p>What is the practice of your shop? - There are hooks stuck in.</p>
               <p>As your's is a cabinet of curiosities, it is necessary for Mr. Hart to be very often at sales to pick up those things? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have the conducting of his business? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When he came home you did not tell him you had missed a watch, but that you suspected you had been robbed generally? - Yes, I desired him to look into the sash and the drawer, and he missed them immediately.</p>
               <p>You told Mr. Hart you believed you had been robbed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How does that square with your missing a watch the moment you went to the sash? - I am sure of it, I saw the vacancy; I would not wish to say more than I know, I would sooner shew lenity.</p>
               <p>Court to Hyam Hart. When you came back, your wife says she desired you to look? - Yes, upon which I drew out a drawer of the shew-glass that goes out into the street, I opened that drawer and missed a diamond ring, next I missed two gold enamelled rings, and several other things that I could not describe, and I omitted them in the indictment; next there was a watch that I missed, my watches hang on little hooks.</p>
               <p>Upon what she told you, you went to the Magistrate? - No, I first went up to seek for the hotel, as they left the direction; I found there was no such hotel in Carlisle-street.</p>
               <p>Did you find them by that direction? - No, I afterwards gave the description to Mr. Jealous, and I told him the particulars of the things that I had lost, upon which he and several more went and fetched these men in the course of half an hour, with my property upon them, and likewise my shop-mark in the pocket of one of them: Jealous came down to me and said, should you know your ring; I said, it is a yellow rose diamond ring, with three roses at the top, it was marked two pounds twelve shillings<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200028"></xptr> and sixpence; says he, I have got your shop-mark likewise in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sheppard. This drawer you say goes out into the street? - It opens on the counter, and rests upon the counter.</p>
               <p>Do you yourself take every thing out of that dr awer of a night and replace it in a morning? - If it is anything of value we do, but not every individual article.</p>
               <p>Can you take upon yourself to say you remember every article? - That would be a very great hardship for me to undertake, but if there were five hundred different articles, I could tell that that article was in the drawer very particularly.</p>
               <p>Are there not other articles of equal value? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then how can you particularly tell that? - A man must know within himself, I cannot describe the nature how I should know, but I know I put it in that very morning.</p>
               <p>But how comes it that you can particularly pick out that article? - All the articles I take out over night, I replace in the next morning.</p>
               <p>And there were many articles you did not take out over night? - Small articles we particularly take out.</p>
               <p>You have told us that you did not take out all the articles over night? - If it is a large article, perhaps I may not, but small articles in general I take out.</p>
               <p>There were a great many other watches in this glass, I suppose, of course, besides the one that you missed? - There were.</p>
               <p>Do you take out the watches? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Of course you do not take an account of your stock every morning? - I look to see whether the things hang right.</p>
               <p>Do you count your watches every morning? - I can tell by the hooks, there are four hooks to every pane of glass, and if one is missing, it soon makes a hole.</p>
               <p>Is it not possible, that in dusting your shop window, one article might be missing without being seen? - No, Sir, it is impossible, one watch being missing may make a great vacancy, and every watch has got this mark to it, a large piece of paper, which makes a man more particular.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Is there any mark on the ring itself? - It is a yellow rose ring, and a remarkable fine yellow rose it is, I do not think I ever saw one to fellow it.</p>
               <p>Do you think there is no fellow to it? - I cannot say, such a thing may be possible, I cannot deny that; but it is impossible for my shop-mark to be fellowed.</p>
               <p>There is one hotel in Carlisle-street? - No, Sir, not that I could learn, there is one Mr. Angelo's, it is a kind of subscription-room.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say that there is no house in Carlisle-street that is called an hotel? - Do you mean a house of ill fame.</p>
               <p>There are a good many of them, are not there? - How can I answer that, am I obliged to know every house? I enquired, and received for answer of several housekeepers, that there is no hotel in the street.</p>
               <p>Are there no houses of public reception, called Taverns, in that street? - I never was in one, that is all I can say.</p>
               <p>Are there not more houses than one that they call taverns in Carlisle-street? - There are several public houses.</p>
               <p>You remember taking this ring out the night before, when you shut up shop? - I remember it particularly well, I saw it on Monday morning, I had it on my finger on Saturday and Sunday, that very ring, but I assure you, Sir, it will be as much satisfaction to me, if the honourable Court should find the prisoners not guilty, and more, than if they find them guilty; I have children of my own: all that I do in coming here, is to satisfy the laws of my country.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the making an appointment with anybody about the settling of this business? - I do not recollect my making any appointment, but I recollect people coming to me.</p>
               <p>You have been robbed very frequently lately, have not you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you lost any diamond rings before this robbery? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>You cannot tell what things you lost of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200029"></xptr> those former robberies? - Yes, I can, I keep a book.</p>
               <p>Pray what fort of diamond ring is this that is the value of two guineas and a half? - It is the value of it, I gave forty shillings for it.</p>

               <p>A very fine rose diamond ring! - I say a yellow diamond ring, I never saw one of the colour, it is a fine bright yellow rose, it is as elegant as the first water white by being a fine yellow: Jealous has had it in his possession ever since.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>About three o'clock in the afternoon the prosecutor came to me, and said his shop had been robbed by two young men in drab coloured coats; I think to the best of my knowledge that he mentioned whips in their hands, I suspected who they were; I went with an officer into Crown-court, Bow-street, I cannot say the number of the house, I went up one pair of stairs, and saw the prisoner Artz in the room, he had no great coat on, his great coat was hanging up on a door that led to a back room, I then searched him, and I found a ring upon his finger, and in his pocket a little bit of paper, which has wrote upon it,</p>
               <p>"a diamond ring, 2 l. 12 s. 6 d." I then looked round the room, and under the grate in the fore room, I found this diamond ring, I found a pair of knee buckles; I found nothing else.</p>
               <p>Did you go any farther? - The other officer searched the other prisoner, he was up two pair of stairs in the same house, the other officer went up to him, his name is Dixon.</p>
               <p>Did you acquaint the prosecutor what you had found? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you ask him what the mark of his ring was? - No, I did not, he said he had lost a diamond ring and two other rings.</p>
               <p>Did you enquire what the mark was? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>(The ring deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are my property.</p>
               <p>Look at that piece of paper? - That is my hand writing, that is my shop mark, the ring was stuck down in it.</p>
               <p>Court. The description is a very general one; what led you to this house in Crown-court? - It was a suspicion that arose between me and my fellow servant who they might be.</p>
               <p>That description was enough to lead you to the house in Crown-court, where you believed they were? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Crown-court, I believe, is a place inhabited very much by women of a certain description? - It is.</p>

               <p>PRISONER ARTZ's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I am by business a pawnbroker and dealer in goods, I am well known by every man in the business to purchase things at sales; I am known by very many: I am apprehensive that these things had been purchased by me the day before; I had upwards of thirty-five watches and other things, the property of a gentleman at Portsmouth, I live at Wandsworth, and if they had been produced he would have sworn to them, I make no doubt; I have subpoened him: I have had five or six different Jews, who came to me and offered to make it up, first proposing a hundred pounds, and then forty; I am informed the things are the property of one Judah Levy, who keeps several of these shops. He has several times offered to make up the affair; I know myself innocent of the matter, I do not know these things are Mr. Hart's property:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200030"></xptr> I submit myself to the mercy of the Gentlemen of the Jury; I am conscious of my own innocence.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Artz called four witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Gore. I leave my case entirely to my Council.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Gore called five witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>

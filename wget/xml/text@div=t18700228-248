The envelope was addressed, but I did not read it. I took the letter to Thomas Lowe, Plumber's Place, Rosoman Street"—he was asked why he took it there, and he made no answer—he was then taken to Bow Lane station, and charged—I asked him whether he was in Aldersgate Street on the 24th, and he said he was not—he was placed with eight or nine others, and Sharpe picked him out—I knew where Redford lived; I had been watching his house—he was not there during the time I was watching it.</p>

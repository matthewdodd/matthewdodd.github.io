I keep a butcher's shop in Tower-street, the corner of Black-swan-court: On the 4th of February I heard a cry of stop thief, about half past seven in the evening; I pursued the prisoner at the bar; he was walking when he passed me, but the poor woman that gave the alarm, said, that was the man; she desired me to lay hold of him; I laid hold of him, and he ran from me; I pursued after him, and caught him by the corner of Water-lane, which is opposite Mark-lane, about a hundred yards from Mr. Jewson's house; I never lost sight of him at all, from the time that she said that was the man; when I first saw him he had two bundles in his hand; he threw them away from him after I laid hold of him; he then got away from me, and I followed him again, and caught him; it was a moonlight night; I never lost sight of him; the constable has got the bundles.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have been in the habit of apprehending many persons, and bringing them to justice in this Court; I was coming by this court, and heard the cry of stop thief; I saw a man come out of the court as fast as possible, and throw the bundle down; I caught hold of the bundle to secure it, and followed after him; the butcher who is in Court laid hold of me; I told him I was pursuing the man, and he let me go; I pursued the man, and Stephens then came up again, and knocked the bundle out of my hand; they took me back; I was searched by the constable; I had nothing about me but this handkerchief.</p>

               <p>GEO. PINCHES sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a boot and shoe-maker: I never saw the prisoner before he was taken up; I was in Tower-street when he was stopped; I went to Mr. Palmer's, to carry a pair of shoes home; I was going past a court where there was a butcher's shop at the corner; I saw a man run out of the court, and I heard a voice crying stop thief; the man that ran out of the court threw the bundle down; then I saw the prisoner pick up the bundle, and the man that threw the bundle down went across the road, and down Water-lane; a butcher stopped him at the end of the court, with the bundle, and let him loose again; then he went after him again, and he would have caught the man that dropped the bundle if the butcher had let him alone; the butcher said he would be d-'d if he would not give him a night's lodging in the Compter; I told him it was the wrong man, but he would not hear any reason.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Where does Mr. Palmer live? - A. No. 21, Great George-street, Brick-lane; I live in White-court, Spitalfields; I was going into the Borough afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened to bring you into Tower-street? - A. I was going with Palmer into the Borough.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has he been a customer of your's? - A. I never made him but one pair of shoes; he is a watch-maker; he asked me if I would take a walk with him into the Borough; I told him I was going to Mint-street myself.</p>
               <p>Q. The invitation came from Palmer to you then? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever take a walk with Palmer before that night? - A.Never; we had been in company before.</p>
               <p>Q. You went next day before the Magistrate? - A. No; the business was over before I could get there, or else I would have done the man the service to speak the truth, that I have spoke now.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the evening was it? - A.Nearer seven than six, to the best of my judgment.</p>

               <p>Q. Were there a great number of people when the man ran away? - A. He was too light-heeled for that.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to go in pursuit? - A. I was not very well in health that night.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a watch-maker, No. 21, Great George-street, Brick-lane, Spitalfields: I was in Tower-street when the prisoner was apprehended; Pinches was with me; he brought me home a pair of shoes; I mentioned that I had some business to do over the water in the King's Bench; he said he had some business over in the Borough, and if it was agreeable to me he would accompany me; as we came through Tower-street a man ran across the way from the court; to the best of my recollection the prisoner at the bar was coming the contrary way; he picked up the bundle and put it under his arm, and he turned short upon his heel and was directly laid hold of; the man let him go again, and he pursued after the man; that was a man considerably taller than the prisoner; and then the prisoner was stopped again; there were several people in Tower-street; the man that ran away went down Water-street; I told the people he was the wrong man, but I might as well have talked to a parcel of mad bulls; I heard somebody talk about giving him a night's lodging in the Compter, and I went to the Compter and made some enquiries, and left my address, and likewise Pinches's address.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Did you ever walk with your shoe-maker before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever walk into the Borough with him before? - A. Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Q. How often? - A.Never above three times; I have walked with him several times to the Plough in Fore-street, down from my own house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known him? - A. About six or seven months.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately may he have made any shoes for you? - A. I suppose within these three months.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pair has he ever made? - A. I believe two pair, and has mended several pair.</p>
               <p>Q. He has not delivered you any shoes later than three months? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it before Christmas? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. He has not delivered you any this year? - A. It may be on this side Christmas, I cannot pretend to say.</p>
               <p>Q. It is three months, however, since he delivered you any shoes? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were going to the King's Bench? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Pinches going? - A. I do not know; he came to bring me a new pair of shoes that night.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that three months ago? - A. It was on the 4th of February.</p>
               <p>Q.Neither you nor Pinches ran after the man? - A. No.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called eight other witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

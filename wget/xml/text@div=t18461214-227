                  </hi>. I keep the Red Horse public-house, in Old Bond-street; the prisoner has lived in my service since the 31st of Aug. On Monday, the 25th of Nov., from what had been intimated to me, I went into her bed-room—I found her coming out of the room door with a bottle of port wine—I asked how she got it—she said she had had it some time—I opened the top drawer in the bureau, and found a stone bottle of gin, which she said her uncle gave her—I said, "I must search your boxes"—she begged noe not to do so—I called my lad to fetch a policeman, and we searched, and found coffee, sugar, and cigars in her box, in which the apron was found—the</p>

               <p>bed was in a very confused state—I turned down the bed, and between the bed and mattress we found seven bottles of port, nine of brandy, a stone bottle containing rum, three bottles of gin, and some whisky—I have ex<lb></lb>amined all those bottles, and, to the best of my belief, they are mine—the bottle of port wine I could positively swear was mine—the brandy corre<lb></lb>sponds with a quantity that was missed from eighteen gallons that was in my cellar—the rum and gin I believe to be mine, and the cigars—this table-cloth is mine—this was found in her box, and one of my glass-cloths, which has got the mark on it—she had no business with any of them.</p>

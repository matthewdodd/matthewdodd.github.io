            . I am an officer to the Sheriff of Kent, and live at Maidstone. On Monday, the 25th of April, I saw the prisoner - his conduct excited my suspicion; he came into the Three Tuns, at Kingston - he was rather tipsy, and went to bed: after he was gone to bed, in consequence of suspicion, I went into his bed-room, and searched his-clothes, in the presence of the landlord, and found four sovereigns and a half in his waistcoat pocket, and 17s. in his trousers pocket, 4d. in copper, and an old pocket-book, containing bills and receipts, with Mr. Dison's name - I wrote to him that evening by post, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120013"></xptr>the following morning, when the prisoner awoke, he asked why I had taken his clothes; I told him I bad done it from suspicions circumstances which I had observed, and that I had written to Mr. Dison; he said, "Then I am overtaken at last;" he was about to make a statement to me - I said he had better not; he said, "No, my mind will be the freer for it;" he said he knew when Mr. Dison went to tea, that he went to the shop under pretence of writing a letter - he saw the shopman engaged in serving a lady, that he drew out the till, and took out a 10l. Bank post-bill a 10l. and a 5l. Bank note, and four sovereigns - he then went to the Borough, bought a coat, which he had on, went to Maidstone, and then further, where I took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not appear in very great distress of mind? A. Yes - he said he had robbed one of the best of masters, and was very sorry for it; he did not appear distressed the night before, but in the morning - I never saw a young man show more contrition; I obtained the Bank post-bill from the banker, and asked him if the one he had paid to Cole was the same he had taken from his master - he said it was.</p>
               <p>MR. DISON. This is the Bank post-bill which I lost from my till - it has my hand-writing on it; the house is my dwelling-house, and is in the parish of St. James'.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - having been informed that by pleading not guilty, any extenuating circumstance which might palliate my crime, would be urged, and give me the advantage of witnesses of character, are the sole reasons which, after the confession I had made, induced me to stand my trial; the unhappy man who stands before you, though respectably educated my brought up, has, unfortunately, not a single relation to stretch out a hand to assist him in the season of adversity and distress: previous to the time in question I have frequently been compelled to walk the streets of London for want of a bed, and the means of procuring one - the constable, not willingly, I believe, but by mistake, has stated that I said I went into Mr. Dison's shop under the pretence of writing a letter - I said, "For the purpose of doing so."</p>
               <p>Three witnesses gave the prisoner an irreproachable character.</p>

The prisoner worked for us about three months - we received information, and one evening, when he was about to leave work, I taxed him with having oil about him; he denied it - I said, "Yes you have a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140116"></xptr>bottle of oil in your jacket pocket" - he said, "Yes, I have Sir - I took a little to oil my hair;" there was about a gill of it - I got an officer, and on searching his lodging, about 2lbs. of spermaceti was found - I believe it is ours; the value of the oil is about two-pence.</p>

            . I am foreman to Messrs. Barclays. The prisoner had been at work three or four months; in consequence of a former robbery, I searched the pockets of the work people - I found the prisoner's pocket very oily, and told Mr. Barclay; I know the spermaceti; here is a piece of a lump I can swear to.</p>

            . I took the prisoner and went to his lodgings; I found the spermacetti, and asked what it was - he called it skimmings; he told me voluntarily that it came from Mr. Barclay's, but said the foreman gave it to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It was given by the foreman, for the men to wash their dirty aprons in; I asked the man who worked in the cellar for a drop of oil to kill a few bugs- he said "Take a drop, but don't say any thing about it."</p>

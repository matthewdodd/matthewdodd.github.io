               <p>Upon Friday the 18th of last month I was stopped about a quarter after six, by the highwaymen, within about twenty yards from <placeName id="t17820220-28-crimeloc142">Acton-lane</placeName>

It was neither light nor dark, he had something over his face; I cannot speak certainly to him, I lost my watch and two guineas, and some silver.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Watson, I was driving the chaise at the time of the robbery; about one hundred yards against Acton-lane Inn two highwaymen came up to the carriage, they parted, and one went on one side, the other the other; they turned back, and one came to me, and ordered me to stop, this came and dashed the pistol through the glass and demanded him rings and pocket-book; and said he would have all; it was the same voice and sized person; his face was covered; I can not say with absolute certainty he is the man.</p>
               <p>You cannot positively swear he is the man? - No; only by his voice and size I believe it.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a porter in the service of Messrs. Henry Waithman and another, of Gresham-street—they have a warehouse on the ground floor and on the basement—on Saturday afternoon, 8th June, I left about 3 o'clock, and locked the outer door—there are safes in the lower warehouse, where property is kept—I then went to Alderman's-walk, Bishopsgate, and purchased a book—I then went back to the office to get an envelope to send it in—I found the key go very stiff, and had to kick the door to make it open—there was a kind of stiffness in the lock which was not there before—on opening the outer door I observed a parcel lying on a hale of goods in the counting-house leading to the warehouse—I thought it was not there when I went out, and unfastened the side of it—it was what I supposed to be the tops of new boots—I knew it did not belong to anybody in our place—it was afterwards found to contain some large black sheets of oil-cloth, three leather straps, and some string—I heard footsteps, and retired backwards till I came in view of the private room, and there were the two prisoners in a stooping position—I walked up to them, and asked what business they had there; they said, "We saw the door open, and we walked in"—I said, "Then you had better stop in, for I shall lock the door"—I retired backwards towards the inner door, and on opening it, Williams led the way down to the basement warehouse—I thought he had been there before, seeing the way he went down; so I went and gave the alarm, fearing that the area door had been opened, to secure the front—I got assistance, returned to the office, and saw them come up from below, finding that they could not escape—I then walked round to the inner room and turned the key.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did they do coming from the basement? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They rushed to the private door—there was a key inside that door; they turned that to open the door, and escaped into the passage, when I secured them both; but McGuire got away from me, and Chaplin and Homes man being in the passage I told him to secure him—they were afterwards given into the custody of the police, who came up—I was present when the policeman discovered the keys and the parcel—I am sure they are the two men.</p>

               <p>when you left? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I locked the outer door leading when I left, the door to the passage—an iron gate leads into the area in Old Broad-street—the door leading to Old Broad-street was left open—no one could get into the office that way—that is the door into the corridor; it is a free passage; hundreds go through that way—they cannot get access into the premises that way unless they have keys—the door I locked is the only door into the premises—the windows were closed—I did not close them—there are bars before them inside, and the shutters are iron-bound; nobody could get in—I do not know whether the other clerks have a key to the place—there are six clerks; one of them is here—I was away about half an hour—I will swear it was not an hour.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Tell me the situation of Waithman's. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is an outer door that is locked in the evening at 6 or 7 o'clock, that leads into a small passage which leads into Waithman's office—it is in Broad-street, on the right-hand side coming down from the Royal Exchange—the entrance is in Gresham-house, the first passage to the right—there is no other entrance—the corridor is the centre passage of Gresham-house, which leads from Bishopsgate-street to Old Broad-street—the entrance door of the office is in that corridor, in the passage to the right—by the outer door I mean the entrance to the office; the inner door is a glass door close to the outer door; in fact, there are double doors to the premises, inner and outer—there is another-door leading to the area, but you cannot enter it from the outside—the area is in front of Old Broad-street, on the basement—the private door leads to Mr. Waithman's private room, into which they went to secrete themselves when they heard the noise—they rushed to the private door, which was locked, turned the key, opened it, and went in—the private door differs from the outer door; one is inside and the other outside; it leads to the passage, and the passage leads to the corridor—it opens into the passage from the inside—when I left I locked the outer door—I did not lock the inner glass door; there is no lock to it—I locked the private door imme-diately before I left; I turned the handle—it could not be left open, because it closes with a spring.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been confidential clerk for fifteen years to Messrs. Waithman—I know the premises well—there is a corridor which leads from Broad-street right through to Bishopsgate-street—there is one entrance to the premises from Broad-street—there is another door on the right-hand side, which leads to offices up stairs and areas on the ground floor—if you come out of the street, there is a door on the right hand side; then go in there, and there is a small hall or warehouse with two doors to it, one</p>

               <p>right and one left—that on the right leads to the counting-house, and the left into Mr. Waithman's private room—the left hand door is secured by a key, which is left inside, and the right hand door leads into the warehouse—I have counterpart keys of the two doors, the one which locks inside and the one which locks outside—when the porter went away the outer door would be open if the parties up stairs had not gone—whenever the porter goes away it is his duty to secure the outer door into the warehouse—these chambers are kept by different merchants, and we have rooms there—there would be two doors to open when the porter came in in the morning; the outer door which secured our premises, and the premises up stairs—if our men came first they would open that door—the porter has the key of the warehouse door—I have also a key of that door; no other clerk has—the keys are left at my private residence, and have been there ever since I first put them there—I have counterpart keys of all the doors, the safe doors and all—I left the offices that day before the porter—I left about half-past 2—some of the other clerks had left then.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Police-inspector.</hi>) I went to Messrs. Waithman's warehouse, and saw the prisoners in custody—I received a skeleton-key from Waller, and also these other four skeleton-keys—this is scarcely to be called a skeleton-key, but it is not an ordinary key—the wards have been removed—I fitted it to the warehouse-door—it locked and unlocked it—I tried the other keys to the safes and they fitted them—on the box of the lock of the door, leading to the counting-house, there was a piece of composition, and there was a very small portion of the same composition on the key picked up by Mackrell.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>). My name is Charles Alcide Leroy; I am never called Charles. On Saturday, 15th March, I met the prisoner at the end of a street, near the Prince of Wales, in Leicester-square—she took me to a house in the neighbourhood—I had my purse and watch about me—I had my watch safe while I was in the room with her—I looked at the time, and put it back into my pocket—I did not take off any of my clothes—she moved to the foot of the bed, and about a minute after that I missed my watch—no one had been in the room but her and me from the time I saw it safe—on finding it gone, I was in a very great passion, and said I would give her 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to let me have it back—I spoke in French—hearing the noise, some people came to the room, and a policeman was fetched—the prisoner remained till the policeman came—the watch has not been found.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, C</hi> 52.) I was called to 39, Leicester-square, by a servant of the house, and found the prosecutor and prisoner there, just inside the door—the prosecutor gave the prisoner into my charge for stealing his watch—she said she knew nothing about it, she had not seen it, she was taken to the station and searched by the female searcher—nothing was found—I searched the room that was pointed out to me, and found nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose you told the female searcher what the prisoner was charged with? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I then went back to search the room, and returned again.</p>

               <p>at Marlborough-street—while there I saw the prisoner—after she was locked up I saw her pass a watch, which she took from some part of her person, to a female outside the bar, and she said, "Go to Berwick-street with it"—the watch was very thin—I cannot say whether it was gold or silver—it was about half-past two o'clock.</p>

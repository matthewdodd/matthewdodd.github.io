               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How did you become certain it was bad? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I beard a woman call him a <hi rend="italic">smasher</hi>—I do not know her name—I saw her go by the shop—they had fallen out about some meat, which she came to buy, and she called him a b—y <hi rend="italic">smasher</hi>—I had never seen her before, to my recollection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you saw this coin, between three and four months ago, did you ask the prisoner any thing about them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I saw them first in a cellar opposite, in a box, and then I saw them in the mouth of an oven, where he baked his cakes—these are not one-third of what I first saw—he brought them from the cellar opposite in hie apron—I did not tell him I had seen them—I did not think it was my business—he brought them from the opposite cellar in his blue apron, to the mouth of the oven—I did not speak to him about it—I did not know whether it was bad or good—I do not know whether an oven is a usual place to keep such things in—the prisoner did not discharge me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean he did not discharge you for theft, and tell you so? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I left of my own accord—I did not ask the prisoner, to give me a character—I did not send my wife to him—I left because I was sent into the cellar to get some coals and soda-water—I took the coals and the soda-water into the parlour—I put the coals on the fire, and my mistress said that was not the place for the soda-water—I then took it into the shop—my mistress sent her daughters and son out to rifle me, to pull me about—I thought it was to search me, to see if I had any thing about me—I should think one daughter is about sixteen—the son is the youngest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now do I rightly undestand you, that you were never charged with theft by any of the family? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> "Charged;" never discharged.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you ever accused, or taxed, or charged, by any member of that family, with stealing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was omce a piece of meat lost—I was asked whether I knew any thing at all about it, and I said I did not—I was not charged with stealing it—I was not asked whether I stole it, nor told I stole it—I left last Sunday week, which was more than three or four weeks after that—it was two ribs of beef, not the top ribs—the prisoner himself spoke to me about it—Mr. Solomon was present, and, I believe, Mrs. Shannon—I</p>

               <p>was taken into the parlour—it is not very large—I forget whether Mrs. Shan<lb></lb>non was there or not—I believe another woman was there—I do not know who she was—it was a woman who came to buy meat—she was not bargain<lb></lb>ing then, but she had a basket there—it was six or seven weeks after the beef was missed, that Mrs. Shannon sent her daughter and son to rifle me—it was on a Saturday night, and I left the next morning—I did not leave at the time, because Mr. Shannon was not at home—I did not leave when I was charged about the ribs of beef, because I had not another situation, to go to, but I had when I was rifled by the daughter, a situation in Goulston-street—I was never taxed by any member of the family with stealing beef, or any other meat, and was never asked but that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long after you heard the woman call him a smasher, did you give information? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot tell, it might be two or three weeks—I did not go before, because it did not strike me whether it was good money or bad—I suspected it when the woman called him a <hi rend="italic">smasher</hi>, but I did not give information sooner, because I was not <hi rend="italic">right down</hi> certain that the money was bad; but afterwards I was at work in the cellar, sawing wood, and the stool did not stand steady; I found it stood upon a loose stone—I took np the atone to make it stand steady—I saw the apron and the money in it—I looked at it, and the money was cankerish—I had seen bad money before, nailed on counters and tables—I had seen this money first in the cellar opposite—then Mr. Shannon brought it over—then I saw it in the oven, then in a hole in the wall—when I saw it in the mouth of the oven, I had not the curiosity to look at it—it was not loose, it was in the apron—I saw him take it out of the box—he had sent me to that cellar to more some wood—he came over, and said, "What is it o'clock?"—I said "I do not know"—he said, "Go and see"—I went, and as I was coining down, I heard a jinking with this money—he was on his knees, taking it out of the box into his apron—it was loose in the box—I saw him take something out, and I heard the jinking—I did not see it—I saw it in the mouth of the oven, in this apron—I felt it, but did not open it—I never saw such, a heap of money together before—I did not send my wife to the prisoner for a character, nor to beg that I might be taken back.</p>

I went into the shop, the daughter and son came and began to rifle me, and tried to knock my hat off—I said, "What are you at? if you are so full of your play, I am not"—they did not tell me why they did it, but brought a broom out, and poked about me—my hat fell off—Mrs. Shannon came out and picked it up, and said, "John, you may go home"—I went, and that next morning I came to work as usual—I then saw my master, but I thought I would not say any thing to him, till my mistress came down—when the servant came down, I said, "Gillman, I will not stop; I have lived in places where I can have a good character, I will not stop"—about half-past eight o'clock my master told me to go to breakfast—when I came back, my mistress was in the parlour—she began to abuse me—I told her of her sending her daughter and son to search me—she said I was a liar, and told me to go to hell—I told her I would go, and went away—my master was standing in the parlour at the time—I had been paid on the Saturday night before my master went out—I had had no disagreement with my master that Saturday.</p>

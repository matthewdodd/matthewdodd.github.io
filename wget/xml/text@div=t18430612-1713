                  </hi>. I live in Bridge-street, Great George-street, Bermondsey, and am in the employ of Mr. King, of Newgate-street. On the 24th of May, about four o'clock, the prisoner came into Mr. King's shop, with another man—they were both talking as they came in—the prisoner asked to look at some black kerseymere for trowsers—the young man went up stairs, brought some pieces down, which they did not approve of, and asked to look at more—during the young man's second absence the prisoner came to me, and took my attention by looking at some washing satins, while the other man walked round the shop—a box of velvet was thrown down—I went to pick it up, and while doing so the other man went out—we then missed two pieces of velvet from the back of the shop—I was talking to the prisoner by the side, just by the door.</p>

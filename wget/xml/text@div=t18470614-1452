               <p>2, Upper Brook-street, the house of Sir John Burgoyne; it ought to have been brought home to me to be cleaned, but the prisoner took it there after she had done work, to take home of a night—she had no business with the can of milk at that time—I deliver milk there at three o'clock—this was found about half-past six o'clock—the prisoner had done her work, and should have gone home.</p>

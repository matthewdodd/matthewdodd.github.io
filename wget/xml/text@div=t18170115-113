On the 16th of December, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I sent my son into the garden to get some water, it was dark; he called out shut the door, for here is a man; my wife bolted the door; I heard my son outside, begging for his life; I went to the back-door; I heard a man halloo to open the door; he fired a gun, which made a hole through the door; I heard somebody say, go it while your blood is warm; I told my wife, that we should all be murdered; I heard two or three voices outside. My wife then cried out murder; our house stands by itself, there is not another within half a mile of it; they fired a blunderbuss at the window, which knocked the casement right out; I saw one man at the window, he fired a pistol at me, the ball grazed my arm; I ran into the bed-room, which is on the ground floor, and pushed against the door to prevent them firing in, it was wrenched off its hinges with an iron crow, the bed-room door is inside, they must have been in the house to do it; there was one man with a blunderbuss, and another with an iron crow in the front room; I had the poker in my hand; they told me, if I did not give it up, they would blow my brains out; my wife had put our child out of the window, to run for assistance; they were going to tie my hands, but there was an alarm out of doors; I sprung out, the man called out shoot, but they did not fire; I saw my daughter at the top of the field, by the light of the moon; the men had gone out; they did not take any thing with them; the prisoner is the man that shot at me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150052"></xptr>with the pistol; I saw his features as plain as could be, I am positive of it; I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. I work for Mr. Franklin. I was afraid to live in the neighbourhood after this occurred, I have lived at Wilsdon; I saw three men, I struck the prisoner with a poker, when he put the pistol in at the window; I did not complain to the magistrate, at Wilsdon; two persons came to my assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to the magistrate, did you not complain of an assault - A. I was not used to the business. I told the magistrate how I was served, and he issued out a warrant; the shots made a hole in the door, Foy saw it; when I saw my son, his hands were tied, the prisoner was taken up two days after; we found two balls had lodged in a basket of clothes; I saw the prisoner in Queen-square, he was paving. I pointed him out myself.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BARTON. I am the son. On the night of the 16th of December, between seven and eight o'clock, my father sent me out for some water, the pond is about twenty yards from the house; my mother takes in washing. When I got out, the prisoner rushed up to me with a blunderbuss, and said, if you do not open the door, I will shoot you, he presented the blunderbuss at me; I am sure he is the man; it was quite moon-light; he was the only man that I saw then. I called out for my mother to fasten the door; two more men then came up, and spoke in Irish; the prisoner said to them, if they do not open the door, let us shoot him; the prisoner told me to open the door, or he would blow my brains out; I told him it was fast; the prisoner snapped the blunderbuss at me twice, but it did not go off; he then hit me with the but end of it, over my head, I was insensible for some time, when I recovered, I found my hands and legs were tied, and 1s. 41/2d. had been taken out of my pocket. I am positive that the prisoner is one of the men. When they went into the house, they untied my legs and brought me in, but kept my hands bound; they forced the bed room door open with a crow, my mother and father were there; somebody whistled, and they left the house, the neighbours then came to our assistance; I went to the justice the next morning, with my father. I was with my father, when the prisoner was taken in Queen-square, we were both sure of his being the man, and knew him the instant we saw him, it was a very light night.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. I saw the prisoner in Queen-square first, the officer was with us. I did not see my sister come in; I do not know who tied my hands; they began to tie my father's hands; the prisoner struck me with the blunderbuss, and he knocked my eye (here the witness shewed to the Jury a scar over his eye), which still remains. We went to Queen-square, to look for the prisoner, we did not see him the first time. Howard went with us before, he said, that he knew another man who he suspected; I knew nothing about any reward.</p>

            . At the time that this happened, I lived at Wilsdon. I never was with Barton at Hampstead when I heard of the attack, on the next day, I went with Barton to look after a man, whom he suspected, he was not the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I went to look for another man, whom he suspected. I had seen that man in Queen-square; I left Wilsdon to lodge with Barton. I know nothing about a reward.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see Barton's house - A. Yes, the bedroom door was broken down, and the wash-house doorappeared to me to have been shot through; I saw Barton's arm, it had bled.</p>
               <p>THOMAS MACINTOSH. I am an officer, of Marlborough-street. I went to Queen-square with an assault warrant, to apprehend the prisoner; I do not know, what name was in the warrant; I come here at the desire of the prisoner's solicitor.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner's name in the warrant or not - A. It was, he answered to the name that was in it; I found him in Queen-square, Barton and his son was with me at the time, and pointed him out to me; he surrendered himself quietly; the magistrate admitted him to bail.</p>
               <p>FOY. Barton, and his Son, came to Mr. Baker's office; he said, that six or eight persons had surrounded his house, and had endeavoured to assassinate them; he said, one of them had tied his son's hands and legs, and at last the person went away. I was sent to examine the house, and found it had been injured in several parts, the windows broken in, and one of the doors were forced off the hinges, another door had a hole in it, but it did not appear to have been done with a shot. Barton did not appear to be hurt.</p>
               <p>Jury. What was your opinion of the house - A. I reported it to Mr. Baker, the magistrate, that I thought it was a fabrication, I did not find the bullet - They gave me some bullets.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent of the charge, which I will prove. I shall prove that I was not there, I was at a public-house in Berwick-street, Soho, on the night until eleven o'clock. I was apprehended for an assault, and the magistrate admitted me to bail; I attended at Hicks's-hall, and to my surprise, I found an indictment against me for a capital charge; I have now surrendered to take my trial.</p>

            . I keep the Black Lion public-house, in Berwick-street, Soho. On the night of the 6th of December last, the prisoner was at my house from six to eleven o'clock in the evening, another man was with him; he was not out of the house five minutes all the time.</p>
               <p>Court. What makes you remember the particular night - A. It was four nights from the 2d of December, when the riots were, he was at my house five nights running from that day.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to remember six nights from that time - A. I thought it strange he should be so constant, he was not in the habit of doing so; he has used my house for one year. I am sure he was there on that day; I told the magistrate so within eight days after, the reason that I remember his being at my house on that night, was, he ran 2s. 6d. in credit, and has not yet paid me, the other man had used my house for six months; I have known<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150053"></xptr>prisoner fifteen months, his 2s. 6d. is still on my slate.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM NUGENT. I am in Mr. Howard's employ. I was with the prisoner on the 6th of December, at Baraclough's, from a little after five to eleven o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that it was on the 6th of December - A. It was the day of the riots at Spa-fields, that is the day I mean to speak of, it was the very same day, I mean to speak of no other day, than the day of the riots; we do not owe the landlord any thing, we paid for what we had.</p>
               <p>ANN COCHRANE. I am servant to Mr. Baraclough; he has kept the Black Lion for eight or nine weeks. I lived there before he came, the prisoner frequented the house; I saw him there on the night of the riots, that is the day that I come to speak about, Nugent was with him, they staid till eleven o'clock, they paid for every thing they had.</p>
               <p>Q. When was you desired to come here - A. Yesterday; I was told the riots were on the 6th of December, I heard Nugent say so. I am sure that the day I am come to speak of, was the day of the riots, for I went to the door and saw the people shutting up, and they said it was because of the riots. I have not seen the prisoner at our house since the riots; the prisoner was not a customer at our house before Baraclough came, which is eight or nine weeks ago.</p>

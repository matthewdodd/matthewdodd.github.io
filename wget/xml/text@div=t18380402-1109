                  </hi>. I assist my father, James Strother, who is a coal merchant, at Woolwich—he is under a contract to the Board of Ord<lb></lb>nance. On Wednesday, the 14th of March, we hired a horse and cart of Mr. Watts, to take some coals to the artillery barracks—the prisoner Baker came with the cart—I saw it loaded, and gave him a ticket—I gave directions to Warden to look out—the constable has since produced a tack to me—I should imagine it was one of those sent out with the coals on the occasion in question—it was one of my father's sacks, such as were used on those occasions—I have also seen some coals—they certainly were similar to what we were delivering, but it is impossible to swear to them—the sack contained 224lbs.—they were my father's property that Baker had—this was the ticket I sent Baker with—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the Woolwich police. In consequence of information from Strother, I followed a cart that left his premises, loaded with coal, and in Brewer-street I saw the prisoner Baker take a sack full of coals from the cart, and go into a side gate of some premises, where a new house is, about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's—I followed him—he was in the cellar when I got in the premises, the coals were shot out, and he had the sack over his arm—there were coals in the cellar where he was, when I got there, which was about a minute after he got in—the prisoner Cutten was also in the cellar, he seemed to have been at work at a carpenter's bench—there was about four sacks of coals in the cellar—I took Baker into custody—he said he was not robbing his master, he would make it all right—he said the coals were going to the artillery barracks, and his master would not be the loser—I told Cutten I took him into custody for receiving these coals, knowing them to be stolen—he said he knew nothing about them, his son had or<lb></lb>dered them—before I got to the cellar I heard a question asked, "Shall I settle with you now?"—I believe that to have been Cutten's voice—there were no other persons to have spoken but Baker and Cutten—the cart was a few yards from the spot—the answer I heard made was, "I will see you on Saturday night"—I believe that it was Baker said that—I took pos<lb></lb>session of the empty sack, and took some coals, that appeared uppermost, off the heap—I had not lost sight of the cart above a second between the prosecutor's premises and the time the sack was taken out—there was not time for any one to put a sack into the cart.</p>

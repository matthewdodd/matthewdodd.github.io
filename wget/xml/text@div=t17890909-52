             said she would have my life, and called Stewart, and gave him a knife, and he cut me across my throat; I was in as good health then, as ever I was, but I have been ill ever since, and do not think I ever shall be well any more; after they cut me across the throat, they cut me on the chin, and stabbed me on the side, and on the shoulder, and on the calf of my leg strait down, here is the shirt; (shews a very bloody shirt); I suppose it was during this time I lost my money, I had it when they attacked me, and I had it not afterwards; he was going to make a second cut at me; but the other woman called out murder, and desired him to spare my life; she caught hold of his hand, so I got to this friend's house, as fast as I could; the woman (Peters) was all for killing me; I believe it was about three quarters of an hour when I got away from them, my friend went with me.</p>
               <p>Then they had not ran away? - They never stirred out of the same place, we found them there; the watchman came up, and they were too much for him; and the other watchman came up, my friend could not take them, there was such a gang, and they were going to serve him, as they served me, there were two watchmen, and my friend and his wife at the taking of them, it was about one hundred yards from the house that I was attacked, I had not been drinking before, that night; I was quite sober, I was at work till very near twelve before we settled, I remained up with my friend's wife, who was washing, and the pot of beer was for her.</p>

             took you by the handkerchief, did they begin immediately to threaten, or did she ask you to go with her or any thing of that sort? - They began immediately to threaten, there was nothing at all like going with her.</p>
               <p>What day of the week was it? - It was Sunday morning about five, when I was carried into the London Hospital.</p>

               <p>Then how can you be so positive that these two prisoners were two of the persons that attacked you? - Because I knew them when I was brought to the rotation-office, from the London Hospital, I knew them, because I was by when they were taken: I shewed them to the men that took them.</p>

               <p>What time in the morning was it, when I was taken up? - The watchman can best tell that, the witness who took her.</p>
               <p>Why did not you give charge of me when I was first detained, it was another man that gave charge of me? - I gave charge of her and of him also.</p>
               <p>Did you mention at the watch-house that I robbed you? - I did not think then about robbing, or any thing else; I was afraid of my life, and I was hurried away to the hospital.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you then mention your having been robbed, or being cut and wounded? - It was to the watch-house I was taken, there was nobody but the constable of the night there, he did not ask me any thing, but desired the watchman to hurry me to the hospital as fast as he could; I was asked nothing at that time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Steward. Was not there other soldiers besides myself? - No, I did not see any others in the street besides the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Where was Steward at that time? - He was standing about a matter of fourteen or fifteen yards off; I told her at the same time; says I, you ought to be taken up, and sent into prison; what is that to you, you vagabond, says she; I will cut you; and she followed me, and cut me across the lip; I got the watchman, and took her into custody.</p>

               <p>Did you know the woman before? - What, Poll Peters; no, I never saw her before, only once or twice; I am quite sure she was the woman that cut me, and cut my lip.</p>
               <p>Did you observe where she hit him? - No, my Lord, I did not; I was afraid to rush in when she cut the prosecutor, because she had the knife in her hand; when I gave charge to the watch of her, it was about four minutes after; the watchmen were present then.</p>
               <p>Was there any body else there besides the watchman? - Not as I know on.</p>

               <p>Did you see any body go up to the soldier? - I saw a man taking hold of him; I do not think that was the watchman; it was another man.</p>
               <p>Where was the woman when the man took hold of the soldier? - I had hold of her then, she might be two or three yards; or four, or five yards; he was about fifteen yards off at the time when she cut the man.</p>

               <p>Then before the watchman came up, did he come nearer her? - I did not mind him, I ran after her, to take her, after I brought the watchman.</p>
               <p>What distance was the soldier from Poll Peters at that time? - I cannot say; when she had cut me, she ran away; I said, I will be an evidence.</p>
               <p>Did you say in the watch-house that she was not the woman that cut you? - No Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Peters. What time was it in the morning when you was cut? - Between three and four.</p>
               <p>Did you take hold of me directly when you was cut? - No, it was you cut the man and cut me besides.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Peters. My Prosecutor says, it was this man cut him.</p>

            . When these people were taken up, were they drunk or sober? - To all appearance they were middling, in a middling situation, the man was more in liquor than the girl, to my appearance; the man was so faint, he could say nothing of the robbery till the next day; he was hurried to the hospital, the man was like a dead man when we took him to the watch-house.</p>

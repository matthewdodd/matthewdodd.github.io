                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert James Legg, of the French Horn public-house, Crutched-friars—on 17th April, about 8 o'clock, the prisoner came in and asked for half a quartern of gin—she gave me a half-crown—I saw that it was bad—I said nothing till I bad tried it in the detector, and I then asked her to wait a few minutes, and I would show her another bad one which she had passed about a fortnight previous—she said, "Are you prepared to swear to that"—I said of course not, but I would call the barmaid, who would no doubt recognize her—I called her and said, "Is this the young person you served with a half-quartern of rum, and who tendered you the half-crown," and she said, "Yes"—I then produced the second half-crown—the prisoner immediately run out of the house, and the potman ran after her, overtook her, and she was brought back in charge of a policeman—she left her bottle on the counter, with the gin in it—the half-crowns were given to the policeman.</p>

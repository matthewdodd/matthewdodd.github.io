               <p>I am headborough. On Saturday night, between one and two, I was alarmed, and went to the watch-house; the prosecutor said he had been robbed of three guineas, and should know the men; we first took Chilton at the Windmill; the prosecutor said he was one; then I went and apprehended the other, knowing they associated together, at his lodgings, on Saltpetre-bank; there were several other people in the house; and he gave me the beckon, and said that was one; and when the other man was taken, he said that was the other; there was a third taken, but he would not swear positively to him; I searched the prisoners, but found nothing.</p>

               <p>Between five and six in the morning, I went into the Windmill and called for a pint of purl and halfpennyworth of gin, I was going on board of ship, and the officer came in, and brought in the prosecutor, and asked him if I was the man? he said nothing;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179110260044"></xptr>they took him out again, and they brought him in again, and said they must have me for a robbery; they searched me, and only found a penny. They have been feeding that man, and giving him meat and drink for swearing our lives away.</p>

               <p>I say the same.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Chilton. He came to me when I was in the lock-up-room, and said, Chilton, had not you better save your own life? we were in the ale-house from that time till about a quarter of an hour of the time that they took us.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. How were the men dressed that robbed you? - In short jackets, the same condition they are in now.</p>
               <p>Court to Cook. When Chilton was taken, he says, Hayes did not know him at first? - Hayes gave me the beckon, and I went to the door with him, and asked him if he knew any body there? and he said that is one of the men; I said consider; he said he was sure.</p>

               <p>Have you ever had any occasion to know them in your way before? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Both of them? - Yes, Chilton has been tried before.</p>

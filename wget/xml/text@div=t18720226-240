I am the widow of George Hughes, and reside at the North Pole, Latimer Road, Notting Hill—he died on 30th January—he was fifty-three on his last birthday—in March 1871, he was proprietor of the North Pole—on 7th March he went with Mr. Barth to the renewal meeting at the Magistrate's—he left home about 9 o'clock in the morning—he was then perfectly well, and in very good health—he had always been a strong and hearty man—he returned home, as far as I can remember, about 8 o'clock in the evening, alone—as he came in at the door I saw him walking lame—he com<lb></lb>plained that he had had his knee hurt—he said he had been kicked—he said he had hurt his knee—he went to bed—he got up in the morning, but he was not able to remain up; he went to bed again directly—he was still complaining of his knee—I sent for a doctor next day, the 8th—Dr. Roberts' assistant came—a nurse was also sent for, Harriet Wick, and she remained with him to his death—in January he got worse, and in conse<lb></lb>quence of that it was determined to take his leg off—I don't remember the day the operation was performed—he died at the North Pole.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, and reside at the Rifle Pavilion, Wormwood Scrubbs—in March, 1871, I had known the de<lb></lb>ceased for some time—I always thought him a healthy man—I should imagine he weighed something about 12 stone, or I fancy it might be a little more; he was a little stouter than me—on the renewal day, the 7th March, 1871, I went to the North Pole to fetch him, and about 9 o'clock he and I started to go to the renewal meeting—as far as I know he was perfectly sound in health and strength at that time—he walked and talked very well—we went to the meeting, and after it was over we were joined there by Mr. Dixon, and we went from the Vestry Hall, and took the train to Notting Hill Gate station—we got out there, and went down the Notting Hill Road, and went into the Coach and Horses public-house—Mr. Dixon and Mr. Hughes went into the private bar at the further end of the house; I went in also for a minute or two—I saw the defendant there; not at first; he came in afterwards with a Mr. Weston—there were other persons there, but I did not know them—I wanted something substantial to eat, and I had it in the private bar—while I was having it Mr. Hughes was pushed against the parti<lb></lb>tion where I stood; he stood opposite to Mr. Fuelling, and I should think it was Mr. Fuelling that pushed him—I did not see him actually pushed—some glass came down from the partition at the time, at the back of me; whether it was glass from the frame or not I don't know—I did not wait to see what happened to Mr. Hughes; I went out at once—previous to the push there had been some conversation about the weight of Mr. Dixon's chain, between Mr. Fuelling, and I believe Weston was talking about it—I saw Fuelling take a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note out of his pocket—there was so much talk that I could scarcely understand what it was for—the conversation was about the weight and value of the chain—after the push given to Mr. Hughes I went into another compartment of the house, and did not see anything more of Mr. Hughes—at the time we went into the Coach and Horses I think he was perfectly sober—we got there between 2 and 3 o'clock—I should say the push was given about twenty minutes after we got there, or it might be a little more.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 1, Swanscomb Place, Hammersmith—I have retired from business—I was a baker at one time—I had known Hughes seven or eight years—he appeared a strong and healthy man—this was the first time I ever knew of his quarrelling—I did not know of his giving boxing lessons—on 7th March I met him by accident, at the Vestry Hall, at Kensington—I accompanied him and Mr. Barth, by train, to the Notting Hill Gate station—he appeared to be quite sober at that time—I don't remember the time we left the Vestry Hall—I think we arrived at Notting Hill a little before 2 o'clock, or about 2—we had not been in any public-house between the time of leaving the Vestry Hall and getting to Notting Hill—when we got out there we went to the Coach and Horses, at Mr. Barth's suggestion—we had taken no refreshment before we got there; we were all quite sober—we all three went into the private bar—I believe the prisoner came in with Weston while we were there—there were three or four persons in the private bar when we went in, but they left—at the time the prisoner and Weston came in I was partaking of 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of cold gin-and-water—Hughes was drinking cold gin and water—I had on the watch chain that I have on now—it might be a quarter of an hour, or twenty or twenty-five minutes after they came in before the prisoner addres<lb></lb>sed any observation to me—he was known to me very well—Weston was a stranger to me—Fuelling took up my chain in a jocular sort of way, and said "That is a nice chain, Mr. Dixon; I would not mind giving you 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it"—I believe I said "You very much depreciate the value of my chain, but I do not want to sell it"—I said that in a jocular way—I was not out of temper—I never took it as an insult—Mr. Hughes then said he considered it a d—d insult—Fuelling said "I don't know you; who are you?"—Mr. Hughes said "You don't know me, but (leaning towards Fuelling's face) you know Mr. Harris, do you not?" in that way (<hi rend="italic">describ<lb></lb>ing it</hi>)—I was talking to Weston at the time—I said I had no wish to sell the chain—Fuelling had got some notes in his hand, with some gold in the centre, and a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in his finger—Hughes said to him "You need not be so flash with your money," and then Fuelling pushed Hughes back up against the partition, and up against Mr. Barth—as soon as Hughes recovered himself from the partition, he up with his fist and struck Fuell<lb></lb>ing in the mouth, and after that Weston struck Hughes in the right eye—the blow knocked him against the partition; but instead of his coming flat against it he came against the round part of it, which caused him to slide round on his back, and he came right on the ground—I said to Wes<lb></lb>ton "All this is quite uncalled for"—some man came from outside the house and picked Mr. Hughes up, and wiped his eye, and I am inclined to think that he sucked his eye, to draw the blood from it; but whether he did or not I don't know; he put his mouth to it—after he got himself a bit together, he came up to Weston and said "You have done this to me,</p>

               <p>young fellow," putting his finger to his eye—Weston said "Why did you strike a cripple, one that could not defend himself," at the same time point<lb></lb>ing to Fuelling—after that there were some words going on, and while they were going on Fuelling put his left hand against the stairs, one hand against the partition on the right side, and he struck Mr. Hughes like that with his foot, just above the calf of his leg—he leant on the staircase, and struck his foot out—he struck at him with the flat part of his foot; it seemed to strike with the bottom part of the foot, above his calf, on the right leg, just above here (<hi rend="italic">pointing</hi>), at the side of the leg, inside the leg, just above the calf—then there was a bit of a skirmish, asking what he meant, and a man came and said if anyone touched Mr. Hughes again he would hit them—after he was kicked Mr. Hughes put his hand down to his knee, and rubbed his knee—he did not say anything then—a Mr. Cook, who was in the other compartment, and who knew me and Hughes, said "Never mind, Hughes, come away," and he took us round to the other compartment—I have seen a high heel to the prisoner's boot; from what I could see of it it would be about three inches—when we got into the other compartment Hughes got up and rubbed his leg—I said "Has he hurt you much?" and he said "Yes, he has caught me on the <hi rend="italic">funny</hi>-bone"—I don't know how long we were in that compartment, but it was grow<lb></lb>ing dusk when I left—Hughes was sober at the time he received the blow, and when we left he was sober, as far as to walking, but he was excited—he complained again of his leg—I asked him if he would have a cab—he said no, he would walk home—I accompanied him as far as the Latimer Road—he limped, and stood every now and then—I left him at the farther end of the Latimer Road, from his house—I can't be positive of the time I left him, it was growing dusk—I left him there, and saw him limping along, and I went back home—he had no tumble in the road while I saw him; he had hold of my hand all the way—he had nothing to drink after he left the Coach and Horses with me—he made no complaint about his knee after Weston had knocked him down—Fuelling, myself, and Wes<lb></lb>ton, were in the private bar, and after the occurrence a person came in; I don't know his name, but I see him opposite me now—the landlady was behind the bar, and I think a barmaid—the potman was outside doing something to the lamps, I think; at least, I saw a young man cleaning the lamps, whether he was the potman or not I don't know—I think it would be difficult for anyone but me and Weston to see what was going on, be<lb></lb>cause the compartment was so small.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> If the potman did come in, it was after Mr. Hughes was knocked down—two men came in when he was picked up—it was after he was knocked down that the push or kick was given—the man who came in and picked him up was not the potman; after he had picked him up he stood at the door—the barmaids serve the whole of the partitions—I saw the landlady and a barmaid, or two; I don't know how many—I don't know the name of Towley; he was not the person who picked Mr. Hughes up, that was Achelor or Atchet—it was when Hughes was putting his face close into Fuelling's face that he pushed him back—he pushed him away from him—that was the time he went against the partition, when the glass fell; and then Hughes, as soon as he recovered himself, struck him; he did not knock him down, he knocked him round against the banisters of the stairs; he held by the banisters, he never went down, I am quite sure of that; he went nearly down; he was only saved from going down by the banisters—</p>

               <p>Weston did not push him up; Fuelling recovered himself, and directly Hughes struck him, Weston struck Hughes—Fuelling's lip was cut open, and bled—the remark about the cripple was not before Weston struck him; it was after—Hughes was a man of 12 or 13 stone weight, a short thick-set man, his height was about 5 feet 5 inches; he twisted round, and fell right full-length on his back, and his hat fell off—I can undertake to say that the push went against his leg; I saw that—I have never said it went against his stomach—it was with his deformed foot that the prisoner struck him—Hughes was pointing to Weston, and saying "You have done this for me, young fellow;" and while he was making use of those words, Fuelling leant one hand against the banisters and struck him—Hughes was standing with his back against the partition and his face to Weston—I did not at first say, before the Magistrate, "He <hi rend="italic">kind</hi> of pushed the deceased with his foot in the stomach"—I was examined twice at the Police Court; that was read to me, and I had to contradict it, and said I never said such a thing—I swear I never said anything about the stomach, it must have been a misunder<lb></lb>standing—I said, before the Coroner, that he struck him on the leg; I believe my words were "He struck his foot out, and caught Mr. Hughes on the leg"—the disturbance lasted a very short time—we left Fuelling standing at the bar when Mr. Cook fetched us away—we remained in the other com<lb></lb>partment for sometime—I don't know how long—I was not drinking all the time—Hughes had some gin-and-water, I had some bread and meat—he was very excited, but not tipsy, when we came away; it was the result, of temper, being struck and kicked—he had been drinking; he was not tipsy, he was sober—I don't call a man exactly sober when he has been having a glass of something to drink; he was what I would consider about half and half—I walked with him as far as the Latimer Road, which leads to his home.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was a swelling from the foot to the thigh; it was swollen considerably all the way up, about one-third up the whole limb was swollen; that was sympathetic from the bruise—it would not result from a twisting of the muscles; it could not result from slipping down on his knees; it would not result from concussion; it must have been a direct blow of some hard substance—supposing he was twisted round the corner of a partition, and in tumbling the sharp angle of the partition came in contact with the under part of the knee, that would produce what I saw if it came exactly on that spot, that would be a direct blow—I don't recal the black eye.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a M. R. C. S., and one of the surgeons of St. Mary's Hospital; I also practice at 48, Queen Ann Street, Cavendish Square—I have been 20 years in the profession—I was called in to see the deceased on 18th May, 1871, by the friends, to meet Dr. Godfrey in consultation—I found the right leg very much swollen from the foot to the centre of the thigh—I was told that he had met with an injury, and I had no reason to doubt it—the injury was quite consistent with a kick having been given him in the leg—there was no appearance of scrofula about him; he appeared to be a very healthy man—I heard the nurse's evidence—if the man had been struck there, I have no doubt there would be a bruise at the date the nurse spoke of—the swelling I saw from the foot up to the thigh is consistent with that—after the injury, inflammation set in, which travelled along the leg, both upwards and downwards, and went on to the formation of pus and abscesses—the first time I saw him there was a considerable collection of pus in the leg—I made several incisions, and evacuated half a pint of matter; that showed that the injury must have taken place some little time, or he could not have been in such a condition—if everything had gone on most favourably, it was certain to go on for some time, the man must have been kept in bed a considerable time to recover</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187202260017"></xptr>
               <p>from the amount of inflammatory mischief—I made a close and accurate examination of the knee and knee-cap, and all the locality; there was no external bruise at that time—I saw him again on 4th July, he was then in a much worse condition—I saw him again on 22nd August, he was a little better then; that is, his general health was a little better; the limb was not—I saw him again on 2nd September; his health had much improved, but the limb had not—I saw him on 7th October; his health was better, but the limb not any better—his general health was extremely good after my second visit—after 7th October I did not see him again till 9th January, when I was called in; I then found that acute in<lb></lb>flammation of the knee joint had set in, and that amputation was the only chance of life—I communicated that fact to him—on my previous visits, the inflammation had not reached the joint itself—the appearances I saw on my first visit were not consistent with the disease having originated from natural causes—I performed the operation on 14th January—the leg was taken off about the lower third of the thigh—I afterwards carefully examined the limb that I had taken off—I found the knee joint in a state of extreme inflammation; the cartilages and internal structures of the joint were dis<lb></lb>organised and softened; the cavity had given way, and allowed the exit of tissues round, so that the matter was burrowing up the thigh—all the appear<lb></lb>ances I found were consistent with the injury having been given in the way described in March, 1871—there had been no interim, if I may say so; the symptoms were all consecutive; he had never recovered from the original injury—I confidently expected him to get better after the amputation—he rallied extremely well from the operation—I saw him that same evening, and several times afterwards, and he was making steady progress—the stump had almost healed, and, I believe, would have healed, if the ligatures had come away; I mean the strings placed on the artery to restrain the bleed<lb></lb>ing—they will not separate after a given period, but if they had separated, I believe the wound would have completely closed in a fortnight after the amputation—the operation was performed under chloroform—on 27th January, hearing that the bleeding had recommenced, I went to see him—I found that he had lost a quantity of blood, and was somewhat faint—on the 29th, a second attack of bleeding took place, and I opened the stump, and secured the bleeding vessel; he then turned over, and went to sleep—he died within two or three hours of the time I left him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> That was on the morning of the 30th—I did not make any second operation, I merely opened the stump with my finger; I did not cut it—I did not see that the bed was full of blood on the 27th—they told me that he had lost a good deal of blood, but they had taken it away before I came—I consulted with the other medical man in attendance as to what was best to be done, and we thought it was better to give him a chance of recovering from the temporary hemcerrhage—we plugged the stump with wool, and placed bandages on it, so that there was no chance whatever of the return of bleeding till we should see him again—I saw him the next day, the 28th—we did not attempt to secure the artery till the 29th, except by the plugging—hemcerrhage was the immediate cause of death—the hemcerrhage occurred from the same vessel where the operation was performed—the artery was tied up at the original operation—I must have tied it Originally—one or more of the ligatures had separated—I believe it was tied securely—the ligatures ought to separate—at the time of an operation the bleeding vessels are secured with ligatures, and in the course</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187202260018"></xptr>
               <p>of time natural process separates them—they must come away before the wound can entirely heal—about a week before the man's death one of those ligatures separated, apparently at the proper period, six or seven days after the operation—from that ligature bleeding set in, whether from that vessel the ligature had come I could only form an opinion, but I believe it was from that—if that artery had been properly tied up I should not have expected the hemcerrhage to occur so long afterwards, unless there was some reason for it—I think the reason was some deep-seated ulceration in the stump—it is not possible for an artery of that size to escape observation in tying up—it might do so, but then it would bleed early, in a day or two—Mr. Roberts was with me at the time of the operation—there was no <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of the body; simply of the limb after its removal—the damaged cartilage which I found on cutting open the knee would be the result of inflammation—in my opinion that was the extension of the inflamma<lb></lb>tion which followed the original injury—I could only form an opinion of what the original injury was from what I heard—I was told it was a blow on the leg—the cellular tissue immediately below the integuments first took on inflammation—that would be caused by an injury—I don't think it was the knee joint that was originally injured—it was the cellular tissue, below the integuments of the leg—that part suffered immediately on the receipt of the injury—acute inflammation was established in that, and it spread down the leg and up the leg—that is a very important part of the limb, a part that is peculiarly liable to take on inflammation—the particular part that was injured was the upper and inner part of the shin bone, immediately below the knee—that is a very delicate part—I was told that was the part that was injured, and I have no reason to doubt it—there was nothing to be seen there when I saw him, except general swellings-supposing that to be the part injured, the cellular tissue would carry on the inflammation into the knee—that would not always be the case—it would very often depend on the state of the part—possibly a very stout man might be more subject to the inflammation than another, but not necessarily so—if he had been a drinking man it would be more likely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> As far as I was able to judge, there was no trace of any previous disease—all the appearances I saw in May and in January were consistent with an injury done to the knee in the spot I have described, without any subsequent injury—the inflammation of the cellular tissue extended quite up to the body—I could not trace the particular spot where the injury had been inflicted, because of the inflammation; it was so general—the term "<hi rend="italic">funny</hi>-bone" is merely a popular expression to indicate a nerv<lb></lb>ous sensation to a particular bone—it is simply a shock to the nerve, appli<lb></lb>cable to any part, but more usually applied to the elbow.</p>

               <p>and as a respectable tradesman, carrying on business in the neighbourhood—on the licensing day for Kensington division, Hughes and Dixon came into the private bar, about 2 o'clock, with Mr. Barth—I noticed that Hughes had been drinking, and he was rather quarrelsome, but not till after Fuel<lb></lb>ling came in, which was, I think, at 2.20 or 2.30—Mr. Weston was with Fuelling—I heard something about a chain, but I cannot say what—a gentleman came in, and sat on the stairs, but I do not know his name—that is him (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Townley</hi>)—Hughes said "Is this the d—d German who has got all the money?" referring to Mr. Fuelling—there was then some little altercation, but I do not know what it was, and Mr. Hughes butted his head down in Fuelling's face, with his hat on, and Fuelling said "I don't know you, don't take that liberty again," or some such words, and Hughes struck Fuelling a blow in the mouth, and knocked him down the stairs—I tried to prevent his striking him, by catching hold of his arm—he prevented himself from falling by catching hold of the banisters—I saw Hughes and Weston fall together—Hughes fell round the side of the par<lb></lb>tition, and then he was out of my sight—the potman, Davey, picked him up—he then went from that compartment into the next, with Mr. Dixon and several others, who came in, hearing a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—Hughes pointed to him, and said "You <hi rend="italic">done</hi> that, young man"—they tried to make it up after that—I am sure the defendant did not raise his foot and strike the deceased, because Mr. Watson got in between—if he had done so I must have seen it—I was standing there to keep them quiet—if he had raised himself against the banisters, and raised his foot, I must have seen it—Dixon left the next compartment before Mr. Hughes—Mr. Hughes left about 7 o'clock, with two or three rough men, who were hanging about the house—he was then quite tipsy—during the whole time the deceased was there he made no complaint whatever about any injury to his leg—he continued in the compartment next to the private bar up to the time he left—I serve there, and I was serving him—I had no conversation with him.</p>

               <p>Court. What part of your shop were they in? - They were upon the counter, one pair new and one pair second hand, they were both my own on sale, they were taken down for the prisoner to look at in my public shop; I asked him what he wanted, he said, to buy a pair of silver buckles, but he was not in a hurry, I shewed him the two heaviest pair in my shop, when I laid them on the counter he said, have you knees that will follow them, I said, I had, when I brought him the knees, he desired me to weigh them, while I turned my back to weigh the knees, he run away with the two pair of shoe buckles.</p>
               <p>Court. You did not see him take them? - No, my Lord, my back was to him, I missed him in less than half a minute, and jumped over my counter and run after him, and called Stop thief! and I believe he did the same, when I came to my door, I saw him about fifty yards up the street, and nobody was in the street, he ran into Hermitage-street, and while he turned the corner, I lost sight of him, which was not above a quarter of a minute, a man stopped him upon my calling out, Stop thief! I was in sight when he stopped him, and he held him till I came up, he was about thirty yards off me, when the man stopped him.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you a candle in the shop? - Five or six, when I came up to the prisoner he said, Sir, I have dropped your buckles, and one of the men that stopped him, laid hold of his right hand, I said to the prisoner, never mind you shall come along with me, we carried him to the watch-house, he was searched in my house, I felt my buckles on the out-side of his left breeches pocket, the buckles were taken out of his pocket in my sight, I am positive to them being mine.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is there a private mark on that buckle? - Yes, on one there is, there is my private shop mark on one and a crack on the other, you will find 48 just at the corner, they were so marked when he took them away, we always mark them and make an entry in our book, and the names of the persons we buy them of, the other buckle had a crack in it, which has prevented me from selling them, he desired me to let him go as I had got my buckles again; you rascal, says I, I have suffered too much by such dogs; that is all I know.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see him take them? - No, my Lord, there was nobody else in the shop.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. What might the value of these buckles be? - The weight of them is nine ounces, your Lordship knows the value of silver, they stood me in three pounds one shilling and nine-pence.</p>

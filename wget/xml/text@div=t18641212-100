                  </hi>. I am at present clerk to my father—In November, 1863, I was in business—I was indebted to Mr. Clark in the sum</p>

               <p>of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is. for gum—the prisoner called on me on 3rd November, he did not call exactly in reference to the payment of that account—we had some con<lb></lb>versation about it—I cannot recollect what it was; we entered into an agreement for him to sell some varnish for me and hand over the money to Mr. Clark, I did not pay him in actual money; I think he had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money to make up the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that was the amount of the varnish he was to sell; he gave me this receipt—I saw him sign it (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "London, Nov. 3rd, 1863.—Received of Messrs.

Clark—I said I wanted to pay them some money, and he said he could sell the varnish—he gave me the receipt on account of Clark and Co. so I of course expected that he was in their employment—he said he could sell the varnish, and I said, "If you have the varnish I wish to pay Messrs. Clark the money, and you must hand it over to them."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> How long were you in business? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Only some few months, I began somewhere about the beginning of 1863—my father was not a partner—he was frequently there—he had failed, and was there simply because he was doing nothing—these goods were brought in two parcels on 15th and 16th October—Mr. Beall the clerk called on me about 14 days' afterwards for the account, and I said I believed the transaction was for a longer period; he did not call more than once to my knowledge—I did not see him after that—I was taken ill in November, and was away ill for 3 months, and my father put the business into the hands of Mr. Parke, soli<lb></lb>citor, of Moorgate-Street, to wind it up—I saw nothing of any letter prior to the action being brought against me; any letter that came on business would be handed over to Mr. Parke—I instructed Mr. Parke to state that I had this receipt, but he neglected it; it was found out on the trial at the Common Pleas—I did not see you several times before the action was brought, I could not, I was away from business—I only came back just before the action was brought—it was brought on 20th April—I did not see you on 14th February, I was in the country—I did not sell you any ketchup on 14th February, to my knowledge—I could not tell without my book—I did not sell you a gross of pickles on 27th, to my knowledge—you might have had it out of stock while I was away.</p>
               <p>The <hi rend="smallCaps">RECORDER</hi> was of opinion that there was no evidence of any false pre<lb></lb>tence. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LEWIS</hi> submitted that a larceny was made out, as the prisoner received the money for the express purpose of paying it to Mr. Clark, and though that might not apply to the proceeds to be realized by the varnish, it would apply to the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and with respect to that the Jury might, under the present indictment, find a verdict of larceny. The <hi rend="smallCaps">RECORDER</hi> was clearly of opinion there was no false pretence, nor did he see how the Jury could find a verdict of larceny, that could only be done by proceeding against the prisoner</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of Charles Holmes. Between nine and ten in the evening of the 10th of Feb., the prisoner came and asked if we sold oiled silk umbrella covers—I said, "Yes," and called M'Lean to come and serve him—I went into an adjoining room—M'Lean came to me in two or three minutes for a knife—directly she turned her back the prisoner ran out of the shop with an umbrella, which was on the counter—I ran and called "Stop thief"—I lost sight of him as he turned a corner—the policeman came and asked mewhich way he had gone—I came back to the shop, and the policeman had got him in the shop—he left a parcel in the shop containing a pair of trowsers and his own umbrella.</p>

                  </hi>. I took two umbrellas out of the window, and took the case off one—the prisoner broke the top off his umbrella in trying the case on, he asked if I had a knife to cut a piece of string—I went into the parlour to fetch one, and he ran out—a person might have called him.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in Sydney-alley—I saw the prisoner coming out of the shop running with an umbrella in his hand—he did not speak to any one, but ran into Princes-street into a house or a court there.</p>

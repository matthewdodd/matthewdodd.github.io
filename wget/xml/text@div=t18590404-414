                  </hi>. I am a house-agent, in Pratt-street, Camden-town—on 2d March, about twelve o'clock at night, I was in High-street, Camden-town—I went into a public-house and had twopennyworth of gin and water—the only persons in the house were the prisoner and two other women—the prisoner came and spoke to me, and she followed me out, and when I got a few yards, she came close to me, and put her hand in my pocket and took my money—I seized her hand, and with her other hand she struck me forcibly on the nose—I had fifteen shillings in my pocket—it was safe when I came out of the public-house—the policeman picked up three shillings, but other people got round, and I suppose they picked up the rest.</p>

               <p>but I have always ordered them off—I do not know that I have been followed forty yards, all the time protesting against it and ordering the person off—not to my knowledge—I may have been followed fifty yards—if she had put her hand in my other pocket, I had five sovereigns there; but she put her hand in my left trowsers pocket—I had the same coat on that I have now—I do not know whether it was buttoned—I did not feel her hand in my pocket before I pushed her—I caught hold of her hand before she drew the money out—I had fifteen shillings—there was a crown-piece—two half-crowns, and five shillings—it was loose in my pocket—I stated before the Magistrate that I caught her hand in my pocket—when I went to the police-station, I made a charge of the prisoner striking me—my nose was bleeding—I did not, to my knowledge, after I went out, speak to a policeman, and then return and add to my former statement the charge of assault, and state that she struck me—at the station I stated what I have to-day; nothing more nor less—I believe I did not return to the station and add to my former charge that of striking me—I would not say what I don't know—it might have been—I had been out that night on business with Mr. Hook, a butcher—I did not get to him till ten o'clock at night—I had some conversation with him about some carpentering and some other business—I stopped till twelve o'clock—I saw him at his own house—I had not been to the theatre, certainly not—I afterwards went to the Black Cap, and had the gin and water—I did not see the prisoner till I called for the gin and water—I did not see her when I went in—the prisoner and two others were standing at the corner—the prisoner made her advances to me, and asked me to give her beer—that was at the Black Cap—I got three shillings of my money—I held her hand with my two hands, and with her other hand she violently assaulted me, and her paramour had her hand in my hair—I called for the police.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 2, Seymour-place, Camden-town, and am a green-grocer—on the night of 2d March I had been to the theatre with my wife, and was returning home about half-past twelve—I was in High-street, Camden-town, and, just beyond Warren-street, I saw the prisoner, and the prosecutor was shoving her away—he said, "Get away from me; I want nothing to do with you"—I immediately heard him say, "you have got my money; I shall charge a policeman with you"—another woman caught hold of him, and the prisoner struck him in the face—the other woman ran away—the policeman came over the road, and I saw the prisoner chuck money out of her hand—the policeman took hold of both the prisoner and the prosecutor—my wife said, "It is the woman!" and the prisoner then struck her in the face—she had struck the prosecutor before.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you given evidence before on this matter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—Seymour-place is the best part of a quarter of a mile from Pratt-Street—I was not asked that evening to give any evidence—the policeman asked me to hold this woman, which I did till he got another policeman—the policeman found me out—he came to my place—when this took place I was about four shops off—the prisoner had hold of the prosecutor's arm—I did not hear any cry before that—I cried "Police!" after I saw the prisoner strike the prosecutor—I had before that seen her have hold of his arm, and he was shoving her away—it was not half a minute afterwards before I saw money thrown away—I think the policeman was directly opposite—I do not</p>

I am the wife of the last witness—I was returning with him from the theatre about half-past twelve o'clock on the night of 2nd March—I saw the prisoner had hold of the prosecutor's arm—I heard him say, "Go away; I have nothing to say to you, "and immediately I heard him say, "You have robbed me; I will hold you till a policeman comes"—the prisoner immediately threw some money away, which sounded like silver on the pavement—she said to him, "If you lock me up, you shall lock me up for something," and immediately she struck him a severe blow in the face—the policeman then came and took them both—I said, "The gentleman has not done anything"—the prisoner then struck me in the face.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>SAMUEL LACK. I am one of the Bow-street patrols On the 22nd of May, about twelve o'clock at night, as the people were coming from Covent Garden theatre, I saw Rogers following a gentleman at the corner of <placeName id="t18100606-106-crimeloc591">Bow-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18100606-106-crimeloc591" type="placeName" value="Bow-street"></interp>

I took him to the public house and searched him, and found in his breeches these two handkerchiefs, and this in his pocket; I cannot swear which handkerchief it was he took out of the gentleman's pocket. He went upon his knees and prayed very hard that I would let him go, and said it was his first offence.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence; called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

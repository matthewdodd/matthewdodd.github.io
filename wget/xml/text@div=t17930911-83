               <p>Witler. I followed him and found the things on him; he was about two hundred yards from my house, mine is a work shop of various sorts; I asked him where he was going? he said home; I said that was not his road home, he was going quite the reverse; I asked him what he had got in his pocket? he said, nothing. I put my hand into his pocket, and found several pieces of solder and steel, and that sort, and ordered him to walk back again; I called the watchman, and he took out of his pocket all the things in the indictment; I delivered them to

               <p>I saw these things taken from the prisoner; I have had them in my possession ever since. One of the tools in particular belongs to my master, that is the iron bolster, it has a mark on it that I mark all the tools with; the other things I cannot speak so particularly to; it is a cross struck in with a chissel in the side of the bolster; and an iron studding tool is missing from the spring maker's of the same size.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray had the apprentice any business with these tools? - He had no business at all but in the painting way, he had no business in any other shop, and Mr. Witler gave him a caution against going into any other shop.</p>

On the 28th of November, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to our shop, and wanted to look at two or three watches; I took him two or three down. He wished to see two or three more; I handed him three or four more out of the window, one of them he appeared to like very much - it was capped and seconds - the price was eight guineas. After he had looked at it, he pointed to another in the window, and desired it might be taken down to look at saying, he thought it would do for his mate, if it came to 4 l. or 5 l. He said his ship was going to be paid at the sign of the Cape of Good Hope, in the Commercial-road, in about an hour, that two or three more of his shipmates wanted watches, and he would bring them. I took the watch down that he pointed at, and before I could put it on the counter with the rest, be pointed at my regular, in a very sharp way, saying,</p>
               <p>"It is not so late as that, is it?" He hurried out of the shop instantly. I then went to return the watches to the window, and missed the capped and jewelled one. I looked again in the window, as I thought it not possible that he could have taken it, as I only had my eye off him while I looked at the clock, I however I found it was gone, and another as well, which I had shewn him, worth three guineas. I told my son, he went out one way, and I the other. I went to the Cape of Good Hope, public-house, but found no ship was going to be paid there. I heard nothing more until Tuesday morning, December the 1st when I called on Edwards; he shewed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181812020038"></xptr>me a watch, which I immediately recognized - it was the best watch. He said if I would call at three o'clock, the man who left it, would be there. I got an officer from Shadwell Office, and waited there until the prisoner came, we then seized him, and took him into the back-room. The officer searched, and found the duplicate of a watch on him, pledged in the Commercial-road for 15 s. - it was not mine, He had got the watch which he had left at Edwards, as he asked for it when he came. I have only recovered the best watch.</p>

            . I live in the Commercial-road, near the London Docks. On Monday morning, the 30th of November, the prisoner brought me a stop and seconds watch, capped and jewelled. He said it stopped, and wanted me to alter it. I said if he would bring it early the next morning, I would do it by three o'clock in the afternoon. He took it away, and brought it again next morning, and said he would call between three and four o'clock in the afternoon for it. Between eleven and twelve o'clock Mr. Leplastrier came to caution me against a man of colour, who had stolen two watches from him. I asked what sort of watches they were? He said one was stop and seconds, capped and jewelled. I took the watch out of my case and he claimed it. He came again in the afternoon with an officer, and waited for the prisoner, who came. I gave him the watch, and the officer took him.</p>

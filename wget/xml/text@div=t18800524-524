                  </hi>. I live at 20, Duke Street, Bloomsbury—I am a printer—on 17th April, about 11.20, I was in St. Giles's Street, Bloomsbury, going home—I had crossed Broad Street and was going into the Dials—the prisoner came against me with great violence—he put his hand in my waistcoat pocket—we struggled—he snatched the watch from the chain and ran away as fast as he could—I followed—there were two confederates—one of them said "What has this man done to you?" and without wait<lb></lb>ing for a reply threw me into a doorway—I attempted to follow again—I was not able to seize the other man—when I recovered I found my gold watch and part of my chain were gone—I went to the police-station and gave information and a description of the prisoner—I afterwards identified him from about 12 others at Bow Street—I have no doubt about him—there was a good light—he placed his face close to mine.</p>

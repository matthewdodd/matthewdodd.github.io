            . - Mr. Gurney. On the 7th of March were you in Mr. Clark's shop. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At about what time did this woman come in. A. About three o'clock; I was there employed as a weekly porter, to assist whatever might be wanted, sometimes to carry out parcels. The moment the prisoner came in she went to the counter, about two yards from the shop door; she remained there a short time I observed her roll up a piece of buff print: I saw her roll it up with her left hand at the same time with her right hand, pulling other prints apparently over it, to cover it from the shopman; as soon as she had rolled it up, she put it under her arm; she had a shawl on; she immediately walked backwards from the counter, and others came in before her next the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she buy any thing. - A. She did not at that time; she turned round and went quickly across the shop to go into the passage, to go out of the private door; I followed her and asked her what she had got under her arm; she said what she had got was her own, she had seven yards of print and had paid half a guinea for it; I took the print from under her arm; I asked Mr. Latham when I got her in the shop if he had shewed her that piece of print; he said it was the moment before on the counter; I then took her back into the accompting house, and sent for an officer. There is twenty yards of print; that is what I saw her take from the counter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. I did not understand you particularly, in what capacity are you employed. - A. As porter.</p>
               <p>Q. A porter's place and a constable is two things, do you stand there to serve customers, or to watch the customers. - A. I stand there to serve the customers, and carry out parcels; I never go behind the counter; sometimes when the shopmen are up at dinner I cut off goods.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the shop did she go in to purchase. - 
               <persName id="t18080406-44-person441">A. </persName>
            Nearly the middle; the further lamp was lighted at the further part of the shop; it was lit to day at twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How many customers might there be that day. - A. Twenty or thirty.</p>
               <p>Q. How many shopmen do you have to serve. - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court. Do not you know how many shopmen you have. - A. No, there may be about ten or eleven.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Are they all here to night. -

            No; the one that was serving the prints is here.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you upon your oath, did not the poor woman say at the time you stopped her, that she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180804060032"></xptr>was coming out of the dark part of your shop into the light to look at the article, for which she had made a deposit with your shopman. - A. She did not say that she was bargaining for the thing.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you took the goods from her into your possession, and took her to the shopman; did not she say that she had bought seven yards, and had deposited half a guinea for it, if she approved of it on examining it in the light. - A. No such a thing; she said she had bought seven yards of print and paid half a guinea for it.</p>

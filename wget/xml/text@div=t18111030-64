               <p>Q. Are you a lodger - A. Yes, I have the two lower rooms. She came about ten o'clock in the morning. I intended to keep her that night if she would stop; my husband went to bed about ten o'clock, my son went to bed soon afterwards. A woman that washed for me delivered my clothes about nine o'clock, they lay upon two chairs in the kitchen; the prisoner and me sat talking till near eleven o'clock, I told her she might sleep with me, and she wanted to stop to smoke some tobacco; I went to bed and went to sleep, I left her smoking; she was to have laid with me. My son got up about four o'clock to go a milking; I said where is Sally; he said she is gone, and the clothes were gone. I found her about half after ten at night on Michaelmas day. I sent for a constable, and she made off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your things again - A. No.</p>
               <p>TIMOTHY DWYER. I am the son of the last witness. I went to bed about ten o'clock at night, I got up about four in the morning to go for my milk, I found the door open, and the things gone. We made every enquiry, we could not find the prisoner until Michaelmas day, I found her at Mr. Morris's public-house, Great Saffron hill, I told the girl to go for an officer, and while I was speaking to the girl she ran out of the front door; I pursued her and stopped her by Hatton Wall.</p>
               <p>JOHN BARNLEY. I am an officer. The prisoner was brought to me, I searched her, and found nothing relating to this property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was at Mrs. Dwyer's house, she was in liquor, we had seven shillings worth of drink, beer and gin; we continued drinking; a woman brought in some washing and laid it on the table. After Mr. Dwyer and his son had gone to bed a tall woman in a black gown was there. Mrs. Dwyer sent me for two pots of beer before the public-house shut up. I left her and this woman about half after eleven at night.</p>

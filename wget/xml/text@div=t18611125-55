                  </hi>. I am the brother of Edwin Berryman, the captain of the brig <hi rend="italic">Milo</hi>—she is now in the West India docks—on 28th of May she was at sea—I do not know whereabouts; I did not navigate her—we were going from Liverpool towards Cuba—the prisoner was on board the vessel as an able seaman—there was also a sailor on board of the name of Pratt; he was also a man of colour—on 28th May the master was endea<lb></lb>vouring to put Pratt into irons for not doing as he was told, or something of that kind—he was violent, and resisted—while that was being done, the prisoner cam down from aloft, and called out to Pratt, "Don't give in to the b----"—he called that out several times; besides that he used other ex<lb></lb>pressions; I do not recollect what they were; they were inciting Pratt to resist—Pratt was ultimately put into irons—four persons were engaged in doing that, the chief mate, the second mate, the steward and I—the captain was at that time in the cabin—after Pratt was put in irons I came on deck—the prisoner was standing at the poop—the captain told him to go forward; to go down on the deck—he gave the captain some insolence at the time, but he went down after a time into the forecastle—the captain told him to go to his work—he was blacking the mainsheets, I believe—he did not do it—he went into the forecastle—the captain asked him several times to come out and he refused to do it—he said, "Come in and take me, you b----; come in and take me"—he said he would not come out—after he had been asked for some time, I and the second and chief mates went into the forecastle—the chief mate then asked him to come out again—he had been there about a quarter of an hour at that time—during that time the captain was endeavour<lb></lb>ing to get him out to his work—when the chief mate asked him again, he said he would not come out, and refused the same as he did before—the mate then attempted to take hold of him, and he went to resist, and we all laid hands on him, and he drew his knife in the struggle—he took it from his back—he had it concealed behind him, in some place or other—he had not a sheath on—it was a knife that goes into a sheath—I should think the blade was six inches long—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he stabbed me with it in the rump—it was done violently—I think it went in about an inch and three<lb></lb>quarters, the doctors say—the blood flowed very much—he said about the time he struck me that he would have the life of one of us—I do not recol<lb></lb>lect exactly when that was; it was before he struck the blow; before we went into the forecastle—he could not be taken—we went out of the forecastle, and the captain ordered him to be battened into the forecastle—we could not take him without—he <hi rend="italic">fired</hi> bottles several times; not while I was in the forecastle—I saw some bottles thrown out of the door and window—that was</p>

               <p>while the prisoner was there—we left him in the forecastle—I can't say how often be tired into the forecastle, two or three times; twice I think it was—he did not fire at him, because he had no chance, he was in a corner—he did not intend to hit him, it was merely to intimidate him, that was all—I did not see him holding up his pea-jacket to save himself from the shot—it was not after the shots had been fired at him that he flung the bottles out; it was before, and after also—I did not see the mate point his pistol through the stove-hole—the boatswain is second mate—I did not hear the captain order him to bore a bole on each side of the forecastle, large enough for a ball to go through; nothing of the sort—we kept him somewhere about two days and two nights in the forecastle.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever hear angry altercations between him and the captain before I <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I cannot say that I did—I never heard the captain say that the mate should take a hand-spike and lay him stiff on the spot—the captain never allowed the mate to strike him—I never heard him say anything like, "Mind what you are about or I will sacrifice you before you get to Cuba"—I did not hear the prisoner say to the captain that he was born under the British flag, and ruled by the laws of the country; nor the captain reply, "D----the flag, I know what flag you shall belong to"—I did not hear him say, "You shall not have a farthing when you are paid off; for the last fifteen years I have been complaining of the likes of you, and this is the way I serve them—I heard nothing of the sort—my wound is still a little sore at times, with very much walking or anything—I never heard the captain call the prisoner a black son of a b----h—this knife was used by the prisoner for work about deck—he carried it about with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am master of the ship <hi rend="italic">Milo</hi>—on 28th May, we were at sea about sixty or seventy miles from Cuba—some of the officers were engaged in endeavouring to put a man named Pratt, in irons—Pratt had laid up without any cause, with a small pimple on his finger; and he would not keep a look-out—we were getting close to the land, and were short-banded, having only four able seamen on board, with two boys—he was</p>

               <p>violent; he would not go in irons, and aid the whole ship could not put him in irons—he was a black man—the prisoner was on the mainyard at the time, blacking the topsail sheets—he had left about two or three feet undone—the mate told him to go on with it, he said he would not and he could not—I then told him I would not ask him to do anything I could not do myself and I went up to the mainyard outside of him, took the brash and blacked the chain; I then came down, and told him to go on with his work, which he did, swearing, and he upset a bucket of tar upon a new mainsail—directly after this I sent the mate forward to bring Pratt to me, that I might look at his finger—while Pratt was being put in irons the prisoner came down off the mainyard, saying, "Don't go in irons, Jack; don't go in irons for the b----"—I was on the poop at that time—he used strong language besides this—I ordered him to go to his work—he used all kinds of expressions—"Go to h----and be d----d," and instead of going to his work he went into the forecastle—I waited until the others came up from below, from putting Pratt in irons, and we then went forward to the forecastle—I told the prisoner to come out and go to his work; he said he would not, and told us to come and take him out; and the first man that came in he would have his life—he kept singing out, "Come and take me you b----, come and take me—I talked to him and told him to go to his work, and I called the crew and told them that man would not go to his work, and that he was armed with a knife, which the second mate called out—I told him the consequences if he did not go to his work, and told him the mate was going to arrest him with the second mate and my brother, and if he used a knife I would shoot him. at that moment—I went to the forward window of the forecastle with my revolver, which was loaded with shot—they went into the forecastle, and the first I heard was some one singing out, "I am stabbed"—they ran out of the forecastle door, I came aft and saw that my brother was stabbed in the right hip—I then went forward to the window to try and see where the prisoner was, and he threw a large quart glass bottle at me, full of palm oil—it struck me on the nose and face, and cut me very badly—he threw numerous bottles after that, whenever we went past the passage—I then fired two or three times through the window—I could not hit him from where I was—I did not try to do so—I did it to try and frighten him—I could not have hit him if I had tried to do so—I did not hit him—finding I could not get him out, I had to batten him up in the forecastle till we got to Cuba; and I had to put a small foolish boy that I had on board, in the passage while it was done—if the carpenter had tried to batten him up without that, he would have thrown bottles at him, but I knew he would not throw at the foolish boy, so I stood him in the passage, and then battened up the forecastle—when we got to Cuba he was taken out by the authorities—I saw my brother's hip—there was a wound nearly four, inches long, and I think the doctor said an inch and three-quarters deep—the doctor is not here—he was examined in Cuba—it was a very bad wound; it bled very considerably.</p>

RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> He was in irons at the time you took it from him, was he not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yea—I did not say to him, "You are my prisoner, and the law of England allows me to do as I like with you"—I do not recollect what I said to him—I did not say, "I will put you where you won't see to read your Bible"—I mean to swear that at the time I took it from him I did not know it was a Bible; I did not look at it at the time—it was an ordinary sized book—I did not say to him, "To-morrow I will take you ashore and put you in chains"—he was put in the stocks by order of the British Consul; that was not on the way home—it was at New Wales after we left Cuba; not on board, ashore—I put him ashore because the law of the mercantile navy tells me that I cannot keep a sailor on board in irons—I had nothing to do with putting him in the stocks—I did not tell him I had arranged it so that when I got him to England I would transport him or hang him; nothing of the sort—I have been a captain about two years—I have been on board a vessel altogether fifteen years—I have never been mixed up in any of these cases before—I have never given evidence before, or had evidence given against me—I swear that.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you returned the Bible to him the morning after you had taken it away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The steward took it to him by my orders—whatever took place after we got to Cuba, was by the direction of the Court there—the proceedings are lodged there; I brought a copy of them with me—he was tired at Cuba, and found guilty of mutinous conduct—whatever was done after I got to Cuba, was done by the direction of the authorities there; by the direction of the Naval Court—I had no option in the matter.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose you landed the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I applied to the British Consul for police officers, and he was landed—I made my complaint before the British Consul, and he convened a civil court, consisting of the masters of four British ships—the Spanish authorities had nothing what<lb></lb>ever to do with it—it was determined that the prisoner should be sent back here to take his trial, and I was to bring him back; and as I was going a long coasting voyage I was to take him along with me to the different ports I touched at, and then back to England in irons—my vessel was the only vessel that was going to England for two or three months, not from Havannah, but from St. Jago de Cuba—mine was the first vessel that was expected to get to England—Havannah is directly across the island—I don't suppose it would be above a hundred miles.</p>

                  </hi>. I am boatswain and carpenter on board the <hi rend="italic">Milo</hi>—I remember the 28th May, when Pratt was put in irons—while it was being done the prisoner came down from aloft—he said, "Don't give in to the b----s, <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>, don't give in to them—after Pratt was put in irons, the captain told the prisoner to turn to his work—the prisoner said he would do no more, he would be d----d if he would; and he went into the forecastle—I heard the chief mate, and likewise the captain, ask him civilly to come out and turn to his work—he said he would do no more—I suppose they were talking to him about a quarter of an hour—he said, "I will do no more; come in and take me, and I will have the life of some of you—after this I saw the mate and young Berryman go in; I went in with them—I had a wooden heaver in my hand, which the mate gave me—when we went in, the mate put his hand on the prisoner's' shoulder, and said, "Will you turn tot?"—the prisoner put himself in a fighting attitude—young Berry<lb></lb>man sprang in between them, and both of them were in a scuffle, and they had the prisoner down in a kind of a stoop—it is quite a narrow passage; the forecastle is on deck; and the galley is partitioned off from the forecastle—they did not have him down; they had him in a stooping position, and he sent the knife up from below into Berryman's leg—I saw that—after that Berryman ran out of the forecastle—he bled a good deal—I and the mate also ran out—the prisoner then went in round a corner of the partition, and stood with a knife in one hand, and a bottle in the other—I saw him throw a bottle at the captain which struck him on the face.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was that after the captain had fired at him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; before—the captain did fire at him I believe, with a pistol—I saw him fire at him—the shot did not strike him, because it could not, he was round the corner, and the captain stood in the doorway, and he fired right straight in—the captain could not see him from where he stood—the prisoner did not show me any of the shot afterwards—I swear that no shots were fired until after he struck Henry Berryman—I have not been talking to the other witnesses since they were examined—I had never heard the captain use violent language to the prisoner—I can't say whether or not he was struck while we were in the forecastle—he was not knocked down to my knowledge—he was in a stooping position—I suppose that was from their trying to drag him out of the forecastle—I did not put my hand upon him—Henry Berryman and the mate did—I did not see Berryman strike him; I don't know what he was armed with—he went in along with the mate—I did not use the heaver—I know nothing about the prisoner being kept for two days and more with very little food—I have not been talking this matter over with the captain and the mate coming home.</p>

               <p>she went to? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and back with her to England—the prisoner was not on board the whole of that time; he was ashore at St. Jago until we left, we then took him with us—he was used well and fairly fed; he did no work; he was not beaten or knocked about—he had as good a berth as any in the ship, except the captain—when he went to bed the handcuffs were still on—there was no person to undress him, or anything of the kind—he was un<lb></lb>dressed and washed—the young man that he stabbed used to wash him regularly—during the passage home he was kindly treated.</p>

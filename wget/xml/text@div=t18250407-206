On the 1st of April the prisoner came in and bought a yard of ribbon, which he paid for, and then asked for some silk<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070076"></xptr>handkerchiefs. I shewed him one, he said it was too small. I had reason to suspect him; he asked to see some coloured ones; I said, I had none; he asked to see some Irish linens. I had put this crape on the counter just as he came in - and as I reached the Irish, I saw him take the crape, and put it into his pocket, which was a large pocket, as long as his coat. I said,</p>
               <p>"You villain, you have taken that piece of crape." I collared and took him to the door, calling for assistance; he hit me on the side. I was obliged to let him go; he ran out, and I after him; a boy stopped him. I am certain he is the man; I took the crape from his pocket: it cost more than 40 s., wholesale price - it measures twenty-six yards.</p>

I looked at some handkerchiefs, which were too small. I asked to see some Irish. I took the crape up in my hand - she turned round, and said,</p>
               <p>"You thieving villain, how dare you be guilty of that." I said, I would put it down; she pulled me into the parlour, and sang out as loud as she could; I ran out of the shop - but I had stolen nothing.</p>

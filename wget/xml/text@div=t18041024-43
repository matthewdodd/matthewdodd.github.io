               <p>Q. Do you remember, on Wednesday the 3d of October, a black man coming to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know whether it was the prisoner at the bar? - A. No; I asked him if he wanted any clothes; he said he did not want clothes, he wanted something else; I told him to walk in, I sold watches; he came in, and pitched upon one old watch, and he agreed to give me two guineas for it; afterwards he gave me a ten pound note, and said he wanted change; I told him I had not got change, but I would go to a neighbour and get it; I went to Mr. Newton's, and he gave me ten one pound notes for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know either of these notes? - A. No, I cannot write nor read.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any recollection of the man? - A. I don't think it is the man; it was a man, I am sure, a head less than that man.</p>
               <p>Q. A black man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You sold him a watch; look at that watch? - A. I had several watches like that.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that again? - A. It is very hard to swear without being sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you no marks upon your watches? - A. I cannot read nor write.</p>
               <p>Q. There may be marks upon it that you may know, without being able to read and write? - A.I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it this string with it? - A. No, only a bit of packthread.</p>
               <p>Q. What change did you give him? - A. Seven single notes.</p>
               <p>Q. What small change did you give him? - A. My wife sold him eighteen shillings worth of other things.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you by at that time? - A. No; I gave him in change seven pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that waistcoat? - A. I sell such waistcoats, but I cannot tell whether that is one or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180410240036"></xptr>Q. You cannot say that the watch and waistcoat are not the same? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. But to the same man were sold a watch and a waistcoat? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The waistcoat and handkerchief went from you stock, but you did not see it delivered by your wife? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you make waistcoats? - A. No, I buy them ready-made.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose you had been robbed of those things, you would not have been able to have sworn to them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Holloway. When I took this watch to Moses, the next day, he told me that was the watch he sold to the black man.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Moses.) Q. Now I call upon you to recollect whether you did or not state that to be the watch you have sold? - A. By sight I could nearly swear to it, but there are many alike.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had a watch, to get a glass and a minute-hand put to it -</p>
               <p>Jury. (To Wendy.) Q. Did he, before the Magistrate, offer to produce any Greeks? - A. No, he did not; he said they lived in East Smithfield, and I went the next day but none of them came.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The waistcoat was given to me by a black man, a Greek, that lives in East-Smithfield; on Saturday night we had a little merriment; I gave the servant the waistcoat and jacket to put up for me, and on Sunday morning they were both gone; I went to my comrade, a black man, a Greek, and asked him if he had a waistcoat to lend me; he told me, he had never a one just then, but would get one for me, and he bought this waistcoat for me.</p>

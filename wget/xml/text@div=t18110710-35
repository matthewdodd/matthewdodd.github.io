             I am a waterman and lighterman by business; I have known the prisoner six or seven years. Last September I was standing on Tower Hill, he asked me if I wanted a watch for my own wear; I told him I did not; he said he had a very good one that he had made for a gentleman in the country, it was in pledge for two guineas, he wanted money, and he had pawned it; he said if I did not want it myself there was room for me to get a guinea by it; it was a capped watch; he produced a duplicate in the name of Smith, a silver watch, two guineas; he said he always pawned his things in that name: I had the duplicate, and got the watch out at Mr. Christie's, Butcher-row, East Smithfield; he charged me five shillings; he said he would see me the next day; he did, he took the watch and opened it; he said that was the watch, he asked me if I would buy it out, I said, yes: he asked me what I was going to give him for it. It stood me in two pounds seven shillings. I think I gave him fourteen shillings. I wore it a month. Last February the main spring broke, the prisoner put another in; he lodged at my house then. I wanted money, I pledged the watch the sessions before last, at Mr. Windsor's, the corner of Essex-street, Whitechapel, for two guineas.</p>
               <p>COURT. How came you to know any thing about the prosecutor - A. Some conversation came out at the time a cause was tried at the Sheriff's Court, six or seven weeks ago; I was in company with the prosecutor at the Elephant and Castle, Moorgate. I his is the same watch there is Camarthen upon it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Mr. Lill have you had any quarrel with the prisoner - A. No, he lodged in my house. I never had any dispute with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor is there any account between you that is not settled - A. Yes, there is. When that cause was tried he went away with ten weeks rent, at seven shillings a week, which was not paid.</p>
               <p>Q. There were no words, was there - A. Yes, there were some words.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you - A. I am an officer in the impress service.</p>
               <p>Q. This excepting your appearance at Clerkenwell Sessions, was the first time that you were in a court of Justice - A. No, my lord knows better than that; I was here last winter as a witness.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in custody - A. No, I was not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find your way to Horsemonger-lane the College or the Jail there - A. I was there upon a charge of felony.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the only time that you have been in custody - A. It is not. I was in custody at the Thames Police office.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon what charge - A Upon my life I do not know. I was taken in custody, and sent to the house of Correction, and in my younger years I have been in custody several times.</p>
               <p>COURT. Were you ever tried - A. At the Guildford aflizes I was; I was at the galley, a man asked me to give him a lift up with some cotton some officer was there, I was taken up. I have been accused but never tried.</p>

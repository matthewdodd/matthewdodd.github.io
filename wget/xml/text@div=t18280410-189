               <p>MICHAEL DIBLY. I work for Messrs. Stringer and Co. On the 10th of February, about ten o'clock at night, I was at the <placeName id="t18280410-189-crimeloc1015">Three Crows public-house, City Road</placeName>

            . I belong to the Guards. I was at the house, and saw Dibley, Morris, and Harding there; Cooper was not there - the prisoner sat next to Morris, who had the watch some time in her hand, and then laid it down by the prisoner, who took it up and gave it to Harding; he put it into his bosom, and went out; Davis followed; Dibley then went to the bar for an officer to take the girl; the prisoner was taken to the watch-house; I am sure he is the man who had the watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me in the room before ten o'clock? A. Yes: I had come from Ware that day.</p>

            . I was at the watch-house when the complaint was made - I knew the prisoner, and on the Tuesday following I went and took him; I told him it was for a watch; he said, "I may thank Cooper for this" - he afterward said, "I admit I was in the room; but I had nothing to do with the watch" - the watch was returned to the prosecutor at the office by some girls.</p>

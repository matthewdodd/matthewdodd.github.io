               <p>These pious Exhortations wrought much upon R. O. and he continued very penitent confessing that he was as free to dye as to live, were it not for his wife and Children, lamenting more them, that they should be the offspring of such a Parent, desiring his friends to take care so to Instruct them, that their Fathers end might not hereafter be a reproach to them.</p>

Confessed the sinfulness of his Life, but more particularly bewayr'd his sin of Sadbath-breaking, of which he had been very Guilty, that he had been no less a prophane hearer, he was deeply sensible of the Injury he had done the person, whose Life he had taken away; and was willing to satisfy blood for blood, since no other satisfaction could be given.</p>
               <p>W. N. Confessed that he had been a great oppressor of the poor in his Office, whom he had very much wronged by Extortion. That he had been a very great scoffer at the miscarriages of other men, and too much Guilty of that huffing pride and insolency, which is too common among men of their Condition, he exhorted therefore and those that had the same Imployment to take warning by him, not to exceed the bounds of Mercy, nor to stand upon the utmost points of Rigour and Justice but above all to beware of being false to their trusts and of extortion, by which he had undone many poor people.</p>
               <p>Yet as mercy is not denyed the worst of sinners, they went not without hopes of mercy to the place of Execution, being all extreamly penitent and freely resigning themselves into the hand of Justice.</p>

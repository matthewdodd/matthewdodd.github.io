                  </hi>. I have been a widow five weeks, and am the only executor of my husband; I live in the parish of St. Dunstan's, Stepney; the house is my dwelling-house. On Thursday morning, 27th June, I missed my watch and chain from the looking-glass in the first-floor back-room—I had seen it safe on the Wednesday morning—on the Wednesday afternoon, about four o'clock, the prisoner Lawrence came—my boy called me into the shop where he was—I did not know him, and he said, "How do you do, Mrs. Snowden?"—I then found I had known him five years before, and asked him to stop tea—we had tea in the parlour at the side of the shop, and I went backwards and forwards into the shop—Miss Hall was in the room with us, and when I went out of the room I left her with Lawrence—he said it looked a large house, and asked me how many rooms I had—I said I had only four up-stairs, and told him if he would wait till the shopman came in I would show him over it—he waited, and I did so—I was with him all the time—I did not notice my watch and chain then—he left at about a quarter to seven, and next morning I missed them—I went to his house, but could not find him, and he came to me late in the evening, and said I had been to his house breaking his wife's heart, and that I had been suspecting him wrongfully—I told him I had not charged him, I only suspected him, as no one else had been through the house—he advised me to go to the station—I went to Arbour-square—I went to his house next morning, and he took me to a house in Newington-causeway, where there was a sick man lying, and he told me that was the man be had sold my watch to—I called again at the same place, and saw Mary Dunn, who took me to a public-house, where I paid 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and got my watch—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I think it cost 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

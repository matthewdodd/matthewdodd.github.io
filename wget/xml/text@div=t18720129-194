                  </hi>. live at 61, Theobald's Road, Holborn, and am a collector—the prisoner was a servant in my employ—on the morning of 5th January I was awoke about 4 o'clock by Mrs. Guthrie, one of my lodgers, and went down stairs to the back parlour—I found the curtains were burnt, the arm chair was on fire at the time, and the bar of a little fancy table was burnt nearly through; that was out, it had been burnt, and a child's chair which was underneath that table was also burnt—there was some paper burnt, in the cupboard, and on the top of that there were three pieces of wood; the paper was burnt, and the wood had been blackened and charred—the flooring was burnt, and the wood round the window was charred—the table which was burnt was in the same position as it was left over night—I went to the prisoner's bedroom—the door was partly open, and a pail put against the door, apparently to keep it open; that was where she sleeps—the prisoner was partly dressed, with her night dress over her other things—when I came down she was in the room, on the threshold of the door—the bed was not made; she had not made it for the night, as she generally does—I said to her "Esther, have you set fire to this place?"—she said "No, somebody must have been in and done it"—her room was close to the room which was burning—I said it was very strange that it should be on fire in such different places—she made no reply to that—there were three places on fire—I went to the door and got a constable—the prisoner's room is next to the room that was on fire, and her room door was open—when the constable came, he asked me if I would give her in charge—I said to him when he came in, "I wish to give my servant in charge for attempting to set fire to the premises"—the con<lb></lb>stable questioned her, and she said she broke open the cupboard to get some tea—he asked her if she had done it—she said she opened the cup<lb></lb>board to get some sugar to sweeten some tea that she had made, and we found there had been no tea made—she said she dropped the paper in the cupboard, where the wood was put over it, an she went to get a light to look for the sugar—there was a grate in the room, but there was no appearance of any fire in it—the prisoner said "I dropped the paper inside the cup<lb></lb>board"—the cupboard door was open, and I saw the charred paper there—she said she forced open the cupboard door with the screw-driver—the door was locked over night—she said she had got out of bed, went to the cup<lb></lb>board to make some tea, and forced it open with a screw-driver—there was</p>

I am the wife of James Guthrie, a compositor—he is dying of consumption—I lodge in the house of Mr. Brogden—on the morn<lb></lb>ing of 5th January, about 4 o'clock, I had occasion to get up to attend to my sick husband—my room is two floors above the shop—my room became full of smoke—I took my lamp and went down stairs to the kitchen—I found the fire was not there and I went to the passage, level with the shop—I looked in the parlour but I could not see my hand before me, for the smoke was so great—I put my hand against the door and put my leg against a zinc pail which propped the door open—I went in to where the prisoner slept—she was lying on the bed, partly dressed, but her night-dress was over her petticoats—I said "How can you lie there with the place all on fire, and this smoke?"—she said "I have not done it, some one must have come in and done it"—she raised herself up in bed—I looked into the adjoining room, that is the back parlour, and I saw the easy-chair was all red, on fire, and I instantly closed the door and proceeded to Mr. Brogden's bed-room and he came down—the prisoner's door was propped open by a zinc pail—it was the next room to the parlour—when Mr. Brogden arrived he moved the burning furniture into the yard—the prisoner's mistress said to her "How can this fire have come here?"—she said she did not know anything about it, that somebody must have done it—her mistress then said "What can have become of the curtains, where can they have gone to?" and she said "Did you go to bed?"—she first said that she did go to bed—her mistress said "If you did go to bed you had no candle or matches; how did you come by the light; you must know how you got the light, Esther?"—she said "I never turned the gas out"—and she also said she had not been to bed—her mistress said "How was it you did not go to bed, or what male you get up; if you acknowledge going to bed, what made you get up;" and she said "I got up in the night to make tea"—her mistress then went to the sideboard cupboard and she perceived that it was forced open and the look was partly hanging down—she asked the prisoner why she went to it, and she said she went to get the sugar to make tea in the night—when the constable came she said "I broke open the cupboard by a screw-driver"—she said that in going to the cupboard she had dropped a piece of paper and that set light to the long curtains and that she pulled them down—they were long white muslin curtains, and were attached by a string at the top</p>

I was called by Mr. Brogden to his house, 61, Theobald's Road, Holborn, about 5.15 on the morning of 5th January—I went into the back parlour, and saw the prisoner and Mrs. Brogden and Mrs. Guthrie there—Mr. Brogden said "Policeman, this is a very mysterious affair; someone has set fire to my furniture here in the back parlour"—Mrs. Guthrie was standing on the sill of the door—she came into the room, and said about 4 o'clock she came out of her room, and found the place full of smoke; she came down stairs, and saw the prisoner lying on her bed, partly dressed; she pushed open the parlour door, and saw the back parlour furniture in flames, burning; after she had woke the prisoner up, she asked her how she could account for the fire, and she said she knew nothing about it—the prisoner was present at that time—I saw an arm chair that Mr. Brogden had taken out into the back yard, and a child's small chair—the legs were burnt and black—the parlour window was burnt very much, and a pair of curtains had been pulled down, and were partially burnt—the cupboard in the sideboard was open, and at the entrance there was some paper and wood built up—there were three separate places in the room where fire had been—after Mrs. Brogden found the cupboard broken open, she said "Esther, you must know something of this, sleeping so close to it"—I was examining the cupboard at that time—there were marks on it, and there was a screw-driver close by—the prisoner said "I forced open the cupboard, for the purpose of getting some tea and sugar, and I must have dropped the light in the cupboard when I was looking for the tea and sugar"—Mr. Brogden then said "I shall give her into custody for forcing open the cupboard, and on suspicion of setting fire to my place"—she said "I know nothing about setting fire to it; I did not do it"—she was taken to the station—I found on her a bag of money, containing about 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver and copper—there was a farthing, which Mr. Brogden identified as being a portion of his money.</p>

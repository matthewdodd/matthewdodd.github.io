                  </hi>, I am a watchmaker, and live at 40, Princes-street, Leicester-square. The watch now produced was made by me, about three or four years ago I think—it has my name on it, and "Princes-street, Leices<lb></lb>ter-square," was also engraved on it at that time—that has been removed since it went from me—it is a gold watch with a duplex escapement, jewelled in four holes, with a compensation-balance, and seconds—a very superior kind of watch—I charged 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I made it for Mr. George Bullock—from circumstances that have since arisen, I remember the sale of some valuable property in April, 1844, advertised to take place at Messrs. Debenham and Store's—shortly before that sale, a person named Richardson called on me—he is a customer of mine—he called with a piece of paper, with the number of this watch on it, and made some in<lb></lb>quiry about the watch—I gave him my opinion upon it—I saw him again I think about the Friday after the sale—I go to wind his clocks every week, and when I saw him there, he told me the watch had been stolen from Debenham and Store's—I then lost sight of the transaction until Aug. last, when the watch was brought to me by the witness Cloughly—something took place between us, which led to our going to Debenham and Store's.</p>

I have been acquainted with the prisoner more than twenty years—I bought this watch of him—I cannot speak positively as to the time—I had had a watch of him before, with which I was not quite satisfied, and applied to him to give me another in exchange—this memorandum is the settlement we came to on the matter—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Mr. Cloughly, to Thomas Wimbush, May 1844, to a duplex gold watch, 13 guineas"—this is that watch—this is in the pri<lb></lb>soner's handwriting—whether it was in May, 1844, that I bought the watch, I cannot swear—I had asked him two or three times to have a settlement of the affair, and he said, "I am not exactly positive as to the time, can you tell me?"—I said I did not think I could—he said, perhaps he might remember, and it was put at the nearest time we could both recollect—he afterwards had the watch from me for a fortnight or three weeks, to have a new spring put to it—I was afterwards passing down Princes-street, and saw the name of Walker over the door, and I thought I would see if he was the maker, and if it wanted any little alter<lb></lb>ation he would do it—there was no address on the watch at that time, nor when I bought it—the name occurred to me quite perchance in passing—Mr. Walker made a communication to me on the subject, which led us both to Debenham and Storr's</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I made an excuse, and said for something I had forgotten—I then proceeded on my way, and he with me as far as Holborn—he said his wife was going off from the Bell and Crown by the coach, that afternoon, and if I went as far as there he would go into the City with me—but he only went as far as there, and then I left him, and went on about my business—I do not remember the name of the house I dined at in Maiden-lane—I was always in the habit of dining there at that time—but I never dined there when the prisoner has been dining there—I had only been in his company once before, in New-street, Covent-garden—he came in while I was dining there, that is the only time I remember.</p>

I am a refiner and gilder, and live in Clerk<lb></lb>enwell—I buy gold—I purchased a bar of gold of the prisoner on the 20th of April, 1844—it was what is termed a skillet of gold, melted into two flat pieces of iron—I should say it might be done in the ordinary furnace of a working jeweller—it weighed 11 oz. 14dwts.—I paid him 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—I might have made purchases of him before of a very trifling character, and I have done a little gilding for him—his dealings were not large—I never made a purchase of him approaching to this in value—I never pur<lb></lb>chased any bar of melted gold of him before to my knowledge.</p>

Mr. Debenham dwells in the house—it is the parish of St. Paul, Covent-garden—the watch in question belonged to Miss Fleming—the golden casket was in the Thurs<lb></lb>day's sale, and the other articles in the Wednesday's sale—this watch would attract the particular attention of dealers—of course an old gold watch would attract attention; but this particularly, because it is a very superior watch, and one that we very rarely have—we advertised our loss, and offered 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. reward—I know the person of the prisoner—he was in the habit of dealing at our establishment, not very largely.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Pamphillon, a shoemaker, of 16, Arthur Street—on the night of 29th September, about 7 o'clock, the prisoner, who is a labourer, came to the house—I told him he was not to come in; if he did I would send for a policeman and have him turned out—he called me a wh——I asked him if he could prove that I was a wh——he went out, and between 9 and 10 he came back—he knocked at the door; I opened it, and said he was not to come in, and if he did I would send for a policeman and have him turned out—he came in—there was a candle on the table—he took it up and went into the back room—I followed him and said "There is nothing in here belonging to you"—upon that he blew out the candle, caught hold of me, and threw me on the ground—I felt him feeling for my throat, and I put up my hand and felt the knife and caught hold of it—he said he would murder me—he let go of the knife when I caught hold of it—I had a cut in my right hand on the thumb—I got up, lighted the candle, and went into the front room—the cut on the thumb was as I held the knife—the cut was received in my taking hold of the knife—when I went into the front room my husband came home—I opened the door—the prisoner was then sitting in a chair in the front room—he had gone in there before me; he had only just sat down—my husband said "What is the matter?"—I said "Fetch a policeman and lock him up"—he went to fetch a policeman—the candle was lighted when my husband came in; I had lighted it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My husband came in directly after I was cut, it might have been four or five minutes, by the time I lighted the candle and went from one room to the other—the rooms do not open the one from the other; there is a passage to go down—I was not remaining in the room with the prisoner; I had only just got into the front room as my husband came in—he did not say anything about the prisoner being there; he only said "What is the matter?"—the prisoner lived next door—he was in the habit of coming to our house when I was alone—he has not stayed very long, sometimes half an hour—a person lodged upstairs—there was nobody in the room at this time but the children, one is four years old, and the other two—he was always coming in sometimes when my</p>

               <p>husband was at home, and sometimes not, very nearly every night—my husband has found fault with me for having the prisoner to see me when he was away—he expressed no surprise at seeing him there on this occasion, because as soon as he came in he saw me bleeding, and asked what was the matter—I did not say that in forcing his way in he cut my hand—I never said so to anybody.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. My hand was bleeding very much; I had it rolled is my apron—my husband saw my hand, and the baby I had in my arms was covered with blood—he did not ask me how it came to be in such a condition—there were no angry words between me and the prisoner; before he did this he had called me a wh—at seven o'clock, and said he would come in to annoy us—I always told my husband when the prisoner came—I have never told him he had not been when he had—my husband told him he did not wish him to come, and if he did he should shut the door in his face—ho continued to come after that—I don't know whether the knife was lying on the table; I did not see him pick it up—as soon as I got into the room he seized hold of me, and threw me on the floor—we have not found the knife; I must have put it down after taking it from him—I don't know what became of it—it was a black-handled knife—we had been using it that day at dinner time—there was not a bed in the room where this happened—he had the knife in his hand when he threw me on the ground—I did not see the knife, I felt it; it was dark, I could not see—I think he was kneeling down beside me—I struggled, but I did not catch hold of anything.</p>

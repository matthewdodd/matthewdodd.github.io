Upon examining an old trunk in his room, I found a bit of cloth, tied up with some white tape; I cut it, and felt something pretty thick; in it was a bit of silk tied up; I opened that, and there I found five half bank notes. I seeing some old print upon one of them, I looked at it, and said, I am sure this is not for less than a thousand pounds, because I could see the end of the word thousand, it can be no other word.

               <p>M. Harris. He consented to it, that it was so.</p>
               <p>Q. What country woman is she?</p>
               <p>M. Harris. She comes from Derbyshire; her father is dead; I know her two brothers</p>
               <p>Q. In what circumstances was her father?</p>
               <p>M. Harris. I have heard they were poor people, and kept a little farm of about 20 or 30 l. a year.</p>
               <p>Q. What was she when you knew her first?</p>
               <p>M. Harris. Then she was just come from a service in Watling-street, at the sign of the tea-chest.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she receive wages there?</p>
               <p>M. Harris. I believe she did.</p>
               <p>Q. What was her master's name?</p>
               <p>M. Harris. I think the name was Hanison; she lodged at Mr. Jefferson's, a grocer, by Temple bar, in Shire-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she use to appear?</p>
               <p>M. Harrison. She had scarce any cloaths at all, nor no money at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her when she went from that lodging?</p>
               <p>M. Harris. I did not for about two years after.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see her since?</p>
               <p>M. Harris. I saw her on the last fast-day; she called upon me, and gave me an invitation to go and see her, and I went to see her on the fast-day.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she appear then?</p>
               <p>M. Harris. She appeared very much in an exalted state; I was so surprized to see it, I took the liberty to ask how she came to be possessed of so large a fortune.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>M. Harris. This was the 5th of last March, when I went to live with her, and also before, when I went to see her.</p>
               <p>Q. What account did she give you?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176110210035"></xptr>M. Harris. She told me her fortune came by a person belonging to a picture that hung in her dining room.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner then?</p>
               <p>M. Harris. He was then in Newgate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever go with her there to him?</p>
               <p>M. Harris. I did, almost every day, and sometimes twice a day; I heard her tell him she had shewed me his picture, and what discourse had passed between she and I; that is, what she had told me. Mr. Perrott asked me if I thought the picture was like him.</p>
               <p>Q. In what situation did she then live?</p>
               <p>M. Harris. She lived in a plentiful manner; Mr. Perrott used to make her great promises how they should live when he came out of New-gate; and she told him about a house of Mr. Smith's to be disposed of. He made an objection, and said there was not room sufficient to keep a pair of horses. He said he would make her a present of a pair of diamond buckles, and a pair of diamond ear-rings, and lay out upon her 300 l. When she went to buy this house of Mr. Smith's, she took half a Bank-note for 1000 l. and said the other half was in the hands of Mr. Perrott in Newgate. They had a great deal of conversation relating to notes, and other things. When she told him that house was to be sold, he said, My dear, have you a mind for it? She said, Yes, if she could have it for eight or 900 l. Mr. Perrott said, My life for it, you shall have it, for I like the place above all things.</p>
               <p>Q. from Prisoner. When did I promise her these diamond buckles and ear-rings?</p>
               <p>M. Harris. I cannot exactly tell the time, but it was all within the time I lived with her; it was when we were with him in Newgate. I went to live with her on the 5th of March.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hewitt. Was there any agreement between you, that Perrott should be denied to you, in order that he should be a bankrupt?</p>
               <p>Hewitt. There was a meeting of a great number of the creditors at the Half-moon tavern, the night before he was denied; I believe it was the night that I went to his house. It was the night before the act of bankruptcy was committed. It was agreed between him and the creditors, that he should be denied to any one of them, that he might be a bankrupt; and he was denied to me, in consequence of that agreement; he was denied to another also.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that person?</p>
               <p>Hewitt. I do not know now; I cannot recollect that; it was one of the creditors that was at the Half moon tavern.</p>
               <p>Q. from Prisoner. Was you at my house in the morning, and in my company?</p>
               <p>Hewitt. I was; that was previous to that day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That was the very same morning.</p>
               <p>Q. from Prisoner. Did not you go out at the back-door?</p>
               <p>Hewitt. I believe I did.</p>
               <p>Q. from Prisoner. Do you remember a circumstance of your asking my apprentice whether I was at home? What was the answer?</p>
               <p>Hewitt. I cannot tell the answer.</p>
               <p>Q. from Prisoner. Do not you remember a circumstance of your coming to ask my apprentice, Bagley, concerning his master, and he said to you he was at home, and you answered he must say he was not at home; you knew he was at home.</p>
               <p>Hewitt. That I do not remember.</p>
               <p>Q. from Prisoner. Do you remember my going out at the back-door?</p>
               <p>Hewitt. No.</p>
               <p>Q. from Prisoner. Did you call upon any business to ask for money, or if I had any bills?</p>
               <p>Hewitt. I had a note of the prisoner's, payable at a banker's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner owe you any money?</p>
               <p>Hewitt. He owed me a large sum of money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had bought goods of Mr. Hewitt, upon nine months credit; none was become due then.</p>
               <p>Hewitt. I called upon him then on account of hearing some of his bills had been returned, to know if it was true, being willing to know what situation he was in.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether any money was due to you on the 19th of January?</p>
               <p>Hewitt. I cannot tell; unless I look into my books; I had a draught of his upon a banker, and that was returned me; then it became necessary for me to apply to Perrott for the money.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that?</p>
               <p>Hewitt. Not that day, but the day after.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it before, or after the issuing the commission?</p>
               <p>Hewitt. It was paid after he was denied.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he pay you that money?</p>
               <p>Hewitt. I believe that very same day.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not that before the issuing of the commission?</p>
               <p>Hewitt. I did not receive the money of him after the commission was entered; the commission was issued on the 19th, which was the day after.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176110210036"></xptr>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>My lord, all I have to say is this, that Thompson sold goods is very true; but what debts he took, how he negotiated them, I cannot say. All the debts I received of him, I sent to Mrs. Powell to Bath, and Weybridge. It is a very great unhappiness to me, that Mr. Thompson is dead; what he knew he would testify. As to those notes, half with me, and half with Mrs. Ferne, they were Mrs. Ferne's own. I have laid in Newgate so long, I have none but she to support me; she has sent me a bit of meat, tea, and sugar, and those little things; and she requested of me to take them half Bank-bills into my portmanteau. I thought I should be very ungrateful, if I did not; and the reason she gave me was, her house had been attempted to have been broke open twice; and for the favours she was pleased to compliment me with, she said she thought she had some little right so to do. They asked me for the key; I gave them it. When they found these half Bank-bills sewed up by Mrs. Ferne, Mr. Brown has positively sworn they were covered with a piece of white cloth in a bit of silk. They were covered with a bit of white dimity. When I asked him to take an account of them (for I did not know what notes they were, neither did I ever see them) he would not let me, but carried them away.</p>

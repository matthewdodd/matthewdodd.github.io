                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 141). On 11th Nov. I was on duty in Baker-street, Stepney, between 1 and 2 o'clock in the morning—I heard a cry of "Police!" and saw the prisoner quarrelling with some prostitutes—he struck one of them a hard blow—I remonstrated with him, and endea<lb></lb>voured to persuade him to go away, but finding that he could not understand English, I motioned to him with my hand, which he seemed to under<lb></lb>stand, and walked away—he then came back towards me again, and wanted to go to the prostitutes violently, but I stood in front of him—he turned round, met me, pulled out this American bowie knife, and made a back<lb></lb>handed blow at me with it—I had been cautioned by the women that he had a knife or a dagger—I think he drew it from a sheath in his pocket—I am sure it would have touched me if I had not moved—he then followed me, and made another blow at me with it; it was with the greatest diffi<lb></lb>culty that I could keep clear of him by leaning back—I drew my staff, and struck a blow at him which missed him, and he ran away—I chased him for a quarter of a mile.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shipping clerk, of No. 5, New-road, Step<lb></lb>ney. I heard cries of "Police!" and "Murder!" in the Commercial-road—I went down Sidney-street, which leads to Baker-street, which is full of women of the town—I saw eight or ten women gathered together, and a policeman directing the prisoner to go along, but not touching him—I then suddenly saw a knife go at the policeman, and I said, "You are stabbed"—I drew back against the wall, the prisoner rushed past, and the policeman after him—I only saw him strike at the policeman once—the prisoner ran with the knife in his hand as far I could see—I omitted to state that after the blow the policeman drew his truncheon, and made a desperate blow at him, which, if it had struck him, would certainly have knocked him down—I am sure he is the man.</p>

On the morning of 11th Nov., about 2 o'clock, I saw the prisoner in the Commercial-road, arm in arm with a female—he had been described to me as a foreigner, and I stopped him, and said, "What countryman are you?"—he made no answer—I said, "Are you a Spaniard?"—he said, <hi rend="italic">"Me no savez</hi>"—I asked him if he was a Frenchman—he said, "<hi rend="italic">Me one</hi> Frenchman"—I said, "I think you have got a knife"—he said, "<hi rend="italic">Me</hi> got no knife"—I put my hand to his right trowsers pocket, outside, and felt something—he then put his hand to the pocket—I seized him by the wrist, and took this knife from him—he was loath to part with it, but I put my finger under the cross piece, and took it</p>

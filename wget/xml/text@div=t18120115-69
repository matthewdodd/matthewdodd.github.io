On the 12th of last December the prisoner came to work about half past eight in the morning: the box containing the gold filings were in the shop under the charge of my apprentice, placed on one of the work boards; the apprentice was then called out of the shop, and the prisoner was left alone. Shortly after that another man came to work, and was followed close up stairs by the apprentice; the box then containing the filings was taken away by the apprentice. I shortly after weighed them, and found it to be deficient sixteen pennweights. There was some missing on the morning before. It was weighed on the 11th at night, the last thing, in the presence of my apprentice. About twelve o'clock I sent to Bow-street for an officer; he came and asked the prisoner if he had any gold about him; the prisoner answered, no; he searched him and found in his breeches pocket a small grain; he searched his fob and found a paper, he asked the prisoner what it contained; he said, gold. The officer found another paper, he asked what it contained; he said, gold. It was weighed in the presence of the prisoner and the officer, I found the weight that we missed out of the box.</p>
               <p>- ROBINSON. I am an apprentice to Mr. Allen. I saw the gold weighed on the 11th of December at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it on the work board when the prisoner came to work in the morning - A. Yes. I saw the gold found in his fob.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. This is the gold filings that I lost by the chips that come off; they are chips and filings together.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had a brother that was sick for six years, he worked at home, and after he was dead I looked over his box I found these filings, there is a very little gold in it I believe.</p>

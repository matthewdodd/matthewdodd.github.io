               <p>I am thirteen the 11th of next May.</p>
               <p>Do you know the consequence of telling a lye? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is it? - If I tell a lye, I must go to the devil; I live with Mr. Garrard; he is a linen-draper; I carried some linen for him, on Saturday, the 9th of January, to Whitechapel, from Watling-street, about two in the afternoon; a man took the linen away from me in Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>How many men took it away from you? - Two.</p>
               <p>Have you ever seen the men before? - No.</p>
               <p>What did they say to you? - I went into a house to ask my way, and two men came up to me, and said they were going to the house; and they took me down ever so many entries.</p>
               <p>Do you know the names of the places where they conducted you? - No, I cannot say I do: then they wanted to feel the weight of my parcel, and asked me to let them carry it, which I did not; I refused it; then one took hold of me by the arm; he stood before me.</p>
               <p>Do you know the men again? - Yes; the prisoner is one of them.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner do? - It was he that held me.</p>
               <p>And the other man took away the things? - Yes; then that man had hold of me; and afterwards he took a letter which I had, out of my hand, and tore it open, and almost tore it to pieces; the man that took the things from me, ran away.</p>
               <p>Did you cry out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did you call? - I did not call any body.</p>
               <p>Nor you did not cry? - They made me cry.</p>
               <p>What did this person do, after he took this letter and tore it? - Then he delivered it to me again; then he pointed the way where the other was gone; and he pointed a wrong way; then I went up some places, and then I met the patrol; and then I got into the street: then they had me home; and afterwards, they asked my master whether they were to go after him; and then they went after him.</p>
               <p>Did you ever get the cloth again? - Yes; he caught the man and the cloth, but I was not there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. You did not know either of the people before? - I never saw them before.</p>
               <p>The description you gave of them, was, that they had white jackets on? - Yes, I knew him by his face</p>

               <p>When was it? - I do not know; you look in the book; you know.</p>
               <p>You object to answering then, when you was ordered to be transported? - That is no business to you.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you the goods here? - Yes: on the 9th, the Saturday before last, about four in the afternoon, the little boy came to my house with one of our patrols from Whitechapel; he told me that the boy was robbed of a bundle.</p>

               <p>From what house? - The Duke's Head in Wildford-street.</p>
               <p>Who were the three men you took? - The prisoner and two more: the goods were not there.</p>
               <p>Where were the goods? - They had a dispute among them, in the presence of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He said he never was guilty.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said so? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How did you get these goods? - I took one of them out; he says, you go with me to another public-house, and I shall deliver you the goods; I left two men in possession of the prisoner, and I went to another public-house in Petticoat-lane; and then he sent for his brother; and he told his brother that he should go to Woolpack-alley, in an open cellar, and he would find the property; I sent one of our patrols with him.</p>
               <p>Then you was not present at the time of finding the goods? - No.</p>

               <p>What did you do with the goods afterwards? - I delivered them to Mr. Emanuel; he took them to his house.</p>
               <p>Did you examine the goods at the time? - Yes; there is a piece of cotton that I marked (produced); this is the same; this is the mark, 1367, 2880.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. So it was Silva's brother that gave them to you, and you let him off? - He ran away.</p>

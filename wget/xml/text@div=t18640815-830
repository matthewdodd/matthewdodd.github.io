                  </hi>. I am a salesman in the employ of Messrs. Bransby, upholsterers, in the Old Kent road—on a Monday in July, Trevoy came there with Linsey and asked to see some carpets—I showed him some, and he selected one—he then selected a bedstead, mattrass, and palliasse, two chairs, and a looking-glass—he gave his name Edward Trevoy, 21, South-road, Rye-lane, Peckham, and told me to send the goods the same night as he wanted them for the servant to sleep on—I told him our terms were cash on delivery—I despatched the porter with the goods the same evening, and gave him directions not to leave them without the money, but he brought back neither goods or money—I went on the Wednesday to the address he gave, and met Trevoy in the street—I said, "Mr. Trevoy, I want our goods"—he Said, "I have no goods of yours"—I said, "That is false"—he said, "The house is locked up, and you shall not have them"—one of our men had got into the house while I was talking to him—we then went to the house—Trevoy went in, but would not let me in—a policeman was there, and Trevoy gave our man in custody—the man got over the gate, and the policeman as well as Trevoy would not unlock it, and would not let me in—I saw our porter come out in the policeman's custody.</p>

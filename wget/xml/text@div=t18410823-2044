On Tues<lb></lb>day afternoon, the 3rd of August, between three and half-past three o'clock he came alone, and offered a bed in pawn—he appeared sober—I offered him money on it, which he refused—I packed it up for him to take it away—he then said he would take the money, and an old woman came in—I do not know his wife—she said, "Don't take that bed in—it is my pro<lb></lb>perty—he is a rogue, and has robbed me"—she attempted to strike him, but he stepped back—he then struck her twice across the mouth, back-handed, with his open hand—her mouth appeared swollen—I sent for a policeman, who came, but the prisoner had left—he came next morning, between half-past nine and ten, for the bed, with a young woman—I gave it to him—after he struck the deceased, I perceived he had been drinking, but was not drunk—I am quite satisfied he knew what he was about.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Church-street, Spitalfields. The prisoner came to me on Wednesday morning, the 4th of August, about ten o'clock, and said, "I wish you to come directly to my wife, for I think she appears to be dying."—I went; she was in bed at the house in Wentworth-street; I at first thought she was labouring under an attack of apoplexy—she was insensible—a bystander remarked, that her husband had been ill-treating her—I believe he was not present—that attracted my attention—I examined her head more minutely, and found a slight contusion over the right eye, and over the upper lip—on examining over the temple, there appeared contusions of a more severe</p>

               <p>character, but the dark hair prevented my observing it so minutely as I did after death—I visited her from that time till Thursday evening, when she appeared dying—I saw her on Friday morning, and she died about two that afternoon—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination on Saturday—I ex<lb></lb>amined the scalp—there were very extensive contusions over the left tem<lb></lb>poral bone; beneath the scalp there was extravasation of blood at the corresponding part to the contusions—there was a large clot of extrava<lb></lb>sated blood, beneath the <hi rend="italic">dura mater,</hi> beneath the left temporal bone, where I had observed the contusions externally—on the Wednesday night, the prisoner requested me to do what I could for his wife; and, on one occa<lb></lb>sion, I asked him whether he had been beating her—he either said, "I pushed her or struck her against a mangle"—I cannot recollect which he said, pushed or struck—he said, "Do what you can for her for my sake"—he remarked, that he thought his wife had taken laudanum, but there were no symptoms of her having taken any—I examined her stomach after death, and found it healthy, the only matter in it was the remains of the medicine she had taken—when I first went to attend her I smelt her breath—there was a strong smell of alcohol—I infer from the account of the wit<lb></lb>nesses, that the wounds stated to have been inflicted were the cause of her death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the immediate cause? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say the blow over the head causing the effusion of blood and <hi rend="italic">serum</hi> on the brain, which was the immediate cause—I think the only cause of that effusion to have been the blow over the head, because the effusion which was seated over that part of the brain is very seldom extravasated in a case of apoplexy—I do not know of one case—the stomach and liver presented quite a healthy appearance, quite different to a person addicted to intemperance.</p>

I saw the de<lb></lb>ceased on Thursday evening, the 5th of August—she appeared to be dying from the effect of concussion of the brain—her breathing was un<lb></lb>easy, and the pupil was fixed—in consequence of what I heard, I made a particular observation of her head and face—I noticed a slight contusion on the outer angle of the right eye—the left eye was severely blackened—there was a bruise on the upper lip, and an extensive contusion on the left temple—she had a great deal of hair for an old woman, and it was difficult to ascertain the limits of it—the right side of the body was wholly paralyzed—there was no fracture or dislocation of either shoulder—I only saw her that evening—my impression was she would not live till the next morning—the prisoner was present—there were a great many people in the room—an observation was made in his presence, that she had been pushed down and fallen against the mangle—I cannot say who said that—I assisted at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, and agree with Mr. Burch's evidence—the quantity of extravasated blood was very large—I suppose the clot of blood and the <hi rend="italic">serum</hi> which had separated from it, must have been at least six ounces; and the clot of blood was so florid, and the separation so perfect between the solid and watery parts, that I think the effusion must have taken place very rapidly, and must have pressed so much on the brain as to put a stop to her power of speech and motion—the effusion on the brain</p>

               <p>was undoubtedly the immediate cause of death, and that was caused by some external violence applied to that part of the head—the brain would not present that appearance by taking a quantity of laudanum—the ap<lb></lb>pearances from taking laudanum is usually that of congestion, or an ac<lb></lb>cumulation of blood in the veins of the brain—the prisoner appeared ex<lb></lb>cessively anxious, and labouring under great despondency.</p>

I went on duty at 10 p.m. Feb. 20th round Kensington Palace and a portion of High Street, Kensington, which includes the Palace Gardens—I go through the gates into the avenue with a key after 12 when they are locked—there is a sentry stationed in front of the Palace—the avenue is about 40 yards from Major Chaine's house—no one can come from the avenue to Major Chaine's house without being seen by the sentry on duty—no one could get over the railings, which are about 16 or 17 feet high—there are some railings about 4 feet high outside the Palace grounds close by a field—Major Chaine's residence is part of the Palace—the sentry's beat is about 30 yards—the avenue from the main road to the palace is about 300 yards—there is a lamp close to the scullery window which is close to the ground—I entered the palace grounds about 10.15—I go through every hour—I observed the cream-jug through the scullery window at about 10.15, and last saw it safe at 4.15—the prisoner was the sentry on duty, and I said "Good morning" to him at 4.15, and went back to Kensington Palace at 5.15, and passed the major's scullery—the cream-jug was then gone—I went to the station, saw the sergeant, and reported the jug as missing—I received instructions from the sergeant—I returned to the palace at about 6.20 and spoke to the prisoner, but not on this matte—no sentry goes on duty after 6—I returned to the station, and on the following Friday afternoon I searched for the jug in Devil's Square, and found it in a flower-stand with straw on the top of it, and snow on the top of the straw—Devil's Square is opposite Major Chaine's, about 15 yards from the senary post—it began to snow about 5 a. m.—there was no snow under the jug—I</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective T</hi>). In consequence of information I received, I went to see the prisoner and Private Baker on the morning of the 21st February—I said to Baker, "From what time were you on duty in the courtyard at Kensington Palace?"—he said "From 2 till about 4," and that the prisoner relieved him—I said to the prisoner, "What time were you on duty at the courtyard?"—he said "From about 4.10 to 6"—I said, "Could anybody enter that courtyard without your knowing it?"—he said "No, I don't suppose they could"—I said "Did anybody enter the court-yard?"—he said "No one but the policeman"—I said "Did you see any<lb></lb>body near the window?"—he said "No"—I said "Could anybody go to the window without your knowing it?"—he said "No"—I then said I should take him on suspicion of stealing a silver cream jug from the residence of Major Chaine—he said "I saw no mug there"—I made a note of that when I got to the station—he said "I know nothing about it; I never took the mug; I was on duty there from 4 till 6; I was on my post all the time"—Noller afterwards found the jug, and called me—the jug was lying on its side, with the handkerchief in it, thus—it was on the mould, in a flower-box, against the wall, at the foot of a column—there was no snow under the jug—the flower-box is 13 or 15 yards from the scullery window—the window forms one corner of the courtyard—there is no sentry-box—there is a covered colonnade to protect the sentry, down two sides of the square, and the win<lb></lb>dow is at the angle of the square—the sentry on his beat necessarily passes the window, which is about the centre of the beat—the scullery window faces Devil's Square, which is part of the grounds—you cannot See the window from the street—I cannot trace the ownership of the handkerchief to the prisoner—I found no handkerchief in his kit or on his person—this plan (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is correct—there is an open passage from one yard to the other—both the courtyards are inside the Palace grounds—the gates leading to the avenue are kept shut at night, and are about 16 feet high.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There is no certain spot for the corporal to march the relief off; anywhere in the square is sufficient—there is no sentry-box in the square—the sentry would stand close to the entrance to Devil's Square and challenge the relief, and the relief would be posted close to where he stood—a sentry would not leave his post until I relieved him, or he would send a policeman to me to tell me—I dare say it would be possible for a man to get into the square when the sentry was posted if he had light shoes on—it may be that there is a gate open all night at the other end of the avenue—I have never been up there at night.</p>

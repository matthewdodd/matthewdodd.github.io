                  </hi>. I am barman at the Bryden Arras, Islington. I was there on the evening of 2nd July—the prisoner came to the bar, and asked for a glass of stout, which he paid for in copper—he then called for a quartern of port wine, and brought a bottle—I asked him if he would have the best; he said he would have that at 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; I served him—he tendered me a half-sovereign; I examined it, and broke it; I found it was bad—I said, "This is a bad one;" he said he got it over at the corner—my father came down stairs, and I told him—the prisoner took both the pieces of the half-sovereign in his hand; I asked him, and he would not give it me—I took one part from him—I cannot say what became of the other part; he said he got it from a young woman over at the corner, over the way—my father said, "Do you mean at the post-office?"—he said, "Yes"—he was taken <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the station—I kept the piece of the half-sovereign in ray hand till I got to the station, and gave it to the sergeant <hi rend="italic">Prisoner, Q.</hi> When I went, the landlady came in and served me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I served you myself—you asked me to go with you to the Post-office; I refused.</p>

On 2nd July I was called into the bar, and found the prisoner, and some one holding him—my son told me he had passed a bad half-sovereign—I asked the prisoner where he got it from; he said, "Over the way, at the corner"—I said, "What at the post-office?"—he said, "Yes"—I looked across the bar, and the young woman from the post-office was there, being served—I said to her, "Miss Foster (which is the name I call her), did this person come from your place? she said, "Certainly not"—the prisoner said nothing to that—I sent for an officer, and gave him into custody.</p>

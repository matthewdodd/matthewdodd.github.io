               <p>On Thursday the 28th of last month the prisoner came in to a sale of goods which I had the care of; he asked for a catalogue; he went down into the kitchen; I watched him out; I went up into the shop and found him there, I was surprised at that as I thought I had seen him out; he asked me what time Mr. Phipps began the sale; he turned from me to go out, and I saw the impression of the plates under his coat; I followed him out and secured him. I said, you have robbed me; he produced the plates, and said, I acknowledge it, I stand convicted.</p>

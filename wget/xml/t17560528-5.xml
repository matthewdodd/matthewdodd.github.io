            . I am wife to the prosecutor. On the 18th of last February I was coming through Thames-Street, and met the prisoner, and laid hold of her; then I accused her with robbing me on the 6th of January. I took her into a house; there she confess'd, and said she would help me to my things, saying they were pawn'd somewhere in Thieving-Lane, but would not tell me the person's name. She had my apron and petticoat on, which she own'd to be mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I know nothing of what they lay to my charge.</p>

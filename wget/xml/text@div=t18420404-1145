                  </hi>. I am a labourer at Billingsgate-market, and live in Chap<lb></lb>man-street, St. George's in the East. On the 16th of March, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, I was in Billingsgate-market, and saw the prisoner in a boat, with cod-fish in it—I saw him remove two fish out of the boat, and put them into another boat lying alongside—I in<lb></lb>formed Newson.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fellowship porter, occasionally employed by James Ebenezer Saunders, junior, a fish salesman. I was sorting out fish from a boat called the <hi rend="italic">Hunter</hi>—I went down into the boat, and found the prisoner there—he had no business there—I said, "You go ashore, you have no business in this boat"—he said, "What for?"—I said, "You have planted two fish away"—he said he had not—I said, "You have," and took him out into the next boat, showed them to him, and said, "Here they are"—he said if I told him that again he would <hi rend="italic">punch</hi> my b—head off, and if he had been minded to take any he should have taken larger ones; but the larger ones had been taken out before—I called Es<lb></lb>den to turn him out of the boat—a scuffle ensued—he struck Esden, Kicked him, and tried to bite him—I was obliged to go on shore, and sent Green, the officer—when I returned I saw him strike Esden with a mop<lb></lb>stick—he had put the fish into the <hi rend="italic">Lord Rivers,</hi> and when all the fish was cleared away, he might take the fish on shore without being seen.</p>

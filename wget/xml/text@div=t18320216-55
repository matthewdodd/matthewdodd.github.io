            . I am a smith, and live in Booth-street, Pitfield-street. I was with Moore-as we were going into the Spread Eagle, some people were coming out; they pushed us off the threshold of the door, on to the pavement - I turned to look for Moore, and missed him from my side; I found him laying on the curb-stone on his back, bleeding at the mouth - I took him up; his hat was missing - I had not seen him struck; I asked several times for his hat, and was then knocked down myself - when I got up I found the Policeman had got the prisoner; Moore and I were both sober - we had not tried to push into the house, for the Policeman said we could not get any thing; we were going on home - I suppose about a dozen people came out of the public-house.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was on duty, and stood next door to the Eagle - Moore and Cooper passed me, and went to go into the house; I took hold of each of them by the collar, and told them they could have nothing to drink, to prevent their going in, as I saw a mob was coming out; they went away directly, and never spoke a word to me - they had got eight or ten paces towards the curb; the prisoner got in front of them, knocked Moore down, and as he fell his hat came off - the prisoner took it up, and went behind his associates; I was immediately seized by the left arm, by a man named Goodwin, who said, "Let them go to work" - I pressed my arm from him, and charged him, in the King's name, to aid and assist; he is a night man's son - I went up and took the prisoner, who stood by the shutters; he kicked at me - I held him till my brother officer came: he was taken to the station, after great resistance; I never saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183202160025"></xptr>the hat after he went behind his associates - I was seized by Goodwin, or I could have taken him with it; he had been in the public-house with Goodwin.</p>

            . I keep the Spread Eagle. The prosecutor and his witness came to my door, and tried to force an entrance; I had just closed the door, and was sweeping up and getting the people out - they knocked and hammered at the door; my man opened it to see whether it was on the jar, and called me; I said I should not let them in; they then tried to force the door open against me: I used force to push them back; the other party in the house was in conversation in front of the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. What party? A. The prisoner and several more, all relations and friends - I would not draw them any liquor, and they were just on the point of going - when I opened the door to let them out, the prosecutor and his friend went to force themselves in; I pushed the three men (the prisoner, Bartlett, and Goodwin) out against them; that is all I know - they had come to my house about seven o'clock in the evening, and were in and out all the evening; I think there were eight of them - I had closed my door on purpose to sweep the doorway and shut my shutter; I heard nothing which passed outside till the rattle sprang.</p>

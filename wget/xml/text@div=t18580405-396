                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, N</hi> 535). I was on duty on 8th March, at 10 o'clock at night, in Church Street, Hackney, in plain clothes—I saw Johnson looking through the window of the Britannia public house—he then went away across the road, and Jackson came out of the house and went across the road, spoke to him, and gave him something which sounded like money; and Johnson gave him something in return—they walked together towards the railway arch—Jackson then left Johnson, and went back about twenty or thirty yards to Mr. Pike, the baker's shop, and he went in there—Johnsonthen crossed the road and looked towards Mr. Pike's shop—Jackson came out again and crossed the road; the prisoners both joined one another again—they went towards the old tower in the churchyard, and through the churchyard about thirty yards—they then walked back towards the railway—Jacksonthen left Johnson and went into Mr. Pennington's public house, the Three Cranes—I saw the constable, Moody, and called him to watch Johnson, and I went to the Three Cranes, and immediately I put my head inside the door Mr. Pennington called out, "He has just passed a bad shilling"—I believe Jackson had got outside the door—I went after him, took hold of him, and told him he must come back with me for attempting to pass a bad shilling—I took him in the house and searched him—I found on him a comb, a sixpence, a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece, and 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, all good—I asked him what he had done with the shilling he attempted to pass; he said he threw it away—I took him to the station, and on the way met Moody—I asked him where Jackson was; he said he was over the way, in the Prince of Wales beer shop—I told to go and take him into custody—I took Johnson to the station and went and assisted Moody in taking Jackson—I searched Jackson at the station, and Moody searched Johnson—from information I went back to Bohemia Place and examined a water pipe—I found this bag, containing seven bad shillings and two bad half crowns—I took them to the station, and fetched Mrs. Pennington, the landlady of the Three Cranes—the shillings in the bag were wrapped in separate pieces of paper; the half crowns were loose.</p>

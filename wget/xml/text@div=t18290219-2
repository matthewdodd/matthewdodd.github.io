The prisoner lived in our service twice; she lived there eight or nine weeks the first time - we let our house, and took her back to accommodate the persons who succeeded us; she was with us six weeks, on the 5th of February, when this happened - the bar is a small room adjoining the parlour; there is nothing but a partition and a small door between them - we have a locker fixed to the wall in the corner of the bar - it has no lock to it; we keep money in it: on the 5th of February she brought five tea-spoons to the bar after tea - I had desired her to bring them into the bar-parlour, and place them on a small chest of drawers; I saw her come into the bar-parlour, but she never would put them there if I was there, but place them in the bar- she must go through the bar-parlour to get to the bar; I saw her go into the bar with the spoons - I was sitting in the bar-parlour with my husband and a little boy, about five years old; she passed through the parlour to go to the bar, and I distinctly heard the lid of the wooden locker fall as if let down - my husband asked me if I heard it; I told him to hold his tongue - she left the bar in about two minutes, and went through the parlour to the kitchen; I had examined the locker, and tied thirty-two sovereigns up in a bit of linen rag just before, and a 10l. Bank of England note - I tied them up together about a quarter past five o'clock, and left them safe in a purse in the locker; she went into the bar a few minutes after six with the spoons - nobody but myself had been in the bar in the intermediate time; they could not go without my seeing them, as they must go through the bar-parlour; there is another door, but it was fastened - she came through the parlour and across the passage into the kitchen, which is on the same floor; I immediately went to the locker before she could get to the kitchen, and observed a bag of silver there as I had left it, but the gold and note were gone - they were in a small purse; I immediately took my candle and went into the kitchen after her, and immediately she saw me she put her light out; I asked her to give me the purse which she had taken from the bar - her answer was "The devil a bit of purse have I got;" I told her she had got it in her bosom, for I saw it there - I saw part of it; I did not tell her I saw it, but told her she had it in her bosom - I asked her to give it me; she put her hand to her bosom, and I saw her move it from the front of her bosom, under her left arm; she then felt in her pocket, and took out some trifling things - I then told her she must go up stairs with me; she did not answer, but rushed behind me, and went back to the bar-parlour - I endeavoured to follow her, but she shut the door against me; she partly closed the door, and lay down against it to prevent my coming in -I could open it a little, and saw she was lying behind the door, but could not see what she was doing; I could only see her feet, and hear she was doing something; she kept there about two minutes, and then let me into the room; she got up and went up stairs with me - I asked her to take her clothes off - she took them off very deliberately, but I found no purse on her; she had five half-crowns and some shillings in her pocket, but I do not know whether I missed any silver that day - the silver bag had been turned on one side: I am certain no silver had been taken out of the bag that night, for I marked it- while I was up stairs with her, my husband went for an officer; Lee came in about half an hour - I expected she would give me the purse; the officers asked what she had done with it; I told them in her presence, I supposed she would give it me soon, but she denied knowing any thing of it; she continued to deny it - the officers and I searched in the kitchen where she had been standing, but found nothing; we went back to the bar-parlour - took her into custody, and the officers told me to search the parlour where she had been: I searched afterwards at the end of the chest of drawers which the door opens against - I saw some umbrellas had been pulled out from the end of the drawers, and in that space I found the purse with all the money in it, and my rag as I had left it; she had just gone out of the door in custody when I found it - the officer took the money to Hatton-garden; I myself did not take it up - I called<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182902190005"></xptr>the officer to do it; it was opened in my presence - I found thirty-two sovereigns and a 10l. note in it; I know the note by the name of Weed on it, who I had received it from - I put his name on it myself, and I knew the linen rag.</p>

I was sent for between eight and nine o'clock, and after Lee, the officer, took the prisoner away I remained in the house, questioning a man, who I understood to be acquainted with her; the landlord called me out of the tap-room into the parlour, and the prosecutrix pointed out the purse - I picked it up, opened it, and it contained thirty-two sovereigns, and a 10l note, which have been in my possession ever since, except twenty sovereigns which the Magistrate ordered me to give to the prosecutor.</p>

            . I keep the Sun. I was in the room with my wife, and saw the prisoner go through into the bar; I desired her to leave the spoons on the drawers in the parlour, but she took no notice, and went into the bar with them - she did not shut the bar-door; I could not see the locker, but I heard the flap go down, and nobody was there but her - nobody could go into the bar without my observing them; I swear nobody else went in - we had been sitting there some time - I know the Bank-note.</p>
               <p>MRS. EFFLAND. This note (looking at it) is my husband's; I wrote the name of Weed on it; I know the rag also.</p>

I used to take the spoons every morning and evening - I put them down with the tea-pot, and come out through the room they sat in: the child had some iron things and nails in a basket - I began to talk to the child; I always used to put out the candle before I came out of the kitchen, because she said it smelt so; she called me out of the kitchen and searched my bosom and pocket - I came into the room again to pick up the nails the child had taken out of the basket; she then called me up stairs and told me to strip; I did so, but she found nothing; I went into the tap-room and stopped till the officer came - he found nothing but my wages.</p>
               <p>MRS. EFFLAND. I had not been out of the parlour after I made the money safe; nobody could have gone to the bar without my seeing them.</p>

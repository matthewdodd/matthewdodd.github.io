               <p>A second count for uttering the same, knowing it to be forged, with the like intention.</p>
               <p>The indictment opened by Mr. Garrow. And the case by Mr. Fielding, as follows:</p>
               <p>May it please your lordship. Gentlemen of the jury, your attention you perceive is now called to a capital charge, namely that of forgery: the commissioners of the customs, who are servants of the publick, in a very high department, have found it their duty to submit the present prosecution to you: before I state to you the particular circumstances of that transaction, which has involved the prisoner in the guilt now imputed to him, it will be proper that I should state to you those circumstances upon which the present crime has been established: so long ago as the year 1768 the commissioners of the customs made an order that a certain class of men, called extra tidesmen, occasionally employed by the customs, when employed on board ships, as their employ would necessarily confine them there, that they should be allowed ten shillings and sixpence a week; that this provision might reach their families, and in order to enable those families to receive this money, or themselves, if absent from on board ship, that they might receive the money, they were to produce certificates of the register of the customs, of their having been so employed; and, that on the production of such certificate, they should be enabled to receive it. Gentlemen, the prisoner at the bar most undoubtedly knew of this order of the Board of Customs; he knew that there were printed instruments containing the form of the certificate, and the form of the receipt; he had contrived to provide himself with one of those papers, and on the 19th of June it was, that he, being at the Custom-house, saw there a young man of the name of Smith, who will be called to you as a witness; this young man appearing to be disengaged, he immediately accosted him, and told him, if he would go up to the pay-master's board, and receive such a sum of money as the certificate imported, to be easily received, he would give him a penny for his trouble: then it was he put into the possession of the lad the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150095"></xptr>two papers, one of which you will have in your presence; the boy went to the pay-master; he saw a Mr. Simmonds; he presented to him the paper; it was a certificate to this effect; the paper has these words,</p>
               <p>"Custom-house, London, June</p>
               <p>"the 19th, 1790. This is to certify, that</p>
               <p>"John Skirrow, extra tide-waiter, is on</p>
               <p>"ship duty, and intitled to board's allowance</p>

            ; it would therefore purport that this was the signature of a John Skirrow, who had been an extra tidesmam, and entitled to board's allowance; now in fact it turns out upon looking over the board's list, that no such person is in existence as 
               <persName id="t17900915-78-person763">
                  John

            ; first here is the fabrication of Mr. Irwin's name, which is material to the present prosecution, resting merely on the publishing the forged receipt; there being no such person as John Skirrow does not at all alter the nature of the crime; if there had, and his name had been fabricated, then there would have been a different mean of ascertaining the guilt of the prisoner; but there being no such person does not at all alter the nature of the offence. Gentlemen, you see, therefore, the simple charge is, that he has forged this receipt, or uttered it, knowing it to be forged; the money he was to obtain by means of this forgery is, it is very true, most insignificant; but it is of the utmost importance, as these matters have happened before this time, that an example should be made for the sake of the publick, of that person who has committed his sort of offence: now as to the other part of the charge, that this was uttered with intention to defraud the receiver general, there cannot be a doubt; if the receiver general, or his clerk, had paid this money, he would have paid it in his own wrong; but it is sufficient, if the intention to defraud should be made manifest to you: therefore you see the complexion of this business; this man knowing well there was a possibility of imposing on the commissioners of the customs, and of imposing on the pay-master, has presented this to them with a view to defraud the receiver general.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, now it is proper I should state to you the sort of evidence you will have in the present case, and the manner in which you will bestow your deliberation on this testimony: I have already told you this man, when at the Custom-house, did apply to a youth of the name of Smith; he went to Mr. Simmonds, the clerk, who contented himself at that time with desiring the boy to produce the person; the boy went down stairs in order to find the prisoner; he did find him there; and told him, that the clerk desired he would come up himself, and receive the money; upon which, without any hesitation, he immediately seemed going up stairs; the boy was following him into the room; but, as he went somewhat quicker than the boy, before the lad had reached the top of the stairs, he met him running down; he ran past him without saying a word; and it was not till some time after this that the prisoner was apprehended by the boy, in company with a friend; seeing him afterwards, he said, that was the man that had desired him to take up the instrument; of course he was taken into custody; you will see therefore that the publishing this instrument was first to the boy, that the boy carried it up stairs to Simmonds, and you of course should watch that boy's testimony, and examine into it; you will see the manner in which he departs himself; the circumstance of the man's (if the boy tells true, and whether he does or not will be for you to determine) going up stairs and running down hastily again will determine that, if you shall think the boy intitled to credit; then the crime will be compleat on the part of the prisoner; for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150096"></xptr>the moment he gave this receipt to this young man to carry up for this purpose, he in truth uttered it, knowing it to be a forgery, with intent to defraud the receiver general of the customs: therefore, gentlemen, you are now in possession of that testimony which you will have more particularly laid before you: you will be aided likewise with the particular attention of his lordship, in a case like the present: if you find that the boy is deserving of credit in the transaction, you can have no doubt on the present business; and I take the liberty of suggesting to you now, that though the sum is small, yet I trust that your understandings are infinitely of too sober a kind to be at all led astray from your duty, by considering the insignificancy of the sum to be obtained; if there should be in the case any of those circumstances that should intitle the man to a consideration of his majesty, he will undoubtedly consider that circumstance, whether it be proper or not that his royal mercy should be extended to the man; but with respect to the smallness of the sum, with respect to a publick body, these certificates are so numerous; there are a great many of them at the board; and if it could be committed with impunity there would be too much of that which is too often committed in those societies. Gentlemen, you are now in possession of the evidence it is my duty to lay before you, and I am sure if it is satisfactory to your minds, your decision will be satisfactory both to the prosecutors and the publick.</p>

            , whose name it bears, in the employ? - There is no such person in the employ.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. How are you able to ascertain that there is no such person as John Skirrow in the employ: do: you recollect that from any writing, any book? - No, I do not, Sir: but I never knew any person of that name.</p>
               <p>Do you keep any list of such persons? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Is there no such lift kept in the Custom-house? - Yes, in the office of the register I did not know myself; but I enquired of the register.</p>
               <p>Then you do not know only by the register, that there was no such person? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you been in this office long? - Four years.</p>
               <p>Is it common for persons who are intitled to this money, to sign a receipt, and pay it away as cash? - It has been practised, I understand.</p>
               <p>I suppose, if a person ever so much a stranger to you, was to come and produce the receipt of a man that you knew to be a tide-waiter, when you saw his hand, unless you had any doubt about it, you would pay it to any stranger that brought the receipt, should not you? - I should, my lord.</p>
               <p>In short, I suppose, among those sort of people, and wives, or the children, or the creditors, that have such a receipt, in them to the money that was to be paid?</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Now, my little man, do you remember being in the Custom-house on the 19th of June? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How far is that from your father's house? - My father's house is facing it.</p>
               <p>What time of day was it when you saw the prisoner at the bar there? - Between twelve and one.</p>
               <p>Look at him now; is that the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Tell my lord, and the gentlemen of the jury opposite to you, what he said to you, and desired you to do? - As I was coming down stairs, he gave me two notes, and said if I took them up and got the money, he would give me a penny.</p>
               <p>What were the very words he said to you? - He said, my man, if you take they two notes up to the pay-master, and get the money for them, I will give you a penny.</p>
               <p>What did you do with those two notes? - I went up stairs to Mr. Simmons.</p>
               <p>Which is Mr. Simmons? - This is the gentleman, (pointing to him.)</p>
               <p>Did you give that same paper into the hands of Mr. Simmons, that you received from the prisoner at the bar? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did you say to him when you gave him the two notes? - I gave him the two notes, and he asked me who gave them to me? - I said, a man on the stairs.</p>
               <p>What did he desire you then to do? - He told me to go down stairs and desire the man to come up to him.</p>
               <p>Then you went from Mr. Simmons to look after the man? - Yes; I went down,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150098"></xptr>and he was about two or three steps lower than he was when I first met him.</p>
               <p>What did you say to him? - I told him to go to Mr. Simmons himself; he went up very nigh the office door, and came running down again.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing to you when he passed you? - No.</p>
               <p>When you described him as coming running down again, was he in haste? - Yes; he was.</p>
               <p>He was running then in haste down stairs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He got out of your sight then? - Yes; I went home, and went to school in the afternoon, as usual.</p>
               <p>Did you call to him to stop? - No: I did not.</p>
               <p>What did you do then? - I went home; and the next day my father came to me, and said something about two notes.</p>
               <p>Did you go back to Mr. Simmons? - No; not that same day.</p>
               <p>Did you go back to Mr. Simmons? - I went to Mr. Simmons then, and then he asked me about these two notes; and then he asked me if I should know the man again; and I said, yes.</p>
               <p>Did any thing more pass between Mr. Simmons and you than that? - No; I went down stairs again.</p>
               <p>When was it that you happened to see the man again? - About a month afterwards; I saw him leaning against one of the pillars at the Custom-house door.</p>
               <p>What did you do upon that? - I went and told my father; and then he told me to go up to the paymaster and tell him; I went up and told him, and Mr. Simmons came down with me; then I shewed him the man.</p>
               <p>Did you tell Mr. Simmons that that was the man who had given you these notes? - Yes, Sir, I did.</p>
               <p>Now are you sure that is the man? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen him before? - I never saw him before he gave me the notes in my life.</p>
               <p>But you are sure that is the man? - Yes, I am positive that is the man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding to Mr. Simmons. Is that the little boy that brought you the notes? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>He came to you the next day? - I do not recollect whether it was the next day or the same day.</p>
               <p>To Smith. Are you sure it was the second day, my little man? - Yes; I am sure it was the second day.</p>
               <p>To Simmons. Did you mention any thing of it? - I immediately went to the register's-office to see if it was Mr. Irwin's signature.</p>
               <p>Did you enquire after the boy? - Yes; I saw him, and desired him if he saw the man again to let me or somebody know.</p>
               <p>Had you said any thing that could come particularly to his father? - Not to his father particularly: his father was a stranger to me.</p>
               <p>To Smith. How came your father to desire you to go? - I do not know, I am sure; but he said, Mr. Simmons told him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I believe your father generally carries those sort of receipts? - Yes, he does.</p>
               <p>What does he charge for that? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>You have sometimes I believe been employed by your father to take those kind of receipts? - Yes; I have.</p>
               <p>Then it is not the first transaction of the kind by a great many? - No, Sir, it is not.</p>
               <p>You have done so very frequently before? - Yes, Sir, I have.</p>
               <p>Therefore having receipts given you to take for payment was not at all a particular thing to you? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Then you did not go back to Mr. Simmons, and tell him that the man you was sent after did not come back? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>You thought there was nothing particular in it of course, or else you would have gone back to him and told him? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>And you did not see the person that gave you the receipt for a month? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150099"></xptr>And you never saw him before? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. The other receipts which you have at different tines carried up to the pay-master, are those you have received from your father? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then other people have employed you to carry up these instruments? - Yes; but not from strangers.</p>
               <p>But having been there at the office before you accepted this employ of the prisoner? - Yes; I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Smith. Did Mr. Simmons offer you any thing if you could find the man? - No, Sir; he did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he tell you you must find the man? - No, Sir; he did not.</p>
               <p>When did he speak to you about it? - The next day.</p>
               <p>Was there any noise about it? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Nothing said about it? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Your father was not angry with you for taking up this receipt? - To the best of my recollection, I cannot say he was.</p>
               <p>Why do you say to the best of your recollection?</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Do you hear my lord. Why do you say to the best of your recollection? are you sure he was not angry with you? - No, Sir, I am not.</p>
               <p>And when you saw this man again in a month's time, you made the immediate discovery, that you told us of? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. You never saw this man before this day that you had the notes from him, till he was taken up? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Simmons. Was it you, or one of the other witnesses that told me, that the prisoner at the bar was a tide-waiter? - I said he was a tide-waiter.</p>
               <p>Of course then he was backwards and forwards from the time that this note was offered to you to the time he was taken up: did you see him? - I do not recollect whether he was at the office or not; it did not lay with me at all.</p>
               <p>CLAUDIAS SMITH sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You live near the Custom-house? - I do.</p>
               <p>When did you first hear that the boy had been with those notes that were questioned? - I cannot exactly say the day of the month; but I sent up my son with two other notes for two watermen, that use my house, and he brought me the money, the two half guineas; that was the same day as this; there was nothing peculiar in the day; I did not hear of the boy getting those two notes for the prisoner, till the prisoner was gone; I was informed that Mr. Simmons wanted to speak to me, and I went up the next day to Mr. Simmons.</p>
               <p>Court. When did you hear that Mr. Simmons wanted to speak to you? - The afternoon of the same day that the boy had been to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was that the first that you heard relating at all to these notes, or the boy's concern in it? - It was the first I heard; I did not know Mr. Simmons's business till I went up; I went to Mr. Simmons.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Your house is directly opposite the Custom-house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The persons that belong to the Custom-house must be in the sight of your house very much? - Most certainly.</p>

            , for whom you gave that receipt, or from the writing itself? - There is a difference in the I, that I am convinced it is not my hand writing.</p>
               <p>Then if any person had put that receipt<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150100"></xptr>into your hands, you would have said at once it was not yours? - I should have had my doubts at first; but on a further inspection, I should have been convinced it was not mine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you always fill up the person's name? - No; they are brought to me ready filled up; I constantly examine them by the alphabetical list of the tide-waiters.</p>
               <p>Therefore you never could have signed that by mistake? - No; I could not.</p>
               <p>You say that the prisoner at that time was a tide-waiter? - He was.</p>
               <p>Was he the person for whom it was your duty to certify? - Certainly; he could not get it without.</p>
               <p>So that he knew the method of such business? - I have signed a great many for him.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Pray did not you, before the Lord Mayor, say you could not tell whether it was your hand writing or not? - No; I did not say them words; I said, I should have had my doubts at first; but on a closer inspection I was convinced it was not mine; and I likewise mentioned the examining them by the alphabetical list.</p>
               <p>Are the tide-waiters very numerous? - Very much so.</p>
               <p>Do you keep a list of them? - Of every one.</p>
               <p>Have you brought that list with you? - No.</p>
               <p>It is not in Court? - It is not.</p>
               <p>You say you have examined the list; do you speak only from the list, that there is no man of the name of Skirrow there? - I know that there is no such person existing as a tide-waiter of the name of Skirrow.</p>
               <p>Can you take upon you to say that without reference to the list? - Yes, I can; because I have examined it several times.</p>
               <p>This man has been a tide-waiter for six years? - I do not know how long a time.</p>
               <p>They of course are about the Custom-house frequently? - Certainly; it is their duty to be about there.</p>

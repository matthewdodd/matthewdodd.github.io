                  </hi>. I am a rag and bone collector of 47, Mint Street; I make them for my wife—we are not married—I don't remember much about the case, but I know I lost a good deal of blood—I was lying in the passage drunk—somebody woke me up, and I found blood coming from my head and my hand, and somebody took me to the workhouse—I do not know how my head came to be bleeding.</p>

                  </hi>. My husband is a bootmaker—we live in the same house as the prisoner—on Saturday, 16th, about 11 o'clock, I went down and heard the old man groaning—I found him in the passage with his head in a pool of blood—I said "For God's sake, who has done this?"—he said "My wife"—I knocked at her room door and received no answer—I kicked it open and said "Mr. Lefevre, for God's sake come, your husband has been stabbed"—she said "Who has done it?"—I said "He says you have done it"—she said "Oh," and laid down again—she was evidently drunk—I saw the prisoner take a knife off the bed where she was lying—I have heard them quarrelling.</p>

I was called by the landlord and found the prosecutor lying in the passage with his head and hand cut, and pool of blood on the floor—I went for a doctor and had him taken to the workhouse—I took the prisoner in custody—she said "We had a quarrel his morning, and we said we would do it to each other"—I said "Do what, this?" and she made a motion with her hand—I found this knife in the bed where she was lying.</p>

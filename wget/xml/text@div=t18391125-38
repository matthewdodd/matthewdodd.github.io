                  </hi>. I am eleven years old, and live with my mother in Dudley-street. On the 9th of November I went into the Running Horse public-house, Harrow-road, to ask one of the lodgers if he could send my mother Is., as he owed her some money—I saw all the three pri<lb></lb>soners sitting down there—I stopped there two or three minutes, and the lodger asked me what I had in my basket—I said, "A breast of mutton and a few things"—I had brought a basket from home, and had in it the ar<lb></lb>ticles stated, which I had been out to get for my mother—I then came out, and the three prisoners followed me—they said they would take me to the station-house—they would not tell me what for—I said, I will step up to the station-house to see what I am to go for, I have done nothing, to my knowledge"—directly I got to the corner of the station-house Green and Taylor caught hold of me, and Kempston snatched my basket away—they ran up Park-place as quickly as they could run—two ran toge<lb></lb>ther and the other one walked on, and then ran too—I called "Police" as quick as I could—I met two policemen, who went up to the bridge, and saw Green and Taylor—I gave them in charge, and they were taken to the station-house—Kempston was found next morning—I saw him in the sta<lb></lb>tion-house, and they asked me if I knew him—I said he was the one who snatched my basket away—I am sure he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am thirteen years old, and work for my father, at Paddington. On the 9th of November, at a quarter to twelve o'clock, I was coming across Paddington-green, and saw Townsend crossing the road, and the three prisoners along with him—I am-sure they are the men—two of them collared him, one on each side, and said they would take him to the station-house—he said he would go—they kept on till they came to the corner of Hermitage-street—they stopped there, and Kempston laid hold of the basket, and tore it from his arm, and they ran up Park-place—I ran to the station-house and called the police, but could not make any body hear—I then ran up Park-place—I could not see the prisoners, and as 1 came back I saw a policeman—I told him—he ran up Park-place, until we met another policeman, who said nobody had passed there—we then went to the stop-bridge, and there saw Green and Taylor coming up—they were secured, and taken to the station-house—Townsend was with us, and pointed them out before they were taken.</p>

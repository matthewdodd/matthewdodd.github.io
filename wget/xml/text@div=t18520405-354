                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live at 20, Kings<lb></lb>gate-street. The prisoner was in my service till Sept., 1851—I had a customer named Faultier, who lived in Fitzroy-square—my custom was to send in my bills to her quarterly—she was indebted to me in March, 1851, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I never received that sum from the prisoner—if he had received such a sum it would be his duty to pay it to me—this receipt is not my handwriting—I do not know whose writing it is—I did not authorize the prisoner to write it—in June last, in consequence of some information, I sent a note to Mrs. Faulder by the prisoner—I did not keep a copy of that note—the prisoner was aware of the purport of it—it was stating that the bill of March of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was not paid, and I wrote to know if she had a receipt for that amount, as it was not paid—I told the prisoner what I was about to write, and he went away with the note in the usual way—he was gone perhaps two hours, and either that day or the day afterwards he said, "Mrs. Faulder said it was all right, she knew the March bill was not paid; she had made a mistake, and paid the June bill instead of that."</p>

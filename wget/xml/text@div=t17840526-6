               <p>Do you know either of the prisoners at the bar? - Yes, my Lord, I was here last sessions for a small trifle, and I laid in the same ward with them.</p>

               <p>Court. Was you tried here? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you convicted? - No; when I was coming out after my trial, they asked me if I would dispose of a quantity of lead for them.</p>
               <p>Which asked you, both, or one of them? - Both of them; they said they believed there was about six hundred weight of it, if I would take it and carry it to Oxford-road and sell it; I went there, and took a man with me, and I was detected and stopped between Kilbourn and Paddington; we were taken to the watch-house, and from the watch-house to the Rotation Office,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178405260029"></xptr> then to New Prison; and they advertised the lead, and they could not make it out, so they discharged us: after we were discharged, we went and looked for more, and there we found three hundred weight more; then we went and acquainted the Gentlemen of the Parish, I went to Mr. Bond's house.</p>
               <p>Court to Bond. Was this last lead applied? - We applied part of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What he says is very false, this young man lay in the upper ward, and I never changed ten words with him.</p>
               <p>Lively. You lay by me every night.</p>
               <p>Court to Jones. Does this lead appear to have come from the church? - It appears to me to be the same kind of lead; but there is some deficiency in the quantity, the last witness says he was detected with two hundred and a half, which I have not seen.</p>
               <p>Court. Have any of the witnesses a knowledge of these two men at the bar.</p>
               <p>Bond. I know the man with the cut lip, that is Dyer, I have seen him loitering about the roads frequently.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Dyer. I never was there in my life.</p>
               <p>PRISONER HICKMAN's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was out of work, and this young man asked me to go and seek for work, so we went to Mr. Rutherford's house, and I came into the road again, and I went to have a pint of beer, and we drank it and called for another; these gentlemen came up and said, I take you into custody on suspicion of stealing lead; I asked him what he took me for, he could not say, and the justice committed me.</p>
               <p>Jury to Rutherford. Did you take them into custody? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Hickman called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Court. In my apprehension it cannot be the property of the vicar, for he has no freehold, and this is a part of the freehold: it would not have been an indictable offence, if it had not been for this act of Parliament, it was therefore necessary to have a special law for the purpose. If the indictment is to be supported at all, it must be on the third count; but whether by coupling inhabitants with parishioners will prevent them from being convicted under it, will be the subject of a future enquiry.</p>

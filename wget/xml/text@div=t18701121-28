I live at Mrs. Clark's, 18, Williams Mews—on 25th October, about 5.30, I went home from my work about 5.50—the prisoner came and asked for his wife—Mrs. Clark told him she was gone across the market—he said "Will you allow me to search?"—she said "By all means"—he went into the room, and directly the woman came out screaming</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cabman, and live on the same premises as the prisoner and his wife—on the afternoon of 25th October, about 4.15, I heard a disturbance, and heard the prisoner call his wife a whore, or a bad woman, or something of that sort—she said "I don't daserve such treat<lb></lb>ment"—he said "Well, out you go, you b—"—I then looked through the window, and saw him catch his wife by the shoulders, and turn her out of the door, and kick her after she was out—she said "Oh, my God, you have nearly killed me"—he then took her by the shoulders, and turned her out of the further gates—a little altercation took place between her and two women outside the gate—she said "I must go somewhere," and she then retired to Mrs. Clark's—I heard no more till I was putting my horse to, and the prisoner passed me, and almost momentarily afterwards I heard screams of "Murder!" and "Help!" from Mrs. Clark's house—I went there and saw Mrs. Keaser partly down the stain—she might have been three or four steps down, and the prisoner seemed to be behind her; whether he was shoving or striking her I could not say; it was dark, however; she fell into my arms—I took her into the mews, and then rushed up the stain, and saw the prisoner standing at the top of the stain with a knife in his hand, and Brown with a poker, standing in his defence—the prisoner said he would do for the b—lot—at that time, Castle passed me, and the prisoner said, "I will give you the knife, and no one else," and he gave it to him—I afterwards took Mr. Keaser to the hospital in my cab, she was bleeding from wounds in the head and back—I should say the prisoner was sober, and capable of undertaking any business he might be required to do.</p>

I am house surgeon at University College Hospital—Mrs. Keaser was brought there on the night of 25th October—she was suffering from two wounds one on the head, and one on the back; that on the head was in the temporal region, the instrument with which it was inflicted, must have penetrated about two inches, it reached the bone, and then slanted downwards; it must have been a pliable instrument, and have glanced away at the bone; there was free hemorrhage the wound on the back had penetrated about three inches, it was in the dorsal region, it was not quite perpendicular, it had an upward direction, I should say the deepest point from the surface was about two inches—there was no immediate danger from the wounds, though they might have been followed by serious consequences she remained in the hospital about a fortnight, and is still under my care at an out-patient—the wound in the back bad gone through the clothes, I can't say what clothes, I think she had stays, and the ordinary woman's clothing—there must have been decided violence used, especially the head, the bone had impeded the progress of the knife.</p>

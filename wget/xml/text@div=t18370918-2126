I am resigned, but am resolved not to go alone before that God that now warms my heart, and knows my purpose firm, to answer for my actions here. The <hi rend="italic">rober</hi>, who stops one on the road to steal one's purse, exposes his person to our resistance. You, by your numbers, and by law, evade that <hi rend="italic">oportunity</hi> of defence which the more honourable thief offers. Would to God that you were all comprised in one mass, that I might have one chance, to punish by my single arm the vil lany of the whole party. As I would hope for forgiveness for shedding the blood of the thief who attacks my property and my life, so shall I hope for forgiveness in heaven if my fury falls on the head of one or more of you, Could any man, with a heart in his <hi rend="italic">brest</hi>, stand by, as you. have done, to see me perish? Knaves and villains all! look at my first letter to the company; and what man amongst you will say I am not a murdered man? You would see my body go to earth, my soul to hell, whilst you stood coldly by, and as coldly drank my blood, ere a man of you would stretch forth a finger to save me from inevitable destruction. You saw I had fallen from a state of ease by rash, but reasonable, (I had my reasons,)</p>

               <p>though bold speculations: my all was placed in your hands. Before I was utterly lost I wrote to you to do me justice; but, instead of which, through that liar, knave, and coward, Rowcroft, the filthy instrument through whom you do your dirty work, I was <hi rend="italic">no</hi> only <hi rend="italic">robed</hi> of my money, but my very means of life were cut off by the treachery of that vile thing. I would have saved myself by honourable industry; but the means which were my own then, had you promptly said you would do nothing for me, were sacrificed by the delay, as well as knavery, of your foul servant. Instead of blood, a green and sulphurous matter fills his veins, which, when he goes to hell, will burn and stink, and make the d—dest hell fouler. My all is gone. I am now in debt. I have not yet received one shilling by my profession; and, as you may naturally suppose, I cannot paint nor dig; to beg I am ashamed. Madness is inevitable. I have too much <hi rend="italic">spirite</hi> to ask assistance from you in the name of charity. Cursed be the lips that say I ask it! but I demand a reparation for the wrongs you have done me. Firm in virtue's ways, true to every principle of integrity and honour, what have I fear in the presence of a just God? In my first letter to the company I wrote for you to buy my shares, or pay me back the last deposit of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. They had never been done at less in the market than what I asked of you, though Spurling could not find a purchaser at the time; he threw the certificate down with contempt. He knew I had paid 365<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them, and that you held more than that of mine in your hands, besides 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. forfeited money, the Committee are receiving my money, my spirits, and my life I am disgusted with the affair throughout. To cut the matter short, I will have the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. you would wrong me of. Rowcroft sold thirty-eight of my shares for 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he entered an action against me for 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I paid him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for costs. I will give the other shares up. I now demand 132<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., one hundred and thirty-two pounds nine shillings, or I will have blood, for my blood, which you would spill. I will so manage my business, you shall feel my malice before you find me. Rest assured of that. I have nothing now to hope or fear from man. I shall not be tried by him. Should you send the money to a shilling, remember to a shilling, to 17, Cirencester-place, to Miss Gage, and a letter for me, for her to forward to me, before five o'clock next Wednesday, I shall rest satisfied till I receive assurance that no proceedings will be taken against me; otherwise, you, the most official of those <hi rend="italic">Buchers</hi>, may rely on going to Heaven with me the first time we meet. I hope I shall be believed, when I give my oath my purpose is firm, if I fall, I shall not be considered a coward, a rogue, or an assassin. No man in the world can say I have wronged him. My letters will prove I am not destitute of feeling; my actions, that I am true to principles of integrity; the courage I have shown in this business will prove I am not destitute of honour; and the society I keep will prove I am not disrespected. Judge me as you will, so long as I have blood in my veins, I shall be what I am. My pen refuses to mark the infamy of that coward, Rowcroft; he, as you all know, lent me 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I did nothing to give him a bad opinion of me. He called on me before the note was due, when he saw the shares had gone down to nothing. He knew my circum stances; knew that if I could raise that sum it was all I had in the world. He thought that if he could snatch the money from me before I learnt the price of the shares in the market, he would be safe; he knew he had betrayed me, and thought that if 1 discovered it I should not return his money; he wanted me to get him the money immediately, as a favour. I thought his visit omened no good. I went to see the evening paper that day, and saw</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183709180079"></xptr>
               <p>the shares quoted "0 to 0. "If he could have snatched my life with impunity, he would have done it, just as soon as have snatched that money from me. He called again the next morning early. The villain will tell you, if there is one particle of truth left in him, that I said, as soon as I saw him, 'I have seen that the shares have gone down to nothing; but I assure you, that if it is the last shilling I have in the world, the moment I get it I will give it to you. 'When the note became due, he refused a letter to Mr. Scott, which was the same as money, and which he himself had asked for, merely because I had called him my friend: that certainly was a libel, but it was a mistake. I never denied the debt. At last, he called again on me. I declare, that though his behaviour was gross and unbecoming, I do not think that Christ, with all his virtues, could have shown more meekness or better disposition than I showed towards him. He called me a swindler, and, as I understood, challenged me to fight, by proposing to refer the case to any two gentlemen in London. He went immediately, and did his worst. I wrote to Mr. Marshall; and the day after the committee meeting I called to pay Rowcroft, who (in the presence of Mr. Hodges, who I consider a good man) refused to take the money of me, and <hi rend="italic">refered</hi> me to his solicitor. He said that the committee had passed a general scowl on my letters. I almost lost myself for a moment. [Ask Mr. Hodges.] I went; desired a friend to call on him, to ask if he considered me a man of the strictest integrity and honour? He said, 'No. 'My friend then reminded him he had proposed to settle the affair in a gentleman-like manner, and called on him to name his friend. This he declined to do, saying he did not feel bound to give me any satisfaction. He said he had proposed to settle the affair between gentlemen, but that he did not mean to fight: he meant to have it settled with talking alone, as a point of law, <hi rend="italic">wether</hi> I was bound to pay the money or not. A poor excuse, when I never denied the debt. I went the next morning, paid the debt and costs, wrote to Rowcroft to save that character he had wronged, by giving me a letter to my friend. He kept me, I think, more than an hour waiting, and then said he would not give me an answer. Never brute showed more cruelty than he has shown to me, and now the vilest thing could not show more cowardice.</p>
               <p>I remain, Gentlemen, true to my oath.</p>

N., is my mother's son; when I became of age I voluntarily gave him 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I wrote to him for assistance in my present difficulties, but it appears he has turned his back on me. My sister's husband is in town on a visit to me. I have shown him kindness all my life; I have lent him money at times; I lent him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he held for two years. I asked him yesterday, but never before, to lend me only 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he refused. After this what can I do? I never looked forward to a moment in my life with more pleasure, than I now look forward to that which will take me from a world of trouble, either a comfortable sleep, or a better state of existence. I pride myself in the cause in which I fight, for I know I shall have the thanks of all those who have been dupes to your knavery, and the regrets and prayers of those few who know me. Should you settle the affair by doing me justice, I give you my honour, which none of you will doubt after what you have seen of me, that I fight only for myself. I shall not let one word be known to the rest of the shareholders, though in justice I must say, I think them <hi rend="italic">robed</hi>. Had I not written a letter to the committee before the shares went to nothing in the market, I should not have had</p>

I have <hi rend="italic">coppies</hi> of these papers, which I shall carry in my pocket; so if I fall, the press will expose the foul acts of the company to the abuse and contempt of the public. Be assured I shall be safe before I desist, I shall have all my papers returned, and a letter assuring me, and signed by all you may have shown these papers too, on your honour that no proceedings will be taken against me, in any shape whatever to injure me. I shall then consider you rogues, but only on a par with the rest of the world. I shall leave word with Miss Gage before I leave home, to receive 132<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for me; she knows nothing more of the affair, neither can she discover where I go—for your own sakes I wish you to be assured that my project will not miscarry; you may rely on it, that if art and patience will carry it into effect, it will be completed. Should a know ledge of my temperate and industrious habits be of any use to you, you may ask what you like of me of Mr. Ralph Price, or the oldest academician, Mr. Smirke. First claim, £150.</p>

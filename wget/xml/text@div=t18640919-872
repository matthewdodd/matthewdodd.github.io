I am the prosecutor's butler—on 24th August, between half-past 10 and 11 at night, I locked up the house, with the exception of the drawing-room—I cannot say whether that window was closed, as I left the family there when I went to bed—I bolted the hall door—about 2 o'clock I was awoke by a bell ringing—I went down stairs, and found it was the last witness's bell—I proceeded to her bedroom, and from what she told me, I armed myself with a poker, took a candle, and searched the house, but found no one—the bottom sash of the drawing-room window was partly open—the hall door was shut, but the bolts were drawn back—I found a piece of wax candle</p>

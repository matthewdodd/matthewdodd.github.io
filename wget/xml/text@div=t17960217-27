               <p>Mr. Garrow.</p>
               <p>(The indictment was stated by Mr. Lawes).</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Adair. Gentlemen of the Jury, it becomes my duty to address you, and to call your particular attention to a case of the importance of that which is now brought before you. The crime that is imputed to the unfortunate gentleman at the bar, by this indictment, you well know, is one of the greatest magnitude that can be committed upon society, that of wilfully and maliciously depriving a fellow-creature of his life; and, I flatter myself, you are sufficiently acquainted with the principles and the administration of criminal justice, to be perfectly satisfied in your own minds, without its being suggested by me or any other person, that in proportion to the magnitude of the crime charged, the guide to your judgment ought to be the clearness and precision of the evidence, whereby that charge is supported.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, you are called upon to perform, I am afraid, a painful duty; but it is an honourable duty also to those who faithfully perform it; and you will find yourselves called upon, to pay a diligent attention to the facts that will be laid before you in evidence; and the directions that you will receive from the Bench, with respect to the law that is applicable to those facts; because it is by these alone that the judgments that you are to form ought to be directed. You are to pay no regard to any facts or rumours that may have reached your ears; except those that shall be substantiated upon oath, by evidence in open Court; and, in forming your judgments upon the legal operation of those facts, for or against the prisoner, I am sure you will be inclined to be guided by the direction of the learned Judge who presides, from whom you will receive the most satisfactory information. Gentlemen, whatever it will be my duty to state to you in these observations, is merely pointed to direct your attention to the material circumstances of the case; but whatever you may hear from me respecting either the one or the other, either the fact or the law of this case, you will wholly suspend your minds, as to any impression which they may make one way or the other, in the recollection that my statement of facts ought to have no weight, except so far as they are supported by evidence; nor any idea that I may suggest upon the law of the case, except so far as it is confirmed by the learned Judges upon the Bench.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, to you is entrusted a very important duty; on the one hand, is committed to you, the protection of the life of the prisoner at the bar, against light suspicions, or unfounded accusations; on the other, the administration of justice, and the support of those laws of your country which are calculated for the protection of the innocent, as well as the punishment of the guilty, is entrusted in your hands; you are to administer justice in mercy; when I say justice in mercy, although mercy is a principle which ought never to be lost sight of in the administration of criminal affairs, yet that mercy is always mistaken which is not directed by the principles of wisdom and of justice; for though it is your duty, in the consideration of every fact laid before you, where any matter of doubt shall occur to your minds, to avail yourselves of that presumption in favour of innocence, which is the principle of the law of England; till it is encountered with satisfactory proof; yet, on the other hand, you well know that it is not your duty to shut your eyes against clear and satisfactory evidence; or to decline, upon any principles of false tenderness, the discharge of a painful duty, if that painful duty should fall to your lot: but you will pronounce a conscientious verdict upon the evidence that will be laid before you; and if the effect of that evidence should be such, as when applied to the known laws of the kingdom, shall satisfy you that the prisoner has been guilty of a breach of those laws, in the point alledged by this indictment, however painful the talk may be, it will be your duty to perform that talk, and to find the prisoner guilty. God forbid you should be led to that verdict by any thing but the clearest and most satisfactory evidence; at the same time that I discharge my duty in laying before you these circumstances, which, on the part of the profecution, we are led to believe will, to-day, be established by evidence; after having discharged that duty, no man will feel more satisfaction than myself, if, upon the result of the whole of the evidence, you shall find yourselves fairly justified before God and your Country in delivering the prisoner from the heavy charge with which he stands accused.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, it will be necessary for me now to state to you, the nature of that fact upon which the charge against the prisoner is founded; it is not that sort of dark insiduous murder committed in secret; difficult of proof, dependent upon circumstantial evidence, which is frequently the subject of your enquiry in a court of justice, that will be the subject of your enquiry to-day, it is a killing, in the face of day, publickly and openly, in the face of many witnesses; so that the fact of the death of the unfortunate gentleman who has for many years been no more, the fact that that death was occasioned by the prisoner at the bar, will, I am afraid, not be a matter of much doubt, or much enquiry. Gentlemen, the only question that can exit in this case will be, whether, under the circumstances, that that death was unfortunately occasioned by, the guilt of murder is or not, properly imputable to the prisoner; and, if I am right in the law upon that subject, I am afraid, that upon the application of that law to the facts in evidence, there will be as little doubt upon that question; for whatever may be the no<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170043"></xptr>tion of honour, that has been prevalent in this and other countries; whatever impression those notions may have made on the private minds and feelings of mankind, I am afraid they neither can nor ought to find entrance into the Courts of justice; and that the law of this country is, what I believe the law of God also to be-that whoever shall wilfully and deliberately, by pre-concerted appointment, armed with instruments of death, meet another, for the purpose of deciding their differences by the fall of the one or the other; which ever party shall fall, or by whomsoever the original provocation was given, the survivor is guilty of murder, by the laws of God and men. That the degrees of malignity and guilt, annexed to that unfortunate circumstance, may widely differ, is a circumstance that no man feels more than myself; but, whatever may be the degree of malignity and guilt, if once the fact, which constitutes the crime of murder, is clearly and unquestionably established. I conceive of these circumstances are more proper for the consideration of those who are entrusted with the prerogative of mercy, than those who are in the first instance entrusted with the administration of the law. The province of a jury is to investigate the facts, and according to the directions they shall receive from the learned Judge, of the application of those facts to the law, they are, according to their oaths and consciences, to decide whether the party is guilty of that offence which is imputed to him, by the indictment; whether the circumstances of that guilt are such as loudly call for the punishment of the law, or solicit the tender interpositions of mercy, under favourable circumstances afterwards, is not the object of consideration.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I have thought it my duty, in the outset, to state what occurs to me upon that subject, for it is extremely right, that all the circumstances of this unhappy transaction should be laid before you; that public justice may be satisfied, by a full disclosure of every circumstance that may make for or against the unhappy gentleman who now stands upon trial for his life; and if it shall turn out that sort of favourable case, according to the notions and feelings which are implanted in the breast of every man, whatever may be the strict law upon the subject; having, I hope, fairly, and, I am sure, as far as my own opinion goes, faithfully stated to you, what I conceive to be the law, and your duty, acting upon oath, under such circumstances, I shall feel no inclination to press that matter upon your attention. It will, therefore, be my duty, according to the instructions I have received, which I have every reason at present to believe are according to the best information of those from whom I have received them; but which information is liable to mistake, it will be my duty, however, according to that best information, to give you a short and distinct statement of the circumstances attending this transaction, as far as they are material either to the malignity or the degree of guilt imputed to the prisoner; and then it will be your duty upon the whole result of the evidence, to pronounce your verdict, whether the prisoner has, by pre-concerted, deliberate intention, been the death of the unfortunate gentleman who is the subject of this indictment.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, it will be necessary, therefore, to understand the circumstances of this case; that you should not only be acquainted with the fact of the duel itself, but he circumstances immediately connected with it; for I should not think myself at liberty to go into the allegations made on the one side or on the other, that are not immediately connected, or not directly leading to the unfortunate catastrophe that happened. I shall think it my duty neither to attempt to prove or state, as it will be unquestionably your duty to retain your minds perfectly unprejudiced and unbiassed, till you hear the evidence, free from any impressions made by the supposed character of the parties, or by rumours, or loose conversations which have but too much prevailed, upon the subject of this indictment; and feeling that unbiassed mind, and giving that steady attention, which it is your duty to do, to the evidence, you will be guided by that, and that alone, in the opinion that you shall form.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the quarrel which gave rise to this unfortunate duel, originated in a debt of honour, due from Mr. Rowlls to the prisoner at the bar, which will be proved beyond all doubt, I believe, under the circumstances of this case. It will be necessary, therefore, for me, so far, and so far only, as directly leads to this unfortunate transaction, to state to you what has publicly passed on that occation, and what has passed under a degree of examination, that will not be so liable to misrepresentation.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rowlls, at the time of his decease, was a very young gentleman, a gentleman of fortune, and, as I am informed, of character unimpeached, except by those levities of youth which gave rise to the unfortunate transaction; he was a little too found of attending races, plays, and those fashionable amusements, to which young men of fortune are too apt to devote their time, and from that levity of youth arose the circumstance which terminated in his death. I think it was in the year 1780, that he met the prisoner at the bar, who was then a stranger to him, at Ascot races; it appears, from subsequent transactions, that Mr. Rowlls had lost a considerable sum of money to the prisoner at the bar; that circumstance, therefore, gave rise to considerable altereation upon the subject, and security was at length given for a sum of money, not to the prisoner at the bar, but to another. gentleman of the name of Etherington, which afterwards became the subject of dispute; what the nature of that security really was, I shall not presume to state, because that was the subject matter of a dispute, which, to this hour, has never been decided, and therefore on which side the truth lies, I am not entitled to state, not is it material for you to enquire; that security, however, in fact, became the subject of dispute - it being alledged by Mr. Rowlls, that Mr. Etherington was merely a stakeholder, and trustee for Mr. England, for whom this debt was contracted; it being alledged on the other hand, that it was a security for a sum of money, bond-side, advanced and lent Mr. Rowlls, by Mr. Etherington; the security being given by a warrant of attorney to confess the judgment, it became the subject of enquiry in the court in which that judgment was entered; affidavits were made on one side and on the other, each maintaining the truth of their respective allegations, and the court entertained so much doubt upon that subject, as to direct an issue to be tried to determine for what conside<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170044"></xptr>ration the bond, which was the subject of that judgment, could have been given; it being alledged on the one hand, that this was given to Mr. Etherington, as trustee to Mr. England, to cover a gaming debt, which, by law, he could not recover; and on the other hand, that it was money actually lent and advanced. When that cause came on to be tried, it was thought adviseable by the counsel on each side, to compromise the matter, and it was agreed that Mr. Rowlls should pay one half of the sum demanded, with interest; one would have hoped, that, with that compromise, all memory of the transaction had been buried; but a deep resentment lay buried in the mind of the prisoner at the bar, and I believe it will be in proof to you (and if it is not clearly and satisfactorily proved, I beg of you to forget that I have so stated it;) that upon departing from Westminster-half, subsequent to the compromise that I have stated, Mr. England was heard to declare, that the matter should not rest there, but that he would have satisfaction from Mr. Rowlls elsewhere; in what degree that declaration ought to weigh, will be a subject for your consideration, under the direction of the court. Gentlemen, this was, I believe, on the 20th of February, 1784; unfortunately within a few months after this transaction, the parties met together at the same place, where this unfortunate circumstance originated at Ascot races, and there that altercation arose, which was the immediate cause of the duel that followed.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I am happy to be assured that you will have such an account of that altercation, as will probably leave no room for doubt upon that subject; for I see in Court a noble Lord, of high rank and character, who happened, unpleasantly to himself, and, I am sorry that it has given him the trouble of a painful attendance here, happened to be present at that altercation; and, if his Lordship's memory should serve him, distinctly to relate what the conduct of each of the parties was upon that occasion, you will probably think it unnecessary to trouble you with any further evidence upon that subject. I shall state to you, very generally, what I am instructed, passed upon that occasion; and I am happy to state it in the hearing of witnesses present, who will immediately correct me if I am wrong. I understand, that Mr. Rowlls proposing some betts in the booth upon the race-ground, Mr. England interposed with a considerable degree of animosity; and, on the race-ground, before all the gentlemen of the country there assembled, declared, loudly, that the gentlemen ought not to accept of betts from a person who did not pay his debts of honour. I forbear to state the particular words and expressions, because you will hear them so much more satisfactorily from the witness; but that the substance of them was with reference to the transaction, which I have already stated to you, for the purpose of shewing what gave rise to this unfortunate quarrel, namely, the declaraion of Mr. England, that he, not being, a man of honour, had not discharged those debts which he considered he ought to have discharged; that you will conceive necessarily, to a gentleman in Mr. Rowlls's situation, was a charge that must provoke immediate resentment, wounding his honour, upon a very public occasion, in a sensible point. Mr. Rowlls had seen the transaction in a very different light; he was perfectly persuaded that the conduct on his part, had been honourable; and that, therefore, this was manifestly intended to provoke a resentment that should give rise to the unfortunate circumstances that followed. Mr. Rowlls immediately, with that warmth of passion that might be expected from a young man upon such an occasion, came up to him in a threatening posture; Mr. England, in a threatening manner also, desired him to refrain from personal violence, informing him, that if he had any thing to say to him, he knew where to find him; the meaning of that language is to every man perfectly understood; a meeting took place between Mr. England and a gentleman in the army, who interfered, and the unfortunate business was at that time settled between them, in what manner we can only know from that gentleman; and, therefore, as he will appear here as a witness, I will not state it to you; but an appointment was made on the morning following, to meet, with pistols, at Cranford-bridge, to determine the animosity that subsisted between the parties. In consequence of this, they met at the appointed time and place, with every circumstance of deliberation on both sides, each bringing his second, and pistols; with every preparation for the contest that was to ensure, and one or more surgeons were directed to attend, in case of consequences that were likely to take place. I am afraid, therefore, that if these facts (which were too public to admit of much doubt) are satisfactorily proved, you can admit of no doubt, in your minds, that, whatever were the true merits of the quarrel, their meeting was deliberate and pre-concerted; that, in consequence of a deliberate purpose entertained the day before, and after sleeping a night upon it, with all those circumstances of deliberation and forethought, which exclude that indulgence, I am afraid, which the law gives to the sudden passion of a man. These parties met, with instruments of death, for the purpose of deciding the differences and animosity subsisting between them at that meeting, having been so deliberately planned, the circumstances that passed will be capable of proof, by witnesses of undoubted credit; with respect to that, it is only necessary for me to state, that that unfortunate duel was carried on with an unusual degree of animosity and perseverance. The parties (for I will speak of them at present jointly) did not appear to be satisfied with that sort of vindication of their honour, which has prevailed in this unfortunate, fashionable mode of deciding differences; they did not satisfy themselves with exchanging each a shot, shewing that they met like men of honour, and had kept their appointment; but shot after shot was fired to the amount of four or five discharges on each side, before the deceased fell, that is a circumstance unquestionably material, to which party that obstinacy is imputable, the evidence will best enable you to judge. I am of course instructed, on the part of the prosecution, to state, that it was imputable to the prisoner at the bar; that he refused to be satisfied with those usual modes of satisfaction, which the laws of honour, essentially differing from the laws of the country, have introduced; and that, by the declarations made by him, at that time, you will find, that the object of the duel, I am afraid, was not so much the satisfaction of his honour, as either the fulfilling of his revenge for the injury he had sustained, in not being paid the full amount of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170045"></xptr>debt he had demanded, or enforcing that payment by a means, which I will venture to say, if that is the case, neither the laws of honour, nor of the country, can justify; for the subject of duelling, when it it is applied not to the restoration of injured honour, but to enforce the payment of debts, is equally repugnant to the principles of honour as of law. It will, therefore, with respect to the degree of guilt, in this case, be undoubtedly material, that these circumstances should be laid before you; and if it should turn out to he as it is stated to me, I am afraid they will afford a very strong suspicion of the conduct of the unfortunate gentleman at the bar. It will appear, that, in the interval-between the different sirings, certain conversations took place between these gentlemen and their seconds, and propositions were made, which must necessarily relate to the transactions I before referred to, and could relate to nothing else; for that sums of money were offered, by the second of Mr. Rowlls, to Mr. England, and rejected by him; which sums of money put, as I am instructed, the principles of honour entirely out of the question.</p>
               <p>Having stated this, which it is my duty to state, from the instructions I have received, which, if they are not proved, I cannot too often repeat to you, that it will be your duty to forget, and lay out of the question. Gentlemen, a circumstance is stated to me, that after several shots had been fired, Mr. Rowlls's pistol went off; and, either by design or accident, was fired into the ground, at so small a distance from himself, that it appeared not to have been directed to the prisoner; and, at the same time, I am instructed, that the prisoner fired his pistol into the air; that circumstance will have, undoubtedly, all the weight that it ought to have in your consideration, and happy would it have been if that had terminated the dispute; whose fault it was that it did not, you will best hear from the witnesses; unhappily it did not; negotiations took place, the parties still remained unsatisfied, and, with a degree of perseverance, I had almost said serocity, unusual upon those occasions, the pistols were again loaded; Mr. England received the fire of Mr. Rowlls, who, I believe, fired first, upon that occasion also: and then, reserving his fire, with some deliberation, he discharged that pistol at the deceased, which killed him on the spot; it wounded him in the groin to such a degree, that he immediately fell, and was carried dead fromthe field, that therefore his death was occasioned, in fact, by the prisoner, in consequence of a premeditated plan for meeting to decide their differences with the weapons and instruments of death; I am afraid there will not be a possibility of doubt; I am afraid that will impose upon you a duty, which undoubtedly will be more or less painful to you, according as the other circumstances of the case shall turn out for or against the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, I have thus stated to you (not with very minute particularity which I have avoided for the reasons I have told you) the general substance of the evidence that is to be laid before you, upon the part of the prosecution, It remains, however, to account for a circumstance that cannot but have struck your minds in the attention you have paid to the opening of this case, and that is the dates which you must have noticed, and the distance of time that has elapsed between the death of this gentleman and the prosecution for that death; and it becomes necessary that this matter may stand fairly, and to vindicate the conduct of the prosecution itself, it becomes indispensibly necessary to state to you, that that has been wholly occasioned by the prisoner; I do not wish to draw any stronger inferences of guilt from that circumstance, than your own unbiassed opinions and consciences may lead you to think it warrants; but in point of fact, immediately upon the decease of this unfortunate gentleman, Mr. England sted from the spot, and sted from his country, and remained abroad for a number of years; the prosecution was instituted, proceedings were had against Mr. England, he having sted; the only proceedings which can be had against an absent man were entered, and Mr. England was, by the prosecutrix, outlawed; under that outlawry he remained till lately, when he returned again to England, but, it was not till after, I think, four of the witnesses, who were examined before the coronor, who held an inquisition on the body of the unfortunate gentleman deceased, were dead. Whether by that circumstance public justice will be deprived of the evidence of those witnesses, will depend upon the opinion of the Court, whether they are or not admissible in evidence, if they have been properly authenticated in the manner which the law directs, I conceive them to be admissible in evidence; when Mr. England returned to this country, and appeared at large, he was apprehended upon the outlawry; that outlawry has been reversed, and he now stands upon his trial upon the original indictment. You may, perhaps, think, that after the lapse of so many years, there is a degree of animosity in persisting in coming forward with the prosecution against this unfortunate gentleman for his life; upon that subject, I can only say, that it would be a principle dangerous to the administration of justice, if persons, who withdraw themselves from the reach of the laws of their country, were afterwards to avail themselves of that circumstance, either as a circumstance in their own favour, or as the smallest degree of imputation upon those, who are called upon by a duty, perhaps little less painful than your own, to bring that prosecution into a court of justice. But the feelings and duty of a mother (for it is a mother who is the prosecutrix in this instance) the mother of the unfortunate gentleman, who fell by the hands of the prisoner, the feeling, and the duty of a mother would not permit her to suffer that person whom she conceived to be the murderer of her son, to walk at large in this country, after the commission of such an act, till there had been a full investigation of his conduct, by a court and jury of his country; that investigation I will do her the justice to believe and to assure you, on her behalf, that whatever may be her feelings as a mother, she wishes they may be directed by the principles of public justice only. And, gentlemen, if you should find yourselves warranted by the evidence under the direction in point of law, of the learned Judge to release the prisoner at the bar, I trust the animosities will be buried in the grave of her son, and that she will be perfectly satisfied with your verdict; but I have no doubt that you will pay that attention which the importance of this case deserves, that you will deliberate, with every indulgence that the case of the prisoner requires, consistent with law and justice; and if you find yourselves upon the evidence warranted to doubt that the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170046"></xptr>death was occasioned by the prisoner, in consequence of a pre-concerted purpose, you will judge whether the case more or less interests your feelings to render the discharge of your duty more or less painful; it will be your duty to deliver him into the hands of public justice, accompanied with mercy, under the direction of those by whom the laws are now to be administered.</p>
               <p>The Right Hon. the Earl of DERBY sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Mingay. Q. Does your Lordship recollect any thing which took place at Ascot races, in June, 1784? - A. I cannot particularly swear to the year; I have been there several years; but, I believe, I can save the Court a great deal of trouble by saying, that I was present at a dispute which took place between the prisoner at the bar and Mr. Rowlls.</p>
               <p>Q. Will your Lordship have the goodness to relate how it commenced, and how it proceeded? - A. I must preface what I have to say on this subject, by stating, that at such a distance of time, it is very difficult for any body to state, with that sort of accuracy that a man would wish upon oath, particular words in a case of this sort; but as accurately as I can, I will endeavour to relate the circumstances that took place; I must also add another circumstance, that I was perhaps at as great a distance from the transaction, as the nature of the place we were in would admit, the transaction taking place at one end of the booth, I being at the other end; but the first thing that struck my attention was, an appeal from the prisoner at the bar to the company, by way of caution, and the purport of it was, not to bet with Mr. Rowlls, as he was a person who neither paid the money he betted, nor the money which he lost; to the words I do not prosess to be accurate, but that was the purport of them; Mr. England was then sitting upon a bench or stand, which might be as wide as this (pointing to the table), and his face turned to the people in the stand; Mr. Rowlls came up to him in a very boisterous and violent manner, and appeared to me to offer to strike him, adding words to this effect, "what do you mean by that you rascal, you scoundrel," or some such words; Mr. England behaved with as much coolness and temper as ever I witnessed upon any occasion in my life; the prisoner said, "stand off, for if you strike me, I shall be obliged to knock you down, (he had a stick in his hand); our altercation has already disturbed the company a great deal too much; if you have any thing further to say to me, you or your friend," or words to that purpose,"know where I am to be found;" some further altercation took place between the parties at that time, as I have reason to believe, both from the circumstance of their remaining in that sort of situation for some time, (though from the distance at which I stood, and the noise in the stand, I could not distinctly hear) and also from having heard so from credible witnesses since; sometime after this the parties withdrew, and from that time to this I believe I have never seen one or the other.</p>

             called in.</p>
               <p>My Lord, as there has been a report gone abroad, that I was second to one of the gentlemen, I should wish to put myself under your Lordship's protection; if your Lordship can give any better advice, I shall be happy to take it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Rooke. If Mr. Donnisthorpe objects to be examined, we are all of opinion that it ought not to be pressed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sergeant Adair. I certainly shall not press it.</p>
               <p>Capt. Donnisthorpe. I have no objection to throw any light upon the subject, as a gentleman, and a man of honour, provided I do not criminate myself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Erskine. The very form of the oath renders it unnecessary for us to object, because he must relate the whole.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sergeant Adair. Will your Lordship permit, that he having been reported to be in the situation of an accessary to this fact, be examined as an accessary.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Rooke. I cannot make up my mind upon that subject. Can you suggest to the Court, in what way we can admit him; giving him an assurance that he shall never be indicted as an accessary.(The witness ordered to withdraw).</p>
               <p>Mr. Sergeant Adair. My Lord, in the first place, it appears highly probable, that the evidence of Capt. Donnisthorpe will be material to the ends of public justice on the one side or the other; because if Capt. Donnisthorpe was present, and accompanied the party in the field, circumstances must be within his knowledge, very materially affecting the merits of this question, which every way his evidence might turn out, whether favourable or unfavourable to the prisoner, I am not now at liberty even to presume; I would rather leave the question, therefore, in the hands of the Court; seeing, as I think your Lordships must do, that this is evidence material for the information of the Court, and material to public justice, and that your Lordship's admitting him now as an evidence for the Crown, will be a protection to him; your Lordship's sitting in a Commission of Oyer and Terminer, stand in the same situation as your Lordships do as Justices of Assize; if it is necessary for public justice, to admit this gentleman as an evidence, he will be admitted in the same way that other witnesses are.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Rooke. And the Attorney-General would grant a noli proseqnt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sergeant Adair. And even if he is indicted afterwards, no Court would proceed against him, having given evidence before your Lordships.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Rooke. I will tell you what at present we incline to do, and to hear Mr. Erskine's objection to it; we cannot absolutely protect this witness, but we can tell him, that if he chuses to tell the truth and the whole truth, that though he has no right to the King's pardon, yet, upon the recommendation of this Court, there is no<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170047"></xptr>doubt but he will have it; and leave it to himself whether he will be examined or not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Erskine. I have very little to say to your Lordships, upon this question, there is but one idea occurs to my mind upon that. I think if there be any one thing which distinguishes the character of English justice above all other, it is the great caution with which precedents are made, when there is a particular instance on which some other person might be convicted. I am very little accustomed, as your Lordships know, to stand in the situation which I do; it has not happened a great many times, in the course of my professional duty; and though I do not affect to be much acquainted with the forms, though I am with the general principles of criminal justice, I never heard of an instance of a witness being addressed in the manner in which this witness is proposed to be addressed; many witnesses have stood in the predicament that this witness does, and I submit to your Lordships, it would be making a promise which the Court cannot legally do; and, my Lord, after the excellent opening of my honourable and learned friend, the evidence of Captain Donnisthorpe cannot be necessary to prove what he proposes to prove.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord: your Lordships will forgive me, if I take the liberty of adding a few words, in a case of such importance; and, my Lord, I really feel myself in a much more embarrassed situation than before, because I am perfectly aware, that if Capt. Donnistorpe should not be examined, very important facts, in favour of the unfortunate gentleman at the bar, must be excluded from the consideration of the Jury. My Lord, we are not now debating whether this gentlemen is to be examined, aye or no, but whether he is to be put into a situation of indemnity; I must, for one, take the liberty of interposing my objections to his being placed in that situation. My Lord, I have not heard from the learned gentleman, who opened this case, any precedent for such indemnity; I will state several precedents, from whence, the impossibility of a witness being placed in that situation, is, I think, clearly to be inferred; I shall state them from memory, and, I believe, that memory will be found to be correct. I had the good fortune to pass many of my younger years under the learned gentleman who has opened this cause, and, if I know any thing of the principles of criminal law, it was from the advocate for this prosecution that I have learned them.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I remember several instances, while I practised in this Court; the first is, the case of Dr. Dodd, who was tried for the forgery of a bond upon a noble Lord; upon that occasion, it was not conceived, that the attesting witness to that bond, who certainly had no moral guilt in that transaction; it did not occur to any body, that he could be entitled to any hope of indemnity; but that course was taken which is the constant practice, that an accomplice in guilt may entitle himself to a pardon, by making, antecedently to the time of trial, a full confession of his guilt, and so obtaining his pardon; thereby giving him such a claim upon the clemency of the Crown, as could not resisted, In that case, Mr. Robertson was the witness, and he was taken sub silentia before the Grand Jury; at which one of your Lordships, who I believe formed a part of that Court, was sorry, saying, that a counsel for the prosecution shall not be permitted to apply privately for a witness be carried to the Grand Jury; but the Court were to be asked leave to take the witness. It is a thing I have seen an hundred times since I have attended in this place.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I now come to the case of Mr. Puresoy; a case where I had the honour of conducting the prosecution, and my learned friend, Mr. Erskine, had that gentleman's life entrusted to his care. General Stanwich was the second; he was called, and so anxious were they, that persons absolutely attended as counsel for the witness, and yet there was no idea of indemnity in that case.</p>
               <p>My Lord, the next is, the case of Mr. Allen and Mr. Morris, who were tried at this bat; I was not present; my learned friend, who was then Recorder, might be present; Mr. Allen was a principal in the duel; Mr. Morris was Mr. Allen's second; and the gentleman who fell, was Mr. Delaney; Mr. Delaney, I believe, was his second; in that case, the second for the person who fell was examined as a witness; and he was not permitted to ask for the indemnity now asked by Capt. Donnisthorpe; and, I trust, that as it never has been done, your Lordship will not now make the precedent.</p>
               <p>My Lord, there is another case; the case of Colonel Gordon; and there was no question but the death of Col. Thomas was occasioned by his hand; the death was proved beyond a possibility of doubt; I had the honour of being one of the Colonel's counsel; Lord Chief Justice, then Lord Chief Baron, Eyre, presided; Capt. Hill, if I do not mistake, was the second to Colonel Gordon; he had all the feelings of a man of honour about him; he did not wish to be examined; and the Lord Chief Baron immediately, of his own motion. stated to Capt. Hill this: - Capt. Hill, it has appeared in this cause, that you have had a share in this matter, which may involve you in a degree of criminality; you may chuse whether you will be examined or not. Capt. Hill felt as every man of honour felt; he wished not to be examined; but, considering that his evidence might be of use to the Colonel, he submitted to be examined; bat not upon an offer of indemnity; and, therefore, I contend, that Capt. Donnisthorpe cannot be examined upon such promise of indemnity.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sergeant Adair. My Lord, I shall not press this matter one jot further than your Lordship shall be perfectly satisfied, that what you are about to do, is regular and conducive to the ends of justice; I reply rather on account of the argument used against it, than from any anxiety that I feel upon the point, for I have other witnesses to the fact.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Rooke. Then Brother Adair, let Captain Donnisthorpe be called in, and I will tell him the situation in which he stands; if he chuses to take the risk, there will be an end of it.</p>

               <p>Court. Mr. Donnisthorpe; you have been called here as a witness, and you hesitate to take the oath, doubting how far what you say may affect you hereafter; now, in answer to that doubt, the Court tell you this; they cannot compel you to be examined, but if you chuse to be examined, you must fulfil the terms of your oath, which is, to tell every thing you know, the truth, the whole<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170048"></xptr>truth, and nothing but the truth; you will have that honorary claim to the mercy of the Crown, which all accomplices, in criminal cases, have always had; and it is the established practice of the Courts of Justice of this country, where a witness does acquit himself honourably and fairly between the Crown and the party, that the Court should use its influence to protect that witness against future charges; if, under these circumstances, you chuse to be examined, the Court will hear you; if you think yourself not sufficiently secure, the Court cannot compel you; if you are examined, you will be liable to the whole cross-examination of the Counsel for the prisoner; and you must tell every thing you know respecting this business; I cannot explain your duty in shorter words than those of the oath; it must be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Captain Donnisthorpe. I will be guided by your Lordship's advice.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. In what line of life are you? - A. I live at the George, at Chifwick; I am a coachmaster: In 1784, I was servant to an uncle of mine, who then kept the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you in the month of June, 1784, go to Cranford-bridge with any body in a carriage? - A. I took up at Turnham-green a lady, to go to Cranford-bridge, with a Dr. Morrell; I used to stop at Mr. Goddard's, at Cranford-bridge, as I went backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>Q.What passed at Cranford-bridge that took your particular attention? - A. I stopped there to freshen my horses, and for the lady to get out, which she generally used to do; when I stopped, there was a lad waiting with a post-chaise; he was the first boy; what he said to me induced me to go through the house; as soon as I had got the lady out of the carriage, I went to the back of Mr. Goddard's garden, and there were some gentlemen fighting a duel in the common field about 50 or 60 yards from the garden.</p>
               <p>Q.Describe to my Lord, and the Gentlemen of the Jury, what you observed? - A. I saw no more than four; one of them, as soon as I came to the hedge side, I knew was Mr. Rowlls; two of them stood to the east and two to the west; it might be about 18 yards from each other; Mr. Rowlls was dressed in a light coloured waistcoat, with stripes round the pocket-holes, and narrow lace up the border, I cannot say positively, but to the best of my recollection he had no coat on; I heard some lady cry out, "Gentlemen, is not three times enough to try your courage, or do you want to murder one another;" a Lady D'Arterie they called her; soon after the same lady, to the best of my knowledge by the voice, said, Lord D'Arterie wanted to speak to them, and then they all four came very near where I heard the voice come from, to the best of my recollection, but I did not hear any conversation pass; they then went back to their ground again that they came from, and presented their pistols at each other; Mr. Rowlls's pistol went off, and the other gentleman's did not go off; I did not know his name; they said it was a Mr. England; then he presented the pistol again, and it went off, and shot Mr. Rowlls in the groin, as near<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170049"></xptr>as I can recollect; he took a bit of a feel, and fell on his left side.</p>
               <p>Q.What then became of the person who had shot him? - A. He went through the field, I believe, with the rest of the people; I should have interfered for Mr. Rowlls, as I knew him so well, to have prevented it, but there was a cry of keep off, that our lives were in danger, and to leave the business alone; but I cannot say whether it came from Mr. Rowlls's party or the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go up towards Mr. Rowlls as he lay on the ground? - A. I cannot speak to that.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you an opportunity to speak to Mr. Rowlls? - A. No; when I went through the hedge into the field, I could not see any life in him; I took up the pistol that was in his right hand, and went and said, Mr. Rowlls was no more; and then I saw the two gentlemen who stood to the west come round into the bowling-green house, and put their pistols into a box, which they put into a port-chaise, and made the best of their way towards London; one of them came out of the chaise again to get a sword, or pistol, or something he had left behind and got in again.</p>
               <p>Q.From the opportunity you had of observing the person who shot Mr. Rowlls, are you able to guess whether you should know the person again? - A. I don't know that I should; I don't think I should; I did not know any of them but Mr. Rowll.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did you know him; who was he? - A. He was a <rs id="t17960217-27-viclabel159" type="occupation">brewer</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. He was rather a wild, dissipated young man? - A. I don't know; he was a joculer, merry young man.</p>
               <p>Q.The two gentlemen that went away, went away in a chaise and pair? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see a chaise and pair waiting for Mr. Rowlls and his friend? - A. No; I saw but one chaise.</p>
               <p>Q. If you don't know it, it is easy to say so; do you happen to know whether there was a chaise and four in readiness for Mr. Rowlls? - A. No, I do not.</p>

               <p>Q. How far distant were you from the combatants then? - A. I suppose, not above a dozen, or fourteen yards, as nigh as I can recollect; it was a cart-house upon the same land. I saw Mr. Rowlls with his coat off; I did not know Mr. England; Mr. Rowlls, and Mr. Donnisthorpe, his second, walked up to the other gentleman, and his second, and I think I heard one say he would give 100l. and the other said, he would have 200l.; and then Mr. Rowlls turned short upon his left, went to his ground, and fired at Mr. England.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say who it was that said he would give 100l.; and who it was that said he would have 200l.? - A. I cannot recollect; I have had two sits of a fever since, so that my memory has failed me very much; one just before last Christmas, and the other just after this affair happened; I cannot recollect many things that I should do in my business now.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Sandeford.) Q. You say you saw a pistol presented just before Mr. Rowlls fell; was it fired as soon as it was presented? - A. It was a considerable time, so that a person had time to take a particular aim.</p>

               <p>Jury. Q. You said the pistol snapped; was it primed afterwards? - A. No; he held it in his right hand.</p>
               <p>Q. That was Mr. Rowlls's pistol? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.But the other pistol that did not go off, did you see it primed in order to discharge it afterwards? - A. I did not particularly notice; there was not any flash in the pan, so that the priming might remain in; but it went off afterwards, because I saw him fall.</p>
               <p>Q. What time do you think it was from the pistol snapping first, till you saw it fired? - A. I cannot speak to the time; It might be the space of a second or two.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Lawes. Q. Did you live at Cranford-bridge in 1784? - A. Yes; I worked, as gardener, at Mr. Goddard's; I was there when two gentlemen came into the room where I worked; I was nailing a tree against the wall; I did not know them; I saw them open a box with pistols in it; and they got out at the window, instead of out of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Look round, and tell us if you see either of the persons here? - A. I cannot be sure, because I never saw the gentleman before nor since; I saw but two fires; I cannot say which fired first or last; but I saw Mr. Rowlls fall, and the other gentleman got into a chaise and went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how many pistols were fired?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170050"></xptr>- A. I heard as many as five, but I cannot say any further.</p>
               <p>The Right Hon. LORD CREMORNE sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Sergeant Adair. Q. Did your Lordship stop at Cranford-bridge, at the time that the affair happened, which is the subject of this enqury? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Will your Lordship have the goodness to tell us what you saw and heard at the time; you were at that time Lord d'Arterie? - A. Yes; I went up stairs to write a note, to send back by the postision; while I was writing, I heard a shot; I was told there was a duel fighting; I immediately went down to a field where there were ten or twelve people; there was the Rev. Mr. Burrows, and Lady d' Arterie, met at the bottom of the stairs; Mr. Burrows and I agreed to go down and endeavour to stop further disagreement; to see if it could not be adjusted; we went down to the hedge, and Mr. Burrows addressed himself to the combatants; the second of Mr. Rowlls told us, we had no business there; it was not an affair of ours; and desired we would go away; upon this, there was no answer made; Mr. England advanced some steps towards us, took off his hat, and said these words, "Gentlemen, (says he) I have been cruelly treated, highly injured in my honour and character, let there be a reparation made to that, and I am ready to have done this moment." Immediately upon Mr. England's retiring to his ground again, the second of Mr. Rowlls addressed us a second time; and told us, it was no affair of ours at all, that if we did not go away, he should be obliged, however unwillingly, to make use of the word impertinent; Lady d'Arterie was there, while we were speaking, and fearing some words might pass disagreeably, she ran down alarmed along side of the hedge, where we were; and told the second, upon his making use of that word, "Sir, (says the) neither Mr. Burrows nor Lord'd Arterie, mean the least impertinence, be assured they do not; only give them leave to try if they cannot interfere so as to prevent the consequences."Mr. Rowlls's second said, "Gentlemen, I beg you will go away; madam, I beg you will go away." Upon that, we retired; the Rev. Mr. Antrobus went up, with Lady Cremerne, and I don't know whether Mr. Burrows went up with her, to prevent her seeing any consequences that might shock her; I staid in the bower till I saw Mr. Rowlls fall.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your Lordship an opportunity of seeing by whom the shot was fired, upon which Mr. Rowlls fell? - A. I did; that person was Mr. England.</p>
               <p>Q.Should you know the man again? - A. I never saw him but that once in my life, that I am not clear, about it; before Mr. England fired his pistol, Mr. Rowlls came up and spoke, but so low, that I did not hear what passed; Mr. England stood at his arm and drew back the pistol; I don't know what it was owing to, and Mr. Rowlls came up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Erskine. Q. Your Lordship has given evidence so very distinctly, that the Court and Jury have an opportunity of knowing it, and I shall only ask you one question; you have stated the language in which Mr. England addressed your Lordship, which is too plain to require a comment from me; did your Lordship see any thing which took off the impression made upon your mind by what he said to you of his disposition to peace? - A. The impression upon my mind was, that he was desirous of being done with it, if there was that reparation made to his honour.</p>
               <p>Q.On the other hand you observed great violence on the part of Mr. Rowlls's second? - A. I certainly did.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted Mr. Rowlls was near enough to be witness to that violence of his second? - A. He was close behind him.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Burrows, I believe, is a very respectable clergyman, and a friend of your Lordship's? - A. Nobody more so; he is since dead.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Will your Lordship have the goodness to step down towards the bar, and see if your Lordship knows any person there?(The Court ordered that several persons should stand with Mr. England, at the bar).</p>
               <p>Lord Cremorne. A. I am not quite clear, my Lord; it is so long ago, that I cannot upon my oath say.</p>

               <p>Mr. Mingay. Q. Have you any doubt upon your mind? - A. No; I was present at the time this unfortunate affair happened; I went to Cranford-bridge, at the request of Mr. Rowlls, the deceased, as a friend of his; we were at Windfor the night before the duel; and he asked me to go over with him; I heard two pistols fired; I saw nothing of the duel; but I met the prisoner after it was over, going into a chaise; a girl said, "Good God! Mr. Rowlls is shot!" Mr England came up at the same time, with two pistols in his hand; he threw up one of them in the air, and said, "yes; and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170051"></xptr>I would not have shot him now, if he had behaved like a gentleman.</p>

               <p>Q. How late was it when you left him? - A. Between ten and eleven o'clock; I lived at Eton at that time, and I went home.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you with him when he drank some spirits in the morning? - A. No; I did not see him in the morning.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sergeant Adair. Q. Do you remember, about the month of February, 1784, any proceedings, in Westminster-hall, between you and Mr. England?</p>
               <p>Mr. Erskine. You must not preface your question by appealing to that which you cannot prove in Court; alluding to certain proceedings, which are, not proved, neither can be proved; and in the next place, this being charged in June, you have not shewn any connexion.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Rooke. Q. Do you mean to give any intermediate evidence?</p>
               <p>Mr. Sergeant Adair. A. No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Rooke. Then we are all of opinion you should not offer it.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Lord Derby). Q. You have given us an account of the conversation that passed at Ascot, can your Lordship tell how long that was before the duel was fought? - A. I know nothing of the duel, of my own knowledge; but, I believe the duel took place next morning.</p>
               <p>(Mr. England put in a written defence, which was read by the clerk, as follows):</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, I will lay the condition of my mind before you, as it existed throughout the transactions, which, indeed, were the causes of the unfortunate event, which brings me. a long exiled and suffering prisoner, before you; and I address you most solemnly, and in the presence of God, to whom alone I can appeal for the truth of my declaration. Mr. Rowlls had soread reports injurious to my character; and to remove this unfounded and ruinous imputation, I solemnly declare, all my conduct was directed; and it is surely incredible that I should be desirous to expose my life to the most imminent peril, in pursuit of an insignificant sum of money; but yielding to the feelings of honour, I was anxious to redeem myself from shame, urged by a principle that has always been considered by juries with tenderness and indulgence. The situation in which, most unfortunately I was placed, by his conduct, led to the altercation in the stand, as proved by Lord Derby, was resented by the deceased, by a public challenge, accompanied with insults and reproaches, and threats of blows, which left no alternative between my consent to meet him, and the relinquishment of the title of a gentleman, and of every comfort that renders human life any other than an intolerable burden. Gentlemen, still speaking in the presence of God, who knows the heart of man, I received my adversary's challenge, and met him in the field with no other sensation than regard to my wounded character, which I laboured to repair without danger to Mr. Rowlls, and struggled to avert from him all dangers, in a manner almost without parallel in any one case where affairs of honour have ever unfortunately been brought to such a crisis; after I had exposed myself three times to death, because the declaration which was to restore my character, was refused; I fired my pistol in the air, the signal of peace and reconciliation; I did so to give Mr. Rowlls an opportunity to do me justice, without a possible restection upon his own character; I did that at the risk even of my own honour to satisfy his, and to avoid the horror I felt at being the cause of death, by the possible accidents of that unfortunate situation. The honourable and learned advocate for the Crown indulgently directed your attention to this circumstance in my favour; after the interference of the gentlemen who attended us, all justice was refused, and I was left to the dreadful alternative of retiring disgraced and dishonoured, or submitting to the progress of the duel, which he was resohed to pursue; again, I received Mr. Rowlls's fire, without the least disposition to return it, exposing my life to further peril, keeping danger from him, seeking nothing but the privilege of living not disgraced, which, in my mind, is worse than not living at all. For the proof of these transactions, I need not now appeal to the testi<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170052"></xptr>mony of witnesses, because a most disinterested and honourable nobleman providentially present, by mere accident, upon the spot, has proved it; but it has appeared in evidence, that the unfortunate gentleman came to the field with sentiments and feelings widely and fatally different from mine, as appears by Lord Cremorne's evidence; but unfortunately Mr. Rowlls came resolved, that nothing should terminate the quarrel but his death or mine; and with the resolution also, to make no reparation to my honour, though his could not have suffered; because I offered to go publickly to the stand, and satisfy him. My own conscrence acquits me of malice; and I leave myself in your hands, upon the liberal principles avowed by the learned and honourable advocate for the prosecution, who does not wish to shut out of your view those circumstances which, in this day, may bring before you for judgment, the most humane and best of mankind.</p>

               <p>The Right Hon. the MARQUIS of HERTFORD sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. I believe your Lordship has had some opportunity of acquaintance with Mr. England? - A. None, previous to the unhappy affair which occasions his appearing at this bar; but I have observed his humane conduct abroad for fifteen years past, particularly at the Spa; he was always distinguished by the civility and respect which he shewed towards every person with whom he had intercourse; he always behaved generously and handsomely to his countrymen when in distress; and, instead of promoting quarrels and diffention, would endeavour to avoid them; I have observed instances in which he has shewn a very pacific disposition, so far as was consistent with the character of a gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. From your Lordship's observation of the character and conduct of Mr. England, and from facts communicated to you, by others, do you take him to be a troublesome man, promoting quarrels, or a peaceable man? - A. I am persuaded, from all I have seen of him, he is totally devoid of the murderous disposition imputed to him out of doors, and which, I hope, is wiped away by the handsome manner in which Lord Derby has spoke of him.</p>
               <p>Court. We cannot hear that, my Lord.</p>
               <p>A. Mr. Garrow put it to me very generally; I beg your Lordship's pardon.</p>

My first knowledge of Mr. England was in or about the year 1783; I frequently met him at places of public resort; afterwards at Spa, in 1787; his behaviour, as far as ever it came under my observation, was decent and gentleman-like; his deportment, instead of that of a man seeking quarrels, was that of a man strenuous to avoid them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to you, from his general deportment, to be a man of a quarrelsome disposition? - A. Quite the contrary: and, I must beg leave to add, that my opinion of his disposition, in that respect, was formed previous to the unhappy accident which took place, and has been continued down to this time.</p>

             Rowlls, on the 18th of June, 1784, at Cranford-bridge, by shooting him with a pistol. It appears, in the course of this evidence, that the death of Mr. Rowlls ensued in consequence of a duel, and therefore, before I sum up any evidence to you, it will be very proper that I should open your minds upon the law of this land, on the subject of duelling, and I believe I shall have the concurrence of my two brothers on the bench with me, when I tell you that there is no doubt, that in point of law, when two parties meet together deliberately, and not in the then heat of blood for the purpose of seeking each others lives, that whoever gave the challenge, if either falls, it is murder in the other, by whose hand he falls. I state this, not on the authority of the Judges of this day alone, but I will state to you a series of authorities of the ablest and best men that the courts of judicature of this country have ever known, from Lord Coke down to the present time.</p>
               <p>Lord Coke, in a case, very similar to the present, the case of one Taverner, who had fought a duel, who had fled his country, who was outlawed, who returned after that outlawry, and got his outlawry reversed, was afterwards tried at the bar of the King's-bench, and in that case, Lord Coke, assisted by Croke, Dodderidge, and Haughton, laid this down for law: "This," says he," I say, for law, that if one only do give the cause of provocation, and send the challenge, and the other accepts of it, and upon this they enter combat, and he who sends the challenge is killed, this is clearly murder in the other." My Lord Hale, as humane a Judge as ever sat in a court, adopts this case, and cites it in his treatise for law. My Lord Chief Justice Holt, who had as tender a regard for the liberties and lives of his fellow-subjects as any man ever had, in the case of the Queen and Moggeridge, supposes this case, that in a set duel there are mutual passes made between the combatants, yet, if there be original malice between the parties, it is not the interchange of blows will make any alteration in the original intention. If a time was appointed to fight, as suppose the next day, and accordingly do fight, it is murder in him that kills the other; but if they go into the field immediately and fight, then but manslaughter. My Lord Raymond, who was a great ornament to the judicature of this country, in giving the opinion of the judges in the case of Major

            , who had killed a Mr. Gore in a duel, cites with approbation these two cases from an author of authority, of the name of Crompton; he says, "Two quarrelled, one says, if you go into the field, I will break your head, and there one kills the other, murder. Two fell out on a sudden in the town. and they, by agreement, go into the field presently, and one kills the other, murder." And he follows this case up with this doctrine,"though the law of England is so peculiarly favourable as to permit the excuse of anger and passion (which a man ought to keep under and to govern), in some instances, to extenuate crimes even so heinous as that of taking away man's life; yet in these cases it must be such a passion, as for the time deprives him of his reasoning faculties; for if it appears that reason has assumed its office, if it appears that he reslects, deliberates, and considers, before he gives the fatal stroke, (which be cannot as long as the sury of passion continues,) the law will no longer exempt him from the punishment, which, from the greatness of the injury, and the heinousness of the crime he justly deserves, so as to lessen it from murder to manslaughter." This doctrine is again adopted by Sergeant

            , in his pleas of the Crown, and is also adopted by Mr. Justice Foster, whom the public revered for his humanity; and it is followed up by Mr. Justice Blackstone, in very particular words: he says, "Express malice is when one with a sedate, deliberate mind, and formed design, doth kill another, which formed design is evidenced by external circumstances, discovering that inward intention, as lying in wait, antecedent menaces, former grudges, and concerted schemes to do him some bodily harm. This takes in the case of deliberate duelling where both parties meet avowedly with an intent to murder, thinking it their duty as gentlemen, and claiming it as their right to wanton with their own lives, and those of their fellow-creatures, without any warrant or authority from any person, either divine or human; but in direct contradiction to the laws, both of God and man, and therefore the law has justly fixed the crime and punishment of murder on them and on their second, also; yet it requires such a degree of passive valour to combat even the dread of undeserved contempt, arising from the false notions of honour, too generally received in Europe, that the strongest prohibitions and penalties of the law will never be entirely effectual to eradicate this unhappy custom, till a method he found out of compelling the original aggressor to make some other satisfaction to the affronted party, which the world shall esteem equally reputable, as that which is now given at the hazard of the life and fortune, as well of the person insulted, as of him who hath given the insult." Upon this ground, I have no doubt in stating to you, that where parties meet deliberately together, seeking the life of each other, and have not the excuse of sudden provocation, and such passion as overpowers their reason; there is no doubt that the law considers, that if one falls, the death of that person is procured by murder, and that the other is guilty of that crime. The law here you see is strict and positive; there is a false notion, and a fashion in the world, on the other side, it will be for you to say, after I have stated the circumstances of this case to you, whether you think there are grounds to suppose here that there was any sudden passion or provocation; whether the parties were in such heat of blood as not to know what they did at the time they were fighting the duel; if you are of opinion there was no such heat of blood at that time, then I must tell you, that if you pronounce the prisoner guilty of manslaughter and not of murder,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170054"></xptr>you will give way to the fashion of the times, at the expence of the law of the land.(Here the learned judge summed up the evidence to the Jury, after which he proceeded as follows:)</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, upon these facts the prisoner's case is to be lost you, and I believe I have the concurrence of my having on the bench, when I tell you that a deliberate due upon whatever provocation in the eye of law, is plater; for the law does lean to repress those false notions of honour, which men unhappily have taken up among themselves; it will keep the peace, and will keep it diligently and carefully whenever there are any opportunities of intersering, but will not suffer a person, through a false notion of honour, to meet deliberately in a field, with a design to take away the life of another. at the same time the law says, if they meet under circumstances of sudden provocation, the man who takes away the life of the other is guilty of manslaughter only.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, you have heard the circumstances of this case; there is a quarrel at Ascot-heath races, and a very gross insult is given on both sides as appears to me; for on the one side there is a public proclamation, that the deceased would not pay what he borrowed, and then there is an attempt to strike Mr. England, accompanied with these words, "what do you mean by that, you rascal, you scoundrel." or some such words; the next day they meet at Cransord-bridge, coming in different parties; it does not appear that they had met in the room before they got to the field; you find that there is great heat on the part of Mr. Rowlls's second; it rests on the prisoner to shew that he had received, immediately before the duel, some ground of provocation; there is nothing of that kind shewn on the part of the prisoner. It appears from Lord Cremorne's evidence, that at the time that his Lordship and others intersered, Mr. England took off his bat and said, "Gentlemen, I have been cruelly treated, highly injured in my honour and character, let there be a reparation done to that, and I am ready to have done this moment." Upon these words, gentlemen, I had better make no comment at all; I shall leave you to consider whether these were the words of an angry injured man who had received that morning any particular insult; or of a man who did it in consequence of what passed the day before, deliberately at Ascot races. - If you think they are the words of a deliberate man, they make against him; if you believe they are the words of an angry man, as relating to something that passed immediately before the duel, they are in his favour; on the other hand, you have this declaration which makes against the prisoner, that after he had shot Mr. Rowlls, instead of going up to assist Mr. Rowlls, he makes off for his chaise; and, in consequence of the exclamation of the servant girl, he says, "I would not have shot him now, if he had behaved like a gentleman:" you will consider that expression, whether that shews that he was in possession of his senses at the time, and whether it shews matter of deliberation and coolness, and such as the law will not consider as varranting you in declaring this to be a manslaughter; namely, it you find Mr. England to have been cool, and in the possession of himself before the duel, during the tuel, and after the duel, the law is strict; if on the other and you think he had met with any provocation that morning (none appearing before us,) so as to carry him to the field in great heat of blood, then the law does so far indulge, and allow for the insirmities of human nature; as to authorize you to say, upon your oath, that he is guilty of munslaughter only. - Under these direction it will be for you, gentlemen, to decide.(The Jury having withdrawn about twenty-five minutes, brought in a verdict <rs id="t17960217-27-verdict161" type="verdictDescription">

            </rs>).</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Rooke immediately passed sentence as follows:</p>
               <p>Richard England - You have been convicted, through the mercy of the Jury, of the crime of Manslaughter only, having been indicted of the crime of Murder. The grounds on which the Jury have gone, it is not for the Court to enquire after; I have no doubt that they have satisfied their own consciences in acquitting you of the murder; but you stand before the Court under such circumstances as do not lead this Court to incline to shew any particular lenity to you; you have fled the justice of your country for twelve years; you have, in the course of that time, had benefit from the death of several witnesses who were examined before the Coroner; and, by not chusing to meet the justice of your country immediately after the crime was committed, you have prevented the Court from knowing fully all the circumstances of this case; such circumstances as have come before them, lead the Court to think that your case, though of Manslaughter, is by no means a favourable case of Manslaughter; for you have met your fellow-subject deliberately in the field, and, for aught that I can see in the course of this evidence, you have perfectly preserved your recollection and deliberation during the whole of the transaction. It is very much to be lamented, that the laws of honour, which prevail among, I am afraid, almost all the ranks of society at this time, should be so directly in opposition to the public law of the land; but it is so, and it often serves, and in this instance it has served, to prevent you from executing the dreadful, the grand, and the ultimate vengeance of the law.</p>
               <p>Having been convicted of Manslaughter, the Court think it proper to set you forth as an example in future, to let the world know, that they cannot commit even the crime of Manslaughter in a duel, without subjecting themselves to very considerable punishment; such punishment as the Court are warranted in inflicting, they do inflict upon you.

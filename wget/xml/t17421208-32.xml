            . I took a Room of the Prisoner's Brother to put some Goods in, and have lost a great Quantity of Goods, particularly a large Pottage-pot. I, about the 24th of last Month, happened accidentally to go into that Gentleman's House (Mr Bartlet's, in St John-Street) and found this Pot, which holds three Pails and a half of Water; he said, he bought it for eight Shillings, but it cost me thirty-six Shillings.</p>

            . I live at the Horns, in St John-Street ; The latter End of October, or the Beginning of November, the Prisoner at the Bar came to my House one Evening, with a large Pottage-pot, (I thought to leave it there, as there is most commonly a great many Goods left at my House) very much fuddled; Landlord, said she, my Mother is lately dead at Highgate, and I have a Mind to change this Pot for a smaller one. No, said I, I do not Care to do it; She said, I must have Money to Night. I said, Be persuaded by me, and leave it till To-morrow and consider of it. And with great Persuasion, I prevail'd on her so to do; she desired to have some Money upon it, which I let her have, I think it was six or seven Shillings: One Day, this Mrs Tipler came in; said she, Do you know any Thing of a Pottage-pot being left here for me? I told her it was in the Kitchen: Mrs Tipler went into the Kitchen, said she, This is my Pot, it was stole from me. Said I, If it is your Pot, take it; but I hope you will be so good as to let me have the Money that I lent the Creature upon it. She said, she was very much obliged to me, and would drink with me; but she went to Justice Wroth , and got a Search Warrant. - I cannot say whether that is the Woman that brought it; she was then dressed neat, and in a clean Linnen Gown.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had some Words with her one Day, when she was in Liquor, as she commonly is, and she said she would be revenged on me.</p>

            . This Creature came to me, I believe it was about the Time that Mrs Tipler lost her Pot, and as I live by the Road Side, desired to leave a Pot to be delivered to the Carrier, and directed for Mrs Page, to be left at the Horns in St John's-Street, till called for: She came back again, and said, there is the Carrier; and took it away, and I have not seen her since.</p>

He answer'd, kill your Master's Fowls. She ask'd how? They said, they would bring her a thing to do it with, and the next Night they brought her a Stick with a Wier ty'd to the End of it, telling her, she must put it up the Bodies of the Fowls, and it would draw their Guts out. That the next Night they came again, and ask'd her, if she had kill'd any? And she told them she had kill'd two; that they came again the next Night, and Mr. Frame ask'd her to do one thing more, and that was to set Fire to her Master's House, and that she being unwilling, Farrington said, D - n you, if you will nor, some Body else shall, and that the House was set on Fire 2 Nights after. That the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173106020015"></xptr> second Time it was set on Fire, she seeing the Prisoner setting Fire, to it, he jump'd down, and said to her, D - n you, you have frightned me, and if you do not tell me, if they are all still, I have got a Knife, and I will kill you this Minute; that she told him they were all a Dancing, and this was an Hour before Day.</p>
               <p>This Evidence being ask'd by the Court, Why she did not discover this till so long time after? (which, as she said, was about three Weeks since she discover'd it) she answer'd, because she was afraid of her Life; but not being easy in her Mind, without discovering it, she did declare it; she added, that after the Prisoner had jump'd down, he shew'd her a Paper, Touch-Wood and Tinder-Box, that this was about an Hour before Day, and that about an Hour after it was Day, he was behind the new Chimney, and he shew'd a Pipe and Touch-Wood, and told her, that it would lie 3 or 4 Hours before it kindled; that he lighted the Touch-Wood, and put it under the Thatch, and that afterwards it was all on a Blaze, and that he came the third Time, and was behind the new Chimney, and she saw him light the Touch-Wood with his Pipe, and put it under the Thatch; that her Mistress sending up the Boy to take down the Straw that was about, he cry'd Fire.</p>

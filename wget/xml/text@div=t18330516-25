On the 15th of April, I was sitting in my room about a quarter after twelve o'clock, I had previously withdrawn the bolt of my chamber, my clerk being out; I heard the door go and some person go into my bed-room - I thought it was my clerk, but in a minute or a minute and a half I heard the door go again, I went to the door, and saw the prisoner with some musical-sticks in his hand; I said, "You have been in my bed-room" - he said he came to sell the sticks - I said stand still; I opened my bed-room door, and found the boot-rack was stripped - I secured the prisoner and in his bag I found these boots which had been safe an hour and a half before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he say he had bought the boots? A. Yes, of a tall man in my chambers - he did not say it was me - he said it when the porter came and took him - I had not seen the prisoner before.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I go through the temple every day - a gentleman called me and took me to these chambers; he offered me these boots for sale, and asked 30s. for them - I gave him a sovereign, and this gentleman took me while I was putting them into my bag.</p>
               <p>Charles Barnett, Hackney-road, and W. Bignall, Pearson-street, gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

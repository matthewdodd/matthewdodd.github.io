               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long have you lived at Southgate? A. Between twenty-four and twenty-five years; I know the prisoners formerly lived there; they worked for me, and I let them a piece of ground once - the nankeen was bought a few days before I went from home; I was absent about a week - I understand the prisoners had left Southgate two months before the robbery - they were found at Ponder's-end, about three miles and half from Southgate; I bought the nankeen of Mr. Hudal; there were three pieces, which makes the difference in the shade - I saw it in the drawers in the study, where the scrutoire was broken open, the very day I left.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Among all the articles you lost nothing has been found but the nankeen? A. Nothing but that and some pork - I bought three pices of nankeen for Mrs. Lloyd the day before she went to town; I bought it for her - I went to the shop for it; I saw it at Enfield afterwards.</p>

            . I am beadle of Enfield. I have seen the prisoners before, but knew very little about them; I have seen them at Southgate. On Sunday, the 30th of January, I went with a warrant to search their premises - it is a neat little cottage at Ponder's-end, Enfield, a four roomed house; I found the two prisoners and their wives sitting taking breakfast together - there was but one tea-pot, one loaf, and sugar-bason - I asked who the house belonged to; one of the women answered," It belongs to one as well as the other" - that they paid the rent between them; I went up stairs, leaving another person below, and in a tea-cup on the mantel-piece found a duplicate which I produce - Mrs. Glover went with me; she called herself Mrs. Glover - I brought the duplicate down and showed it to the prisoners; all four were present - Glover's wife said the property named in the duplicate belonged to her and her sister; that they bought a piece of nankeen between them, and part of it was made up - the duplicate is for a coat, breeches, petticoat, nankeen, and other things, pawned with Mr. King, of Edmonton, for 6s. 6d.; in the name of Ann Glover, Southgate; I took the prisoners into custody.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. King, a pawnbroker, of Edmonton. On the 28th of January, a woman, who gave her name as Ann Glover, pawned some thing with me, for which I gave her the duplicate produced; there was a white petticoat among the articles pawned - I afterwards saw a woman at the office at Enfield, who I believe to be the woman who pawned them; she also came to my master's house after pawning the things - that was the night after I heard of the robbery.</p>

            WARD. I have five napkins, a white petticoat, two towels, a pair of breeches, and a piece of nankeen, which I call a little coat; it is part of the property pawned by Mrs. Peters on the 28th.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is there any other article in this indictment which you produce, except the nankeen? A. No; the petticoat is white cotton, the nankeen is not a petticoat - it is a child's coat; and here is a piece of nankeen of three breadths.</p>
               <p>MRS. LLOYD. I know this nankeen; these three breadths formed half a petticoat - I know it to be the same; I know my cutting out, and the manner in which it is formed; this nankeen coat has the shade of the nankeen I bought, which is a shade lighter than the rest, and here is a tuck which has been taken out - it corresponds in colour, and the size of the tuck which has been taken out; it corresponds with the other part.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say that coat has once been in some other shape? A. Yes - I only judge of its being mine from the mark of the tuck.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Point out what you swear to the nankeen by? A. By the manner in which I cut it out - I know it by the length; I have not measured it: the three breadths are the length; they were not quite a yard and a quarter long when I cut them out - when I left it was in six separate breadths, not in its present state; the shade of the middle breadth of the coat is lighter than the other two.</p>

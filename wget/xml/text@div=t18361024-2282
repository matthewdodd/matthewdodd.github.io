                  </hi>. I am in partnership with henry Adams, and am a nursery-man in the King's-road, Chelsea. On the 7th of Octo<lb></lb>ber, about six o'clock in the evening the prisoner came and presented me this order for bulbs. (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Gentlemen—Please send, per bearer, 600 yellow Crocuses, 50 Soliel D' Or Narcissus, 50 Grand Primo Citrono, and 100 Hyacinths, for James Gray and Son, Brompton-park"—I told him there was no price attached to the hyacinths, and to go back and come again in the morning, as they vary in price—he came again in the morning, be<lb></lb>tween in six and seven o'clock, and presented this other order—"Gentlemen—Please to sent fifty Grand Primo Citrono, the Hyacinths must not be more than 60<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; must have some Waterloos with them, and twenty-five Vanthol Tulips.—From yours,—James Gray and Son."—he said he was going on to Mr. Knight's, and would call as he came back—when he re<lb></lb>turned, I said there must be some mistake about it, as I had previously sent to Mr. Gray's to know if it was correct—these hyacinths were out of the earth, and dry—I gave the prisoner some roots, and took him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to James Gray and Son, of Bromp<lb></lb>ton-park. I did not send the prisoner to Durban—these orders are not the writing of Messrs. Gray, or any person belonging to them—they are forgeries, I have no doubt—I was at the nursery on the 7th—if any orders had been sent, I should have sent them, but we were not buyers of these articles—we had plenty of them.</p>

I went after the prisoner, and took him with five parcels, containing flower-roots—in going to the station-house, he told me a man gave him the note on Friday night to take to Knightsbridge, and on the Saturday morning he said he was out, and met the same man, who gave him another note, and gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to take it—I asked if he knew the man—he said he did not, nor where he lived, but he was to wait there for him till he came up with the roots.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that a man had given his the order in the street to fetch the goods.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. James Finney, at Lower Tulse-hill, in Surrey. On the 11th of Aug. my master had a time-piece on the dining-room mantelpiece—I saw it safe at ten o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing, and missed it about one—I found the window open, and some marks of a little dirt on the window-cill, which was very unusual—they were footmarks—there was a little wire blind, which had been taken off the window and placed on the carpet—a person could not come inside without opening the blind—I heard no more of the time-piece till I saw it on the 23rd of Sept. in the possession of the policeman—this is it—there is a garden in front of the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Sowerby, a pawnbroker, in Chiswell-street. On the 22nd of Sept. the works of this time-piece were brought to our shop by a woman named King—I had received informa<lb></lb>tion, and declined taking the works in—King's husband afterwards brought the outside of the time-piece.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant G</hi> 20.) I saw Mr. King on the 22nd of Sept., and I received this time-piece—I accompanied King to the pri<lb></lb>soner's residence, in Three<lb></lb>tun-court, Wentworth-street, Whitechapel—it is a very humble place—he lives in a two-roomed house—there is a little bench under the window—I told him I had come to take him into custody for having a stolen time-piece in his possession, which he had sold to King, who was there with me—he said he was deaf, and I repeated the words in a loud tone—he then said, "I bought it here for 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of a travel<lb></lb>ler"—he</p>

               <p>said, "I often buy things of persons I don't know"—I took him to the station, and he repeated his statement—the time-piece was then at the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watch-maker. This time-piece was left at my place, on the 19th of Sept., by the prisoner, and on the 20th he told me it was for sale, and asked me if I could buy it.</p>

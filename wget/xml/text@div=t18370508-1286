                  </hi>. I live at Hillingdon. Dormer was in my service—I observed a duck and some oats in my granary, in my loft, on the 2nd of May, I gave no authority to put it there—Dormer was going to town on Tuesday, but he did not go till Wednesday, about twelve o'clock—Shackle lives at the Coach and Horses at Ealing—he is ostler there—that is in the way to London—I followed the wagon—I did not see it draw up there, but it was there when I went up, and then this corn and trust of hay was lying by the aide of the stable—Thomas Smith was with me—when I got up, I said to Dormer, "You have made a mistake, and called at the wrong place"—I said nothing to Shackle—I have seen this sack—it contains my property—the duck was on the cart in another sack—it was the same corn that I had observed in the loft.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gardener, and live not far from Mr. Gregory. He gave me information on Wednesday morning, and I watched the cart—I went to the Coach and Horses—the carman drove to the water-trough and watered his horses, he then backed his cart opposite the stable-door, got a ladder and placed it against the load, and threw down an, old sack that contained some food for his horses—he put some out of the sack into a trough—then he closed the mouth of the sack, put it on the load again and came down, took the ladder away and went into the house—I watched for some time—when he came out he put the ladder against the load again, and went up on it—I then turned my head, and heard some<lb></lb>thing fall apparently from the load—I turned round, and by the wagon I saw a new sack thrown from the top of the load, Shackle took it up and carried it into the stable—the other prisoner threw the new sack off—I went to Shackle and said, "I believe that to be Mr. Gregory's," and he put it down—he said he did not know it was stolen—I had observed the load before, and this sack was on the hind part—I could see part of it—I could not see all over it, it was partly in between the straw—this was about half-past four o'clock in the morning.</p>

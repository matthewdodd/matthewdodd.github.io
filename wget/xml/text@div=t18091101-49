            . I am assistant elder of the Bengal warehouse. In consequence of information from the last witness I went into the bale room, I found a coat deposited between two bales, I opened the coat, there were seven banks of silk in it, the same sort of silk as were in the Bengal warehouse. I called the prisoner into the office after the men were discharged; he was searched, nothing was found on him; I went up stairs to where the coat was deposited; I brought the coat down, and asked him if he knew any thing of the contents of Feathers's coat. He said, he did not. I said, do you mean to tell me you did not ask Lloyd for Feathers's coat. He said, it was at the request of Feathers that he should take care of it.</p>

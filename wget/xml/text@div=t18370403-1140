               <p>a miller at Greenwich. Jackson was his carter—on Wednesday, the 22nd of March, I observed Jackson at the stable, between one and two o'clock—he filled his nose-bogs with food, and brought them out—I had cut a piece of white paper up in pieces, and mixed it with the food in the stable, and in the loft as well—the nose-bags appeared full—he had no right to stop at the Kent-road in going up—there was no occasion for doing so—I saw the pose-bags filled that day with a mixture of brans, bran, and clover, a sample of which I have now—I found some of the pieces of paper in it—there is clover hay and meadow hay—there are three or four sorts of hay—this is a sort of hay—it corresponds with what I have.</p>

I received instructions from Mr. Butcher on Wednesday the 22nd of March, and followed Jackson with his wagon—he delivered some flour just by the half-way house in the Kent-road, and from there went to the White Swan, and Collins was standing by the horse-trough outside—Jackson went and spoke Co Collins, and train there he went into the public-house; when be came out, I saw Collins give him a dark sack, and Jackson threw it into the hind part of the wagon on a sack of flour—Jackson and the boy then drove off—I followed him till 1 got to a street, near Red Lion-square—he delivered some flour these, and the boy put the nose-bags on the horses—they were put on again at Windmill-Street, at a baker's-shop, when they were taken off for the last time, they then appeared about half full—there were three horses—I then followed him into Chancery-lane, and there Jackson got into the wagon—I followed him down to Fleet-street, and there got quite abreast of the wagon, and from the lights of the shop on the other side of the way, I could see Jacks on shaking something into the sack—I followed biro till they came near the White Swan, in the Kent-road—just before that, Jackson got out of the wagon—the boy drove the horse up to the door, and Collins was there—Jackson went and spoke to him—a carrier's cart was then going by, and when it passed, I saw Collins with a sack on his shoulder, close to the tail of the wagon—I followed him down into the stable yard, and saw him go up a flight of steps, into a loft—I did not see the nose-bags put on again—when I came down after seeing Cull ns come down, from the loft, I went into the road again, and felt the nose-bags, which had been then put on the horses</p>

               <p>—there was not I suppose half a pint of food in each—I gave informa<lb></lb>tion, and the next day I took Collins—I asked him whose stables they were—he said his—I said, "I suppose every thing belongs to you?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, I was an officer, and intended to search his stables—he said, "Very well"—I went up to the loft, and looked into a tub, four or five yards from the door, and found some food there, correspond ing with Mr. Carpenter's—I asked whose it was—he said he bought it at the shop—I said, "Whose shop?"—he said "What is that to you?"—I was before the justice—I had one sack, and Dyke the other, and in show. ing the sample out of the sack, Mr. Butcher produced several pieces of paper, and there was no great quantity of food—the paper in it fell on the floor, and then I tied up mine—Mr. Butcher stood about a yard or two from my sack—it was in Dyke's sack that tome pieces were put.</p>

On the 7th of March, between one and two o'clock, I was in a shed in my yard; my little boy gave me information, and I saw Bedford near my yard door - I asked what he did there: he said, "God bless you, Mrs., don't be hard hearted - I am a poor fellow in distress, and I was induced this morning to take some ducks; they have got my mate, and are after me;" he asked me to keep him from them - I told him I could not- he then asked me to let him out at my front door, which I did; he walked out, and turned to the left: I saw the officer - I called him, and he took him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Berners-street, but my shop is in Maddox-street—the house belongs to John Tomlinson, who occupies part of it. There is an internal communication between the shop and the rest of the house—on the evening of the 6th of February I was in the counting-house, and heard the shop door open, and on looking through a small window, between the shop and counting-house, I saw a piece of cloth taken off the cutting board, and taken out through the door, but I could not see the person who had it—I went out, and saw the prisoner with it, on his shoulder, in the street—I laid hold of him, and he dropped it, and strug<lb></lb>gled, but I kept him, and took him back to the shop—the cloth was picked up and brought to the shop by another person—I gave the prisoner in charge of a policeman—it is my property, and is worth 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner had got three doors down the street when I took him—I am tore the door was shut before.</p>

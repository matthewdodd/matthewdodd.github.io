            , my servant. I missed a silver milk pot, and two large spoons; I went into my shop, and missed my till, with about thirty or forty shillings worth of half-pence; I believe I locked the till about five minutes before eleven. I saw the milk pot and the spoons over night.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever found any thing again?</p>
               <p>Renvoize. A gardner found the till in the morning; I have seen nothing else since; when I came down, the shutter of the window next the door was taken off the hinges; the watchmen brought it to me. It was fast boltted when I went to bed; the sash was thrown up; I fastened it myself over night; I found this chissel (producing a large ripping chissel) and in the kitchen, upon the table, I found a box and burner. Pollard told me Jackson bought this chissel in Wapping, and that this box belongs to Suttle.</p>

            . I was coming home this evening, 24th of last month; I saw three men come out of the prosecutor's house, they crossed the way, and came up to me in a minute; it was about half an hour after twelve. the first held a cutlass over me, the second held a pistol to my forehead; he knock'd me down with it, and then shot me in the arm. Jackson was the man that held the cutlass over me, and demanded my money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or not loose sight of them after coming out of the prosecutor's house to you?</p>
               <p>Greenon No; I suppose it was not a minute's time. Jackson asked me what business I had there; another man, Suttle, shot me through the arm. It was a moon light night, very light. I think I know something of Calligan, but I am not quite sure.</p>
               <p>Q. from Jackson. Whether he swore before the justice that I was the man that shot him?</p>
               <p>Greenon. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. from Suttle. Whether you ever saw me before?</p>
               <p>Greenon. No, never.</p>
               <p>Suttle. That night was very dark and rainy; I look'd out of my window at night.</p>

            . The four prisoners and I went out together one night, about a fortnight ago.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been committed as an evidence?</p>
               <p>Pollard. I cannot tell rightly. I had known them about a twelvemonth. Jackson and Suttle and I went out a thieving; we met Callagan and Earles in the way; we asked them to go to the alehouse with us; I had known them before; we went a little way. We asked Earles and Callagan to go a thieving with us; they said they would not: they went away, and I never saw them till the next morning. We went up to a baker's, somewhere about Brick Lane in Bethnal Green near Shoreditch; Suttle and I broke open the house with two chissels; we broke open two window shutters of one window; we lifted up the window, and Suttle and I got in; the shutter hung half off; it was not pulled quite off.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of Jackson?</p>
               <p>Pollard. He was outside. This was about two o'clock, or half after; it was a lightish night. We got a silver milk pot, six silver spoons, and a till full of money. I took the till, Suttle took the spoons; there were 29 s.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177105150062"></xptr> in halfpence: we forced the till open with a chissel (this is one of them, taking up the chissel.)</p>
               <p>Q. Whose was it?</p>
               <p>Pollard. It belonged to us all three: we bought it in Wapping.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do afterwards?</p>
               <p>Pollard. I got out, and Suttle followed me. Jackson was on the other side of the way; we crossed over to him; we saw a young gentleman looking at us, we crossed the way to him.

             knocked him down with a pistol, and then let it fly at him. Jackson stood over him with a drawn cutlass; this is the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. to Greenon. You said you saw three people come out of this house?</p>
               <p>Greenon. Yes; it was three doors from my house: I saw two or three come from the house; they were very close; it is hardly twenty yards from my house: I was coming to my own house.</p>
               <p>Q. to Pollard. Do you know any thing of that box?</p>
               <p>Pollard. It is our box; Suttle, Jackson's and mine. (The box has tinder in it.)</p>

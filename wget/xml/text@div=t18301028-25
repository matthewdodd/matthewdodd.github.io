            . I am warehouseman to Messrs. Leaf and Co., warehouseman, of Watling-street. On Friday, the 8th of October, I saw a person named Bradley at my masters' warehouse - he produced to me specimens of gauze handkerchiefs for sale; I made no agreement to purchase them from the sample, but made an appointment with him, and in consequence of what I saw of the sample I made a communication to Messrs.

             came, saw them, and claimed them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you upon that see the prisoner? A. I had been in the habit of seeing him frequently, and I saw him next morning; Bradley was present - they did not come together; the prisoner was taken up stairs at our house - Mr. David Brand was present; not the slightest promise or threat was held out to him by any body whatever - Mr. Brand charged him with having betrayed his trust, the prisoner said he had betrayed his trust, and wished to know whether the affair could be compromised - he said he did not care so much for himself, but it was for his wife, who he was sure would break her heart.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you mean to say you have repeated the very words of the prisoner? A. I think I can say I have exactly; I do not mean that I have said every word he said, but the substance of all that was said, except that after Mr. Brand left the room, I asked the prisoner what could have induced him to have done as he had - he said he could assign no cause at all for it, he did not want the goods; the goods were not produced to him at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it said in what respect he had broken his trust, or did Mr. Brand simply say "You have broken your trust?" A. He stated at intervals the different quantity of goods he had taken; I have mentioned all that passed when Mr. Brand was there, as near as I can recollect - nothing more passed.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did I understand you to tell my friend, that he gave you some particulars, in the course of conversation? A. I said after Mr. Brand left the roomt he prisoner and myself had some conversation; I have stated the substance of all that transpired.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Was any thing further said? A. Nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you talking about? A. About his having stolen the goods - he said he had taken them three or four dozens at a time - I asked him what induced him to do it.</p>

            . I am a shopman to Messrs. Sharland and Co., Bishopsgate-street, linen-drapers. I sold to Mr. Danby goods similar to these; they are very likely to be the same - they are the same pattern: I have no mark on them - there was no mark of mine on them.</p>
               <p>Q. Are those the handkerchiefs you sold? A. Apparently they are.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are there tickets on them? A. There are, and I believe they are the same tickets which I saw on the articles I sold - I have no doubt of it; I sold the articles to Messrs. Leaf and Co.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you know the prisoner? A. I have seen him three or four times - I first saw him at Mrs. Wallis'.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after you sold the goods did you see the prisoner at Mrs. Wallis'? A. About an hour and a half; I went to Wallis' - it is No. 4 or 6, George-street, Minories - I saw the prisoner there; he asked me if I had not sold some goods to Leaf and Co. - I told him I had, 45l. worth - he told me that he and the party would pay me the amount if I would not call at Leaf's in the morning for the money - I had appointed to call at Leaf's in the morning for payment; the prisoner said if I went in the morning he should lose his situation.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How came you to buy these goods at all? A. I believe my employer had been in the habit of buying goods of Wallis for some years; the firm of Robert Sharland and Co. have been in the habit of buying of her - she does not keep a warehouse that I am aware of; she is a French milliner - she has some show-rooms; I have been in them - it must be a week ago since I saw her last; I do not know where she is now - I do not know that she has absconded - I have not searched for her; I am not aware that my master has endeavoured to find her - I never bought goods there myself; I sold these goods to Messrs. Leaf and Co., in in the name of Bradley and Co.; I am not one on MR. Sharland's firm - I have no partner.</p>
               <p>Q. Then did not you sell them under a false representation? A. I did, certainly; I had my reasons for that - they were nothing but honest reasons; it has been done in the trade before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you, in a respectable house, consider it honest to sell goods under a false representation? A. I should not consider it dishonest - it was not done with any idea of fraud; I consider it a crime to tell falsehoods - these goods were in my possession, and I sold them in my own name: I have no company, and they were not my goods - they were mine as long as they were in my possession; I considered them mine when in my possession - I had not bought them; they certainly belonged to

             and another. In consequence of information which I received on Friday, I went on Saturday, the 9th of October, to Messrs. Leaf and Co., and found the prisoner there; I had had a communication with Mr. Leaf, the day before, respecting these goods, and spoke to the prisoner on the subject; I did not promise or threaten him in any way whatever - I asked why it was he had betrayed the trust we had put in him - that was the first word I said to him; he said he had betrayed the trust we had put in him, and that he was very guilty - he wanted to know if it was possible the matter could be compromised; I told him No, it must stand on its own merits - he said he did not care about himself, but it would break his wife's heart; he asked a private word with me, and Mr. Danby retired - he said he hoped neither my brother nor me would do any thing rashly in the business; I questioned him as to when he began to pilfer; he said about the time I left London for Brighton, which was about three months ago; part of these articles were shown to him - these spider-bordered goose handkerchiefs, which are of a peculiar fabric; my brother Robert is the manufacturer of them - he lives at Glasgow; we had a consignment of that particular article, not more than two months before - half a dozen of them were brought to our house on Friday evening, from Messrs. Leaf and Co.'s, and were shown to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, go on with the conversation you had in the morning? A. I asked how many he thought he had taken beside the 45l. parcel produced - he said he believed he did not take more than 5l. or 6l. in addition to this parcel - the six constituted part of the parcel.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did this conversation take place between you two alone? A. Yes, he gave the explanation after Danby retired; he had seen the six handkerchiefs the night before, but they were not produced at the conversation, which took place at Messrs. Leaf's, and we had it all over again at our premises.</p>

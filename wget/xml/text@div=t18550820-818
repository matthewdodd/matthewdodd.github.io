On 10th Sept. last year, I left the house at about a quarter to 1 o'clock—I locked the door, and went to my work with my daughter—I returned at a quarter to 5 o'clock, and found the front door latched only, and the lock of the back door burst open—I missed my son's trowsers, coat, waistcoat, two pairs of boots, two handkerchiefs, two waistcoats, and two jackets—I found a handkerchief there which belongs to John Mahony, who has been convicted—I afterwards received some pawnbrokers' duplicates; I gave them to the man who came and examined the house.</p>

On 10th Sept last year, I saw the prisoner, who I had known by sight for some time, and Mahony, who has been convicted, leaning on the palings, at the back of the house which goes up to the six houses—I do not know how they got into that passage—they must either have got over, or gone through a neighbour's house.</p>

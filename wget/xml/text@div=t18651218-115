                  </hi>. I am shepherd to Charles Edward Smith, of Whitton—on the night of 28th October, I saw my master's 195 sheep safe—I went into a turnip-field about 6 next morning, and found one sheep killed—they had cut off the shoulders, the hind legs, and part of the loin, and had taken skin and all—I told my master, and then went to the bailiff—I noticed two foot-marks, where some one had stood to cut the sheep up—it was a very small-heeled boot, with one nail at the end of the tip of the heel—there were foot-marks of a second man, but not close to the first—I saw the prisoner in Whitton that night, at half-past 10 o'clock, with Gold-smith, about half a mile from where the sheep were—I saw Payne compare a pair of boots with the foot-marks at the side of the sheep—he made an impression by the side of the other mark, and they were very much alike—here is a mark on this boot where the tip has been broken off.</p>

I am bailiff to Charles Edward Smith, of Whitton—on 29th October, I received information from the shepherd, I went into a field, and saw the trunk of a sheep—the legs and shoulders had been taken away—I tracked the foot-marks out of the field, and saw that there were nails in them, but it was very wet and slippery—I could only see the track in some places.</p>

On 29th October I received infor<lb></lb>mation, went into the field, and saw that a sheep had been slaughtered in a furrow—it appeared to have had its throat cut, and a person appeared to have strode across it for a long time, as there were two very deep impressions of boots which had been repaired at the bottom, and a portion of the tip was gone—I went to Hounslow, and apprehended the prisoner on another charge—I looked at his boots, and when he was at the Twickenham-station, I told him I should require them, for I believed there would be another charge against him—I went to the field, and saw that they exactly cor<lb></lb>responded with the impressions—I measured the mark with a stick, and it was the same length and width—I covered up the footmarks, and told the shepherd to put up hurdles to prevent the sheep going over the ground—I went back to the station, entered the charge, and told the prisoner he was further charged with being concerned with other men not in custody in slaughtering a fat sheep at Whitton, and stealing a portion of it—he said nothing—when he was convicted of the first charge I apprehended him—I told him the charge, and he asked me if anybody was in custody for it—I said, "Not that I am aware of now, but there may be before you get to Twickenham—he said, "You would have done better, if you had gone and looked over the Park instead of looking after me."</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 8, Miller's Lane, Lambeth—the deceased was my husband—we lived at 8, Burley Road, Vauxhall, at this time—Mrs. Barnes lived in the house, and both the Carnabys slept there—on 10th November Mrs. Barnes went out on an errand with me—I left my husband at home with the baby—when I came home Mr. Whitbread, the landlord, was in the passage, and his wife came out after he first abused us—she followed us upstairs—Mr. Whitbread said did we want to break his b—lock—he and his wife both spat in our faces, in my face and Mrs. Barnes's—we went into the room and were making our way into Mrs. Barnes's room when Mrs. Whitbread called out to the two Carnabys as they came in at the street-door, "Come up here and give it to the b——s; murder them"—Mrs. Barnes had gone into her room and shut the door, and it was <hi rend="italic">busted</hi> open—the table was overturned and the lamp knocked off it, and it went out, and they made their way towards the fireplace—I could see because the fire was blazing—Robert Carnaby took the poker and waved it about, and as my husband was making his way out it struck him across the back of his head—he had been sitting in Mrs. Barnes's room with the baby—William Carnaby came in at the same time—Mr. Whitbread handed him a poker, and after my husband had had the first blow he struck him across the knuckles with it as he was holding his head with his hands from the blow—I took him to the hospital and he died on December 5.</p>

               <p>Carnaby took the poker out of the fire, but I did not see him hand it to Mrs. Whitbread—there were two pokers—I do not know whether Mrs. Whitbread had a poker when she followed us upstairs—I was too anxious to get hold of my baby—I could not see what she had behind her when she spat in my face—I did not say before the Magis<lb></lb>trate "I saw her take it up from Camaby's room," for I never was in Carnaby's room, and did know that they had one—I do not remember saying a word about a poker being fetched—I was so cross-examined before the Magistrate that I was quite put out—I will now state that what I said before the Magistrate about the poker did not take place—I am not prepared to say that Mrs. Whitbread had any instrument in her hand.</p>

I saw that gentleman (<hi rend="italic">a solicitor</hi>) appearing for two prisoners at the police-court, and Mr. Fullagar for the other prisoner—when I was asked at the station who struck the blow, I did not say, "I cannot be positive, because the lamp was broken and we were all in darkness"—Robert Carnaby was dismissed that night from the station—I said in the presence of Joseph Helson, the acting sergeant, "I was so frightened I caught my baby and ran upstairs and over the leads and on to the top of No. 6"—Helson asked whether I saw by whom my husband was assaulted—I did not say "I did not; it was so dark, and I was so frightened;" I said that Robert was the man who struck my husband—Robert Carnaby was not charged on the same night, he made his way out of the house—I did not take out a summons till the Thursday following, and it was made returnable for the Friday following that—I appeared, but the men were not there to answer, and it was adjourned again till Thursday week—I was perfectly sober, and so was my husband—my husband was silly when he went to the station—there were in Mrs. Barnes's room herself, her daughter Mrs. Costello, Mr. and Mrs. Whitbread, and the baby—I said before the Magistrate "Robert Carnaby took the poker out of the fire red-hot and hit my husband across the head with it"—it must have been very hot, it was there some time, and it must have been red-hot—that was the poker he hit my husband across the head with—I did not say "William Carnaby had a poker red-hot which was given to him by Mr. Whitbread"—it was Robert Carnaby who took the poker out of the fire—the red-hot poker was the one Robert Carnaby had—I saw two pokers; Mrs. Whitbread handed William one, but I am not prepared to say so—there was a jug there; it was broken—Costello jumped out at the window.</p>

Mrs. Barnes was sober—I never had any conversation with Burden, No. 111—I did not say to him "I cannot be positive who struck the blow, because the lamp was broken, and we were all in darkness"—there was light from the fire, and there is a gas-lamp opposite the window of No. 8, not a very great way off; it faces the window—there are two windows to the room—there was a big fire—I know of no complaint about an injury to my husband's hand by William striking him—I am not prepared to say that William had a poker in his hand at all—I said before the Magistrate that he had, as far as I could see.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SAFFORD</hi>. Smy had been drinking, and Mrs. Smy also—I should think she had had more than one glass from the manner of her going on—she seemed wild—at that time her husband had received a serious blow—she did not speak; that might be accounted for by her fright—she smelt of beer—she was called into the station, and asked by the sergeant if she knew who struck the blow—she said she was not positive who it was, as the room was in darkness and there were several there—there was very small light in the room, not enough to distinguish anything—it came from a bit of fire, and a small light from the window—if I had not had my lamp with me I could not have seen what I did—one night after this I was called to protect Robert Carnaby, and I saw him home to his house.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Whitbread, who said "Give it to the b——s," and put us all in darkness, and William Carnaby knocked my husband into the fireplace, and Robert made his way towards Mr. Smy with something in his hand, which looked like a poker, and in a minute afterwards, when we got a light, he was bleeding—he fell over my husband, and I pulled him off.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SAFFORD</hi>. On 10th November I was acting-inspector at Kennington Lane—the deceased came there with Robert Carnaby—the charge was preferred before me, and I had the witnesses in one at a time—I asked Smy to explain how he got the injury on his head—he pointed to Robert Carnaby and said "That man's brother did it with a poker"—I asked him if he complained of any other assault—he said "No"—I told him I could not detain the accused on that state<lb></lb>ment—at that time Robert Carnaby was the only man there—I asked Mrs. Smy if she could tell me how her husband came by his injuries—she said that she could not, it was dark, and she was so frightened that she took her baby and ran over the houses and down No. 6—eight wit<lb></lb>nesses I think were examined before me, and among them those who have been examined to-day—none of them could say that they saw a blow struck; and therefore Robert was discharged.</p>

                  </hi>. I am medical superintendent of Lambeth Infirmary—on 13th November the deceased was brought in with a wound on the back of his head about an inch and a half long, which might have been inflicted ten days or a fortnight before by a blow or a fall—it gave rise to diffuse inflammation of the membranes of the brain and to <hi rend="italic">pycemia</hi> (blood-poisoning)—it must have been a violent blow—I made a post-mortem examination—all the organs except the lungs, which were, studded with. <hi rend="italic">pyama</hi>, were healthy, and the disease in the lungs was caused by the blow.</p>

In consequence of information, on 28th February I marked a sovereign, two half-sovereigns, a crown piece, and two half-crowns; one of the coins was an Australian half<lb></lb>sovereign—about half-past five that afternoon I gave the marked money to Blanchard, with certain directions, and between six and seven, in con<lb></lb>sequence of some further information, I went to Messrs. Saxon and Waddington's premises, in Bartholomew Close, accompanied by Mr. Wad<lb></lb>dington—I saw the prisoner in the retail department—I told him I was an officer, and had reason to believe that he had stolen an Australian half<lb></lb>sovereign and a five-shilling piece from a sum of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which had been paid for skins and other things—he was very much confused and made no answer for some time—I told him that he had got the money, and he must produce it—he made no answer—I said unless he produced it I must search him—he theu took from his left-hand waistcoat pocket</p>

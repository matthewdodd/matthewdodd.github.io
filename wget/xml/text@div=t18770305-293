                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman E</hi> 403). On Monday night, 5th February, about 7 o'clock, I was on duty outside the Folly Theatre, in King William Street—there was a crowd of seventy or 100 persons—the deceased and his wife were standing in the road at the edge of the crowd—a dog-cart driven by the prisoner came from the Strand, going westward, on its wrong side—a Hansom cab was standing on the opposite side—the dog-cart was going about 6 or 7 miles an hour—the deceased was knocked down by the off wheel of the dog-cart—he fell backwards in the street—the wheel struck him on the body—the dog-cart drove away—I ran after it 80 or 100 yards—I called to the prisoner—he looked round, but took no notice—I ran by the side of the horse and took hold of the reins and stopped him—there were two others riding with him—I told him I wanted their names and addresses—they all refused to <hi rend="italic">give</hi> them—I said they had knocked a man down opposite the theatre—they said they were not aware that they had knocked any one down—they told the driver to drive away and take no-notice—I took them back to the hospital—I then got their addresses—I arrested the prisoner next morning in King's Road, Chelsea—I told him he would be charged with causing the death of Joseph Thomas Deeley—he said he was not aware when I spoke to him last night that he had knocked any one down.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I found that he was valet to Captain Beattie, who resides at Hatchett's Hotel—I was standing opposite to the box entrance to the theatre—the crowd was opposite the pit entrance—the road is 26 feet 9 inches wide—there is a public-house nearly opposite the theatre—there was no vehicle standing there—the Hansom cab stood rather more westward—I am not aware that I have ever said before to-day that the wheel of the dog-cart struck the deceased in the body—it did strike him in the stomach and knocked him backwards—I saw him at the hospital after he was taken there—I said before the Magistrate that they were driving at a moderate pace—the deceased was standing with his back to the theatre looking rather in the direction of the Strand and his wife was by his side—he was standing I quite still when the dog-cart struck him.</p>

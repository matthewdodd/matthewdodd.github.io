                  </hi>. I am servant to William Sidney Gibson, of Essex-street, Strand. There is a door at the back of the house leading into De<lb></lb>vereux-court, which is kept locked, bolted, and fastened by a chain—the prisoner Inman was in the habit of coming to my master's to clean the windows—he was there on Thursday, the 13th, all the afternoon—I saw him doing something to the bolts of the back door between five and six o'clock—soon after I saw Miss Gibson let him out at the front door in Essex-street—I had seen this writing-desk in the parlour all the afternoon—I saw it about four o'clock—the cloak, and petticoat, and things laid on the top of it—I went into the parlour about two hours after, and they were gone—Miss Gibson examined the back door in my presence, and it was then only on the latch unbolted and unchained—we gave information to the police.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. In consequence of information I received on the evening of the 13th I went to No. 7, Lascelles-court, Broad-street, St. Giles's, and found Inman going to bed there in the first floor room—I took him to the station-house, told him what it was for, and asked what he had done with the writing-desk—he said he had stolen it, but had not sold it—I asked who was in company with him—he said there were two, one named Church, and told me where Church lived—I went back, and found Church in bed in the lower room of the same house—Matthews who was with me told him we were officers of Bow-street, and he must come with us for stealing a writing-desk—he denied all knowledge of it—we took him to the station-house—I asked Inman what became of the desk—he said Church and a man not in custody had sold it—I asked whether he could tell me where—he said he thought he could show me—he afterwards took me to the prisoner Jones's house, No. 20, Little White's-alley, and told me it was there—it was nearly one o'clock in the morning—the street door was open—I went into the passage and knocked at the parlour door—Jones opened it—I asked if he had bought a desk—he paused for a time, and then took me to the cupboard where it was deposited in a bag on one of the shelves—Matthews asked him if there was not some more articles—Matthews opened a bottom drawer where the cloak was, and another where the petticoat was—Jones's wife pointed to the drawers where they were—she was in bed at the time—I took Jones into custody to Bow-street, and next day before the Magistrate, while we were waiting at the office door I heard Church say to Inman, who was crying, "You fool, what are you crying about? if you had repented you ought to have thought of this be<lb></lb>fore-hand—if you had stuck to me I would have stuck to you."</p>

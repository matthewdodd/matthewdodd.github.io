            . I am a Police-constable. I was going by a wall in Lower Lisson-street on that evening, about one hundred and fifty yards from the prosecutor's - there is on the other side of the wall a garden, attached to a chapel; I saw a bar of soap come over the wall; I stood still, and five more came over - I looked over with my light, and saw the prisoner; I asked what he did there - he said he came over the wall; I asked how he meant to get out - he waved his hand, and said, "Over there;" I went round, through a gentleman's house, and took him in the garden; I had taken up the soap, and took it into the gentleman's house - I did not find the frame, but it was found in the garden, and the soap was thrown from that garden into the street - it was about ten o'clock or a quarter-past.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q.Was it a dark night? A. Not particularly so - I had a lantern; I did not see another person in the street - it was a public street; I will swear there was no other person but the prisoner in the garden - it is not so large as this Court; the wall is, 1 suppose, twelve feet high from the garden, and about five feet six inches from the street - I got on the wall, and inspected it; the prisoner was taken within five minutes of the soap being found - he was laying his length in the garden; I saw the soap come over the wall, and looked in the garden - there was no one there but the prisoner.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM LAMBURN. This frame is mine, and I suppose the soap is mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Are you a manufacturer of soap? A. No, I retail it - I and my wife serve in the soap; she is not here - I am sure this soap had not been sold, because I was in the shop all that night; it was on a cask inside the shop door - I did not see any one come in; here is no mark on the frame, but it is my own manufacture.</p>

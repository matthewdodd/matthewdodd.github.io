                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Robert Leigh, of Verulam-terrace, Hammersmith; the prisoner was occasionally employed there as charwoman. On 3rd April, my master and mistress being out of town, she slept with me—she got up about seven o'clock in the morning, said she would go down and light the fire, and stay and help to wash—she left the bedroom, came back in a few minutes, and asked for some matches—I told her where to find them, and she went away again—I looked up the clothes, and about eight went down-stairs—she was then gone, and I missed some money from a shelf, and a cloak, a dress, two seals, an umbrella, a pair of boots, a pair of stays, two aprons, and some printed cotton belonging to me, from the kitchen—the cloak and umbrella had been hanging up, and the rest were on the table—I then went to my mistress's room, and missed three dresses, a book, a brooch, and some artificial flowers, of Mrs. Leigh's—the prisoner would have to pass that room to go down to the kitchen—I have seen all the things again—this printed stuff, cloak, boots, and umbrella are mine—(<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner come to your shop on the 31st of January last. - A. Yes, near eight o'clock, there was another lad with him, the other lad asked for a halfpenny pickled cucumber, I served him, he paid for it, he asked the prisoner if he would have one, he said yes, I served the prisoner, I had suspicion that there was something out of the window, I heard his elbow against the boards, the prisoner stood by the window, I came round and looked, and saw the cake of wax between his thighs.</p>
               <p>Q. Were had it been laying before he came in. - A. In the window, I had seen it there in the course of the day; when I saw that I laid hold of the prisoner, I said, here is a pretty fellow to take the wax out of the window, he said he would beg me ten thousand pardons, I took him to Hatton Garden Office immediately, the wax was left at my shop, the officer came back and fetched it, I knew the wax, it was brought here last sessions, and I marked it at Hatton Garden, there is five pound and a half, it is worth sixteen shillings, it cost me that.</p>
               <p>Q. It was done privately, without your knowledge. - A. It was done without my knowledge, there was nobody in my shop but me, and the prisoner, and the other lad.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Do you know that that little boy is trying for a capital offence. - A. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you heard his elbow, that excited your suspicion. - A. It did.</p>
               <p>Q. How high was this window. - A. As high as windows generally are, I cannot say exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. So that the bees wax falling, would make a noise. - A. It did not fall, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard a noise that brought you round. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You went round, you saw it, he was standing close to the window. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he left the bees wax in the shop, and went to Hatton Garden. - A. I left my wife in the shop, and a man.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pieces of bees wax had you in the shop. - A. Five or six, they were all laying together.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that that which you produce is the cake which you took from the boy. - A. Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the boy pretend, when you charged him with it, that it had fell by accident, and he meant to put it up again. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Jury. Are all your cakes marked alike. - A. No, they are not, this was marked at Hatton Garden office, it was here last sessions. I should wish to recommend the prisoner to mercy.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The bees wax fell down by accident, I catched it between my thighs, I did not intend to steal it.</p>
               <p>Court, Q. to Prosecutor. From what you saw could it be by accident that it fell down. - A. It was impossible.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

            . I am deputy assistant elder in the East India Company's service - the prisoner was also in their service, at 16 s. 6 d. a week, working from eight till two o'clock. On the 17th of November, he was employed in <rs id="t18231203-37-deflabel201" type="occupation">hooping tea chests</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18231203-37-defend390 t18231203-37-deflabel201"></join>; the one in question only wanted hooping - I examined it that morning before he came, and took the number of it; it was not at all necessary to take the bottom off. After he had been at work on it, I had it removed into a back room, opened the bottom, and found the lead work was either cut or broken, and a hole made through it sufficient to get tea out, and a vacant space, so that some had been stolen; he was brought into the room, and told that he was suspected of having tea about him; he said he had not - I said I must search him - he took off his hat, and had none there. French told him he must strip, and on unbuttoning his pantaloons, I found about 14 ozs. of tea, in two large pockets, which came round him in front, and hung between his legs, so that no suspicion will arise from the appearance - it would not be noticed in rubbing him down at the gate. The hole was made by design.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Sometimes a chest appears very sound, and yet tea will run out - A. This chest had no wood broken, only the lead inside; it could not have run out. The tea was loose in his pockets.</p>

            . I am an assistant elder. On the 17th of November, I brought the prisoner into the room. We took the bottom off the chest, and a place was broken in the lead work inside, but the wooden bottom was perfectly sound; I had seen it before the prisoner worked on it - no tea could run out; the bottom must have been taken off to make the hole in the lead. I told the prisoner I suspected he had tea about him; he said, "Indeed, Mr. French, I have not," and pulled off his hat and shoes. I said he must strip; he let his pantaloons down - Glass laid hold of them, and said, "Here is the tea." I turned it out of his pockets, which were large, and hung so that nobody could feel it in rubbing him down - he is a tailor by trade. There were 17 ozs. of tea, and about that quantity was missing from the chest. It was of the same quality.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. - I have been twelve years in the service, and did not intend to rob the Company. I have a wife and six children.</p>

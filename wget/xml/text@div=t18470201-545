                  </hi>. I live at No. 4, Caves-lane, Chatham. On Tuesday after<lb></lb>noon, the 5th of Jan., I met the prisoner in company with another person—the prisoner laid hold of me by the arm and claimed acquaintance with me—she said she knew me in Liverpool—she inducted me to go into the Cock and Neptune—she dragged me in by the arm—she wanted me to have some gin—I stood at the bar—she said, "I shall be 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to your 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for some gin"—I said I did not want any gin—on going out of the door I missed my watch from my jacket pocket—from information I received I went to a house No. 3 in a court close by—I found the prisoner there—I told her I wanted my watch</p>

               <p>she said she had not got it—I said I would get a policeman—she called me back and told me not to be in a hurry to get a policeman, and I should have my watch—she sent a little girl for it—the girl came back and said she could not find it—I went out again—she called me back and sent the girl again—I was then going again and she wanted to run away, but I held on to her till the policeman came—the pawnbroker has my watch.</p>

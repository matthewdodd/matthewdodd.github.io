            . On the 5th of August, I was playing with some boys, at the corner of Sun-court; the prosecutor's shop is at the top of the court. I saw the prisoner run from Mr. Laking's, and throw something away, which I thought was paper. Mr. Laking came out I picked something up that he threw away, and gave it to Tupper. I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

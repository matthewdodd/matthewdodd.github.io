             . On the 12th of August last I lost two gold watches and two silver spoons .</p>
               <p>Q. Whose were the watches ?</p>
               <p>Pilgrim. They were my sons; the prisoner came but the night before, and when I came down in the morning I looked at the watches as they hung up, one upon one sconce and the other upon the other sconce by the chimney; it was seven o'clock by one, and 20 minutes after b y the other, the prisoner was then washing the door. I had not turn'd my back above 5 minutes, but the watches and the prisoner were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the watches found again?</p>
               <p>Pilgrim. Yes; they were brought to me by Mr. Wilks a silver-smith by Cripplegate; for I had published an advertisement offering ten guineas reward; but there was not the whole of the things brought.</p>

            . Servant to Mrs. Pilgrim. I miss'd two silver spoons and the prisoner was taken up: before Justice Dennet she owned that she took the two watches and the two spoons, and that she sold one of the spoons for 11 s. 6 d. to a silversmith near Barbican, I can't remember his name; and the other she sold to Mr. Wilks ; the prisoner came the night before this thing was committed and personated her sister, who is a person of a good character, and lay at Mrs. Pilgrim's that night , and the next morning she went away and took the watches and spoons with her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Nash (Marshals Man.) I had a search-warrant and went with Mr. Pilgrim to search for these spoons, and found one at Mr. Barlow's in Barbican, and the other at Mr. Wilks's, both by the prisoner's direction.</p>

            . On monday the 15th of August Mr. Wilks came to my house, and two or three ill looking fellows with him, and brought the two watches, and said that the reward was ten guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him who brought the watches to him?</p>
               <p>Pilgrim . Yes, and he said the person got away from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you when they were brought to him?</p>
               <p>Pilgrim . He said on the Saturday morning. Mr. Wilks demanded the reward of me, and I told him I would give him but nine guineas, because there was not the whole; for the spoons were not there; he said he would have the ten guineas, and wrote down his name.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he deliver the watches to you then?</p>
               <p>Pilgrim . No; he shew'd me the watches, then I offer'd him 10 l. and he would not take the 10 l. but said he would allow 6 s. for the two spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him whether they were pawned or sold to him?</p>
               <p>Pilgrim . I did not ask any thing of that.</p>
               <p>Wilks . I want to know what this 6 s. was to be allowed for as deduction; I want to have this set in a proper light .</p>
               <p>Court. She says you would allow her but 6 s. for the two spoons</p>
               <p>Wilks. I want to go according to the rule of proportion.</p>

               <p>Parsley . He said he believed he could help her to them, but he did not say then that he had them; and afterwards he said he had them, and that they were brought to him by a woman who had a brown gown, a white handkerchief, a colour'd apron, and an old bonnet: I ask'd him why he did not stop the person; he said it was about seven o'clock in the morning, and there was no body with him; and he said he called out stop thief, but there was no body in the street, nor no body came to his assistance, so she got away, and the persons that were with Mr. Wilks chid me for speaking; and I said I would speak for my mistress. Mr. Wilks said he knew nothing of the spoons; my mistress offer'd him nine guineas, and he said that was not in proportion, and he said he would allow 6 s. for the two spoons, and my mistress would not take it, and she said she would leave it till my master came home; and he would not trust the watches in any person's hand but his own; I had hold of the strings, but he would not part with them out of his hand 'till he had the money.</p>

               <p>Pilgrim. I asked him about the spoons, and he said he knew nothing of the spoons; he said he would have ten guineas; I asked him what he would abate for the spoons, and he said 7 s. 6 s. but afterwards he agreed to abate 10 s. and I paid him 10 l. and then I had the watches.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him how he came by them?</p>
               <p>Pilgrim. Yes, he said a woman came with a watch to sell, that she shew'd him one watch at first, and then she said she had another watch, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174809070027"></xptr> put her hand into her pocket and pulled out another, and gave it him.

               <p>Q. What did he say?</p>
               <p>Pilgrim. He said he left Davidson in the custody of his wife, and he took his wife up stairs and desired an acquaintance of his to secure her, and in the mean time, while they were gone up stairs, the prisoner got away.</p>

               <p>Woodwardson . When the marshals-men went with a search-warrant to search for a spoon , Mr. Wilks denied having the spoon, and his wife was by, and I believe she had been eating bacon and greens, or something like that; for her mouth was very greasy , and Mr. Wilks was charg'd with letting the woman out at the back door, and he said he had no back door, for it opened into the street.</p>

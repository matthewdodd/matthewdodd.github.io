                  </hi>. On 10th Feb., I was an inmate of the East London Union Workhouse, at Homerton—I knew the deceased John Webber, he was an inmate there—he was about 65 years old—he slept in No. 18 bed-room—he had slept there about a fortnight previous to his death—he used to make a <hi rend="italic">romancing</hi> noise in the night, talking very loud in his sleep, and dis<lb></lb>turbing the men—I do not know what he said—I understood two words he said, <hi rend="italic">Mah</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Bah</hi>—he was annoying to all the men that were there—he kept them awake—I am not aware that he was ill—he was not speaking to any one, he was talking to himself—I slept in the same ward opposite to him,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185802220058"></xptr>
               <p>my bed was on the other side—The prisoner slept in the next bed to the deceased—on the night of 10th Feb., between 9 and 10 o'clock, the prisoner came to the deceased, put his hand on him, and said, "Don't make such a noise, you prevent my sleeping, and the other men as well"—and he had said that to him before on other nights—the deceased made no answer to that—I did not see whether he was awake or not—I saw the prisoner get out of his bed between 1 and 2 o'clock, and put his two hands to the middle of the deceased man's bedstead, and he turned the bedstead on it's side, and the deceased came out on the floor—the fall of the bedstead was very heavy on the floor—the bed and bedclothes came with the deceased on the floor—the prisoner then put his hands to the bedstead a second time, and threw it right over the deceased—the deceased cried "Murder!" three times when he was on the floor, and the prisoner took the bedstead off him, and put it in it's proper place—the deceased got up, put his bed to rights, and got into bed—when I got up at 7 o'clock in the morning, I saw blood on the floor about three feet from the bed—I saw the deceased get up in the morning at the usual time, 7 o'clock; he put every thing on with the exception of his coat—I left the room at half-past 7 o'clock, the deceased was then sitting on the prisoner's bedstead, and his face was down on his own bed—I left Crawford in the room—I did not hear of the deceased's death till after breakfast, about 9 o'clock the same morning—I went up to look at him about half-past 9 o'clock, I saw him dead—I did not see any bruises on him—I thought he was sleeping when I left the room.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi>. I was an inmate of the workhouse; I slept in the ward No. 18—I knew the deceased—I slept behind the door, further away from him than the last witness; further off than the prisoner was—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner get out of bed between 1 and 2 o'clock, and throw the man right out of bed on to the floor—he came right over to my bed with the bed and bedstead on the top of him—he sung out murder three times, and he asked for some<lb></lb>body to get up and assist him, and no one would, and at last the prisoner got up and took the bedstead off of him and put it in it's right place again—I did not see any blood—I am blind with one eye, and very nearly so with the other—I did not see any thing done with the bedstead and the clothes after<lb></lb>wards—the deceased was rather bad in his breath, and he was worse in his breath after he got into his bed again—he moaned in his sleep, and made a terrible noise; none of us could go to sleep, we all thought he was dying—I mean every night he made this noise—when I got up I asked him what was the matter, and he said, "This vagabond, Pinson, threw me right out of bed"—I did not hear the prisoner say anything—the next morning the deceased dressed himself all but his coat—he was very bad—he began to make his bed, and he was walking about from one side to the other, and he came and sat down on the prisoner's bed, and laid his head on his own bed—I went down about half-past 7 o'clock—I went up again directly after breakfast, and saw him lying in the same position—I could not tell whether he was gone—he was found dead directly afterwards, when we came up stairs again.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. The bedstead never touched the deceased, it was lying on it's side. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. No, the bedstead laid on the top of him—the man was on the floor, the bed was on the top of him, and the bedstead on the top of the bed.</p>

               <p>Feb.—I was sent for a little before 8 o'clock, and reached there soon after<lb></lb>wards—I should say he had been dead about five minutes—I saw blood oozing out of the right nostril—there was blood on the floor, and on his pillow—there was a slight mark of contusion over the right side of the head—that was the only appearance of violence externally—on Sunday morning I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—there was no other external mark on the body—on turning back the scalp, I found beneath it a black mark, answering to the external bruise, and an extensive extravasation of blood—the vessels on the surface of the brain were gorged with blood—the brain, in other respects, was healthy—I found the contents of the stomach, and the abdomen, perfectly healthy—on opening the chest I found the heart twice it's natural size—the large veins leading to the jugular, and other large veins leading to the right side of the heart, were excessively gorged with blood and mucus—that would lead me to infer that the actual cause of death was pulmonary apoplexy—the extravasated blood under the scalp was not sufficient to cause death—in my judgment, the sudden exposure, and the shock sustained in being thrown out of bed on an extremely cold night, accelerated the death of a man previously diseased as he was.</p>

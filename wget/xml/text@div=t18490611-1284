                  </hi>. I lived at 5, Nightingale-lane, Limehouse, with the prisoner, for nine years. At the time in question I was living at 53, Caroline-street, Commercial-road—I had lived with the prisoner tip to within a fortnight of Christmas—on Friday, 1<hi rend="italic">st</hi> May, I was at home, getting breakfast—the prisoner came in about eight o'clock, and asked me for the hammer, I gave it him—he also asked me for a cup of coffee—I gave him that—he then asked if I was not ashamed of myself—I said, no, I had done nothing to be ashamed of—he said, "I think you ought to be ashamed to treat me as you have, "and he asked me if I intended to have him—I said, no, I did not—I had quitted him—he said if I did not have him I should have nobody else—I said I would if I thought proper—he said he would take my life between that and Saturday—I turned to look through the window, and, while so doing, he drew something across my throat, which cut me—I ran out, and, on turning my head, I saw him cutting his own throat, with something that had a black handle to it; I did not see what it was—I went to a house a few doors off—my throat was bleeding very much indeed—I was taken to the London Hospital, and remained there a month and three days—the prisoner had come to my place on 27th April, and asked me for the razor, and I gave it him in a little box.</p>

On 1<hi rend="italic">st</hi> May the prisoner and prosecutrix were brought there—I examined them both—on the right side of the female's neck there was a wound, between two and three inches long, and about an inch and a half deep, which divided the muscle of the neck, and was within one-eighth of an inch of the large artery—it was a very dangerous wound—she was in the hospital about four weeks, and is going on very well—the prisoner had a wound of greater length, but not so deep—he was about three weeks in the hospital, I think—this razor is a likely instrument to inflict such wounds.</p>

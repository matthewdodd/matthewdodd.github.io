               <p>On the 1st of February last, near eleven o'clock in the forenoon, I was walking up Fleet-street, the prisoner asked me for a bit of tobacco, seeing me take some, I gave him a bit, and we walked together for fifteen or twenty yards, several persons were going before us, there lay a purse between both our feet, seemingly a silk purse, he picked up the purse, I cried halves, he then said, if I would go to the next public-house he would give me half, he turned round by <placeName id="t17820410-49-crimeloc265">St. Dunstan's</placeName>

               <p>Alderman Hart.

            , the fruiterer, in Covent-garden, who told me the man would bring me in for Compound Felony; we went to Bow-street, and the prisoner was committed, I have the ring and direction, it is in my possession, Guest had it three weeks.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you know this ring is the same? - I look on it to be the same.</p>
               <p>Can you swear positively it is the same? - No, my lord, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Is counsellor Fielding in court, I was told that the bill was thrown out.</p>

               <p>You cried halves at first? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You know you had no right to it? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Then you knew somebody else had a right to it, you thought it was lost by somebody? - I knew it was not the man's property.</p>
               <p>It was a third person's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>With what conscience would you think of defrauding the man of it? - I did not know who it did belong to.</p>
               <p>But you might have advertised it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you were both rogues alike, you both agreed to cheat a third person? - Beging your pardon I had no such meaning.</p>
               <p>Then you would have proposed advertising it? - I did.</p>
               <p>You did not say any thing? - I did.</p>
               <p>The ring you had worth two hundred and forty pounds is not here, is it? - I imagine I had no such ring.</p>
               <p>Court. Here is a ring, but he cannot posively swear it is the same.</p>
               <p>The ring you gave to Guest might have perhaps been worth two hundred and forty pounds, you have not sold that ring now and put the money in your pocket? - No, I have not.</p>
               <p>That is well, you advanced five guineas? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You expected to have had some more money, and you was to have given up the ring? - Every man has a right to have something for picking a thing up.</p>
               <p>I think not? - What is he to put it down in the street again?</p>
               <p>No, he should seek for the owner? - I never heard any man say so before.</p>
               <p>You should have said, let us lodge it in some banker's hands? - I wanted to go to the jeweller's.</p>
               <p>Why they persuaded you out of your christian name almost? - Certainly, sir.</p>
               <p>You are sure you did not defraud the man out of some money? - Yes, sir.</p>
               <p>You defrauded him out of the ring, worth two hundred and forty pounds? - I wish it had been worth that.</p>
               <p>If it had you would not have met him any more I suppose, it is a long way from St. Dunstan's church to the Borough, you did not go to any jeweller's for fear they should<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178204100065"></xptr> own it perhaps, and the receipt shewed it belonged to a jeweller? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Nor enquired whether they had lost a ring? - No; they kept the receipt.</p>
               <p>What name was it? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>You can read? - Aye; but very indifferently.</p>
               <p>Could not you read where the man lived who sold it? - I did not take any particular remarks.</p>
               <p>Was it a receipt? - Yes.</p>
               <p>A receipt of whose, of Morrison of Cheapside perhaps, you took care not to see the man's name? - I saw it but do not remember.</p>
               <p>You know you could have enquired at any jeweller or silversmith's shop? - Most of these people that go upon this footing, persuade people out of their reason, I was persuaded.</p>
               <p>What are you? - A gardener.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - At Isleworth.</p>
               <p>That is not far from London, you know what tricks are? - I come to London sometimes three times a week, sometime four.</p>
               <p>To Covent-garden market? - To Newgate-market.</p>
               <p>Still better? - I sell my own property.</p>
               <p>And other people's sometimes? - Not without it is to oblige a friend.</p>
               <p>Oh, to oblige a friend you would sell other peoples property sometimes, you have been in this way of life some years? - Forty years and upwards.</p>
               <p>Aye, and coming to Newgate-market three or four times a week, and yet never met with such a thing before? - He was a clever looking man.</p>
               <p>Why, you are a clever looking man? - I am not half so handsome as he was, to look at.</p>
               <p>If he had brought the money you would have returned the ring? - Certainly, sir.</p>
               <p>Did you go to Mr. Child's, and enquire about that head clerk? - I sent.</p>

               <p>Court. If the man had come and given the money, there would have been an end of the business? - I fancy there would, my lord.</p>

               <p>He was told, I believe, by the poor gardener there, that if he got the five guineas there would be an end to it? - I proposed the matter.</p>

               <p>Are you wise enough to know it? - It was a dark room, and I could not distinguish what it was till I had had it and looked at it; when I came into the Borough I certainly did consent to take the money at first, till a friend told me I was in the wrong.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say, they told me there was no bill found, my friends were waiting yesterday.</p>

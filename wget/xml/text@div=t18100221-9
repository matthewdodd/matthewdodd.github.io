On the 12th of February, about seven o'clock in the evening, I went out, and left the prisoner at home to mind the house; I returned about half an hour afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned did you find your door open. - A. No, it was locked and bolted, I knocked at the door a long time, I thought she was asleep. I went to a neighbour's house and borrowed a key and unlocked it. I found it was bolted, I got a man to put a young man over the door, he got inside and unbolted the door; there is an opening over the door, so that any person could get in; he opened the door, and I went in, I found the key in the drawer where I had left it, and the prisoner was gone, the fire was out, and there was a light on the table. I went up stairs and took the man and the boy with me, and several more people. I found some pieces belonging to my gowns, and an apron that were at the bottom of my chest on the bed. I searched the chest, I found there was nothing left in it, the chest had been broken open; I missed all the things in the indictment; they were all taken out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon before this had you seen them. - A. I believe it was the day before that I went up stairs, I went to get something out, I saw them all safe in the chest. From information, I went over Tower-hill in search of the prisoner, and in Barking church-yard I found her, she was standing against a door, she pulled a girl upon her to hide herself from me; I knew her by my pellise that she had on, and a gown, cap, and tippet; I catched hold of her and holloed out, watch, he came directly; she had got a large bundle with her. Follingwood, the watchman, took her to the watchhouse and the bundle with her; the things are all here.</p>

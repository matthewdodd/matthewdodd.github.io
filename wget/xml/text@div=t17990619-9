             sworn. - I live next door with my sister; Mrs. Jennings asked me to go up with her to this man's room; when we went up, the staple was drawn; I heard him get up directly when I went for the poker.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The man that took the lodging of this woman, was one Jones, a tinker; I was a soldier, just come home, and he said to me, don't you want work; he said, I should not want, for he would learn me his trade, to be a tinker, and I should be at his lodgings; I saw him on that day, and he sent me home to see if his old woman was come home, and tell her to light a fire; I found the door open, and the padlock opened, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179906190013"></xptr>laying on the table; when I went in it was quite dark, and between ten and eleven o'clock this gentlewoman came up and asked me if my brother was come home; I told her it was not my brother; there was nobody at home in the house.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Jennings. The man and his wife lived in the apartments, they paid the rent every night; I went up to see after them the second night of their lodging there, or else I would not have gone at all; he called him his brother.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Where were the things pawned? - A. He would not tell.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know they were pawned? - A. Only what he said.</p>

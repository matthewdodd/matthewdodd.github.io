On Sunday morning last, I went into the warehouse and saw some tea scattered by the side of a chest - the prisoner was there, and I waited till he was gone out to breakfast - I then traced the tea to his drawer in the manufactory - it was not locked - I opened it and found about one pound of the same tea as that in the chest - I informed my partner of it - we sent for an officer - I had heard the prisoner say he way going to get his hair cut; and while I went for the officer he went out - I then went to his drawer again and found the tea removed; but I saw on the table the prisoner's clothes, which he was going to put on, and under them we found about two ounces of tea in a paper - I marked the paper and left it there - the officer went after him as he was going home to his parents - we afterwards found some more tea in another drawer, belonging to another boy, which the prisoner was told to look in - the value of all the tea was about 30s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Had you a lad of the name of Palin in your employ? Yes; he is here - he is about eighteen or nineteen years of age - we have three apprentices - two in the shop, and the prisoner in the manufactory - Palin is a porter in the manufactory - any person might have put tea into the drawers; the drawer, in which we found the largest quantity of tea, was Palin's - it was in a canvass bag.</p>

            . I am the officer. On Sunday morning I went to the house and saw the prisoner come out; I stopped him, and said I thought he had something about him not right; he said he had not; I said "What is in your bundle;" he said "Some paper to make caps;" I said I must take him to the watch-house; and as we were going along, I saw him trying to put something into his pocket; I put my hand in and took from him this small parcel of tea in this paper; I then asked where the remainder of the tea was that had been in the drawer; he said it was in another drawer in the manufactory; I desired him to go back with me and show me the drawer; he did so, and pointed out a drawer, in which I understood Palin kept some things; I found there between four and five pounds of tea; I asked who put it there; he said, after some hesitation, that he did; I then asked how far Palin was implicated in it; he said about as much as he was, and they did not intend to take it out of the house, but to make them some breakfasts and save a shilling.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he say, in addition, that it was at Palin's instigation? A. Yes, and what he said induced me to take Palin into custody - but he was discharged.</p>

            . On Friday morning I saw the prisoner take about four handsful of tea out of a chest, and put it into his apron.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Upon your oath did not you ask this poor lad to take some of the tea, that you might have it for your breakfasts, and save 1s.? A. No; I did not - I did not like to go and tell my master - I did not ask him to do it - nor know that he was going to do it - I did not say a word to him till he brought it in - I had a little bit of it. I have been in Newgate myself once for two days, but never any where else.</p>

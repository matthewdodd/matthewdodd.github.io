               <p>Q. Was she a servant in your shop?</p>
               <p>Rooke. No, she was servant in my house; we have oftentimes found the locks out of order that belong to the inside shutters.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe those shutters.</p>
               <p>Rooke. They went along the counter, and were put up of nights, and made it like a passage, with the goods within-side. The first piece that I missed was a scarlet serge-dusoy, that was about twelve months ago; she lived with me at that time, I missed it about three months before she went away.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did she live with you?</p>
               <p>Rooke. She lived with me about half a year. I missed also a quantity of grey ducape, about 11 or 12 yards, and about 16 or 17 yards of tabby, but the tabby was omitted in the indictment by mistake. I missed also blue ducape, and green ducape, and some black armozene, about eight or nine yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss all these before she went away?</p>
               <p>Rooke. I did. I heard she went to live in Bell-yard, near Temple-bar, and after that she went to Greenwich She told me my lord Anson got her a place to be nurse in the hospital there.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176105060008"></xptr>Q. How came you to suspect her?</p>
               <p>Rooke. One of my servants was taken up for robbing me of a great many things, his name is Spruce. I took him before justice Fielding, he was committed to New Prison. The next morning I went to him, he told me that the prisoner now at the bar was the first instigation of his misfortunes. Upon that I got a warrant from Mr. Fielding, and took her up on the 14th of April; after which I found where she had sold or pawned part of the goods mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find them?</p>

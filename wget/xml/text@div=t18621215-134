I am a grocer, at 34, Church-street, Deptford—on Wednesday, the 3d of this month, about half-past 4, I was in Philpot-lane with my son, who is about ten years old—I left him in charge of my pony and cart—there were four half chests of tea in it, the value of which was 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave directions to my son to mind the cart, and remain there till I came back—I gave him no directions to go any where—I returned in shout fifteen minutes, and could not find my cart—about half an hour afterwards I found my son at Bower's provision warehouse close by—notice as afterwards given to me that my pony and cart were at the green-yard, Kennington—I did not get my tea back—the value of the whole was 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner had been in the habit of minding my pony and cart sometimes near that place—he has done so perhaps twenty times—I know him very well by sight—I had not seen him on this day.</p>

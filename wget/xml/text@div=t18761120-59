About 3 o'clock on the afternoon of 27th July last I was on my farm there near the foot of a wheat stack which had been threshed out. The two prisoners came up to me; they were strangers to me; they asked me for a job of</p>

In about four minutes I looked towards the farm, and I then saw that some straw was on fire just about where I had left the prisoners standing. I drove at. once to the fire and the prisoners were not there. From the time I left the straw until I got back it did not exceed more than four or five minutes. When I reached the stack I saw nobody there. I called for assistance, and James Barton, Wilkins, Dixon, and several others came in about seven or eight minutes. I observed the two prisoners helping putting out the fire; we were unable to put out the fire, from the loose straw that was burning. The fire then communicated to a straw stack and from thence to the barn, and burnt until the next, day. Altogether I had destroyed, the straw stack, barn, two vans, a cart house, a bullock house, a stack of clover, a stack trefoil, a stack of sanfoin, and about 50 quarters of wheat in the barn, and about 100 bushels of clover seed, and some farming implements. I estimate the whole damage at 2,020<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. On the same day Richard Barton gave me the box of lucifers now produced, which I afterwards gave to policeman Gates.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, residing on the Beacon at Chatham—on the afternoon of 27th July I was at Mr. Stunt's farm, at the stack-yard, about 2.30 or 2.45—I saw Mr. Stunt there and the two prisoners—I heard them ask Mr. Stunt for a job—they were then close to my elbow and close by the stack-bottom that caught fire first, and about a foot from the stack itself—the bottom of the stack is the rubbish that lies at the bottom after the stack has been threshed, to keep the corn from the ground—it had been a large wheat stack, and the loose straw had not been cleared up—I went away, leaving the prisoners there—I had seen them be<lb></lb>fore that at the left hand of the fodder stack,' the trefoil, and one of them asked me if that was the master, pointing to Mr. Stunt, and I said "Yes"—when I left the yard I went out into the pea-field, which is towards Rainham—I was between 10 and 11 rods away when I saw the prisoners come be<lb></lb>tween the two stacks and come into the pea-field and pick some peas to eat—that was about three or four minutes after I had seen them with Mr. Stunt—I then saw them go out into the main road, as if they were going to Rainham—I went further on to go to my work, and had got about 20 rods out in the field, when I turned round, and saw a body of smoke coming from the stack-bottom right up over the fodder stack—I ran at once and gave the alarm of fire—I got there in two or three minutes—I found the stack-bottom on fire between 2 and 3 yards from the fodder stack where I had been the prisoners standing.</p>

It was the loose straw that was left behind after the stack had been removed, that was on fire; there was no stack on fire when I got there Mr. Stunt was—there before me—the loose straw was about 4 yards from the fodder stack; that was the nearest—the next was the straw stack; that was close to it—there was grass between the stack<lb></lb>bottom and the fodder stack, but there was litter of straw besides all the way between—I and Mr. Stunt assisted to put the fire out—I did not see</p>

               <p>anyone leaving there, or in the vicinity—other men came up, but I did not see anyone there when I got there—I can't say which way the wind was—there was a wind; it was dry, hot weather.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE DENMAN</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">expressed a doubt whether upon this evidence the prisoners could be convicted of setting fire to the stack; all that was done was to set fire to the loose straw, and although the fire ultimately spread and consumed the stacks, it required affirmative evidence to show that such a result was in-tended</hi>. Mr. Avoby <hi rend="italic">submitted that the prisoners must be held to intend what was the natural and inevitable consequence of their act, viz., the catching fire of the stack from the straw</hi> (see "Queen <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. Price," 9, Carrington &amp; Payne, page 729). Mr. Gill <hi rend="italic">contended that it was not a question whether the prisoners acted recklessly or with criminal negligence; there must be evidence of the letting fire to whatever was charged in the indictment. He referred to</hi>" Reg. <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. Judd," 2 Term Reports, 255, <hi rend="italic">and the case of</hi> "Beg. <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. Child," I Law Reports, Crown Cases Reserved, page 307, <hi rend="italic">was also referred to. In leaving the question to the Jury at the close of the case</hi>, Mr. Justice Denman <hi rend="italic">said that if they were satisfied that the prisoners could not have fired the straw without the intention of further mischief, then they should find them guilty; the mere fact of setting fire to the straw would not of itself be sufficient, as the charge was setting fire to the stack, but if they were of opinion that they purposely fired the straw, utterly reckless whether the stack was burnt or not, in that case he should hold, for the purpose of the day, that that might be equivalent to an intentional setting fire to the stack, he would reserve the question if necessary</hi>.</p>

I did not myself see the stack threshed out—I saw the prisoners assisting, with others, to put the fire out—I should say that was about five minutes after I got there—I saw them both together, and spoke to them—I merely said "How are you?" no more—the fire was not put out; it spread to all the three stacks and farm buildings—the fodder stack was the first that caught after the stack-bottom, and the next was the olover—we call clover fodder in our part of the country—I have heard it called clover hay—a stack of straw was close to the clover, and as the flames ran it caught the straw—when I first saw the prisoners speaking to Mr. Stunt there was no one else in the yard so far as I could see.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> That was about 2.30 or 2.45—I had not been in the stack yard that morning before—I had been cutting peas with my family—a spot was afterwards pointed out to me by my son where he found a box of matches—I saw the prisoners go right by that spot as they walked from the stack yard to the pea field—it might be 2 yards or 1 1/2 yards—I can't tell how many labourers Mr. Stunt had in his employment that day—no one was working in the stack yard that day that I am aware of; no work was being done there—the stack had been threshed out on the Tuesday—the fire occurred on Thursday—I had been away from the stack yard all the morning, and only came there at 2.30—I went there to speak to Mr. Stunt, and then saw the two prisoners—I was between four and five minutes speaking to Mr. Stunt; I then left him and went across the pea field—the nearest men working to the stack yard were about 40 rods off—when I first saw the prisoners they were coming out of the main road to<lb></lb>wards the farm—I don't know which way they had come—they waited while I spoke to Mr. Stunt—they did not follow me into the pea field; they came in the same direction after they had spoken to Mr. Stunt—that would be the proper way to Rainbam—I had got between 10 and 11 rods before I'</p>

               <p>looked back, and then I saw them picking peas in the field; they were hardly a minute doing that—there was a shed in the stack yard, a barn, a cow lodge, another lodge, and a stable—the stack were away from them; it might be 2 yards—I don't know whether there was anybody in the sheds when I was in the stack yard speaking to Mr. Stunt—Mr. Stunt was the first person that got into the stack yard after the fire—I did not see any<lb></lb>body else when I got there—I did not stand to look—assistance came almost immediately—Mr. Stunt told me to go and get a pail, which I did, and pumped the water, and by that time there were other persons there—I can't tell in what order they arrived—the prisoners stripped to their shirts and took of their things to assist—I did not see Mr. Stunt leave the stack yard—I can't say whether the prisoners walked out immediately be<lb></lb>hind him.</p>

On the afternoon of 27th July, I apprehended the prisoners at Crown Farm, Gillingham, at the fire—I charged them on suspicion of setting fire to some hay stacks, and form buildings, the property of Mr. Stunt—I asked them "Where were you two men when you first saw the fire "—Moran said "We were in the road"—Birchall said "We came and asked the master for a job of work; he said he had nothing for us to do, he then went out into the road, and we went out with him, we went a little way along the road and in the other gate and commenced picking a few peas to eat; I looked up and saw the men turning towards us and I said 'Come on <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>, they are going to make a set out about our picking these few peas; we then went out into the road, I then saw the fire and we both went to help put it out"—I searched them, and on each of them I found a tobacco pipe, a few pence and a few half<lb></lb>pence—I then took them to Chatham police-station—I charged them on suspicion of setting fire to-some hay stacks and farm buildings, the property of Mr. Stunt—they both said "There was another man there in Mr. Stunt's employment, and he ought to be examined as well as us"—I received this lucifer-box from Mr. Stunt the same day—when I searched the prisoners I said" You don't appear to have a lucifer in your pocket," one of them, I don't which, said "If I have a lucifer it is more than I know of."</p>

Moran says:</hi>"I was working at Wateringbury on Monday and Tuesday last and started back from Water<lb></lb>ingbury to Maidstone on Tuesday night We lodged at Maidstone on Tuesday night and went to the Potteries on Wednesday morning. There was no work there and a man in a boat sent us to Chatham to the water works; we stopped there on Wednesday night and went to the water works on Thurs<lb></lb>day at dinner time; they did not want anybody, and we then started on the road to Sbeerness, and in about a mile met a man who had been lodging with us, and we sat down for ten minntes, and then asked him for a match;" he said he had got one and picked up a bit of match box from under his foot in the road, and gave me a light from his match. We then went on to the farm bailiff's house and asked for a job. He said he had not got one. We</p>

               <p>then went to the farm and stood against the gate picking a pea or two. The master drove into the stack yard; we went to the master and asked for a job. He said 'No, not at present,' so we came out of the gate with him; he was in his trap, and we went to the pea field and picked a few peas, and went down the road, where we saw the men looking at us. I do not wish to call any witnesses." <hi rend="italic">Birchall says:</hi>" I will reserve mine. I don't want to call any witnesses."</p>

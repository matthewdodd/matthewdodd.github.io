                  </hi>. I live at No. 2, Walworth Place, Newington. On Saturday night, the 5th of November, about half-past nine o'clock, I was returning home—when I got next door but one to my own house, the prison<lb></lb>ers came behind me, put handkerchief over my face, and threw me down on the flat of my back on the ground, put a hand into my pocket, and took out 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there were two persons—I will swear there were three half-crowns amongst the money and I think two shillings and two sixpence—I called for the police, and my wife and a boy came, and a policeman a little after—the men ran away—I had hold of one till he bent my finger, as my hand was round his leg, and then I shifted my hand and laid hold of the collar of his coat—the people came round—they did not know I was robbed, and a neighbour came and bent my finger out of his collar, and then he ran</p>

               <p>away—I know the prisoners are the men—Daniel Turner is the man I had hold of, and he had hold of my leg—I never saw them before—it was rather a darkish night—I had plenty of time to see their countenances, for the light came right opposite them—my neighbour had brought a candle out—there was no lamp—I have not the least doubt of Daniel—he is not the man who robbed me, but I cannot swear to the other—they trampled me down to get away from me—Daniel forced my arm from my pocket with his foot, trampling on me—I was a little scratched on the head from their putting their feet on my head to keep me down—they took all my money except twopence, which I had in an old coat pocket—when my wife came out, she picked up the handkerchief which they had put round my head, and said, "This is not yours," and I said it was very likely the handkerchief they put over my face.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife, and live at Walworth, in the parish of Newington. I heard a cry of "Murder" on this night, and went out—I saw my husband lying in the gutter, and the two prisoners upon him—I came up and spoke to them—I thought it was a scuffle amongst them—I did not think they had robbed him—I never saw them before—I told them go about their business, and let him alone—they made no answer, but when I came up I saw James Turner having hold of my hus<lb></lb>band's leg, and my husband having hold of Daniel—I am sure they are the men—I will swear to them both—the handkerchief which was found, which Daniel claims, was twisted round my husband's neck as if to choke him—they remained there a few minutes, because my husband would not let go of Daniel—my husband was quite sober—if he had been in liquor he could have held Daniel—I swear to both the prisoners.</p>

I heard the cry of "Watch," and went out, and saw the prosecutor holding Daniel Turner—I am sure he is the man—the prosecutor was up then, but still had hold of him—I did not see the other prisoner at all—Daniel ran away, and I followed him—he went and hid in a water-closet by the Horse and Groom public-house—I swear he is the same man as the prosecutor had hold of—I did not see any thing of the handkerchief till it was brought to the station-house—I came back, and told them Daniel was in the water-closet—we afterwards saw him standing by a public-house—when he saw us he crossed the road, and ran down West-street—I did not see him taken—I saw James taken by the Duke of Clarence public-house in Penton-place—he had got over a back garden—I saw him in custody of Caselton and Pugh about twenty minutes after—I had been looking after him—when we got to the station-house we found Daniel there, taken by another policeman—one of them owned the handkerchief at the station-house.</p>

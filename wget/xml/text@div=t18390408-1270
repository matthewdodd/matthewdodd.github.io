                  </hi>. I keep a public-house at Hendon. On the 23rd of March, the prisoner came for half-a-pint of beer, and a penny biscuit—he paid me a shilling—I put it into my pocket where I had sixpences, but no other shilling—I found the shilling was bad a few minutes after he was gone, and I put it on a shelf—I delivered it to the officer the next morning—I am sure it was the same I took of the prisoner—I saw him again on the Sunday morning, the 24th, about ten o'clock, he called for a pint of porter, and walked into the tap-room—I drew the porter, John Burgess, my husband's son, took it into the tap-room, and brought me another shilling of the same description as the one I had taken before—I knew the prisoner</p>

               <p>again—I took the two shillings into the tap-room, and saw to him, "You are a circulator of base coin"—he said he was not—I said, "Here is a proof of it, I have a shilling in each hand, one I took of you last night, and the other this morning"—he said, "Give them to me, and I will give you two others?"—I said, "No, I will give them to some one who will take better care of you than I can"—I then sent for the officer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at Fetter Lane. The prisoner came into my service on 10th Jan., as an assistant, and he continued till the 29th; two days after he left, I missed a coat, a pair of gloves, some boots, and books—this coat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is mine—it was taken off the prisoner at the police court—some books of mine were found at his lodging.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Had you several coats hanging up in your study? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, two or three—I gave you a frock coat the first week you were there—I did not give you this one to try on—the one I gave you was quite a different coat to this—I told you the books were at your service, to read at my house, not to take away—this one is a medical list, that ought not to have been taken from my house.</p>

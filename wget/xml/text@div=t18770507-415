                  </hi> I am a travelling clerk in the missing letter Department of the General Post-office—in April last I was directed to make an investigation as to the loss of certain letters—on the 25th April I made up a test letter in which I enclosed 206 penny postage stamps—I addressed it to Mrs. E. Thompson, 126, Pentonville Road, London—I posted it at the northern district office, at 7.15, in the evening—I drew the attention of Mr. Carman, the inspector, to it—at 9.30 I went to 126, pentonville Road and enquired of Mrs. Thompson, who answered the door, and she brought me another letter which she had received—I afterwards saw the prisoner in uniform going on with his delivery, and after that I saw him go into a public-house in Henrietta Street, Brunswick Square, where he remained about fifteen minutes—he then went into No. 19, and about a quarter of an hour came out in private clothes and went again to the public-house—I went into another compartment of the bar and <hi rend="italic">w</hi> him with another man—he then came out and walked down the street and pareyed with another man in Compton Street for about twenty minutes he then re-crossed the street and went towards Cockburn Street, where stopped him and said I wished to ask him about a letter which I had posted that evening to Mrs. Thompson—he said "I delivered a letter to Mrs. Thompson to-night"—I said "I know you did, but not the one I posted"—he said "I know nothing about it, I want to go"—I said "You not go"—Rumbold, the officer, then came up, and Mr. Carman—I said Do you know this gentleman?"—he looked at him and said "No"—I repeated the question and he again replied "No"—I said "Look again"—said "Oh yes, I know who it is now; it is Mr. Carman"—we all then went to a top front room of No. 19, where I again asked about the letter;—the prisoner denied all knowledge of it, but said to Mr. Carman "I had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187705070009"></xptr>
               <p>a letter for you and sorted it for the delivery"—I then directed Rumbold to search the prisoner—he said we should not, and became very violent, so that I was obliged to assist Rumbold to hold him—I shortly afterwards saw Rumbold take a letter from the left hand pocket of his private coat—the prisoner said "That is the b——trator," pointing to Carman, "who put the letter there"—I took him into custody—at Bow Street I examined the envelope and found seventy-two stamps were missing—the envelope produced is in the same state now as when it was found on the prisoner—the stamps had been put in the envelope in different pieces, the one of forty-eight stamps was missing; of a piece of twenty-four, twelve remained; eight were taken from a piece of sixteen; and a whole piece of four—the stamps were also folded differently to what they were placed by me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not know that the delivery that evening was a heavy one; I should say it was not—there were ten pieces of stamps in the letter and two single stamps—it is customary to tie up letters with a string, which sometimes cuts the letters—there are no shops in Henrietta Street to give light to the street—Mr. Carman wore a hat—I do not know what he usually wears—we had great difficulty in getting the, letter—the prisoner is an auxiliary letter carrier—he was employed from 5 p.m. till his delivery was finished, between 11 and 12 o'clock, for which he received 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he may have been seventeen years in the service—I do not know whether he knew me—when a letter is accidentally broken it is the carrier's duty to deliver it to the address on it, give an explanation, and endorse it—he ought in no case to delay a letter even to show to the inspector—express rules are laid down for our guidance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. The letter carrier is furnished with a pouch in which, to put returned letters—the envelope is no more torn now than when it was taken from the prisoner—it could not have been done in the struggle, be<lb></lb>cause his arms were secured—we had no difficulty in taking it from his pocket—the prisoner is an optician, and merely came on duty at 5 o'clock in the evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of letter carriers for the northern district post-office, at Islington—the prisoner was employed at that office to collect and deliver letters—on April 25th I sorted the letter in question to the prisoner, quite securely fastened—I subsequently saw the prisoner, and heard part of the conversation mentioned by the witness Mr. Stevens—I also went with Rumbold and Stevens to the prisoner's house, and heard the prisoner deny all knowledge of the letter—he was very violent when we searched him—we found the letter—t did not see it actually taken—it was not torn in the struggle—the prisoner then said, turning to me, "That's the b——traitor"—I received on the following morning the pouch with which the prisoner is furnished, and which he had to post in a pillar box to the office—it has a brass plate on it—it contained three letters.</p>

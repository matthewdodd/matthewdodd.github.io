On the 26th of July, about eleven o'clock, I met the prisoner James; he came along side of me, and said, he knew this place when there were not so many houses; I said it was very possible, for I was a stranger there, I knew nothing about it; he went on a little further, and stooped down and picked up a brown paper, and in the brown paper was a red pocket book; he said to me, there may be something of consequence in it, and, as I was with him when he found it, I was entitled to half the reward; we came a little further, and he said we had better go into the public-house, the White-horse; we went in, and he called for a glass of beer, he opened the pocket book, and took out a receipt for either one hundred and fifty pounds, or one hundred and eighty pounds, I cannot say which, from lady Spencer, for a brilliant diamond cross, bought of one Mr. Smith, a jeweller; and then another man came in; I cannot say that it was the other prisoner; and he asked him whether he knew such a jeweller as Smith; he said no, he did not, for he was a builder at Stepney; I have my beer every day from that house, and I told the girl to be sure not to forget my beer; then James said directly, we had better go to some other house and settle it; and sure enough I went with them to the sign of the Ship, and it was to be advertised; as he was going away, the builder said, as the woman was with you when you found it, you should leave her some security; he went out to see for a friend to get some money; but that friend was not at home; then the builder said, what money could I make up; I said about two guineas; I went home and got a one pound note, a seven-shilling-piece, and the rest in silver; when I came back, James was gone, and the builder said he had settled the business; I was to give him the two guineas, and he would call upon me; I gave him the money, and never had the cross at all; I only saw it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. You gave the money to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110133"></xptr>other man, not to the prisoner James? - A. No; but he did not call himself James; he called himself Thomas Wilson.</p>

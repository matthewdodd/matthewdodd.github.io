                  </hi>. I carry on business at 41, Thread needle Street, City, in the name of Joseph Kohn and Company—I have occasionally employed the prisoner since March to take cases to the docks, which I packed my-self—on the 27th September I packed this case (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) with about 109 dozen India-rubber combs, and directed the prisoner to take it to the London Docks—they were worth about 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the value of what I missed is 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told my clerk to watch him, and placed the matter in the hands of a detective, and have since found part of the goods at Moses Moses's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Kohn—on the 27th September I received instructions from him and followed the prisoner—he took the box downstairs and placed it on a barrow—Donovan was with him—they went as far as Leadenhall Market, where the prisoner left Donovan, who went nearly to the bottom of Leadenhall Street, and I missed him—I went on to the Minories, and found him again in five minutes—I only took three or four minutes to walk from Leadenhall Street to the Minories, and at the bottom of the Minories I missed him again—I went to the London Docks, and waited there till he arrived with the case—he was alone, and directly he delivered it at the jetty I had it opened, and found that nearly all the contents had been abstracted.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 10, Backchurch Lane, Commercial Road, and am errand boy at Billingsgate—I was there on the 27th September, and the prisoner asked me if I wanted a job—I went with him to Mr. Kohn's place—he went up and brought this case down on his shoulder—it was nailed down, and there were irons across the top of the lid—he put it on the barrow, and gave me the shipping note; which I put in my cap—he left me in Leadenhall Street, and told me to meet him at the corner of the "Golden Lion" public-house, Leman Street—I met him there, and he told me to draw over into Prescott Street, Lupus Street—I did so, and his brother came up—the prisoner took the case off the barrow and put it on</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186610220121"></xptr>
               <p>his brother's head—I gave him the shipping note—he said that he should not be a quarter of an hour gone, and told me to go and have a bit of dinner—he was away about a quarter of an hour—he brought the case back and gave me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to take it to the London Dock Jetty—I spent 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for some fish and bread—Prescott Street was not in my way to the docks if I had gone straight—it took me about three-quarters of an hour to go to the docks from where the prisoner took the case away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Prescott Street is a very little out of the way, is it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it is as good a way as any to go—I stayed about five minutes in Golden Lane, waiting in the bar—it was twelve o'clock just as I got to the docks with the case—the prisoner said that he was going to his dinner—he was gone a quarter of an hour, or a little more—it was after I delivered the case that I got the bread and fish in the docks.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a City detective officer—Mr. Kohn gave me instructions to investigate this matter, and on 5th October the prisoner was brought to me at the East India Docks by Blades and another officer—I told him we were police-officers, and should put some questions to him respecting a box taken yesterday week to the London Docks—he hesitated at first, and then said, "I took it there quite safe"—I said, "Are you perfectly sure of that?"—he said, "I sent a young fellow with it"—I said, "That case had been opened when it reached the docks, and seventy dozen combs had been stolen from it, how do you account for that?"—he said, "It was all safe when I delivered it at the docks"—I said, "You just said that you sent a young fellow with it"—he said, "Yes, but I saw him give it safe into the docks"—I said, "Who is he?"—he said, "A stranger to me"—I said, "It was strange to trust a case to a stranger. Do you know his name, or where he lives?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Can you assist me in finding him?"—he said, "No, but he hangs about Billingsgate Market"—the prisoner's brother was with him, and we took them both to Mr. Kohn's office and pointed the cases out to them—I said, "That is the case I spoke of"—the prisoner said, "Yes, that is the one we took"—I went to Bilings gate Market next morning and found Donovan—I took him to the City, confronted him with the prisoner, and said, "Is this the lad you sent with the box?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "He makes a statement criminating you, would you like to hear what he has to say?"—he said, "Yes"—Donovan then made the same statement as he has to-day—I said, "You hear what he says. Is it true?"—he said, "I told him to go with me to the 'Lion' "—I said, "Is all you say true?"—he said, "Yes, it is all true"—he was then locked up again.</p>

               <p>On the 6th of March, about 7 o'clock I was standing at my door, I keep a publick house opposite the new Sessions House Clerkenwell-green? I saw the prisoner Taylor, leading a mare, and the other prisoner Hobbs was then on the pavement, he said, bring it this way, we shall get more for it here than any where else; they led her down to Hockley in the Hole, to one Paris, a horse boiler, I saw them both standing at the gate, I then returned back to my own house from there, and called up my wife, and I went back and saw Mr. Paris coming, for where they boiled them is down Black-boy Alley, says I, Mr. Paris there is a horse that is in your yard that is a stolen one, says he, the servant has sent for me to look at him; I went with him and the mare stood there, and the men were over at the public house, I desired Paris to ask them some questions, the prisoner Taylor said, he brought it from Hornsey, and that there was no fear of his buying the mare, for she was worn out and broken winded, and very apt to lay down under a load. Mr. Paris said, if they could bring any body to prove that they came honestly by the mare he would buy her, the prisoner Hobbs said if you will go with me into Saint John's-street, I will bring witnesses, they went into Saint John's-street and returned, I stood with the other not taking any notice that I was an officer, Paris returned, says he, Mr. Seasons this young man bears a good character, I said I was not satisfied, I returned and told the prisoner Taylor, says I, young man this is a stolen mare, and the man is in custody, says he, I did not steal it myself but it was Hobbs that stole it.</p>

               <p>What did you tell him would be the consequence if he told you the truth? - In order to get it out of him whether it was so or not, I told him that if the horse was stolen to go away, and he got up instantly, that was while Hobbs was gone with Paris, I then took the prisoner Taylor to my house, I saw Paris coming down I could see him out of my door, I handcuffed Taylor and took him to New Prison, I met Paris with Hobbs, says I, Mr. Paris take hold of him, it is a stolen house I put them both into New Prison, I went and acquainted the Magistrates with what had passed, and they both owned that the horse was a stolen horse.</p>
               <p>Did they say where they had stolen him? - They said they took him from Finchley Common, I asked them who it belonged to they said they did not know.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any promises or threats made use of? - None, only what I have mentioned.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of it? - Yes, I went to seek after the owner of the horse, and at Holloway turnpike I saw a man, who directed me to several people that were drinking, and when I told them, they said, they should as soon have thought of the best people in the country being guilty as them, they gave them a very good character, and upon that character I hope I shall be called.</p>

               <p>Are you sure that these men are the young men that brought the horse? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What might that mare be worth? - She was in foal, I suppose three or four pounds.</p>
               <p>How came you to bid half a guinea for her? - They told me that it was broken-winded, I had a suspicion it was not an honest horse and therefore I desired them to wait, and I sent for my master, this horse was the same that Seasons had from our yard.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Was the mare that Seasons brought home to you yours? - Yes.</p>

            . I am a clothes-salesman, and live in Rosemary-lane. The two prisoners came to my shop between one and two o'clock in the day, on the 5th of November, and offered the silver articles for sale. Brook was the man that offered them. I asked him where he got them; he said he had brought them from abroad. I told him I did not think that they were his. He said they are mine, if you will not buy them, give them back to me. I refused, and he told me to send for an officer. He could not have gone away without jumping over the door; I do not think he attempted it. I went for the officer, and left them in charge of my wife and man. The articles are worth thirty shillings.</p>

            . I live with Mrs. Robertson. I got up after six o'clock in the morning; it was not light; the day had began to break. I was going to open the street door, and saw the hole in the wall.</p>
               <p>EBENEZE DALTON. I am a police officer. I searched the prisoners, and found the boots, one shilling and two-pence three-farthings, in farthings, and ten-pence halfpenny, in penny-pieces and halfpence, and two children's thimbles on Brooks; and on Franks I found one shilling and sixpence, in halfpence, and four-pence halfpenny, in farthings and penny-pieces. Brooks said, that he bought the boots in Petticoat-lane, for his little brother, and gave sixpence for them. Franks said, he found his things at the back<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181612040036"></xptr>of the hospital in Whitechapel-road. I found a chisel in the bar of the house.</p>
               <p>Court to MRS. ROBERTSON. Did you lose any thimbles - A. I cannot say; my children have thimbles.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you as much as two shillings in farthings - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Brooks Defence. On the 5th of November I was coming from Stepney, and fell in with this boy. We were talking together, and he blacked my face in the fields. I had a stick in my hand, and I pushed it into the ground to get up a turf to heave at him, and I rose the spoons up. They were buried in the ground. I went to Petticoat-lane, and bought the boots; they gave me the farthings in change. As I was going down Rosemary-lane I saw a boy, who asked me if I had any thing to sell; I gave him the spoons, and they sent for an officer.</p>

The prisoner lodged at our house from the 11th of December, 1812, until the 12th of February following, which was on a Monday - he was was in my debt; he slept in the bed next to my bed-room. At nine o'clock in the morning he came down to the kitchen, and said -</p>
               <p>"Good morning;" he returned up with the clothes brush, and came down in about half an hour, wished me good morning, and said he should return about one o'clock, and should bring me some money. I had left my bed-room door ajar, as my child was in bed. I went up stairs about an hour after, and missed these things from the drawers, I saw no more of him till the 6th of March when I met him in Aldgate, he passed me, ran across the road, looked at me, and ran towards Whitechapel - he was apprehended on the 9th.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. - Q. Have you found any of your property. - A. No, he owed me 24 s. I had not threatened to arrest him for it; he was found in the London hospital, which is not far from my house.</p>
               <p>WM. CROWDER. I saw every thing safe at half-past ten o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I owed the gentleman some money, his wife asked me many times for it; when I went out, I said I should get some money, I could not get it, and did not like to return, and went to lodge at another place, I soon found the officers were after me. I said I had only left my lodgings in debt; I got ill and went to the London hospital, I was in there the day that the prosecutrix says she met me, and was not able to move.</p>

                  </hi>. I am first cousin to Margaret Edwards, who was tried here this session—I saw the prisoner at the bar, on the subject of her trial, several times—the first time was on Thursday evening, the 10th of this month, when I called at Mr. Tinslay's office—I saw Mr. Tinslay—I saw the prisoner alone afterwards—I saw him on Saturday, the 12th, and I gave him half-a-crown, in the first instance, to go across the road to the office in the prison, to get certain documents-when he came back, I asked him what the expense for the defence would be, and he told me three guineas—I then gave him a sovereign and a sixpence, which made 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for which he gave me a receipt in Mr. Tinslay's name—on the Wednesday following I met the prisoner again, in the Old Bailey, and we walked to<lb></lb>gether up Fleet-street—I told him I was very sorry I could not raise the money, and he said, "Raise me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by seven o'clock this evening it will do, as I am quite ready for you"—I saw him in the evening, a considerable time before the appointed time, and I gave him a sovereign, and he gave me a receipt—I saw him again on the day of the trial, before the trial, he was coming up the Grand Jury stairs—he asked me where I had been—I said, looking for him, as I was to have met him that morning by appoint<lb></lb>ment, at eleven o'clock, but I could not find him—I was to have met him at the George public-house, at the corner of Fleet-lane, but I met him here two hours at least after eleven o'clock-when I told him I had been look<lb></lb>ing for him, he said it was all right, the brief was in Mr. Clark son's hands, or words to that effect—I am sure he mentioned the word "brief," and that it was in Mr. Clarkson's hands, and it was all right—I am sure of those expressions.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in Court when Margaret Edwards was given in charge to the Jury—I was sent for out of the other Court, in con<lb></lb>sequence of her mentioning my name as her counsel-up to that time the prisoner had not said a word to me about retaining me for her defence no brief for her was at that time in my hands—I remember the learned Common Sergeant appealing to my generosity to defend the poor woman, and I defended her, on both the indictments, gratuitously—I remember the prisoner coming behind me when the discussion was going on—I did not hear the witness Harriott say, in the prisoner's presence, that he had given him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that had passed before I came in; but I heard the Common Sergeant say to the prisoner, "It appears you have received 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; how is</p>

               <p>in the prisoner is not defended?" or words to that effect, but 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was mentioned—I do not remember the words the prisoner made use of, but he made some excuse to the Common Sergeant, and mentioned the name of my learned friend, Mr. Prendergast—I think he said, indeed I am sore he said, that my learned friend was expected every minute—I continued in Court till I had addressed the Jury on the second charge, and while they were deliberating I went out of Court-up <hi rend="italic">to</hi> that time nothing was said by the prisoner about his having received more than the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he did not, at the time of the trial, give me any brief or instructions—I made the best effort I could from the facts disclosed by the witnesses—the prisoner appeared very much confused from the state in which he found himself; and I think he was unable to furnish any instructions at that time.</p>

               <p>between 9 and 10 o'clock, I was sitting in a chair outside the defendant's door, and she was sitting by my side, and I saw young Hyam spurt some water all over her, through a tin tube, like this, and some of the water went on the pavement—her husband was called, but I did not see him—I saw a City Policeman come, not many minutes afterwards—I went to the Police Court when young Hyams was charged with assaulting the defen<lb></lb>dant with the water, and fined 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but only that time—I know that the defendant went to Hyams' house on the night of the 14th, to make a com<lb></lb>plaint, but I cannot say what happened—when the policeman came, the boy had the trumpet in his hand, and he ran indoors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am not often there—I happened to be there that night doing business with her—I did not see her till the week after—Mr. Isaacs went for a policeman—I don't know where Mrs. Isaacs went—I was left alone, but it was nothing concerning me, and I never got no off my chair—Mr. Veal saw it done, I believe; I swear that—I do not remember saying at the Police Court that nobody else was there but myself—I never saw the schoolmaster—I got there between 7 and 8 o'clock, and remained till nearly 11—I did not notice Mr. Hyams shutting up—the boy got the water out of his house—I do not know whether it was in a jug—I saw him with the trumpet in his mouth, and he blew the water over Mrs. Isaacs as he passed—I did not see where Mr. Isaacs came from, but I know he went for a policemen, because Mrs. Isaacs told me so—I did not speak to the policeman, or run after the boy; I told you I did not get up—I told Mrs. Isaacs what I would have done to the boy—I have never been a wit<lb></lb>ness in a Police Court before—I know Mitchell Hyams, I summoned him to the Police Court, and that was the only time I was there—I was bound over as well as him, by my own wish, because he is my uncle—it was his wish and my wish that we should both be bound over.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, of Middlesex Street, directly opposite Mr. Hyams'—on the night of 16th August I saw the boy Hyams with a tin trumpet in his hand—a thing like this—I had seen him with it on several occasions the same day; he was making an awful noise with it, so that my customers were annoyed—I did not complain to his father or mother, because I knew it was no use—they must have seen the trumpet, because he was there the whole day long—the last time I saw him with it was after 9 o'clock—I generally shut up about 10 o'clock, sometimes at 9 o'clock.</p>

On 14th August, about 9.40, I was fetched by the defendant's husband to Petticoat Lane—Middlesex Street is one side, and Petticoat Lane is the other—he made a complaint to me—I saw some water on the pavement, a yard or two from the house—I saw the boy Hyams in the doorway, with something like a tin trumpet, or whistle, in his hand—ho walked in and shut the door.</p>

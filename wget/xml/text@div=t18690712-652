I am a labourer—I work at Uxbridge, and live at Smith's Buildings, there—on 6th July, about 6.30, I saw the prisoner come out of the passage into his own home, and saw him open the door—Redrup, the deceased, was with him—we used to call him <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>—they went in to No. 4, Smith's Buildings, that is Mrs. Murray's house, the prisoner's mother; but she was not there that night—the prisoner lives there—he opened the door, and Redrup stepped his foot inside, and fell down—they were both very tipsy—I went on to the tap for some water, and came back about five or six minutes afterwards, and looked into the house, and saw Redrup on his back, in the kitchen, and a cushion under his head—he was alive then—the prisoner stood at the door then—there was no blood about then—I did not notice that anything had been done to his throat—about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour afterwards my little girl called to me—I went to the door, but did not go inside—I saw Redrup lying in a pool of blood—I went for a policeman—I did not see one, and went for the doctor—the prisoner was not there then.</p>

I am a labourer, and live at Uxbridge—on Tuesday, 6th July, between 6 and 7 o'clock, I saw the prisoner and deceased at the top of the passage, leading to 4, Smith's Buildings, where the prisoner lives—Camp was lying down in the passage—he did not seem sober—it is a public passage, leading to the bouses—Redrup was lying at the top of the passage, on the ground, on tire path—he was drunk; he could not</p>

I am the wife of Samuel Gowlett, a labourer, of Ux-bridge—I remember the 6th July, three weeks come Sunday evening (27th June)—I don't know the day of the month—I saw him sharpening some<lb></lb>thing on the step of his own door—he was eating his supper, for some minutes—we were inside our door—we live close to one another—after he had eaten it, I saw him throw a piece of bread out that he had done with—he was very much the worse for liquor; then I heard him scrap-ing something to and fro on the red brick, at the door—I did not speak to him then, nor he to me—I afterwards met him at the top or the passage, and he said, "I have just sharpened this, I owe a spite, and I mean having my revenge"—I could not say that I saw anything in his hand; whatever it was it went up his sleeve—I could not say what it was that he was sharpening; it was something that grated on the step—on Tuesday, 6th July, at something like 6.30, I saw the prisoner with Redrup—they went into Mrs. Murray's house—I heard them in—I don't know whether they fell down, or laid down—I went to the step of the door, and said, "<hi rend="italic">Will</hi>, whatever did you bring Redrup home here for, you know how it do annoy your mother"—he said, "He has been put upon where we have been drinking, and I brought him home to protect him"—his sister came running up from her own cottage—she looked in with me, and said, "Does he not look in a fit?"—I saw Redrup lying on the floor, on his back—they were both lying down together, on the floor, but Murray was rolled more over on his side—as he lifted up his head, he spoke to me—he laid close at Redrup's feet, as Redrup laid long ways, Mur<lb></lb>ray sat at his feet, in a chair, with his arms leaning on his knee—he got up from the ground—when I first saw him he was on the floor—he lifted up his head and spoke to me, and then he got up—Murray appeared to me to have a froth or foam coming from his mouth, but I quite thought it was from the drink he had had, and he was lying on his back—I saw a cushion lying close by, and I put it under his head—I shook him by the shoulder, and said, "<hi rend="italic">Tom, Tom</hi>, wake up; do you know me," and he opened his eyes, and said, "Yes, Mrs. Gowlett, I am all right"—he was wry much the worse for drink, still he recognized me; he knew my voice—he was drunk—there was nothing the matter with his throat at that time—Murray then said, "I shall lie down and have an hour or two's <hi rend="italic">doss</hi>"(dose); he then came from the chair which he sat in, blundered over him in some way, being tipsy, and laid down by the side of Redrup, and put his arm across him, and said again that he</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you known Murray some time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and his mother—he had been drinking a good deal for a long time—about six weeks before this transaction I heard that he had fallen down and cut his head, and lost a quantity of blood—I know he had been keeping company with a young woman, she had left him, and I heard that that preyed on his mind, and made him give to drink—he was drunk nearly every day shortly before this occurrence—when drunk, he was in a very wild and frenzied state—his sister lives near, at No. 1; she is married to Edward Groom, a painter—the prisoner's mother lives at No. 4—she is a nurse—he is not an only child, or an only son; he is the only one at home—I did not know his father, I believe he has been dead some years—Groom's father lives at No. 2, and I live at No. 3—No. 4 is a three-roomed house, one above the other—the room I saw them in is on the ground-floor, that is used as a kitchen and sitting-room; there is no other place besides that down stairs, except a little cupboard—the mother has not slept there for the last eight weeks, she goes out nursing—the prisoner slept in the top room—no one occupied the house but he and his mother, when she was at home—Neale lives at No. 5—I was at the end of the row when Neale came running by; I saw him go and look in after he had been for the water—before the prisoner got up into the chair he was lying beside the deceased, he was on his side and the deceased was on his back; the cushion was under his head then—I saw the prisoner lying in that way for a moment or so before he got into the chair—I could not say the time justly, for a minute—when I first looked in, I saw him lying beside Redrup—he could only have been there a few minutes, from the time they passed my door—I only said, "Why did you bring him in here?"—that seemed to disturb Murray, he seemed to be <hi rend="italic">doseficd</hi>—it was immediately after he used the words I have mentioned that he scrambled up into the chair—he then laid down again beside Redrup, and I left them in that way—my attention was called by the screaming, about ten minutes afterwards—when I left them there was nothing the matter with Redrup, that I saw, except the effects of drink.</p>

               <p>chair was, I should think, about two or three feet from the middle of his body; I have not measured it—the razor was in about the middle of the seat of the chair—it was a common Windsor chair—the razor was lying straight across the middle of the chair, not in a line with my brothers arm, but away from it, crossways—there was blood on the handle, and the blade too and two or three drops of blood had dropped from the handle on to the chair—I laid hold of my brother's hand, but I did not move it—I merely laid hold of it to feel if there was any life in him—I considered he was dead—his hands laid on his breast in that position (<hi rend="italic">describing it</hi>)—there was a pool of blood on the floor on each side of him—there were some persons at the door at the time, but no one else in the house when I went in; I think Mrs. Gowlett was at the door, I can't be certain—when I first saw my brother he lay on his back, with his hands so; both of them open, or nearly so; they might not have been quite flat, but in that position—there was a little blood on the back of his right hand, I think, but none on the front—there was no blood on the left hand; the left hand was uppermost, nearest his head—he lay flat on his back, and his legs quite straight, as though he was asleep, and had not moved—as soon as I found that he was dead, I came out again, and closed the door—Dr. Ferris came directly after me; I suppose I had been outside three or four minutes, and we went into the house again together—we examined him, and was satisfied that he was dead—I waited till a policeman came—I left the house in his charge, with orders not to allow anybody to touch him, or go into the house, except Dr. Ferris, or any other medical gentleman—I then went with a police-constable straight to my father's shop, in High Street, opposite the Market House, and the prisoner was there in custody—the constable said to him, "I take you in custody on a charge of the wilful murder of Frederick Redrup "—the shop was full of people, at least there was my sister, and several there; and I am not quite certain what the prisoner said, but I believe he said, "All right, I will go"—he was taken to the police-station, and given in charge—Sergeant Cooper asked the constable, West, what number it was in Smith's Buildings, and the prisoner said, "99 "—West said, "No. 4 "—the prisoner said, "You know nothing about it, Mr. West; if you had been there, you would have been in the same position as he is now "—the prisoner was searched, and a bead was produced from his pocket—I said to the constable, "Take care of that bead, for I believe we have some at home that will match it"—there were spots of blood on the inside of the leg of the prisoner's trowsers—I could see that as he was going along the street with us—I did not see any blood anywhere else—my brother was of weak mind, and had been so from his birth—the prisoner was the worse for liquor—I should wish to mention about the bead, I produce some which exactly match the one found on the prisoner; they belong to my daughter; my brother was in the habit of having a bead in his mouth, he was scarcely ever without a bead or a button in his mouth.</p>

From information I received, I took the prisoner into custody, in the Market House, Uxbridge, about six or seven minutes past 7 o'clock—Mr. Vagg said to me, in his presence, and pointing to him, "He says he has cut <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Redrup's throat"—the prisoner said, "Yes, I have; I will go with you, Mr. West"—I took him across to the deceased's father, to ascertain whether such was the case or not—I said to the prisoner, "Where is <hi rend="italic">Tom?"</hi>—he said, "At my mother's house"—I left the prisoner in charge of Mr. Vagg, and went to 4, Smith's Buildings, where I saw the body of the deceased—he was quite dead—I then returned to the prisoner, and told him I should take him into custody on the charge of the wilful murder of Frederick Redrup—he said, "All right, I will go"—on the road to the station I met a brother constable, who said, "What's the matter down the town; I heard that they wanted two or three policemen there"—I said, "This man is charged with wilful mur<lb></lb>der"—the prisoner said, "Yes, and I would do it again, if I had the chance"—I took him to the station, and he was charged by the deceased's brother with the wilful murder of Frederick Redrup—Sergeant Cooper asked me the number of the house in Smith's Buildings—I said, No. "4 "—the prisoner said, "You know nothing about it, Mr. West; you were not there, or you would have been in the same position as he is "—I did not notice that the prisoner said anything about No. 99—I searched him, and found on him this glass bead, a key, 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—I did not examine his clothes—I noticed a spot of blood on the inside of the left leg of his trowser; it was a large spot, about an inch or an inch and a half long, and almost as broad as your two fingers; it was quite wet.</p>

I produce a razor—I found it on 6th July, about 7.10 in the evening, on a chair, at No. 4, Smith's Build<lb></lb>ings, Uxbridge, on the ground-floor—Mrs. Murray occupies that place—I saw the deceased lying on the floor, on his back, with his head towards the door—this cushion I found on the table; there was no cushion under his head then—I measured the distance from the centre of the breast of the deceased to the nearest edge of the seat of the chair, and it was exactly three feet—I found this razor-case in a small drawer of a chest of drawers in the room; the top was off, and one place was vacant—the razor I found its into it—the name of Murray is scratched, as if with a pin, on both sides of the razor.</p>

               <p>room, a sort of little washing-place, it was on the right-band side from where the deceased lay, a little further back, almost straight with his feet, the door would be almost level with his feet, and about four or five feet from them—the door was open—I saw a hand-basin in that cupboard, with water in it, of a reddish colour—this towel was on the door—there was blood on it—I submitted it to Dr. Ferris; it was wet when I found it; it looked like blood—there was a little spot or two of blood or red in the basin, just above the water, as if from the water—I taw the deceased lying there, and I saw the razor on the chair, and I stretched hit right arm over towards the chair—he was then quite warm—I stretched his fingers up, and I spanned the space with my hand, and I should say it was about mine or ten inches from the edge of the chair; it would not reach the chair by nine or ten inches—police-constable Gould was in charge of the room when I went there—I saw two spots of blood about a foot from the door leading to the cupboard, where I found the water; they were in a direction from where the deceased lay to the cupboard; there was a knife partly out of the deceased's pocket; there was no blood on it—I searched the deceased and found on him this knife, three pipes, a tobacco-box, and a brass match-box.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons—on 6th July I was called in to No. 4, Smith's Buildings—I got there at 7.5—as the door was opened, I found the deceased living on the floor, with his head towards the door—his head was in a pool of blood—I examined him, and found him quite dead—my attention was directed by George Redrup, to his throat, rod I found a large gash, in the throat, from side to side, and I saw that the windpipe was out right through—there was one out right across, and just the beginning of one on the right aide; one very small superficial one, and one large one right across—his hands were across his chest like that (<hi rend="italic">describing the position</hi>)—one across the chart and one across the stomach—there were only a few sprinkles of blood on hit right hand, on the back, dotted over; just sprinkles, as if from the jet of an artery—there was no blood on the inside of the right hand—there was blood on the back</p>

               <p>of the left hand, and the palm of the fingers was covered with blood—the back of the fingers was covered with blood, with the exception of just the tip of the forefinger—there was nothing more on the back, just a little stream like, running down; but not continuously over it, as if it had run down from the back of the fingers—the insides of the fingers were covered with blood—there was no blood on the body lower than the collar bone, in front, on the shirt—I mean, running down—the wound must have been done when he was lying down—next afternoon I made a more detailed examination of the wound, with the assistance of Mr. Macnamara and Mr. Roberts, surgeons, of Uxbridge—I found a large gash right across the throat, and there was a smaller one on the left side, not reaching through the skin—the large wound was not deep, on the left side; the left carotid artery was not cut through—the windpipe was cut right through, at the top of the trachea—the gullet was not wounded—the right carotid artery was cut completely through, and the large muscle on the neck was also cut com<lb></lb>pletely through—the mass of blood was on the right side of the head, which would be accounted for by the right artery being cut—there were sprinkles of blood on his waistcoat and on his trowsers—the cut commenced on the left side of the throat—a razor would produce it—I saw this razor on the chair on the right side of the deceased—it would produce the wound I have described—death would ensue in a minute or two from such a wound, very quick—the wound was the cause of death—I noticed the room, there was no sign of struggle—there was a paper screen, about half a foot to the left of the deceased, which was not disarranged, nor was there blood upon it—there was a small, square piece of carpet, not nailed down, lying on the floor—that was not disarranged—that was under the deceased—the chairs were evenly against the wall, and there was a table to the left; in fact, there were no signs of a struggle—there were no scratches or bruises on the face or hands of the deceased—I examined some water in a basin; it was very dirty, soapy water; it had a reddish colour—I examined it—I cannot swear that it was blood—I found no distinct evidence of its being blood, although most probably it was—the prisoner's clothes were shown me next day—the red spots upon them were blood, decidedly, and human blood—his shirt was shown to me, and these trowsers and this towel—I think that was all—these marks are all blood, decidedly human blood—they appeared recent then—I am of opinion that if the deceased had got up to inflict the wound upon himself, the blood would have streamed down his chest, and there was none below the collar bone—if he did not get up, his hand would not reach the chair.</p>

               <p>any physical injury, as among soldiers and sailors, drunkenness, even when existing to a slight extent, produces sometimes a fit of temporary insanity, leaving the mind clear when the drunken fit is over"—I did not examine the prisoner at all—I did not know him before this; I knew his mother.</p>

             (police-constable S 58). I took the two prisoners, and these thirteen pieces of wood; Cadwell said his wife bought part of them, and they had come at two separate times - that Palmer had brought some in the morning, and some in the evening - he said his wife gave 1s. for that in the morning, and he gave 1s. 3d. for the other; he said he was not aware but he had given a fair price for it - I thought well of him; he has been two or three months in the business.</p>
               <p>MR. KNAPP. This is my property; it is worth about 18s.; it is not possible for a man who had been in our business to make so great a mistake about the value.</p>

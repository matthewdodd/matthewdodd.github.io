                  </hi>. I am a chair and sofa maker, and live in Broadwall, Stamford-street, Surrey—the prisoner was my journeyman. On Satur<lb></lb>day night last, about eleven o'clock, he came to be settled with—he pro<lb></lb>duced his account to me—there was a difference between us as to the charges, which were more than I thought I should pay—he called me a b—ferret-eyed looking b—, and a shuffling trickster, said said he should like to give me something—I then sent for a policeman, who heard me tell him, what he had done I would pay him for, and when the other work was finished, I would settle for that—he then appeared more calm, and the constable left—I proceeded to settle with him—he went and sat at the end of the room, and I was settling with the other men—while I was sit<lb></lb>ting down writing, he got up, came behind me, and in an instant I felt a tremendous crash on my head, three times; had I not put my hand up, to save the second blow, I believe death must have been the consequence, for I received that blow on my hand instead of my head—I cannot say who struck the blow—I became insensible, and recollect nothing more till I found myself reviving in the surgeon's shop—I was afterwards attended by the surgeon of St. Thomas's Hospital—I managed to go out a little way on Sunday evening, but felt so faint I was obliged to return.</p>

I am in the employ of Mr. Nash—I was there on Saturday evening while he and the prisoner were settling some accounts—there was a dispute with the prisoner—a policeman was sent for, and he became quiet—after that he sat down in the room by himself—the pro<lb></lb>secutor began to settle with another man—I saw the prisoner get off his seat, walk round behind the prosecutor, take an empty champagne bottle off the drawers, and strike the prosecutor over the head with it as hard as he could, apparently—master had his hat off, and was sitting at the table—he struck him three times with it—he said nothing—the prosecutor got up and went out—he staggered outside the door—his head bled a good deal—the bottle was broken all to pieces—I think it broke with the se<lb></lb>cond blow, and the third was given with the neck of it—I ran to master's assistance, went over to the doctor's to him, and saw him sitting, bleeding in a chair—he was sensible then—the prisoner was quite sober—I gave him in charge.</p>

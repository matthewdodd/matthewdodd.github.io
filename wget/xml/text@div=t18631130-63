                  </hi>. I am collector at Newgate-market—I have had a good deal of experience in meat—I was inspector of meat to the Commissioners of Sewers fourteen or fifteen years—I saw these four quarters which were condemned—in my judgment they were quite unfit for human food.</p>

               <p>disease would show itself over the surface of the meat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, the disease would not show itself—it would not be so good if it was kept in hot weather—the disease would be as apparent after the first day or two as it was after<lb></lb>wards—the disease would not be more apparent by the meat being kept, the meat would not look so well.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>). On 24th November I took the prisoner in custody at Coupar Angus, on a warrant—I told him that I was a police-officer, and that I had come from London for the purpose of apprehending him—he began making a statement—I told him that he had no occasion to make any statement at all, but what he did say I should have to repeat in evidence against him before the Magistrate—he made a statement—I could not understand it very well; it was rather broad Scotch—I asked a gentleman to take down the statement in writing, and he did so—I read the statement over to the prisoner, and then asked him to read it himself, and sign it if he liked—He did sign it—I brought the prisoner up to London with Culross—I heard a noise in the night while we were in the train—I distinctly heard Stewart say, "If you do, you will ruin me," and Culross indignantly refused to do as he wished—(<hi rend="italic">Statement read</hi>: "David Fairnie, shoemaker and dairyman, Blengowrie, came to me some time ago, and asked me to take two cows belonging to him, and send them to the London market; he asked me to do so as a great favour, and I consented out of charity to him, as he had to my knowledge previously lost some cattle. My arrangement with Fairnie was, that I should slaughter the cows, forward the carcases to London in my own name, and hand over to him the proceeds of sale. I took delivery of the cattle at Rosemount Station between 10 and 11 o'clock at night. I drove them to Coupar Angus, and James Culross, butcher, slaughtered and dressed them next day; and the day following that, I quartered the carcases, packed them up, and conveyed them to the railway station at Coupar Angus where I consigned them to George Lee and Co., meat-salesmen, Newgate-market. The two carcasses were cut down into four quarters each, and packed in cloths. Four quarters of these beasts were seized in London, and condemned. I received the condemnation, which I afterwards handed to Fairnie, and which is still in his possession. I paid him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., made up thus:—1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received from London; 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the two hides, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the tallow.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> In consequence of his statement you went to Fairnie, did you not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, for the purpose of serving Fairnie with a subpoena—the prisoner told me that Fairnie had these papers and invoice, and I told Fairnie what the prisoner had said—he denied that the statement was true—he said he had sold the beasts altogether, and never heard anything about hides or tallow—at that time he had produced the documents—I asked him to produce them, and I took possession of them.</p>

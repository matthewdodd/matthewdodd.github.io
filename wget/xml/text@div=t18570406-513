The prisoner is an Italian, and an acquaintance—on the evening of 28th March he came to my house—he went away about half past 11 o'clock—we had been drinking together; I went out with him; we were on friendly terms, we went out friendly; I bade him good night, and all of a sudden he took a knife and stabbed me—I was near the street door at the time; he was at the side of me—we had not had any words or any quarrel before that—I felt the blow in my arm, it cut me through my coat—he then gave me another stab in the neck, and then I ran in doors; I was also cut in the hand in defending myself; I saw the blade, but I could not distinguish what sort of a knife it was—he had it in his right hand—he had a cane in his left hand—he ran away after stabbing me.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 20, Castle Alley. The prosecutor lodged in our house—I remember the prisoner coming to his room, on the evening of 28th March; I went up, and they were both sitting together very com<lb></lb>fortable as I thought; there was another young woman there; Mr. Dese<lb></lb>mona had invited her up—I keep lodgers—they had some porter—I was out for two hours while they were there, and left the place in charge of a young woman that lodged with me—when I came home, they said I should have some drink with them, and they sent me out for two pots of stout—I was there when the prisoner went away—he parted with us on good terms, and bade me good night—Mr. Desemona went out with him—I heard them arguing at the door—I did not understand them; the prisoner spoke very roughly—I took a candle, and went out, and saw the prisoner having hold of Mr. Desemona, and Mr. Desemona rushed in very soon after me, and said he was stabbed with a knife—the prisoner ran away—I saw him break the door, half of it is glass, and then he ran away—he broke it with a stick which he had in his hand—I called out, "Police!"</p>

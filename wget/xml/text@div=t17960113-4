               <p>On Saturday the 13th of December, as near as I can tell, about five o'clock I went out, and returned at half past six; I did not discover that I had been robbed till Monday morning; the servant took the shutters down, called me, and told me the window was broke; there were three holes made between the putty and the frame, by which means a piece of glass was taken out; I looked in the place where the goods were missing, and missed five or six fruit knives with silver blades.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of them? - A. I think four or five-and-twenty shillings; I am not certain what I valued them at in the indictment; I sent for the glazier to mend the windows; I was sent for, on Monday morning, to the magistrate, about ten o'clock; I saw my knives, they were marked with my own private mark, and with my own hand; when I went out of town, as I had so frequently had my windows broke, I looked to see that my knives were all there, and they were placed in a regular row in my case.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not this window have continued in this state at any time between the time you went out on Saturday and the Monday morning? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>On the 19th of December I and Dean apprehended the prisoner, in Fleet-street, and another with him; I apprehended them, breaking a shop window; we searched the prisoner, and in his under-waistcoat pocket, on the right hand side, Dean took out a tobacco-box, with some knives in it; we went to different shops, to enquire who had had their windows cut; we went to Mr. Parker, in St. Paul's Church-yard, who had had his windows broke, but had lost nothing; we enquired, and found out, that Mr. Janaway was robbed, and sent for him to Guildhall.</p>

               <p>I was with the last witness on the 19th of December, at the time the prisoner was apprehended; I searched him, and in his under-waistcoat right-hand pocket, I took out a tobacco-box with these knives in it, (producing them), I have had them ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Janaway.) Did you examine the window yourself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the shop window shut upon the Sunday? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then from half past six on Saturday, till Monday morning, it was shut? - A. Yes; and the shutter appeared to be broke, a piece being cut out by an instrument; there were three holes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you open your shop? - A. I suppose about half past seven.</p>

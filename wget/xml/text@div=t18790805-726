                  </hi>. I live at 20, Manor Street, Rateliff, and am superinten. dent of the Trinity Ballast Department—I missed a ballast winch from the store in October last, which I had seen safe in September—it belonged to the Trinity Corporation, and was marked "HT"—Maddigan was engaged</p>

               <p>in the ballast trade—I made inquiries, and charged him on 5th July with stealing the winch—he said that he bought it of M'Nally. (Maddigan here handed in a letter, stating that his witnesses had gone on a voyage, and requesting the postponement of his earn to the next Session, and upon his undertaking not to take any advantage of the fact, the Jury were discharged from giving a verdict as to him, and his ease was postponed.)</p>

I live at the cornet of John Street, St. George's—Maddigan lodged in my house—M'Nally came there to him three times, and the third time he said he had a b——winch to sell for 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; that was nine and a half months ago—Maddigan said that he had no money till next week, and then M'N ally came the third time, and that conversation took place—I never saw the winch.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was asked if I saw anybody come after Maddigan—I said "A young man from the Trinity with brass buttons came after him about a winch"—Maddigan's wife came afterwards and asked me if I saw anybody come to the door, and I told her—I saw no money paid—I was never in trouble in my life—I was never at Maidstone or Clerkenwell—I was never convicted.</p>

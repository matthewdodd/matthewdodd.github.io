            . I was sixteen years of age on the 5th of April last. My father was a shoemaker; I worked with him till he died, and then went to New Providence. On my return I was ill, and was confined in St. Bartholomew's Hospital. After that I went to sea, came home again, and went to St. Thomas's Hospital, which I left a fortnight before I was taken up. About the 3d or 4th of February, I was loitering about Charlotte-buildings, Gray's Inn-lane (it was about a week before I was taken), and I met a man named Lloyd - I had some conversation with him; the prisoner was not with him. I met him afterwards, and he proposed to introduced me to somebody. On the 26th of February he introduced me to the prisoner at the door of the Black Dog, public-house, Gray's Inn-lane. He said to the prisoner,</p>
               <p>"Here is a chap that will pass pap for you, and I know he is all right." The prisoner then said,</p>
               <p>"Very well, shall we have any thing to drink?" They said Yes. He took us into a public-house, and treated us with gin, (Lloyd, me, and two young women) - the prisoner gave me 1 s. to buy some victuals, and I went away. I did not like to go out that night.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you meet him again - A. I met Lloyd next day, by accident, Sunday, the 27th, in Holborn - he gave me 4 d. to pay for my lodging, and appointed to meet me at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120050"></xptr>Black Dog on Monday morning. I went there about nine o'clock, staid till eleven, then Lloyd came - some men who pass bad notes, came in afterwards; they were strangers to me. The same day, between five and six o'clock, the two young women whom I saw on Saturday night, went with me and Lloyd to St. Giles's - the young women went before, and Lloyd and I went after. We met the prisoner about Broad-street, and then went to a house in St. Giles's. Lloyd and the prisoner went up stairs, and told me to remain at the bottom; Lloyd came down, and told me to come up - (do not know the street or number, but I should know it if I saw it). I went up into the garret, and there saw the two young women, another girl, a man whom they called Mike, Lloyd, and the prisoner; the prisoner told me to stop till they came back - he and Lloyd went out immediately; I waited there, and they returned in about three-quarters of an hour. The prisoner pulled out five 1 l. Bank notes, and gave one to Mike. Lloyd got a pen and ink, wrote on the other four both back and front, and put them into my coat-pocket. He said,</p>
               <p>"Here are the notes, put your hand upon them" - the prisoner was in the room; I desired to look at the water-mark. The prisoner said there is a good water-mark on them, and nobody will tell them from good. I looked, and saw West Smithfield on one of them. The prisoner, Lloyd, and I left the house, and as we went along, Lloyd said,</p>
               <p>"You shall have 6 s. for each note you do for us," meaning the prisoner and him - we were all three in company. The prisoner said I should have some bottles. Lloyd said,</p>
               <p>"Here is a bottle shop;" the prisoner told him to go in and buy one or two. Lloyd went in, and bought a small bottle for me to put the rum into, and a pint and a half bottle for the prisoner to put it into as I came out with it. As we were going along, the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"This house I know, if they stop you they will let you go" - it was a public-house and wine-vaults. The prisoner told me to wait while Lloyd went and got the chaunt.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the chaunt - A. The direction of some neighbour's door. Lloyd brought me this direction,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Orton, No. 42, Devonshire-street, Red Lion-square, plumber and glazier." The prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"Go in there, (pointing to a wine-vaults), ask for three half-quarterns of rum, and give the chaunt which Lloyd gave to you."</p>
               <p>Q. Did you keep the four notes, or return them - A. I forgot to mention that I gave them back to Lloyd before he got the chaunt, and when he brought it he gave me one of the notes back. I went into the wine-vaults, kept by Mr. Clark, I believe, at the corner of a passage in Devonshire-street, Red Lion-square. I went in, asked for three half-quarterns of rum, and said, please to change a note for my master. The rum was put into the bottle, and I asked for change? He said he had not got change, and I then said I could not have the rum; he emptied it out, and I came away with the bottle and note, and told the prisoner and Lloyd, who were waiting for me at the door, that I could not get change. The prisoner pointed to the Turk's Head just by, and told me to ask for the same thing there, and give the same chaunt. I went in - there was a lady in the bar, and asked her for the rum, and to change a note for my master. She asked what direction? I said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Orton, No 42, Devonshire-street, plumber and glazier." She took the note, and gave me 19 s. 1 1/2 d in change. I came out, and Lloyd came to me and asked if I had the smash, (the money). I said I had - the prisoner was by - they always kept together, and outside. I gave the prisoner the change and rum, and told him he owed me 5 s., which with the 1 s. I owed him on Saturday night, would make the 6 s. for the note. He grumbled, and said,</p>
               <p>"What?" and on hearing him grumble, I said,</p>
               <p>"Nothing." Then we all three went up by another public-house, near Devonshire-street, close to Red Lion-square, and Lloyd gave me another 1 l. note. The prisoner told me to ask for the same quantity as before, and give the same chaunt. I went in - it was the Hole in the Wall; I saw a man and woman in the bar, the woman was sitting down. I asked for the rum and change, and gave the same name. The woman said she did not know any such a person, but the man said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, I do; he mended my pipe last week." They gave me 19 s. 1 1/2 d. in change; I came out, and gave the rum and change to the prisoner. We then went down into Red Lion-street, and Lloyd gave me a note; the prisoner told me to wait while Lloyd went and got a new chaunt. He brought me one, but I told him that was too hard a name, and I could not recollect it - he then brought me,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Brandt, watch and clock-maker" - I think it was Theobald's-road or street, and by Lloyd's direction I went into a wine-vaults in Red Lion-street (I don't recollect the name). I asked for three half-quarterns of rum as before, gave the note to a woman, and gave her that direction. She said,</p>
               <p>"I know Mr. Brandt, but I don't know you." I told her, as Lloyd had instructed me to say in case I should be questioned, that I had only come there that morning. She took the note, wrote the name on it, and gave me 19 s. 1 1/2 d. and the rum. I went away, and gave both the rum and change to the prisoner - they were both waiting outside; the prisoner always received the change, except once. He then said we must go down to Temple-bar - we all three went. Lloyd went and got a chaunt, and brought me, I think it was,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Hambler, boot and shoemaker, Water-street." I went into a public-house, in a street on the right hand side from Temple-bar, going down towards the water. I asked for the same quantity of rum, and change. He said he had got but 15 s., or else he would give my master change, without the note or the rum. I went away, and found Lloyd and the prisoner at the corner of the street. The prisoner pointed to a public-house in a passage, and told me to go in there. I went, and asked for liquor and change as before, and gave the same chaunt. The woman said,</p>
               <p>"Are you sure you are right?" I said Yes. She then gave me 19 s. 1 1/2 d. and the rum; I gave her the note, and left the house - Lloyd was at the door, but the prisoner was absent. He said,</p>
               <p>"There is somebody coming after us, let us run." We ran through Temple-bar, towards St. Paul's, and joined the prisoner in a court, I was going to give him the rum and change, but he said,</p>
               <p>"Give it to Lloyd, that is his note" - Lloyd took it from me, and I said he owed me 6 s. for it; he said,</p>
               <p>"Lend me this 6 s. for I want to get my top-boots tonight." I said I supposed he would pay me, and he said Yes. I asked the prisoner for the money for the three notes I had done for him? and he gave me 17 s., and 1 s. he lent me on Saturday night, made 18 s. We did nothing more that night. He agreed with Lloyd to bring another young man with him on Tuesday night, which was the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120051"></xptr>next night. Lloyd and I left the prisoner, and went to Gray's Inn-lane. Lloyd left me at the Black Dog.</p>
               <p>Q. On Tuesday, the 29th of February (the next night), did you meet them by appointment - A. Yes, between five and six o'clock, Lloyd, I, and a young man named Nicholls, went up to the same house in St. Giles's, and saw the prisoner there; he told me and Nicholls to wait till Lloyd and he came back, we did, they returned in about three-quarters of an hour, the prisoner came and pulled out eight notes, I am certain, if not nine - I saw him give one to Mike, who was there - he lived there with two young women, and a girl. Lloyd asked for a pen and ink and wrote on the eight notes, back and front. I saw him put them into a piece of brown paper - he then put them into my pocket and told me to put my hand on them. Lloyd told Nicholls and me to go to the corner of Fleet-market, at the Fleet-street end, and he and the prisoner would meet us there. We all four left the house. I and Nicholls went there, they went a different way; we found the prisoner and Lloyd on the spot they had appointed - they were there before us. Lloyd asked me for the eight notes, I gave them to him in the same paper, he gave Nicholls one, they went on towards St. Paul's, and Lloyd gave him a chaunt; he went into a wine-vaults, which Lloyd shewed him, and got change - we three waited at a little distance, not altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go to Castle-court - A. Yes; Lloyd gave me a chaunt,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Janson, Castle-court;" I went into the public-house, they told me to get Mr. Janson's name on it, for they did not know me, and stopped the bottle. I came out, and told the prisoner and Lloyd. the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"Never mind, come on, here is another bottle;" and gave me Nicholls's bottle. We all four went to Coleman-street, Lloyd gave me,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Johnson, Bell-alley," for a chaunt, and directed me to go to the Three Tuns, kept by Needham. I asked for three half-quarterns of rum, and, by mistake, I gave Johnson, Brad-alley. The lady gave me change, and desired me to look at it before I left the bar, as she would not change it after. I came out - as we were going on to Mr. Morris's, Nicholls left us. I gave the change and the rum to the prisoner. As we went along we stopped, and I said there is somebody touting us (which means watching). The prisoner told me to wait a bit, and Lloyd went and looked at the man, who was an officer; he then seemed to go away, and the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"Now go."</p>
               <p>Q. To where were you to go - A. To Morris's, the Blue Anchor. Lloyd had given me a 1 l. note out of the eight, between Needham's and there. I went into Morris's, and gave the name of</p>
               <p>"Johnson, Brad-alley;" and asked for the same quantity of liquor. Morris asked me several questions, where Brad-alley was, and if it was in Coleman-street - I said Yes, for I did not know where it was. He was writing on the note when the officer came in and collared me, before I got the change. He asked what I was doing, and took me into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner soon afterwards taken - A. As we went along the prisoner and Lloyd came to rescue me; they had told me before, that they would rescue me if I was taken - they came round, followed us, and came in front of the officer. I supposed they wanted to rescue me. The officer told another man to take me into the public-house - I went in quietly - the officer ran out, and brought the prisoner in. That is all I have to say.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner was taken, was anything said - A. The officer said to me, Do you know this man? I was going to say Yes, but before I could get the word out, he knocked his hand down, and said,</p>
               <p>"By G - d, you don't know me!" and then I said No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Have you no other name but Richard Hill - A. None, except what the boys in Gray's Inn-lane gave me. I had no home. I returned from sea three months before I was taken, and was two months and a fortnight in St. Thomas's Hospital; and for the other fortnight I lodged in Field-lane. I loitered about Charlotte-buildings, because I had nothing to do, and I must own I was obliged to pilfer and do other things. I have a father-in-law, a shoemaker, at Bradford, in Wiltshire, his name is

               <p>Q. What was the first ship you went to sea in - A. The brig Junius, Mr. Miller was the captain; I left him at New Providence, and worked my passage home in the brig Swan. I have had no employ on shore.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you lived by thieving - A. Sometimes I have opened the hackney-coaches for people, and other times pilfered meat to eat.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been a prisoner - A. Yes, three months ago I was in this very prison for stealing a piece of bacon - the Court had mercy on me. I was taken up once on suspicion. I have been in custody three times including this time, and no more.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you promised mercy, on condition of being a witness - A. About a week after I was taken. I was told to tell the truth, and I thought it best to tell the truth. I wrote on a paper what had passed between me and the prisoner, and when the gentleman of the Bank came I shewed it to him; he asked me some questions about it, and wrote down what I said. I have thought it best to tell the truth, and I hope I shall get a ship and go to sea, for I have had my life threatened by a parcel of rascals in the prison.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you call yourself a rascal - A. Yes, I am a very bad boy. They threatened to stick a piece of steel into me, and I can call them nothing else but rascals.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know what pap was before you knew the prisoner - A. No, I learnt all the slang when I was in the Old Bailey, of course I was not here three months without hearing these things.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you write down all the chaunts they gave you - A. No, I went and shewed the officer the houses, and that called it to my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you get the clothes you have on to-day - A. With a little money the Bank allowed me for victuals, I lived on the gaol allowance, and bought the clothes with the money.</p>
               <p>MR. REYNOLDS. Q. What did the turnkey give you - A. Ten shillings a week. I was destitute of employ, and had no friend to apply to.</p>

He came for three half-quarterns of rum, I or my wife served him, we were both in the bar; the rum was put into a small black bottle of his, it came to 9 d., he gave me a 1 l. Bank note.

               <p>"From Mr. Orton, plumber and glazier, Devonshire-street." My wife was not agreeable to give change, and I said Orton had mended a water-pipe for me. I gave him the change, and marked the note directly - it might be in his presence - (looks at one) - this is it; it has</p>

               <p>"Mr. Brandt, watch and clock-maker, Theobald's-road," which I wrote on it immediately, and told him I knew Mr. and Mrs. Brandt, but did not know him. He said he had not lived there long. I gave him 19 s. 1 1/2 d. change - (looks at a note) - this is it. I wrote</p>

I remember a lad coming to my house at the latter end of February; I think the witness is the boy, but he was differently dressed. He brought a bottle, and asked for three half-quarterns of rum. I put it into the bottle - he tendered me a 1 l. note, I said I could not give him change, for I did not know him. He said he came from Mr. Hambler, No. 2, Water-street, boot and shoemaker - I knew him very well, and it induced me to take the note. I marked it, and told my wife to give him the change, which she did, reluctantly - (looks at one) - this is it; it has that on it in my writing.</p>

            . I am a City constable. On the 29th of February, about ten minutes or a quarter before nine o'clock in the evening, I was in Coleman-street, and saw the prisoner and another young man standing opposite the Blue Anchor. I saw Hill standing by himself at the gateway adjoining the public-house - I suspected them. The other man came up, looked me full in the face, and I went away up the street sixty or seventy yards, then crossed over, came down on the opposite side, and took my station in Bishop's-court, directly opposite to where I stood before, they could not observe me. They remained there; the boy had crossed over to them, and was in conversation with them for about five minutes; he then ran across into the public-house, a hackney-coach was just passing at the time. I ran, keeping the coach between me and the men, and went into the public-house. The boy was at the bar, Morris had the note and pen in his hand. In consequence of what he said, I took the boy into custody. Morris gave me the note, I desired him to notice it, and I marked it in his presence with my initials - (looks at one) - this is in. I found a bottle standing on the bar, and brought it away. I found nothing on the boy. Before I left the house I got Wright to assist me. In our way to the Compter with the boy, I went into White Rose-court, and when I got to the end I met the prisoner and the other man; they must have gone down London-wall, and up Basinghall-street. When they saw me they fluttered and fell back - I had the boy by my side. When I got opposite to the Bell, public-house, which is about fifteen yards from the court, the prisoner was not two yards behind me. I said to Wright,</p>
               <p>"Take care of this boy while I apprehend this party" - the prisoner must have heard me. Directly as I spoke, the prisoner and the other took to their heels, and went down White Rose-court - I cried out Stop thief! and kept them both in sight. I came up to the prisoner and collared him, the other was a-head and got away. I said to the prisoner I want you!" he said</p>
               <p>"No, it is the other man you want." I took him into the Bell, where the boy was, and said to the boy</p>
               <p>"You know this man very well." He seemed anxious to answer me, but the prisoner knocked his fist down and said,</p>
               <p>"By G - d! you don't me, do you?" the boy said,</p>
               <p>"No, I don't." I searched the prisoner, and found 3 l. 9 s. 6 d. in silver and 1 s. 5 d. in copper<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120053"></xptr>all good money. I asked him his residence? he said he did not choose to tell me. I never learnt where he did live.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Hill was a stranger to you - A. Yes. I had no communication with him before I took him. I saw the prisoner before I went into the house. I do not think he knew me.</p>

I had occasion to go to Fore-street, and saw the prisoner, another man, and a lad, standing opposite the Blue Anchor door. I returned in about five minutes, they were then gone from where I saw them. I went into the Blue Anchor, and saw the boy, Morris, and the officer. I knew him to be the same boy I had seen with the prisoner. Hughes applied to me to assist in taking him, and I went with him through White Rose-court, into Basinghall-street. Two men followed a little after us, about six yards behind. When we came within six yards of the Bell, the officer turned round and said,</p>
               <p>"This is the man I want" - (they might hear him) - he left the boy in my charge. They instantly turned back and ran away.

                  </hi>. I am a tailor of 5, King-street, Hammersmith—a gen<lb></lb>tleman, named Edmunds, has for some years past been an occasional cus<lb></lb>tomer of mine—last April the prisoner came, and said, "I want a coat"—I showed him some pieces of goods, and he said, "This one will do;" a tweed, I believe he has it on now—I told him it would be 33<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for cash; he said, "Very well"—he said that he was servant to Mr. Edmunds, of Crab Tree—that is not a public-house, it is a local district—he said, "I am superintending an estate belonging to Mr. Edmunds, which he has purr chased at Willesden; I have a great deal to do in managing matters for him"—I took his measure, and got the coat ready to try on on the follow<lb></lb>ing Wednesday, when he called, tried it on, and arranged to call for it on Friday—he came on Friday, and said, "I have no time to stop to settle for it now, I have to go to Willesden; I have a number of men fencing in to pay, and must go and look after them, you know nobody will look after them like yourself, and I shall be very much obliged if you will send it down home for me," handing me a card, and I thought from that that he was a respectable man, and a housekeeper, I sent the coat home on the representation that he was servant to Mr. Edmunds, and was managing the estate, and had to go and superintend the men—he said, "You know that</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said just now distinctly, that you let him have it because he fixed a day for paying for it; have I made a mistake or you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I let him have it on his representations—it was because he said that he was servant to Mr. Edmund's, and was employed to layout the estate at Willesden.</p>

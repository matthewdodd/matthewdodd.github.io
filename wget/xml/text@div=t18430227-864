                  </hi>. I am shopman to Robert Roberts, a tobacconist, St. John-street. On the 11th of Feb., between eleven and twelve o'clock, the prisoner came to the shop and handed me this order for tobacco—he said he had brought it from Fletcher and Tomlins, of Barnet (who are regular customers of ours), and wanted to know at what time it would be ready and he would call for it—I said in about an hour and a half—he said he bad not had his breakfast, could I tell him of a coffee-shop—that he had come all the way from Barnet that morning, and had had nothing—I told him there was one close by—after he left the shop one or two parties came in, and my suspicion was created—I went to him to the coffee-shop, and said the order was ready—he came over with me—my object was to show him to the parties—he did not say anything when he came over—I did not deliver the goods to him—this is the paper he brought—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Mr. Roberts, St. John-street. Please send by bearer 1/4 cwt. super shag, 7lbs. negrohead, 7lbs. bogie-roll, for Fletcher and Tomlins, Barnet."</p>

                  </hi>. I am employed in Mr. Roberts's shop—I was not present when this order was delivered, but saw Roberts bring the prisoner in—I said I would send the goods to the Rainbow, which he said was opposite Islington workhouse—I followed him from the shop—he should have gone straight up St. John-street to go to Islington, but he dodged me by going round the coach-stand to avoid me, turned up Percival-street to John's-row, and turned into Ironmonger-row, which is towards the City again—I stopped him there, and asked where we were to send the goods he had ordered for Fletcher and Tomlins, of Barnet—he said, "I have not been giving any order at all, I have not been near your house"—I told him where our house was—I bad seen him go out of the shop, and followed till I gave him in charge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 11th of Feb. Fenton directed my attention to the prisoner in Goswell-street—he was not going in the way from St. John-street to Islington—he went up Wellington-street and down Ironmonger-row—I then took him into custody—Fenton asked him where the goods were to be sent—he said he was not the person who had been to Roberts's.</p>

On the 4th of June I had reason to suspect the prisoner, and between one and two o'clock I watched him as he came into the warehouse, I happened to be up stairs, he did not know that I was up stairs, but from up stairs I could see him in the lower warehouse, I see him after he had been a little while in the warehouse, stoop down and lay hold of two pieces of cast iron, that we call back<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010157"></xptr>legs, and put in his great coat pocket, but he was disturbed by some of the men, and he threw that down; my foreman was coming up stairs to tell me, who had seen him as well as myself; I came down stairs; the prisoner bespoke a set of pantheon stove metal, it was put into the scale and weighed; he was a customer of mine, sometimes he has laid our four or five guineas a week. The foreman asked him if he wanted any back legs; he said no; the metal was weighed for him, and brought into the counting-house, I reckoned it up what it came to, and he had not money sufficient to pay me, and he wanted it on credit, and I refused it on credit, because he owed me three shillings and sixpence before, and I could not let him have any more till that was paid; after a great argument to get me to consent to give credit for the metal, he went out into the street, and my foreman and I followed, and my foreman stopped him, and took this pair of back legs out of his pocket; I went for a constable, and when I had been for a constable my man had been to his house, and brought the fronts back.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. How long has he been a customer of your's? - Ever since I have been in business almost, since Christmas.</p>
               <p>Q. You refused to trust him because he owed you three shillings and sixpence before.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the value of this? - About five-pence, I should not have charged him but six-pence if I had sold them to him, but I have lost things of greater value, which I have reason to suspect he took them.</p>

I said no, I will not any more, then says he, I must leave it; he went out of doors and I went after him about fifteen or twenty yards, and I said, what have you got in your pocket more than you should have? he said, nothing; I felt his left hand pocket, and there was nothing in that, and I felt in his right hand pocket, and there was the back legs that I see him put in.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You sussered him to go out of the warehouse? - I did, because I had heard people say, that you cannot take people till they are out of your house.</p>

(a woman driving it) she said she bought it; I asked her where? she said, in the road; I asked her how long since? she said three months since; I told her it was my property, and therefore it was necessary that we should find a justice of peace, that I might have it.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a carpenter, at Wetstone, in Finchley parish, near Barnet, in Middlesex.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know about the jack ass belonging to Mr. Nash? - I see the prisoner at the bar on it, Brackley, in Page-street, Hendon, on the 26th of March, soon after nine o'clock in the morning; they were driving some more asses to bring them to London.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the other man doing? - He was on another ass by the side of him. They were driving three more asses before them; I had seen the prisoners before. I keep milking asses myself, and that made me take particular notice of them. They wanted me to buy a mare ass of them, but we did not deal.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time did you at all know Nash? - Not at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What was there singular about the ass, was it a mare ass or a jack ass? - A jack ass, but cut. It was remarkable by being very high, and by being cut, which made me know him again, and his tail being cut, and I took particular notice of it as I could, expecting them to be stole.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen it since that time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see it afterwards? - Last Wednesday evening, a week before yesterday.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see this ass? - At my own door; Mr. Nash brought it to me to know whether it was the ass that I see this man upon.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you veature to swear that you made observation enough to be positive? - Quite certain.</p>
               <p>Q.That is the one that you see Brackley upon? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Was this offered to sell with the mare ass? - No, only the mare ass. I did not offer to buy that, I did not want such a thing as that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where Mr. Nash lives? - In the country in Buckinghamshire, somewhere near Wickham-common.</p>
               <p>Q. How far may that be from where you saw the man? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Nash. I suppose it may be upwards of thirty miles from where I found it.</p>
               <p>Q. I mean the place where the prisoner was seen on this ass, offering it to sell? - That I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen it, before you lost it? - The 24th.</p>

             I was coming up to sell five asses that I had got then; I had got one that was rather heavy in foal; as I was coming along, this man see me, and he asked me the price of it; I told him, and we could not agree. With that I came and brought them all up to Smithfield, all of them, and I sold it to a man whom I could have got to prove that he bought the ass of me that day, in Smithfield, but I thought I should have been tried in the country, and that is the reason that I have no witnesses here now. I used to drive asses with earthen-ware. My father bought it in Smithfield for my purpose.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Cogdal. I know nothing about it, it was his ass for any thing I knew; I was coming up to Smithfield to buy me a horse; therefore I was walking along after him.</p>
               <p>Court to Ivory. Were these men in company together? - They were in company together, and both stopped together, and I talked to them both about dealing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200043"></xptr>as though they belonged to one another, for the space of a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they both offer to sell? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure that where these asses were offered to sell, was in the county of Middlesex? - It was in the parish of Hendon, and Hendon and Millhill is in Middlesex.</p>
               <p>Jury to Nash. Do you know either of the prisoners at the bar? - I know then both very well; John Cogdal used to drive five or six asses with a waggon and a horse behind them; and the other used to sell earthen ware, loaded on asses.</p>
               <p>Q.What is the value of it? - I gave two guineas for it; I have been offered a guinea and a half for it since.</p>
               <p>Both <rs id="t17950520-23-verdict134" type="verdictDescription">

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not remember having any special conversation with Bell in reference to Mrs. Watt—I don't think I-have any document in Bell's handwriting showing how he made up the amount we gave a receipt for—I have the entries in this book—I appropriate in my mind the amount of entries that make up that sum.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. Unless I appropriate that receipt I have mentioned he has not accounted for those amounts.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I believe all those were marked in red—Bell did not mark those making the 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; he had not left at that time—I received these amounts from him personally—I may have seen him once or twice after I left; I don't think I did at the office; I am not quite sure—I never called his attention to Mrs. Watt's name—he said the 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was in respect of certain loans marked down here; he told me the names—he did not account to mo from time to time after that; I was only secretary about</p>

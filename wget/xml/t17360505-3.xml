            . The Time mentioned in the Indictment, my Servant and I were at Work in the Bake-house; I sent him into the Yard for something, and hearing him cry out, I took up a long Pole and ran to the Door; this was about two o'Clock in the Morning; I had no sooner got to the Door, but a Man fired a Pistol at me, and wounded me in my Arm and Breast. A Second fir'd and wounded me in the Face, and beat me backwards. Then I saw three Persons, they took me in their Arms, unbottoned my Breeches, took out my Money, and laid me down; they brought my Man into the Bake-house, tied his Handkerchief over his Eyes, his Hands behind him, and sat him down by me. The Prisoner stood over me, swearing with horrid Oaths, if I spoke a Word, he would blow my Brains out, while the others got Candles and robb'd the House. They took many more Things than are mentioned in the Indictment; all that I had that was Valuable they took with them. The Prisoner was taken at Bridgewater in Somersetshire, and made a Confession before the Mayor and Alderman. One of the Rogues had been my Servant, and, I suppose, he was the Director in the Affair; the Prisoner I am positive was the Man that stood over me; I can't say whether they broke any Lock to get in; I believe they got over the Wall that is next the Fields, but they broke several Locks in the House to get the Goods.</p>

               <p>Q When you went out of the House into the Yard, did you shut the Door after you?</p>
               <p>Bird. I don't remember whether I did or not. The Lock of the Yard Door was not broke, but they broke several Locks in the House, particularly, the Lock of a Chest of Drawers, and some large Locks on the Doors of the Rooms. <rs id="t17360505-3-verdict24" type="verdictDescription">

            . The prisoner came in at our house 9 at night; he had a pint of beer, and three halfpeny worth of bread and cheese was all he had. He went away between four and five in the morning, and never paid for his beer and bread and cheese. I saw him go out, but a chairman told me he had got something under his coat. I went out, and took him about six or seven yards from the door. with the tankard upon him [Produced in court, and deposed to by prosecutor.]</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did he carry the tankard?</p>
               <p>Davis. He had his hand through the folds of his coat, and the tankard under the coat in his hand. I asked him why he went away with the tankard in that manner? he said, he was going to fetch some water; he would not deliver it to me till I called Stop thief, then assistance came.</p>

I came from Ireland, and have not been here long; I am but 35 years of age.</p>

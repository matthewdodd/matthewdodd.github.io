            . I am an officer. On Monday the 14th of March, from information, I found the prisoner in an alley adjoining Essex street, Whitechapel; I searched her and found a duplicate upon her. I questioned her how she came to have it, she said she was in liquor; I went to the pawnbroker, and ordered him to attend the office.</p>
               <p>- NEED. I am journeyman to Mr. Christie, 59, Lower East Smithfield. On Saturday evening the 12th of March, about nine o'clock, the prisoner brought this saddle and bridle to pawn, she said she brought it from her master, Dr. Fisher, at Wapping; I lent her a guinea and a half upon them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in her defence, nor called any witness to character.</p>

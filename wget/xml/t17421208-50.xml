            . I did not lose any Thing; the Feather-Bed and Bolster were taken off the Bedstead and tied up in the Curtain. They were moved, as I apprehend, with a Design to be taken away, the third of November, between five and six in the Evening : The Room was locked when I went out in the Morning; and when I came Home, the Padlock of the outward Door was picked. I was drinking a Pot of Beer below, and was informed of it by the Maid. It is a Publick House, and this Apartment is let to me; I went up Stairs, and found the Prisoner in my Room; he enquired for one Williams a Watchmaker, but no such Person lived there. I took him by the Collar, and left him in Custody of some of the People in the Yard till I got a Constable.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was very ill; I had a Stick in my Hand , and could hardly walk .</p>

             . The Prosecutor has a Part of my House. I undid the Bed, and found this Poker which he had bought but a Quarter of an Hour before of Mr Marsh , as he told me; it is a proper Instrument to break open a Padlock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him if he thinks I am able to carry that away.</p>
               <p>Taylor . It is not so large, but any Body might carry it. He looked pale but not sick.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is a common Sort of a Passage, and an Alehouse; so I went in to inquire if one Mr Williams lived there; Mr Taylor was below Stairs , and asked who was there. I said , I am glad you are come, I wanted to ask you a Question, but he immediately secured me.</p>

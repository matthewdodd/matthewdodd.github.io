                  </hi>. I am a jeweller, and live in Southampton-row, Rus<lb></lb>sell-square; I also carry on business in Holborn, in partnership with my brother. I know both the prisoners, one by the name of Wilson, and the other by the name of Lilly—in December last Lilly came into my shop in Southampton-row, and asked if I would purchase a ring—he produced this ring to me—(<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—it was a very foggy day—I asked what he wanted for it—he said it cost him, or the person who gave it him, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in India—I immediately gave it him back and said, "It is not worth half the money to us"—he said he was a tailor, that he was in very great distress, and had to make up a payment that morning, or he would not part with it, as it was given him by a particular friend—would I give him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I said it would not suit me at any thing like the price, it was only valuable to me to break up for the stone and the gold—I at last said, I would give him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, which I did—he said he did not like to part with the ring, but would I lend him the 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he would come back and redeem it, but he has never been—I do not think he told me his address—this ring purports to be an Indian ring of rude manufacture, as they make them in India of very pure gold, but clumsily made, and the stones roughly cut—it is made to</p>

               <p>imitate a ring of that description—it has all the appearance that a genuine Indian ring would possess—if the gold was genuine it would realize me from 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., not more—it is a base composition, made with a peculiar alloy, which stands the test of aquafortis, on being rubbed on a touch-stone—I have not had this assayed, but I hare had some assayed, which I believe to be of the same quality, and that turns out to be about 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce—therefore this ring would be under 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it is intended to represent standard gold, worth 78<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce—the things which appear to be stones are two pieces of crystal, called doublets—when a stone is set without foil behind it, it is one criterion of its being a genuine stone, and shows that it is fine—these two pieces of crystal are cut very flat, the horizontal parts are brought together, and the colouring put between them to imitate the real thing—these stones are worth 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each—altogether the ring is worth 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on the 21st of July last I was in my shop in Hol<lb></lb>born—the prisoner Wilson dame there and inquired if I bought jewellery—I said, "Yes,"—he produced these twin pins stuck in a piece of paper—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—one is now broken—it was cut by direction of Mr. Alderman Pirie, for the purpose of assaying—one of these imitates the opal, the other a ruby—immediately he gave them to me I recognized them to be of the same description as the ring, and of the description also which I had been cautioned against—they are made to represent standard gold, worth 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce at least—I said, "What do you want for these?"—he said, "They cost me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I asked what he wanted—he said 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said, "Are they gold?" or "What are they?" one or the other—he said, "Yes, they are gold"—I said, "Are they real stones?"—he said, "Yes, they are rail stones"—I laid, "What is your name?"—he said, "Wilson"—I said, "You are a <hi rend="italic">duffer</hi>" (which is a term in the trade applied to persons who make spurious goods,) "and your name is Walker, you have made these things on purpose to rob me, as some of your gang have before"—he said I was a liar—I told him if he made use of that kind of language I would kick him out of the shop—he said, "Well, you are a liar, and you may try them"—I then took the touch-stone, and was rubbing them sharply upon it, when he came with his clenched fist and threatened violence towards me—I told him that if he made use of any threat in my shop I would knock him down—he opened the door and began calling me a swindler and many other bad names, and said I had robbed him of his pins—I had not then said I should not return them—he eventually went away from my shop, and I kept the pins—I told him I would keep them and show them, and take them before a Magistrate—about five minutes after he was gone, I went out to look where he went to—I went to the corner of Castle-street, which is four doors from my house, and saw him in conversation with the prisoner Lilly—Lilly came up to me and asked why I had stopped the pins—I said, "Because it was a <hi rend="italic">duffer</hi>"—he then said if I called him a <hi rend="italic">duffer,</hi> as I had called his friend, he would roll me in the mud—he then said he would <hi rend="italic">punch</hi> my head—I said, I was sure he would not, but if he annoyed me in the street, I would give him in charge of the police—he dared me to do it—there was an altercation—I said if I bad done wrong I was open to the law, but it was my intention to take the pins to the Magis<lb></lb>trate—I then walked back to my shop—they followed me—an assembly of people was collected by the noise they made outside my shop-door, which continued about five, seven, or ten minutes—I obtained a policeman on my way from Castle-street to my own door—I said to them, "If you cause</p>

               <p>any disturbance here I will send you off to the Computer"—Lilly said if I did, it would be the worst day's work I had ever done—the noise and dis<lb></lb>turbance continued till I was obliged to give them in charge—I should say there were from thirty to forty or fifty persons there—there was a mob completely round the house—these pins are of the same description as the ring—I have had them assayed—they can be made for about 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the two—the stones are only doublets—the opal is glass, and the ruby a piece of crystal—they are of a base composition, in which there is a small portion of gold—it is made to imitate standard gold—such things are never made in the trade under any circumstances.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PREDERGAST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I take it for granted you do not sell any articles in your shop for gold, which are not gold? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Cer<lb></lb>tainly not—I do not profess to mark things gold which are not gold—I swear that positively—I do not sell any articles for gold which contain less gold than those produced, not for solid gold—these are sold for solid gold—there are many descriptions of gold articles—in the composition of these pins there are four carats, or four 24th parts of gold, and twenty parts of alloy, a composition which is never made up for legitimate trade—these have been assayed by Johnson and Cock, of Hatton-garden—I be<lb></lb>lieve they are here, subpoenaed on the other side—they have reported the result of the assay—what I know about the pins is from what they have stated, nothing else—there have been three assays made—I can of my own knowledge tell within a trifle what proportion of gold there is in this ring, from rubbing it on a stone, and trying it with aquafortis, although I cannot say to the exact proportion—I was of opinion that there was no portion of gold at all in it, from the fact of its being gilt, but I have con<lb></lb>vinced myself that there is gold in it, by a trial on the touch-stone, which is the usual way with jewellers—I found that out previous to the assay, and previous to going to Guildhall—I had never seen Wilson before the 21st of July—the mob were laughing and making a noise—they did not attack me, but they made a disturbance—he was representing that I had stolen his pins, and wanted the policemen to take charge of me—the police<lb></lb>men were not called by him—I called them, because he was threatening violence towards me, because I would not give up the pins—I have known a person named Cullingford within this week—I never told him that I should not have given the prisoners into custody, only I thought they would have brought an action against me, nothing of the sort—I knew it was their intention to have brought an action against me, as they have done against a great many others on similar occasions—supposing these pins to be genuine, they would be worth full 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or from that to 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., according to the value of the stones—I was not going to give any price for them—he asked me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I looked at them to ascertain their value—precious stones vary greatly in price—supposing these to be genuine, I should sell them at 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they certainly would not be worth ten gui<lb></lb>neas—the weight of gold would be comparatively small—the stones would be the valuable part—the gold, supposing it to be solid, would be worth about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was never in a court of justice as an offender—I was never at Guildhall charged with setting a dog on a person, nor any thing of the sort.</p>

               <p>Birmingham ware—I should say none of these things are made at Bir<lb></lb>mingham—rings are made there to imitate stones, but certainly not to imi<lb></lb>tate Indian gold—no ring of this description is made for the trade—the part of this ring which purports to be gold is in the same state as when I received it—it most decidedly represents the standard Indian gold—this is the exact colour of Indian gold—Indian gold is twenty carats fine, or even more than that—it is almost pure, that is, twenty-four carats of gold and no alloy at all in it—I have been a jeweller all my life time—I have not worked with my own hands, but I have constantly been in it from childhood—I took out these stones from the ring, and put them in again myself—I gave 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I have never offered to sell it—I should have broken it up, and had the stones reset and remounted—I should say I have not seen rings in shops marked "real stones" which are not real—I do not think there is any such thing—I sell every thing pertaining to silver and jewel<lb></lb>lery—the seal and fancy trade has very much altered of late years for the better—gold used for manufacture is better now than it was twenty years ago, when I first knew the trade—gold was of a red colour, and then there was more alloy—it has varied according to fancy or fashion, but has never been under twelve carats fine.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Boot-street. I have known Lilly ever since the latter end of 1834, and Wilson between two and three years—Lilly is a tailor, and Wilson, I believe, has been a gentleman's servant—Lilly has very often employed me to pawn clothes and jewellery for him—the clothes were manufactured by him, and the jewellery by a man named Walker—Lilly told me they were manufactured for the purpose of pledging or selling at a profit—Lilly directed me when I pawned things to give an address as near to the pawnbroker's shop as possible—I was employed by Lilly till about May last—both he and I knew that the jewellery articles were not genuine—he stated so to me—on the first occasion of my pawl<lb></lb>ing for them, at the latter end of 1839, I met Lilly at Walker's, accident<lb></lb>ally, and they proposed I should endeavour to pledge a suit of clothes and a ring, which I was to call a ruby, but they told me it was not rubies, but <hi rend="italic">doublets</hi>—in case I was asked if it was rubies, I was to say yes, and that the ring cost six guineas—I was at all times to represent the articles as genuine, and as having cost a great deal of money, in case the question was asked—I should say I was successful in passing off these articles to pawnbrokers in about fifty or sixty instances—the sum I got depended on the article—I generally pledged, not sold—4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the highest I got for any article—I always paid the money to Lilly—the six guinea ring Lilly told me cost 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he directed me to get as much as I could on it—that was pawned along with other articles, but I suppose it realised 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had some money for my trouble—I pawned the first suit of clothes and the ring at Mr. Barker's, in Houndsditch, for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Lilly was outside the door when I went into the shop, and Walker along with him—I gave the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Lilly—I think he gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he told me, if I was asked what the ring was made of, to say it was rubies, and to call the metal gold—Barker did not ask anything about it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the ring produced by Mr. Simmonds</hi>)—I have seen this ring before, or one similar to it—they were charged 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

               <p>for it—this is not the ring I was to pass off as a six guinea one—this is the one—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—this was in the lot I got 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on—when I took the second lot, I was to say I had redeemed the lot on Saturday night, and that was the same, I was bringing back again—it was a facsimile of the first lot, but not the same—after I had succeeded in these things, Lilly said it was well done—I have heard him talk of poor Tomlinson, and say that he stopped some of his goods, and he brought an action against him, and ran it on to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I know of Lilly selling pins to Messrs. Bradley, Campbell, Allport, Glanville, and D——I saw them all before he sold them—they were spurious pins—I saw him go into the shops to sell them, and he afterwards told me he had sold them—I never spoke to Wilson about this business.</p>

               <p>---- <hi rend="smallCaps">MANNING</hi>. I am a jeweller, and live in Regent-street. About six months ago, or not quite so much, the prisoner Wilson came to my shop with three studs, which he represented to be gold—I did not try them, but from their appearance I should say they were not gold—I said, my young man had bought a pin of a person, who I supposed was the same party, and I asked him where he came from—he said from Lincoln, and that his master had made him a present of them—I said, "If I ever see you in my shop again, I shall charge the police with you"—he left the shop—about a fortnight or three weeks after, he came again in company with a short stout man who I cannot swear to, but he was about the same height as Lilly—Wilson came with his face close to the door, and the other man came up—I saw Wilson's face directly, and followed them close up Regent-street, but when Wilson saw me, they turned down Argyle-street, and I missed them all at once—he put his head into my shop as much as to say, "That is the shop" or something.</p>
               <p>---- <hi rend="smallCaps">DELLER</hi>. I am a pawnbroker in Long-acre. On the 21st of October, 1839, Lilly pledged a bar of gold at our place for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he repre<lb></lb>sented it as 52<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. gold—he said he was a jeweller, that he had taken it to a neighbouring pawnbroker's, who had offered him nearly what he asked, and on those representations I lent him the sum he asked—it has not been assayed, but in my judgment it is worth about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce—there was about 2 1/2 oz.—about four months after, he came again, and pawned some jewellery—I cannot now ascertain what it was—I said, "You are the party who pawned the bar of gold about four months ago"—he said, "Yes, I am, I shall have it out shortly"—the year expired last Sunday.</p>

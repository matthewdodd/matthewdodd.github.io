I had still hold of my watch chain, we had a struggle, she broke the watch away from the chain, I had my hand upon it in my pocket or fob, and she pulled my hand out, in which I held the watch: the watch separated from the chain at the swivel by which it hung to the chain; she did not take the chain. The constable has the watch. I lost three shillings; the constable came up, I discovered I had lost my handkerchief, he secured her. I believe the watch was found upon her, it was in the evening.</p>

I could not see it till I moved her. The prosecutor said I have been robbed; I desired him to wipe his face, it was bloody. My nephew said, here is the watch, uncle.</p>

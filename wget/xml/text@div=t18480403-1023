On Monday, 26th March, I was at the Hoxton police-station—a young woman was brought there on some charge—when she was there the prisoner came into the station and there was some interference on his part, and he was taken into custody—he was searched—I found a crown-piece in his right-hand pocket, and a sixpence—I gave them to the inspector, who put on the desk—in four or five minutes the inspector called me, and told me the crown was bad—I put a mark on it, and so did he—I told the prisoner it was bad—he said nothing—it has been in my possession ever since.</p>

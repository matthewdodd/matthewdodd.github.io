On the next day I saw him before the Justice; I know it to be mine.</p>

            . I live on Finchley Common. I was making a garden. I observed the prisoner walking about a hay-rick; then Joe Woodward frightened the fowls up to the Common. I saw the prisoner part the bushes with his feet, and sprinkle something to the fowls. I saw him stoop, as if a man was snatching up a fowl. I had suspicion of that. He was taken, and brought to the Bald Face Stag. He had two fowls found upon him.</p>
               <p>- FROST. I am a constable. I took charge of the prisoner, and the fowls. Mrs. Schofield saw the cock in the evening; she said it was her fowl. I searched the prisoner. I found a bag with some wheat in it and bread.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Monday, the 30th of November, I went to Finchley; I was told there were some new buildings going on there. I was out of employ. I went to get work. I saw two cocks fighting; I took them up, I do not deny. One was nearly killed. I had no intention of committing a felony. I hope you will decide a favourable punishment.</p>

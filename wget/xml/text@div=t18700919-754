Please write on to Portree, Skye, in direct course of post, stating what you intend to do in the matter, and tell me if you can insure a few hundred pounds upon her, for the passage, and at what rate also the freight. You are not to leave port till you hear from me, and till you know that the ship is insured"—<hi rend="italic">no signature</hi>);—("16th December, 1869.

               <p>—we had some dispute, and I was discharged—he discharged me after knowing that he was in my power, and even then I did not communicate it till the vessel was actually lost—I went direct home to South Shields, where I came from before I went into the ship—I relieved M'Kenzie of the command, a policeman advised him to leave the ship—the policeman was called because he was making some bother—he was not there previous to that as my friend—I never saw M'Kenzie in my life till I saw him in the ship—he came on board in spite of me—I got into trouble about a mutiny in March, 1867—a complaint was made against me that I had induced the crew to mutiny—I was not punished for it, nor the crew either—justice was not done—we were not sent home as a mutinous crew at Carthaginian; we were sent home as passengers—I made complaints also—I have not been unlucky, but I had the misfortune to sail with a blackguard—I waited three weeks at the sailor's home, and then received a letter stating that the case was dismissed—we were not sent home in custody, or with direction to be taken in custody, and try us when we arrived, it is the first I have heard of it—I was taken out of the <hi rend="italic">Lord Seaton,</hi> not by a Spanish vessel, but the crew left her voluntarily—I was taken by carabineers to the gaol at Carthagena—there was no mutiny going on, but we objected to sail further with the captain—the police vessel took us out of the ship, and to gaol, and we were taken before the Consul, and sent home, I and eleven of the crew—I had a claim against the owner when I left—there was a dispute between us—notwithstanding Gillies had put himself into my power he discharged me and appointed another captain.</p>

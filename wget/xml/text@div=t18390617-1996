                  </hi>. I live at Merton, and am a farmer. I had thirteen trusses of hay in my barn on the 13th of May, bound, ready to go out—on the 14th, I missed two trusses—I saw them afterwards, but they were made into three bundles—I know it by the rye-straw bands, which is a very unusual thing, round the bundles, but in my barn they were in trusses—I am quite sure it is my hay.</p>

I saw Remnant on the 14th of May at my skittle-ground—I saw some hay there—there were several other persons there—I did not see any thing done to the hay by any body—I said nothing to Remnant—I saw Allison, a man not in cus<lb></lb>tody—I asked him whose hay that was—he said, "It is mine"—there were three bundles—he said, "I have got it for the races"—I said, "I don't care what you have got it for, take it off my premises"—I afterwards saw Allison and Remnant with the bundles, each going in front of the house—I saw a third man, but I do not know whether it was Cook or not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable at Merton. I apprehended Cook on the 19th of May—on the morning of the 20th, (I did not make any promises nor ask any questions) he told me, in going from the watch-house to Wandsworth, that he, and Allison, and Remnant went to Mr. Rayne's barn and fetched two trusses of hay, and when they were going to a beer-shop, he would not take it any further, but had no more to do with it—another man took Remnant.</p>

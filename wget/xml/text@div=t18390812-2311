                  </hi>. I am a porter at Covent-garden-market. On the 11th of July I was under the portico of Drury-lane theatre about five o'clock—I saw the prisoners standing just at the corner of the theatre—I saw Green rubbing up a five-shilling-piece with the end of her shawl, as I was pass<lb></lb>ing by—she then went to the seed-shop at the corner of Charles-street—I went on the opposite side, and stood there to watch—Griffiths remained where she was—I saw Green come out, and then she and Griffiths held a conversation—Griffiths then went into the same shop, and returned—they crossed over to Covent-garden—I followed, and then saw Green rubbing up a shilling, under an arch in the market, with the end of her shawl—she gave it to Griffiths, who went and purchased some almonds—I told the constable—I saw them searched at the station-house by Blosset.</p>

Reed made a communication to me—I went to the shop, and received a crown-piece—I then took the prisoners in King-street—they were together, cracking almonds—Green would not allow me to take her pocket at first—I snatched it off her—I found some good money, and one counterfeit crown in it.</p>

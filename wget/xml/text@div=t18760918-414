                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Ladbury, Collison, &amp; Co., of 99, Cheapside—I am trustee under the bankruptcy of Powlesland, and under the liquidation proceedings of Bayliss—the in<lb></lb>debtedness of Powlesland, so far as has been ascertained, amounts to 26,972<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the assets are put down at 2,495<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., of which 850<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is claimed by the bankers under a bill of sale, showing a deficiency in round figures of 24,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 24,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 18th May I discovered that Pow<lb></lb>lesland had absconded—I then communicated with Bayliss, certainly on the 23rd, and I think also on the 19th—I saw him at his premises, Beech Street, Barbican—I told him what my object was, and asked him if he could give me any information with respect to Powlesland, of High Wycombe, or of any of his property—he replied that he had seen Powlesland on the pre<lb></lb>vious Tuesday, 16th May, on two occasions—he said "I paid him two sums of money, one of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one of 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I parted with him, and he said he was going to Aldersgate Street Station—he was in great distress of mind, but where he has gone I cannot tell, I know nothing about it"—I asked him to allow me to see what his transactions with Powlesland had been—he said "Yes," and produced a book, from which I took these short particulars (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) of recent transactions—he agreed to my sending a clerk to take further extracts, which he did, and which extended over rather more than twelve months—I have not that account before me—the transactions from February, 1875, to May, 1876, show that the total amount of goods sold by Bayliss, after deducting his commission, was 24,034<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the commis<lb></lb>sion for the latter portion I find was 5 percent.—that was commission on the sales, not interest on the advances—the amount of cash received from Bayliss for the four months preceeding the bankruptcy was 7,624<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the account does not show the cost of the goods—it is simply an account between Powlesland and Bayliss—the cashier copied it from his books—it does not in any way mention the owners of the goods—it shows the gross amount of goods on one side, and the gross amount of sales on the other—the second interview was with my clerk, who asked him whether he had seen or heard anything further of Powlesland, and he said he had not, and inferred that it was very unlikely that he should—that was on 24th May—the 7,624<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. represents the amount of cash obtained—a large loss was evi<lb></lb>dently made by the purchase of the goods between the bankrupt and the sales—I have inspected the books of Powlesland, the bankrupt, as an accountant, and I am trustee of his bankruptcy—these books have not been kept for the last twelve months, and do not disclose the amount of pur<lb></lb>chases in the four months—I found invoices 'of his purchases for the last four months amongst his documents—the books and invoices were obtained from High Wycombe, the bankrupt's premises—the examination I have</p>

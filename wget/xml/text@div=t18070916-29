On the 8th of July my mother was out of town; between eleven and twelve o'clock I went into the cellar to get a bottle of rum: it appeared to me that a considerable quantity of spirits were missing. I counted five bottles of brandy that were missing, two bottles of rum, and a considerable quantity of port wine. From information of the cook, my suspicion fell upon the man. The following morning I procured an officer. We examined his trunk; there we found a bottle of brandy, two bottles of port wine, and an empty bottle; the corks were cut off the bottles, as they are now; the top of the corks were marked with a B for the brandy, and the top of the corks are cut off.</p>

            . Q. You are cook to Mrs. Chitty. - A. Yes. I only know about the wine and cyder; he asked me to have a bottle of wine, I told him he had better not do it, for they were too good a judge of what was in the cellar. I saw him take three bottles of cyder while the man was bottling of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where he was to get this bottle of wine. - A. He got it out of the cellar, and gave it to me.</p>
               <p>MRS. HOWARD. I am a chairwoman. I was at Mrs. Chitty's on the 4th of July; the prisoner came where I was ironing; he took a bottle of wine from under his apron. I did not see where he took it from.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I am innocent of the charge; I was unwell; the wine was given me by a person in the city to take with my bark.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

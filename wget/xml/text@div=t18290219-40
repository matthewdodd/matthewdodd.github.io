            . I am mate of a vessel. I was at the Turk's Head, New Gravel-lane, Shadwell, with the prosecutor; I was not exactly sober, but had all my senses about me - the prosecutor had a watch in his fob; I saw the appendages hanging out - I asked the prisoner to assist me to get the prosecutor home; I found him at the corner of <placeName id="t18290219-40-crimeloc219">Union-street</placeName>

            . I am a watchman. I heard the cry of Stop thief! I saw the prisoner run, and pursued him into Shadwell High-street, and then into Bluegate-fields; I took him about half-way up, and in about half a minute the witness came up, and said, "What have you done with the watch you thieving rascal - have you thrown it away?" he said he had no watch; I took him to the watch-house - we then went back; when I came to the spot where I took the prisoner, Roberts, (another watchman, who was on the opposite side of the way,) found the watch and the case; the glass was broken.</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that he was passing, and assisted a stranger to raise the prosecutor off the ground, and then ran on, it being late, but had never seen the watch.</p>

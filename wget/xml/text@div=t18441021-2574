                  </hi>. I am a naval surgeon, and reside in Perthshire. In Oct. last I left a sea chest in the care of my cousin, in the London-road—it was about six feet long and three broad—a number of things which I did not want, were deposited in the chest, and it was locked—it contained my uni<lb></lb>form, epaulettes, sword, and some plate; a pair of gloves, a pair of braces, and a large collection of Indian coins, shirts, trowsers, and other things—I returned from Scotland on the 21st of last Sept., to join my ship at Ports<lb></lb>mouth—I found the cord of my chest cut off, and all these things taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an upholsterer, and live in the London-road, St. George the Martyr, Southwark. My cousin left a chest in my care—I have an impression that it was safe about a fortnight before my cousin ar<lb></lb>rived from Perth—I cannot say to a day—I had occasion to go to the ware-house where it was deposited, a few days previous to my cousin arriving—I looked at it then, and it appeared to me to be safe—it was corded—I did not try it with my hands to see if it was fast—I could not positively say that the cord was on—the prisoner was in my employ, and was so at the time my cousin arrived—he came about Whitsuntide—he had access in the course of his business as my servant, to this warehouse, which is in the back part of the house.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you prepared to say that you observed this box after it was deposited with you by your cousin? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I may say daily—I cannot fix on any day or date—the prisoner came into my employ last Whitsuntide—I had various parties in my employ before—they have left me—I had three servants in the interval, between my cousin leaving, and his miss<lb></lb>ing these things—I do not know what has become of them—they have left me—there was no particular reason for the last one leaving—there was one I turned away because I was not satisfied with him—he was inattentive to his work—there was a charge of dishonesty against him—that was the reason that I turned him away—he left on the 29th of Sept. of the present year—he had access to the place where the trunk was deposited—I charged him with stealing bed-ticking in the first instance—he was there part of the time the prisoner was there, but he had been longer than the prisoner—the trunk was in a large warehouse—there were various goods in the warehouse, some wools and some palliasses.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the employ of Alexander Stewart. About the be<lb></lb>ginning of Sept., I was at work in the back-warehouse where this chest was placed—it was a common chest, standing in the warehouse—I wanted a work bench, and I had to move the chest—I took the lid up and found it was full—I could not move it—I asked the prisoner if he had got a board six feet long to lend me to make a squab on—he said he had one that he was not making use of—the lid of the chest was fast down, but not corded—I found I could not move it without the prisoner's assistance—he lent me a hand—it was a tremendous weight—I never saw the chest corded.</p>

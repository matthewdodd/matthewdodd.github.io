I was attracted to a house in Robin-Hood-lane, Poplar, by cries of "Murder!" and "Police!"—I and serjeant Timpson went to the house—I saw a woman's head out of the window—she said, "For God's sake, policeman, don't go away; there will be murder done"—I said, "What is the matter?"—she said, "That man of mine," or words to that effect—directly the pri<lb></lb>soner opened the door and rushed out with this short poker in his hand, and struck me three or four blows on my head, cheek, and temple—he said, "You are the b——r that had me before"(I had had him about two years and a half ago)—I became insensible—I did not draw my staff, or speak to him at all.</p>

I went with Backhouse to 28, Robin-Hood-lane—we heard a woman calling, "For God's sake do not go away, there will be murder"—the prisoner and his brother came to the door—the prisoner said, "You b——r, you had me before"—the brother held my arms while the prisoner struck Back-house—I saw the prisoner take the iron out of his pocket and strike him—I got to him as soon as I could, and found him on the pavement bleeding very fast—I saw only one blow given, as I was grappled by the brother—nothing had been said to the prisoner before the blows were given.</p>

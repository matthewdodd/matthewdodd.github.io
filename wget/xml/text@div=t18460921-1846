                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Joseph Allison, a silk-mercer, in Regent-street. On the 18th of Sept., the prisoner and another woman were at the counter, being served—in consequence of something! I sent for a policeman—they got up to go away, and I stopped them—the pri<lb></lb>soner had been sitting before that—I charged her with having something that did not belong to her—from the mode of her denial my suspicions were con<lb></lb>firmed—I</p>

               <p>cannot say what were the words she used, but it was," Me! I have not," or something to that effect—she then moved a little back, and I saw a movement beneath her mantle, and almost immediately I saw a portion of a piece of silk on the floor, from beneath her mantle—I first saw the end of it, and then saw the whole piece as she moved—I took her into the counting-house, and called for the constable—she begged me not to do so, and spoke of compromising the matter—she used the word "compromise"—the con<lb></lb>stable came, and she was given in charge—this is the silk—it is damask silk—there are thirty-two yards and a half of it, worth about 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner's mantle fell nearly to the ground.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Alliston—I picked up this piece of silk and placed it on the counter—I had seen it on the counter before, just where the prisoner was sitting—I was serving to the right hand side of her, and my attention was drawn to the quantity of silk before her, moving as if something was drawn from under them—I am not sure that I mentioned that before the Magistrate—I had seen this silk on the connter an hour before—I do not know of any one who had been showing silk to any cus<lb></lb>tomer but myself—there are only two shopmen in that department—it was about half-past five o'clock—I was folding this silk myself, and was called away to serve another customer—Evans was serving the prisoner—I was told he did not know anything about it—this silk bad not been moved from the part of the counter where it was—I do not think it could have been moved—I put several other pieces of silk on the top of it to put them away—I had not been called away only for a yard or two.</p>

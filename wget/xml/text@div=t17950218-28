                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180060"></xptr>Prisoner. My Lord, and gentlemen of the jury, I am now brought on my trial a second time for the same offence; I am advised that it is not the same so far in law, as to entitle me to plead my former acquital; the charge before was for uttering a forged draft for five pounds, with intention to defraud Messrs, Ransom and Co. the charge to day, is for uttering a draught for ten pounds.</p>
               <p>The jury that then tried me, acquitted me, and I will beg leave to state shortly, as before, the manner in which I became possessed of these bills. As I was lately an officer in his majesty's navy, I was obliged to be often at Portsmouth, I became there acquainted with one Macdonald at the Blue Posts, where I lodged, he did not lodge there but in some private apartments in the town. Almost as soon as our acquaintance commenced he told me he was going to America; among other intercourses, we went together to play at billiards, where at other places as well as at Portsmouth, we played for small sums; I won a very large sum of him at Portsmouth, and he applied to me for fifty pounds, which he lost; and then applied to me for another fifty pounds, and as I had won the greatest part of his money that he had lost since the time of our acquaintance, I lent to him; and I lent him a third fifty pounds. As he was going out of the country I thought it would be proper to have some security, and he said he would give me some bills. In about a week or a fortnight after I went to Northampton, soon after my arrival there he made a remittance to me of three checks, one of five pounds, one of ten pounds, and one of fifteen pounds, all of them drawn by Mr.

             on Messrs. Hammersley; I soon after returned to town, and on Sunday the 31st of August, I paid one five pound check to Mr. Lewis's servant, and the other two I sent by a servant to Messrs. Ransom's, the bankers, and all of them were actually paid at the banker's, and no questions have ever arisen on them to my knowledge; from this treatment of Macdonald, I had reason to believe I was treating with a person of honour; on my return to town I met with him at the New Exchange coffee house, when I mentioned to him my desire of having the remainder of the debt being paid, and he gave me three other checks, purporting to be drawn as before, which I immediately sent for payment by a servant, but on their being presented Mr. Moreland stopped them, and desired to see me, and I went immediately to Mr. Moreland, he then informed me that my checks were forged; I then said, I would endeavour to find Macdonald; I informed Mr. Moreland by whom they were paid to me. I did not see Macdonald that night, but I see him some time the next morning at the coffee house, when I stated the circumstance to him, and he expressed a considerable passion, and with apparent resentment set off to go to Mr. Moreland's, and returned in great haste in about half an hour, telling me he had explained the matter to Mr. Moreland's satisfaction, I then thought that the alarm that Mr. Moreland had made on my mind was an unjust suspicion, and Mr. Macdonald then took from his pocket a letter, which he informed me he had received from Mr. Exton, by that day's post, containing two checks signed by Mr. Exton; and they were signed different than those he gave me. I looked at the two last checks, and from the circumstance of the two first checks being paid, I relied on Macdonald's veracity; of these two last checks. one was for twenty-one pounds, payable to Mr. Ryland, or bearer, and which has never been negociated; the other was for ten pounds, payable to Mr. Brooke, or bearer, and which I paid to Mr. Lewis,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180061"></xptr>Saturday, the 13th of September, and I received of him in exchange, three pounds sixteen shillings, and which I understand was presented by him, or his servant, to Messrs. Ransom's, who stopped payment, and I was apprehended on the usual charge of uttering it, knowing it to be forged. I shall here beg leave to call to your consideration, the evidence on the trial for the first indictment, one of the witnesses proved that I paid it to him for money due to Mr. Lewis, for goods, which he then objected to taking, on a supposition that it was not a good one, on which I told him if it was not good I had two others of the same, and to take it home, and if his master did not like it I would take it back, on that I called on him on the Tuesday or Wednesday following for the change, which he gave me, the bill having been paid. It was also proved by Mr. Francis Heslop, that some considerable time after paying the five pounds, on being sent for to Mr. Ransom, I went there without any hesitation; I related the facts as I have to you to day, and so satisfied was Mr. Moreland of my innocence, that he did not detain me, and on the last trial so satisfied were the jury of these facts, that they acquitted me of the crime laid to my charge.</p>
               <p>I have communicated to you all the circumstances of my first meeting with Macdonald to the present time, and I must here request your particular attention to the times when the foregoing transactions took place. The first checks were paid the latter end of August 1794. On Sunday, the 31st of August, I paid one to a servant of Mr. Lewis's, who objected to take it; my answer was to him, that if it was not good I had two others of the same; in regard to the other three checks which I sent by a servant to Mr. Moreland, the banker's, and who desired to see me, I went to Mr. Moreland's without restraint; Was this the act of a guilty mind? had I a guilty conscience, should not I rather have sled? Mr. Moreland was so well convinced of my innocence that he suffered me to go at large; from Messrs. Ransom and Co. I never sled, but immediately sought after Macdonald, and never changed my lodgings to the time of my apprehension; taking all these circumstances together, is it at all surprising, that any suspicion that I had entertained against Mr. Macdonald should vanish? that I did not question Mr. Macdonald, is certain; that I am not guilty myself, is unquestionable; for if I had known they had been forged, I would not have paid two checks to Mr. Lewis, and after I had done so I would not have gone home to my lodgings, solely to give the prosecutor an opportunity of apprehending me; would any one of you have acted so? surely not. The great difficulty by witnesses to prove the negative, is a hard matter; add to this, I am not twenty years of age, and Mr. Macdonald is a great deal older, and no wonder that he easily prevailed on my credulity.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, under all these circumstances, I trust you will not reverse the verdict of the former jury; that you will not inser that to which the facts do not lead you, and consign me to an ignominious punishment, that is to an awful death; it is a maxim of justice, that it is better that many guilty persons should escape the punishment their crimes deserve, than one innocent person should perish.</p>

Colonel Standen had a lodging at my house—he left London on the 16th of De<lb></lb>cember—his plate-chest was on the first floor—the prisoner came there every day; and when the Colonel left London, he came regularly every day for the first week—he had access to the room where the chest was—he then neglected his duty, and ceased to come at all—in consequence of di<lb></lb>rections from Colonel Standen, I examined his chest, and sent him a list of what I found in it—a complaint was then made of plate being missed, a silver label was missing, which I had seen in the Colonel's apartment on the table.</p>

I counted the plate before my master left town for Brighton—the prisoner was with me to see that it was all right, and it was all right—there was a dozen and a half of large forks, a dozen small ones, a dozen and a half of table spoons, a dozen dessert spoons, two sauce-ladles, and two sugar-ladles—the prisoner was helping me put it into the box.</p>

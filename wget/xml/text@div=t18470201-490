                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. George Lambart; he lives at Old Park Farm, Enfield; the prisoner was his carter. On Saturday, the 16th of jan., I sent him with a load of hay to London, and he was to call at Bull-stair-wharf for 15ewt. of beans, which Mr. Lambart had bought—I</p>

               <p>gave him ten sacks for them—he returned, and I weighed the beans—there were only 14cwt. And 13lbs., which is 99 lbs.; or about two bushels deficient—I asked him where the overplus beans were—he said they were put into the big sacks, as the small ones would not hold them—a day or two afterwards he said there was half a bushel which he gave to the horse—there were ten sacks—they were right, but the weight was deficient—he had only one horse—it would not be possible for one horse to eat two bushels of beans in a journey from London.</p>

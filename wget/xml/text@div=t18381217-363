                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Turner, of Lower-street, Islington. On the 4th of December, I was at Mr. Older<lb></lb>shaw's sale—I had two half-crowns and one shilling in my purse, and three half-crowns one shilling and eight-pence in loose halfpence in my pocket—there was a great crowd of persons, and the prisoner stooped down close to me—I turned and saw him there—I felt my pocket, put my hand to the prisoner, and said, "You have robbed me"—he began to move, and I said, "You are the man that robbed me"—he had cut my pocket, and my silver was gone.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable, and live near Uxbridge. I was pre<lb></lb>sent at Mr. Oldershaw's sale—I heard the prosecutrix cry out she was robbed—the prisoner was close to her, trying to get away from her—she kept him till I laid hold of him—I saw him put his hand into his pocket—I directly caught hold of his hand, and never let him take it out—I found in his waistcoat pocket three half-crowns, one shilling, and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—I saw him put something into his trowsers pocket—I found nothing in that pocket, but the pocket was torn, and this purse with two half-crowns andone shilling in it, dropped down from him.</p>

            's, the Black Horse: I found my box broke open on the 12th of May, the box was in the room where I slept, I had a guinea and five one pound notes taken out of it, and a silver shirt hasp; I had seen them on the 7th of May, the prisoner slept in the same bed with me.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he? - A. A <rs id="t18050529-54-deflabel304" type="occupation">day labouring man</rs>

               <p>Q. Have you found any of your things? - A. Only my shirt hasp on the prisoner; I asked him how he came by it; he said he bought it at Brentford fair. (The shirt buckle produced by the officer and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Q. You never found any of the notes, nor traced them any where? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then all you know is that that is your property? - A. Yes, that is my property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Will you venture to swear to this? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. The day your box was broke open the prisoner went out with you; and when you went out the box was safe, and when you came home you found your box broke open? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you charge him with stealing five pounds? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What wages have you? - A. Fourteen shillings a week.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before he was committed that you borrowed a seven shilling-piece of him? - A. No, not a seven shilling-piece, it was half a crown.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make use of this expression, that you would thank him to lend you this money, that you were quite broke down - How long was it before this? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you and the prisoner a quarrel about a week or ten days ago? - A. Rather longer.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been beating an old man of the name of Langdon? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he quarrelled with you about your beating an old man? and this breast buckle which you have sworn to, he told you he bought it at Brentford fair; he wore it publickly, and while he was sleeping in the same bed with you; and you have lost these notes you say, and you had only fourteen shillings a week? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his going along with you to Marlborough-street, with another man, and they taking their oaths, that they were not the men that robbed you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After that you saw this breast-buckle in his breast, which he told you he bought at Brentford-fair, and then you had him apprehended - Is that so? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long had you missed it before he quarrelled with you? - A. I had not missed it before he and I quarrelled.</p>

             sworn. - On the 20th of May the prosecutor came to me to take the prisoner into custody; he believed he was the man who stole the property, by seeing the breast-buckle in his possession; I went to the Black Horse and asked him for the breast-buckle, which he at first refused, saying, he had bought it at Brentford-fair. I produce 4 l. 10 s. which he had in his possession, one Bank note, of 1 l. three guineas, and a seven-shilling piece.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the prosecutor.) Look at that Bank note - Can you read? - A. No, I cannot tell whether it is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to borrow half a crown of this man while you had this money? - A. My brother was a baker; he and I had a horse, which we sold for 8 l. then I had 4 l. I had one of my own, an old mare, which I sold for four guineas; and then I had a little poney which I sold for 2 l. then I had 8 l.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the other two pounds? - A. There were ten shillings more of this money.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you borrowed the half-crown? - A. I do not exactly know.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before you went to the office? - A. A good bit.</p>

I cleaned out a privy for Lord Northwick; it came to a guinea; I put the money by; I had been a long time saving this money; my box was broke open, it was very well known; I had lost the key; I offered to lend Mr. Corby some money before he had lost this money; I had lent him money two or three different times; it is very<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180505290042"></xptr>well known; I am sure I am not deserving of this now.</p>

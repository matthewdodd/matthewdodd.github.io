            . On the first of August, in the evening between eight and nine o'clock, the prisoner, who <rs id="t17751018-17-deflabel86" type="occupation">keeps a public-house</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17751018-17-defend198 t17751018-17-deflabel86"></join> in the neighbourhood, came into my room, and asked me if I had any of his pots; I told him, I had none. Finding me sitting alone, he began to be rude with me, he pulled me about, and used me in a rude manner; I endeavoured to pacify him, and then he was more rude; he locked the door, and put the key into his pocket, which so frightened me that I could not speak; then he forced me into the bed-room, which is in that room, and did with me what he intended to do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he force you?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he carnal knowledge of your body?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it against your will?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Yes, my husband was then at a benefit club; I told him of it as soon as he came home, which was about twelve o'clock. I was not able to cry out; there was no one upon that floor, nor no one near me as I knew of.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a married woman?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your husband?</p>
               <p>Atkins. A stone mason.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he go out?</p>
               <p>Atkins. He went out to work about five in the morning; he came home before he went to his club at between seven and eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How near does the prisoner live to you?</p>
               <p>Atkins. About a dozen doors off on the other side of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. You used to buy your beer of him?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your husband came home at half after eleven at night?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You told him what Burdock had done to you?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you leave off taking beer of Mr. Burdock?</p>
               <p>Atkins. As soon as my husband went to take leave of him the beginning of September; the reason was, my husband owed him some money, and he desired he would have beer at his house till he had paid him.</p>
               <p>Q. Does no one lodge on the same floor with you?</p>
               <p>Atkins. There are four rooms on the floor; I have two; one Mrs. Hopper has the room next to me; one Mrs. Martin, a maiden body, has the other.</p>
               <p>Q. What divides Mrs. Hopper's room from your's?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Lath and plaister, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you capable of hearing any thing that passes in Mrs. Hopper's room?</p>
               <p>Atkins. No, she had not been in the house some days; I had not seen her for several days.</p>
               <p>Q. Does any body live above you?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Yes, there are people lodge there, but whether they were at home, I cannot tell; there are four rooms up three pair of stairs; one Martin has one room above me, and one Call as another; I don't know the names of the rest.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177510180018"></xptr>Q. Were any of them at home?</p>
               <p>Atkins. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Who lodges on the one pair of stairs floor?</p>
               <p>Atkins. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the prisoner's business; when he came to you; I suppose the door was shut?</p>
               <p>Atkins. It was ajar: he asked me if I had any of his pots?</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do to you?</p>
               <p>Atkins. After he had pulled me about. I went to get up to go to the door, and he flew to the door and locked it: he refused to quit the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you cry out?</p>
               <p>Atkins. He frightened me; he came in unawares; he confined me in that manner that I was not able to speak.</p>
               <p>Q. How, did he confine your tongue?</p>
               <p>Atkins. I talked to him as loud as I do talk in common, while I was able.</p>
               <p>Q. There are such a number of people in the house: here is a house four rooms upon a floor, with different occupiers almost in every room; if I had been you, I should have cried out and took the chance of their hearing.</p>
               <p>Atkins. They are as often cut as at home; I talked as loud as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before he locked the door? You talked to him, reasoned with him, and argued with him in a very mild way?</p>
               <p>Atkins. I did not reason with him at all; I endeavoured to resist.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might it be before he locked the door?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Six or seven minutes, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he locked the door, had he done any thing more than put his hand into your bosom?</p>
               <p>Atkins. No, he crouded me into the bedroom.</p>
               <p>Q. Before or after he locked the door?</p>
               <p>Atkins. After.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not desire him to lock the door?</p>
               <p>Atkins. No, he locked it, and put the key into his pocket. I asked him where the key was? as well as I was able: he said, he had it in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the bed-room door?</p>
               <p>Atkins. It goes out of the other room: he took hold of me, and perfectly lifted me into the room, and threw me upon the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts did he lay hold of you?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Round my waist.</p>
               <p>Q. Then your arms were at liberty?</p>
               <p>Atkins. And I endeavoured all I could to resist.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it began to be serious; did not you call out then?</p>
               <p>Atkins. As much as I was able, I did, and desired him still to quit the place.</p>
               <p>Q. But you did not call out to any of the neighbours?</p>
               <p>Atkins. I was not able to call loud enough for any body to hear me then above or below; but I was very sensible there was no body there to hear me.</p>
               <p>Q. You told your husband as soon as he came home?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Yes, I said, Why don't you go and see what you can do with him, for I am used exceeding ill by him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not desire your husband to go to a justice of peace?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Yes, I did immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your husband to do with Burdock?</p>
               <p>Atkins. To tell him of his fault before he went to the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Why, did he not know the fault he had committed?</p>
               <p>Atkins. It was fit my husband should go to him, and let him know that he knew it.</p>
               <p>Court. That he might not be out of the way?</p>
               <p>Q. Then I suppose he told Burdock his fault, and he said, he was sorry for it, and no more was to be done?</p>
               <p>Atkins. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you expect Burdock to do; to ask your pardon, I suppose?</p>
               <p>Atkins. He must know very well it had been a great trouble to me.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Burdock to do?</p>
               <p>Atkins. As the law was to direct - I had nothing to do with that.</p>
               <p>Q. As your husband and he could agree it?</p>
               <p>Atkins. As I had a husband, I left it to him.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times was you in Burdock's house yourself before the complaint was made to a magistrate?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177510180019"></xptr>Atkins. I never went any further than the door to order a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times has Mr. Burdock been in your room since the 1st of August, to the time he was taken up?</p>
               <p>Atkins. He came in twice afterwards in my husband's absence.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave him so good encouragement, he came a second time, did he?</p>
               <p>Atkins. There was no encouragement at all?</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that Burdock came first into your room, after the first of August?</p>
               <p>Atkins. About six or seven days he made it his business to come in for a pot as before, and he began to come up to me as he had done before; but I was guarded against him, and kept my door wide open.</p>
               <p>Q. So you was guarded against him, and kept your door wide open. Do you remember his coming to some of the other lodgers?</p>
               <p>Atkins. I never minded who came to any body in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember upon the 3d of August, Burdock going past your door, and though it was open, he would not come in?</p>
               <p>Atkins. I don't know any thing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say upon the 3d of August to Burdock, So, now you will not speak to your old acquaintance?</p>
               <p>Atkins. That is false. More than that he wished his hands and legs might drop off if he ever came into the house again; and swore more than that, that he never heard a woman talk and cry like me.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you did not in a few days after the first of August, say to Burdock,</p>
               <p>"So now you will not call on your old acquaintance;" or words to that effect?</p>
               <p>Atkins. I can safely take my oath I never saw him come up stairs, only when he came into my room.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that letter: did you ever see that before. (Shewing the witness a letter.)</p>
               <p>Atkins. Yes, I have seen that letter to be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see that letter?</p>
               <p>Atkins. The day of the month is in it I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Who wrote the letter?</p>
               <p>Atkins. It was a gentleman, who said, my husband was to blame that he did not follow the law with this man.</p>
               <p>Q. What is that gentleman's name?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Robinson.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does he live?</p>
               <p>Atkins. I don't now justly; it was at the Hole in the Wall in Chancery-lane, where he happened to call upon my husband.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he know any thing that you had been used in this manner?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Because both my husband and I told him.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw him before, did you?</p>
               <p>Atkins. I had never seen him before.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he advise you to do?</p>
               <p>Atkins. No farther than to send to him in that manner; but I thought it was best to go to a Justice of Peace. We did not take his advice.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know how that letter came into the hands of Mr. Burdock?</p>
               <p>Atkins. It was a chairman carried it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you deliver that letter to Mr. Burdock?</p>
               <p>Atkins. No, I had another note I went to give him. I saw the chairman in the court just now that took that letter.</p>
               <p>Court. You say, that you advised your husband next day to go to Burdock and talk with him.</p>
               <p>Atkins. I did so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your husband follow your advice</p>
               <p>Atkins. Directly, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he go to Burdock?</p>
               <p>Atkins. I think in about three weeks after.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not apply to any magistrate, then till after he had told him that?</p>
               <p>Atkins. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever go to Burdock's after that three weeks, after he had been told of it?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Yes, just over the cell of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that Burdock carried you in his arms into the inner room; now you knew his design then.</p>
               <p>Atkins. Yes, and resisted all that in my power lay.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not cry out: I think, you said you only spoke loud.</p>
               <p>Atkins. As loud as I was able. I was very ill at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. After he had committed this foul deed. did you tell him that you would prosecute him?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Yes, and told him that my husband would do it as soon as possible.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177510180020"></xptr>Q. Why, both of you knew he was to be hanged if he was found guilty.</p>
               <p>Atkins. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. But you told him he should be prosecuted then?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Yes.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>You went and got a warrant to apprehend Burdock?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you get that warrant?</p>
               <p>Atkins. I think the fourth of September.</p>
               <p>Q. What constable did you give the warrant to, to execute?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Smallwood and Sturton.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go along with them to execute the warrant?</p>
               <p>Atkins. No; but my husband did.</p>
               <p>Q. What instructions did you give them about the warrant?</p>
               <p>Atkins. I did not know that I had any occasion to give them any.</p>
               <p>Q. But did you desire them to go to the house and call for a pint of beer?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you desire the constables, or either of them, to take Burdock aside and tell him the business, and if he saw him inclinable to make it up, to come to your husband and settle it, because the constables are in court?</p>
               <p>Atkins. The last time it was, those words were mentioned, the other time no such thing was mentioned. One came and said he could not find him; that he was absconded, and likely he would send some friend to make it up. I said, I did not desire to make it up; but we would go as far as the law would go.</p>

                  <p>On Wednesday November the 1st was published. (Price 6 d.)</p>
                  <p>THE CONVIVIAL MAGAZINE, AND POLITE INTELLIGENCER; Or a real REPRESENTATION of the CHARACTERS and SENTIMENTS of the TIMES.</p>
                  <p>CONTAINING</p>
                  <p>The Portraits of the most celebrated Toasts; Men of Rank conspicuous in the World; Statesmen, Orators, Preachers, Petits Maitres, Actors; and Buffoons.</p>
                  <p>TO THE PUBLIC.</p>
                  <p>THE Authors of this production will not attempt to delude the Public by a parade of words and specious promises, which they are incapable of performing, and shall therefore only mention such particulars as are within their reach, and which they will assiduously exert themselves to display to the almost.</p>
                  <p>Besides their seizing every Object that can contribute towards the Entertainment and Instruction of their readers, they will be enabled to lay before them Topics that never yet appeared in a Magazine, by the assistance of some Gentlemen of consequence in polite life, who have promised to transmit them all the amusing conversation that shall pass in the most respectable parties. This will not be confined entirely to the Metropolis, but Bath, and all the other polite Watering-places will furnish them with Materials for cultivating this Correspondence. In this pursuit they will extend their Information from Scarborpugh to Brighthelmstone, and whether the subjects be Gallantry, Intrigue, Politicks, or the Drama, they will equally find a place in this Miscellany, if judged either Amusing or Instructive. This deportment of their Magazine, which is entirely upon a new plan, and which will never exceed the bounds of the strictest truth, will justly entitle it to the Appellation of the CONVIVIAL MAGAZINE.</p>
                  <p>In fine, every possible Endeavour will be exerted to render it one of the most entertaining and instructive production extant; in the execution of which the proprietors are resolved that no Pains or expence shall be spared. To this end, they have engaged some of the most capital Artists to furnish them with copper plates which shall not be inferior to those of any Monthly publication whatever.</p>

               <p>You are desired to call upon me to-morrow at three of the clock in the afternoon, at the Robinhood Tavern Butcher Row, Temple Bar. By default an action, will be brought against you at the suit of Mr. William Atkins.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Who is that Robinson that wrote that letter. You saw it wrote you say?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Yes; and the man wrote it according to his own directions; he would have had my husband give him money to have brought an action, but my husband thought he had better go to a justice, and he did not take his advice.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prosecutor.</p>
               <p>How came you about Chancery Lane?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Because my husband works at the New Six Clerks Office, and I am there almost every day since this affair happened, because I was unhappy at home.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Then you live at the Six Clerks Office for fear of being ravished?</p>
               <p>Atkins. It is a very sad thing to have things disturbone so.</p>
               <p>The jury informed the court that they did not desire to have the prisoner put upon his defence.</p>

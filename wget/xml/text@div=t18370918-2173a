                  </hi>. I went with a hired horse with Mr. Moseley to Camberwell, to assist him with his dray—I stopped at a beer-shop at the corner of Lock's-fields—I left my coat in the dray, when we went to fetch the empty barrels out, about nine o'clock in the evening of the 18th of September—I was there about ten minutes—when I came out my coat was gone—this is it—I made inquiry about it, and had a direction to the prisoner's house I went and saw them there—I cannot swear to Beagle, but I can to Lockie—I said they had got my coat in their possession, and I demanded it—Lockie said there was not such a thing there—there was a woman there—she said there was such a thing there, and she brought it to me from behind Lockie's chair—it was mine—I should think that was half an hour after my missing it—the policeman then came, and said, if he took them up would I give charge of them, I said "Yes," and took them during the night—they had made their escape out of the back door.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a green-grocer. I was at the beer-shop about nine o'clock, and saw Beagle take the coat off the dray—I am sure he was the person—I had known him before—Lockie was with him—Beagle went away with it, and Lockie with him—I had seen them together before.</p>

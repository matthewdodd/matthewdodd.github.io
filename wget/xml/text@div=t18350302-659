                  </hi>. I live in Maiden-lane, Islington. On Sunday, the 8th of February, about twenty-five minutes after two o'clock in the morning, I was coming down Castle-street, Long-acre, in the parish of St. Giles—I met the prisoner and two other men in company together—they were standing at the corner of Castle-street—after I passed, they fol<lb></lb>lowed after me—then one of them came in front of me, looked me in the face, he then went back and spoke to the others—I continued walking on—I went up Short's-gardens—they all three followed me—I went on one side for a necessary purpose—I then crossed the road, and they followed me—the prisoner came up to me at the corner of Charles-street, and Drury-lane, St. Giles—he said, "You are the b—who wanted to fight me"—and at that instant, he knocked his head against my face with violence, knocked my hat off, and knocked me against the wall—I did not fall—he snatched my watch out of my fob, and my handkerchief out of my pocket—the watch-chain and all went together out of my fob, and he snatched a silk handkerchief out of my pocket—I had not attempted to strike him—I never saw any of them before—I never spoke to them—I am sure the prisoner is the man who did this—he ran as hard as he could—I halloaed "Stop thief"—he dropped the handkerchief as he ran—I picked it up all over mud, in the middle of the road—I saw him run into a house, No. 3, Charles-street—I called out "Police"—a policeman came directly, and saw him running before he got into the house—I went to the house with the policeman—the door was open—it is a private house—we went up stairs to one room, and knocked at the door—they were some minutes before they would open the door—at last a man opened it, who was rather intoxicated—I found the prisoner in the room, lying on a bed, with a rug over him, and his clothes and shoes on—I have not the least doubt of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was in Drury-lane—I saw the prosecutor standing at the top of Charles-street—he called out "Police"—I ran up to him—he said he was robbed of his watch and handkerchief, and said, "It is a man in a white coat; there he is now running"—the prosecutor had this handkerchief in his hand wet with mud at the time—I saw three persons running—the prisoner was one of them—I have known him some time about the neighbourhood—he ran into No. 3, Charles-street—I heard footsteps up the stairs—I had no light with me—the passage was dark—the door was open—I got a light and examined the house—I found him lying on a bed in the garret, covered with a rug up to his shoulders—there was a man and a woman in the same room, in the same bed—he was on the outside of the bed, covered over nearly to his neck—Randle, who was with me, turned his lantern towards him—he then raised his head up—Randle said, "Halloo, young fellow!"—the prosecutor said, "That is the man that robbed me"—he was secured—I am certain he is the man I saw running from the prosecutor—the house is in the parish of St. Giles's.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did the three men go into the house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To the best of my belief they did—I am not certain all three went in, because some persons were standing on the pavement; but, to the best of my belief, the two others went into the same house—the prosecutor was with me when we went into the room—the other man was in bed when I went in—his clothes were off—I saw him in bed—he did not get up and open the door—Randle went up stairs first, the prosecutor next, then there was another constable, and I followed—Randle searched the prisoner in my presence, but found no watch on him.</p>

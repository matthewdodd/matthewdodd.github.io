                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer in Coleman Street—on the 23rd October the prisoner was indebted to me for 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on that day he called at my office, and said he had called to liquidate a bill of 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., that he had not the means of paying me in cash, but he had some drain pipes lying at the Bricklayers' Arms Station which he thought might suit me, as I was building; and if I would buy them of him I could take the amount out of the purchase-money to liquidate that to which he was indebted to me—I consented to do so, and requested him to give me an inspecting order—he said he would go out and get the order; he returned in about an hour, and brought this bill, purporting to be drawn by James Mayhew, and accepted by James Smith—I noticed that it was wet when he brought</p>

               <p>it to me—I asked whether he knew the drawer and acceptor—he said he knew them both very well, that James Mayhew was a contractor at Wandsworth in a very large way of business, and that Mr. James Smith, the acceptor, was a builder in a large way of business, whom he had known and supplied with goods for years—as the bill was damp, I asked him whether he saw them sign it, and he said he had seen it drawn and accepted, and knew both the men well—he said, "I don't want all the money to-day, but if you will just advance 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that would give you an opportunity if you like to make inquiries, and I can call to-morrow for the balance"—on his representation I gave him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of the bill—I never saw him again until he was in custody, which was a week or more afterwards.</p>

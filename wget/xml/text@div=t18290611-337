               <p>PHOEBE CARNEY. I live near Tottenham-court-road, in the house kept by the prisoner's father. On the 15th of May I went into the wash-house, and saw this brass mould; I took it into my room, and showed it to my husband, who works for the prosecutor; he asked the prisoner if he knew any thing about it - he denied it at first, but afterwards owned it.</p>

No - the prisoner came in, and my husband said, "Do you know this?" he said, "Yes, I brought it from one of the men's benches, and I intend to put it back, but I brought it to show my father."</p>

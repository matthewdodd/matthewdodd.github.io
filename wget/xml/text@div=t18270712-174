               <p>SARAH PENND. I am the wife of William Pennd, and live at Hammersmith. On the 30th of June, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I was waiting about for my husband to come home - some man came by and pushed me down - I did not know him; I do not know whether he took my shawl off, or it fell off - I tried to keep it on my shoulders - I had hold of it, and slipped off the pavement, which made me let go.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, have you ever said, before a Magistrate, "The shawl was dragged from me?" A. I said the same as I do now; there was a crowd, and I could not find it; I never allowed any one to take it - I saw it again next day; I do not know the prisoner; I saw him in about half an hour, and thought he was the man, but was not positive; I went up and asked him for my shawl - he said he knew nothing of it; I thought he might be the man, and gave him in charge - a strange woman returned it to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not swear at the office the very reverse of what you have to day? A. I do not know that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the man who took your shawl accuse you of taking his money? A. No; he never spoke about any money; I did not swear to the prisoner at the office; I did not swear that I saw a man do it; I had spoken to no man before it was taken; I cannot say more than I have; I did not say it fell down, and I could not tell who took it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not frequently been taken up on charge of robbery? A. No; I shall swear to nothing. I was married eighteen months ago, at the new church at Chelsea; my maiden name was Bury.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you persist in saying you are the man's wife? A. I shall say no more - I am married to him - I have not been in custody; I knew Swan, and was never in his custody, or any body else's in my life, for any thing at all; I have been taken up for being a little intoxicated, but never for theft.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Bow-street. On Monday morning I found the prisoner and shawl at the watch-house; he said the prosecutor and his wife charged him with stealing it, and that it was under the straw; I found it there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not the prosecutrix say he took it? A. Certainly - and she said so at the office.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PENND. I am married to this woman; she had a shawl like this.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you been married? A. About eighteen months; it was at the new church, Chelsea; I cannot tell whether she has been in custody; she was not since she has been my wife; she has been taken for drunkenness.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Hammersmith. I know the prosecutrix well - she has been in my charge for defrauding five or six different people of property, but they gave up the charges sooner than be exposed - the last time was six or eight months ago; I have had her several times within the last two years; I sometimes kept her about an hour.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What were the charges? A. Picking people's pockets.</p>

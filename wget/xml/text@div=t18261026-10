On Saturday, the 14th of October, Rush came into the shop and asked for a quarter lb. of sugar; a pound of tea stood on the counter, tied up, when he came in; he had a sack on his arm, which he rested on the counter close to the tea. I observed Clements pass the shop-door while he was there, but I did not observe him take any notice - I served Rush with the sugar, which came to 11/2d., and just as he got to the door I missed the tea - I immediately ran out and took him, walking with Clements, about thirty yards from the shop; I saw the tea in his right-hand, and saw him give it to Clements, who put it under his arm, under his coat, but not to conceal it. I asked him for the tea; he gave it to me without hesitation, saying, "That man told me to hold it." Rush immediately ran off - I took hold of Clements, and gave him to Mr. Young, while I followed Rush as far as the Cock public-house in Hosier Lane, and there lost him - I went with the officers, about half-past ten o'clock, to the Anchor public-house, Saffron-hill, and found him there, and was certain of his person.</p>

On Saturday, the 16th of October, about three o'clock in the afternoon, both the prisoners came to the shop-Elizabeth asked me if I would take a cheque for drapery goods; she had not then bought any - I said if we had any knowledge of the parties we had no objection to take it; she took her pocket-book out, took these two cheques from it, and gave them to me - I sent them to Cockburn and Co.'s, bankers, at Whitehall, and in the mean time showed them the goods they wished to look at; they purchased to the amount of about 7l. - they both purchased cloaks, shawls, and other things; I asked Elizabeth if either of the names the cheques purport to be drawn in favour of was her name; she said they were not, she had received them from her mistress - she did not give her mistress' name; they were more than an hour in the shop, looking at things, and did not offer to go away; the boy returned from the banker's, and stated the cheques to be forged - they were not aware of my having sent the boy: he produced the cheques.</p>
               <p>Q. Did their looking at the goods occupy an hour? A. We were extremely busy, and I apologised for detaining them, as I served other ladies at the same time - when the boy returned I told them we had sent to the bankers's, and they had pronounced them to be forged -Elizabeth said they were not forged; we sent for an officer, who came and took them both into custody, with the cheques - they both stood close together when the cheques were tendered to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You had all your conversation with Elizabeth? A. Yes - they staid there during the hour of their own free will; all Ann did was to look at the goods with the other - she negociated no cheque.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You amused them by saying you had other customers to serve? A. Yes; our shop is not more crowded on Saturdays than on other days - three o'clock is a busy time.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM FYSON. I am a Policeman. I went on this Saturday afternoon to Mr. Brooks', and saw the prisoners there; I was asked to take them into custody for uttering two forged cheques - they got up, and went with me immediately; Elizabeth said she was very willing to go, and as we went along she said she was sorry she had offered the cheques - if she had known they had been had she would have destroyed them, and at the office she told me she had found them in Hyde-park; Ann was near enough to hear this - she said nothing in my hearing; I produce the cheques - I have had them ever since, except for about a day and a half, when they were in the hands of Mr. Stafford, the clerk of Bow-street; I put my mark on them before I parted with them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. They went willingly, without any resistance at all? A. Yes - the conversation was with Elizabeth entirely.</p>

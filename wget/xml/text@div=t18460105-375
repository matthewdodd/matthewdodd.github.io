                  </hi>. Iam a widow, and have lived with the prisoner as his wife for three years nearly; we lodged in Coventry-street, Bethnal-green; I have two children by him; one is dead, the other lived with us; we lived on very good terms; he was a sober man, and a porter at Billingsgate. On Thursday evening, the 27th of Nov., he came from work between seven and eight o'clock, and was very much in liquor—I was putting a blind up at the window, and saw him crossing the street—when he came into the room he said,</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Pearce, a surgeon, in Bethnal-green-road. The prisoner came to me on the evening of the 27th of Nov., and said he had stabbed his wife—he wished me to accompany him, and said he would not leave the house without me—on the way be expressed great regret, and appeared in a state of great mental excitement, apparently partially inebriated—I went with him, and found the prosecutrix at No. 3, and had her taken to her own house—her stays were taken off, and I found an incised wound on the left side of the abdomen, and a portion of the omentum protruding—I reduced it, and dressed the wound by ligatures—there was a very slight discharge of blood—there was blood on her stays, and a cut in them—when down stairs the prisoner handed me a clasp-knife from the table, and said, "This is the knife with which I stabbed her," and it was in consequence of her refusing to partake of pig's maw, which he had provided for her—I had sent for a policeman, and gave him the knife—I took the prosecutrix to the London-hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I was surgeon-dresser at the London-hospital. Mr. Rolph brought the prosecutrix there on the 27th of Nov.—I found an incised wound with a ligature, which I removed, and a part of the omentum protruded—I applied another ligature by direction of one of the assistant-surgeons—the wound might have been occasioned by a knife of this descrip<lb></lb>tion—it was just below the last true rib—the cut in the stays corresponded with the wound—the knife had penetrated an inch and a half, as near as I</p>

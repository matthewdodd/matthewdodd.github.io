             depos'd, That she heard  an Irish Man, the Prisoner's Countryman, say, That the Prisoner sold 2 of the Prosecutor's Books. She further said, That she saw the Prisoner bring back the Stockings to the Prosecutor's Wife: But what the Man told her was no Evidence, and her seeing the Prisoner bring back the Stockings, did not make it appear that the Prisoner stole them, though she produced a Part of them in Court, for they being out at the Ankles, were converted to a Pair of Gloves.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner said more in his Defence than could be contain'd in this Paper, the most material Part was as follows:</p>
               <p>The first Acquaintance I had with this Family was occasioned by the Prosecutor's Wife being my Countrywoman, I was going to see them, and they were coming to see me, till we knew one another better and better, and then the Prosecutor's Wife fell sick, and indeed and she was very bad, and I pitied her, and the she had a little Child, and it was a great deal of Trouble to her, so I took it in my Arms and carried it home to my House, and three Weeks after I went again, and she said she was a little better, but her Nurse run her to a great deal of Charges, and what her Husband was getting could not support it. So the Nurse being gone to Market I got her out of Bed, and like a Fool, as I was, I put her in a Coach and carried her to my own House, and there I took more Care of her than I would of either my own Wife, or indeed of my own Mother, for I let her lie in my own Bed, and I laid my self down in a Closet, till I was so stiff I could not perform my Business; all this while, though I was very bad myself, I took so much Care of my Countrywoman, that in a little Time she was able to be walking about the House, and do any Thing which a Woman in Health should be doing, and then her Husband came, and he was likewise lying in my House sometimes, and said, he should never make me amends for my Kindness, and indeed and I believe and he never designs it, for when he took his Wife home they grew very ungrateful, for she demanded her Pail, which she had before gave me, when I fetched it to wash her Feet in, and she bid me fetch the Stockings, which she gave me, and the Books, which I took for her cross-grain'd Child to play with; and then I was demanding my Money for my Trouble, and then I was demanding my Looking-glass, which I lent them (for my Face is not so handsome that I should take a Pride to look at it) and then the Prosecutor and I fell to Quarrelling, and he said, he would sell his Soul to Ninety-nine Devils but he would Prosecute me, and I said, and I would trust to the Lord God and the Law, and then we went to the Law together, and I cast him and recovered Damages, and that is the Cause of my being brought here; and I hope the Honourable Court will consider it, since I desire no more but to be 'quitted and to be clear, and to have a copy of my indictment. He then produc'd several Witnesses, who depos'd, That they had promised him Satisfaction for the Trouble he had in looking after the Prosecutor's Wife, and that he had recovered a Verdict and Judgement at Guild-Hall, for their not making him Satisfaction: the Jury considering the Whole, brought in their Verdict <rs id="t17280717-11-verdict47" type="verdictDescription">

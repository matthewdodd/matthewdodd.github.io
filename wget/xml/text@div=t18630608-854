                  </hi>. I am a plasterer, and live at 3, Canterbury-grove, Lower Norwood—on Saturday, 9th May, between 9 and 10 o'clock, I was sitting on a form outside the Horns tavern, along with Bunn—I saw the prisoner come outside, and say to Dixon, "You must be a s—b—"—Dixon turned round directly, and said, "You are a b—s—b—"—the prisoner said, "If you call me that again I will ring your nose"—Dixon repeated those words—with that the prisoner walked from the step of the door where he was standing towards Dixon; they closed, and fell together, and rolled over two or three times in the road—they both got up again—a man named Waller tried to stop it; and the prisoner said if he interfered he would serve him the same, and he had a tussle with him, and, I believe, struck him—he then turned round to Dixon again to renew the fight, and Dixon fell—I did not see whether he got up again; I remained sitting on the form; I saw Dixon taken away; I do not know whether he was sen<lb></lb>sible; I was not near him—I do not know that he had anything under his arm—I saw a saw picked up after he had fallen.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fly-driver, and live at Connor-road, Brixton-hill—on the evening of 9th May I was at the Horns tavern—I saw Dixon there; he had a saw in one hand and a piece of pork—I did not hear the prisoner say anything to him, but I turned round and saw them scuffling together, and they fell—I stood in between them, and parted them—the prisoner said to me, "<hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>, will you stand in front of me when the man has struck me with a saw?"—I said, "I don't know anything about that; I have not seen it"—he said, "If you don't get out of the way I will hit you"—I said, "Would you take advantage of a man when he has got his hands full?"—with that I received a blow from him, and was knocked down by the side of the deceased.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer at Norwood—on Saturday, 9th May, between 9 and 10 in the evening, I was outside the Horns—I heard Dixon say to the prisoner, "You are a b—s—b—"—the prisoner said, "If you repeat that again I will ring your nose"—he did repeat it, and the prisoner came towards him, when Dixon put a short saw that he had in his hand to the prisoner's chest—they closed in a struggle, and rolled down in the road; I believe the saw was struck down—they scuffled, and got further away from where I was sitting—I did not get up—I saw them get together again; I saw Weller between them separating them—I saw Dixon fall—I saw no blow struck.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was the deceased a sober man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never knew him to be otherwise—I knew them both, and knew no harm of either—this happened outside the public-house; I had not been inside—the blow with the saw was a push with his right hand at the prisoner's chest—I did not see blood immediately flow from the prisoner; I saw blood afterwards—Dixon fell very soon after Weller got between them—it did not last above four minutes altogether—I saw Dixon fall; there was a post there; I can't say that he fell through stumbling against the post; I think it must have been that, but I was not near enough to see—I have known the prisoner from a lad—he always bore the character of a peaceable, well-conducted man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Lower Norwood—I was called in to make a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination of the deceased—I found a fracture on the right side of the skull, by which a large triangular piece of bone had been displaced; under that bone, a blood-vessel had been ruptured, and a large quantity of blood was thrown out on the skull; on the opposite side of the skull a blood-vessel had also been ruptured, and a quantity of blood was effused on the surface of the brain there, of which injuries he died—the fracture extended to the base of the skull.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The fracture probably was caused by his head coming in contact with some hard substance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No doubt of it; it was not the result of a blow with a fist; that is quite impossible—it would require some force—the force of a fall might have done it—his own weight in falling would be quite sufficient to account for it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he drink any thing more in your house. - A. Part of a shillingsworth of brandy and water, I drank some and the woman drank some; after the eggs were eat and the brandy and water drank, he fell asleep, I was busy serving, the woman went out privately while I was serving my customers, and she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180605210006"></xptr>never returned; I awoke him after she was gone, and asked him whether he knew this woman, he said no, he put his hand in his pocket and said he had been robbed, and he had lost near all his money.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you any opportunity of seeing before that he had any property about him. - A. I saw some notes when he first came into the bar.</p>

Yes, they went and searched for the woman and found her in Carter-street, Tooley-street; the next morning, about half after five o'clock, she was searched and nothing was found but a silver pencil case belonging to the prisoner.</p>

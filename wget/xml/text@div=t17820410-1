               <p>Prisoner. I have a witness in court to prove, that my sister should say my mother gave her the property, which said was given her by my wife; but upon account of some words with her, she said she would be revenged of me some how or other.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>On the 12th of February twelve months, I heard the cry of fire, and got out of bed, and asked the watchman where it was, he informed me it was at King Edward's Stairs, I got up, knowing several masters I had worked for there; Mr. Evans was one, seeing his house in danger I went there, and asked if he would have a cart or two, to assist in carrying his property away, he said, Asstill fetch me one or two down, I went away immediately and brought a town cart and horses to his door, and informed him it was there, I got up into the cart, the fire men brought up the goods into the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178204100005"></xptr> cart faster than I could stow them; at the farther end of the court I asked for the assistance of one or two of the fire-men, they were obliged to lay them in the street at the tail of the cart, he got up and we stowed them in the cart, when they were loaded Mr. Evans ordered me to carry them to Wapping Wall; I went with them to several places upon Wapping Wall, the fire-men took them out of the cart again, and saw all the property was clean out of the cart before I went back; when Mr. Evans, about the middle of the day, told me he should want me no more, and asked me to go and have some refreshment, I went, and had some victuals and beer; one of the fire-men came the next day, and informed me, Mr. Evans wanted the cart to fetch the things back; the fire-men put them into the cart, I drove them to Mr. Evans's house; the house not being damaged I drove them there, the fire-men took them out of the cart again, Mr. Evans asked what my demand was, I told him how many load I carried, he gave me two guineas for my trouble; sometime after that, I believe it was near two months, I was at work, and I was informed how there had been such a warrant to search my house, upon suspicion I should have taken some things of Mr. Evans's at the time he had employed me; they searched my house, they found nothing upon my premises, they got a search warrant to search my mother's, apartment which is a different dwelling-house; they found part of this property there, I was informed there was some goods pawned in my name, over at Mr. Mathews's the pawnbroker (at which I was quite amazed) by the orders of my wife; I asked my wife how or by what means she could come at this property? she made me this answer, that how her mother had been in want of money, and had called her in to carry this property for to make some money for her, upon which, she, as she could not deny her going with the goods, gave them to this woman the evidence here, as she had not been used to carry things to pawn she did not like to go, and she gave them to this woman; as to the property, there was none found in possession of me at any time; I have evidence to call on

               <p>I am a purveyor of scales and weights to his Majesty, I live in Butcher-row, Temple-bar, I am brother to the prisoner and likewise Elizabeth Smith, I thought it fit to convince her of her error, but not to punish her too far for making a report about me, I served her with a Marshal's Court writ as soon as the trial was over, there she said she would be damned, or words to that effect, if she would not hang him, this was on a Friday, and she cried about John, my mother said he had been terribly injured; I went down to the witness Smith, and told her it was very hard she did not go to see her mother when she was dying, she said there had been a great deal of confusion in the family, but she said positively at that time she had them from my mother; as they said he would not be tried to-day, a young man at Newgate door told me so, I applied and asked Mr. Pitt if he could let me in, he knew they would not let me in, so that I could not know from the prisoner when his trial would come on exactly.</p>
               <p>Clerk of Arraigns. The prisoner had particular notice he would be tried at nine o'clock this morning.</p>
               <p>Court. The evidence does not support the charge of stealing them in the dwelling-house, if he did steal them at all he stole them from his own cart; if the prisoner did take them from the cart, instead of carrying them to the place where he was directed, that is a sufficient stealing in point of law to constitute a felony; they were delivered to him to carry to a particular place, if he took them out of his cart with intent to steal and convert them to his own use, it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178204100006"></xptr> is a felony, but there is no pretence to say they were stolen in the dwelling-house.</p>

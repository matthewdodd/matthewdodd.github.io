                  </hi>. I live in Rawstorne-street, Clerkenwell—the prisoner was my apprentice and shopman. On the 20th of April I put some pieces of cloth away in a bundle—on the 24th I missed them—I suspected the prisoner—on the Monday morning when I went into the shop I found him with his hat on ready to go—he said, "I am up before you this morning"—I said, "Yes, and so you were on Saturday morning, I suppose"—he said, "No, I was not"—I attended to my work—in about half an hour he said, "Well, I think we had better have a <hi rend="italic">tussell</hi> to get the street-door open"—I had locked it to prevent his going—I said, "Very well," and directed my mother to call a policeman—I returned to the shop—the prisoner said, "You had better open that street-door, or else I will make you"—I said, "You will?"—he said, "Yes, I will upset you in about two minutes"—I bolted him in, he began kicking as hard as he could, and got something to wrench the door</p>

               <p>open—a policeman was called in—I had broken his box open on the Sa<lb></lb>turday, and there I found the cloth which I had put into the bundle—I meant to get the things out, lock them up, and make no disturbance about it—I did not intend to prosecute him, if he had not behaved as he did—when the policeman came in, I accused the prisoner of robbing me—he directly said it was not mine, and I had no business with it—the police<lb></lb>man then took him in charge for stealing the things I found in his box—I missed them on Sunday morning—this is the cloth I found in his box—this black remnant I had left in cutting out a coat and trowsers, and I in<lb></lb>tended making a waistcoat of it.</p>

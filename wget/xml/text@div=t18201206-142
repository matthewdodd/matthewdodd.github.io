            . I am a dress-maker. I went out on the 27th of November into the mob, hearing a bustle at the top of Silver-street, Kensington Gravel-pits, and saw Sterns take May by the collar, that was the first I saw. There was a crowd there. I looked round and May either fell or was knocked down. Cooling ran from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Cooling did not strike him - A. No, he ran away. May ran after Cooling and brought another young man instead of him, to a light, and said,</p>
               <p>"Is it you, Mr. Osborne?" Sterns insisted on his letting the man go, as he was not the man he had before. May told him to mind his own business. Sterns laid hold of him with his left hand, and struck him - he fell towards me - he was knocked down - the crowd pushed in before me. I saw no blows, only heard them. There were fifty or an hundred people round. Sterns gave May in charge of a constable.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Sterns gave the deceased in charge - A. Yes - the disturbance began before I got up - I saw nobody strike him.</p>

He said there was a row in the Hoop - we went back to see. I saw a skirmish in the passage, and Mrs. May at the door with two children. I persuaded her to come out, some of them returned to the tap-room and some to the parlour. I followed May into the tap-room, and saw Cooling strike him in his face; he fell on his back. I was not there at the beginning. May got on his legs, and caught hold of Cooling, and turned him out of the house. I remained in the tap-room, and picked up three hats off the floor. I went out, but did not go towards the mob for sometime. When I did go I saw them collar May and strike him several blows until he fell down. Sterns said he would give him a night in the watch-house, sent for a constable, and said he would hold him till the constable came. I went to my club, and May afterwards came into the club-room and paid his money. I do not know how it began.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ALLEY. Q. Did you not tell the Magistrate May was drunk - A. I do not think he was. I said he was not in liquor. I said he might be in liquor.</p>

Cooling said, "You are a boasting man now you have got your 30 s. a week. D - n my eyes, I am as good a man as you." May collared him, and said, he would take him to the watch-house, and then the scuffle began. A man ran out of the parlour, they said it was Tuck. He hit May over the head.</p>

I ran into the mob, and saw May holding Cooling with both hands across an iron bar with three spikes, and kicking him on his legs and shins. Cooling cried for mercy, and begged some one to fetch Osborne. I thought Cooling's life in danger and fetched a constable. I returned and saw May following Cooling, he fell across the curb. I saw no one till he brought Osborne back. He got clear of him. May then turned round and struck Sterns, who repeated the blow. I sent for another constable at Mr. Stern's request, and he gave May in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Did not Sterns ask if he meant to murder the poor fellow while he held Cooling - A. He did. I saw Cooling's legs next morning, they were kicked in such a manner they were quite scabbed.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and work under May. On this afternoon he said he was going to his club, when he had seen the men on their patrol. I went with him, he was a little in liquor, and gave me his watch. I was in the Hoop, he came in, and said</p>
               <p>"Give me what you have in your pocket." Cooling said,</p>
               <p>"D - n you, do you think I am going to thieve your watch?" he said he made himself very busy about the watch he had of Arthurs'. Cooling said,</p>
               <p>"I am as good a man as you, and will fight you." May said he would not fight, but put him in the watch-house, and collared him, and pulled him out to the door. Cooling held by the cill of the door to prevent being pulled out. Tuck came from the parlour and struck May. I went to hinder him, and he hit me down, and several fell over me. I afterwards went out and saw them struggling, but saw no blows. Sterns threw May down - he got up and ran after Cooling.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I attended the deceased - he had some symptoms of inflammation - he had no bruise whatever in his body, he had a black eye; he died on the 7th. His symptoms were those which a man would have with water on the chest. Mr. George opened him.</p>

            . I attended while Mr. George opened the body. Two quarts of water were in the chest, which was undoubtedly the cause of his death.</p>

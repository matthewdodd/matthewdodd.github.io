               <p>Q. Where was this money? - In a box in the room that the prisoner and I lay in. On the Friday night before this happened, this man was out all night; on Saturday morning he came in when I was thinking of getting up, and went to bed, I got up and went out about a little business, and I came in in the course of the afternoon; I went to the box and opened the box, and took out my pocket book, and took a guinea out of it, and put it into my pocket book, and left eleven guineas in it; I locked up the box again; the prisoner was laying on the bed at the time. On Saturday night the prisoner and I lay together; on Sunday morning (I never observed any thing a matter with my box) I cleaned myself and went out pretty soon in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160007"></xptr>morning, between nine and ten o'clock, and I left the prisoner in bed; I did not return till between the hours of eleven and twelve at night; I went up stairs and missed the box, and found the prisoner in bed; I enquired of the young woman that cleaned the room, whether she had seen any thing of it; she told me she had never been in the room from the time that I left it, as the prisoner was in bed, till she had cleaned herself, and she was not then in a condition to do the business of the room. Then by making an enquiry for the box, there was a young man up stairs that lay in the room, and he told me it was in his room; I went up stairs, and found the box and some bits of wood in the room were the box was taken to; one of the pieces was about five inches long, and an inch and a half wide, where the box was broke.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. How many other persons lodge in the house besides these? - Nobody but the family of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. This was a public house, and on Sunday these persons have a number of persons coming to see them? - Nobody came to see me, I was out at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray where was it you found this box? - In the room over head.</p>
               <p>Q. That was not in the room where the prisoner lodged? - No, he lodged in the same room as I did, and in the same bed.</p>
               <p>Court. Who inhabits that room where you found the box? - The two witnesses.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. How many boxes had you in your room? - Two</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of boxes were these? - The one that my money was in, was rather slighter than the other which I kept my clothes in, but I put the money there because I thought if any thing should happen of this sort, it would not be suspected so soon, to be where my tools and dirty linen were.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not there a man, a waterman, lived in the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he left the house soon after this transaction? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. That man is one of the witnesses on the trial? - Yes, he is.</p>

               <p>Q. Then subsequent to this time, that you made this demand on the prisoner, you left him and found him at his work? - Yes, I found him in the same place.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, have you always given the same account of this transaction as you have at present? - Yes; to what was asked me I have said the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if you was asked a little more you would say a little more. Where did you get all this money? - By my industry.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, how much money had you on the Saturday? - Sometimes two guineas, for my week's labour I mean.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money was you master of on Saturday morning? - I was master of twelve guineas; a guinea of which I took out of my box and put into my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, of course, on Sunday morning you had more than the eleven guineas and this guinea that you took out of your pocket book? - No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of your week's earnings? - I did not work that week, because work was stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had this money been in your pocket book? - I cannot say how long.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you count it last? - I counted it on Saturday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no more than twelve guineas? - No more.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how did you subsist the week if you did not work? - I had some silver in my pocket that I subsisted with.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever tell any body that you had eleven guineas in your pocket book? - I said at the time when the money was gone, somebody asked me what was lost, I said, perhaps it may be fourteen, fifteen, or sixteen guineas; but that was including my clothes and tools; but when I went to the box I found it to be only the eleven guineas from the pocket book.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you give me this answer when you had been to your box and seen that the eleven guineas were gone? Upon your oath would you have missed your things if they had not been there? - No, I should not at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you say that you had not the anxiety to examine whether any thing else was gone, when you found your money was gone? - I had not the curiosity to examine at that time.</p>

            ; he missed his box as soon as he went into his room; he then went down stairs and asked if the servant had moved his box out of his room? I heard him enquire for the box, and I called to him and told him there was a box in my room; he then came up; as soon as he came to the foot of the bed he sees his pocket book laying at the foot of the bed, as soon as he sees his pocket book laying at the foot of the bed, he said that he was undone, that his money was taken from him. He then went down and called up the landlady of the house, Mrs. Kavener, and he unlocked the box before Mrs. Kavener, and he found nothing disturbed in the box, only the place where the pocket book lay, where a hand was put in.</p>

               <p>Q. You took no notice of this box until the disturbance was made in the house? - I see it lay on the bed; but I thought it belonged to the waterman, as it was on the waterman's bed.</p>

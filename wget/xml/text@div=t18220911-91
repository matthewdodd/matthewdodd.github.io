            ; we live in Percy-street, Gray's Inn-road. On Saturday last, between eight and nine o'clock at night, I was in <placeName id="t18220911-91-crimeloc501">Fleet-market</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18220911-91-crimeloc501" type="placeName" value="Fleet-market"></interp>

I am certain the prisoner is one of the men; he was a stranger before; he spoke to me, for I complained of their pressing on me, and he said, if I could not come there in a good temper, I had better go home. I let go my friend's arm and ran out of the market, being alarmed. I put my hand in my pocket and found it cut; my gown and petticoat were cut right down. I saw the prisoner again on the Monday, in Great Queen-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields - I was then alone - I was convinced he was the person; I gave no alarm. I saw him again at half-past nine o'clock that morning, at Mr. Loveday the pawnbroker's, offering some duplicates, which were part of the contents of the pocket-book. I charged him with being the person who stole my pocket-book; he denied it, but said he had found it; he held it out - I snatched it from him, and gave it to Mr. Loveday. A constable was sent for, who secured him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. The market was much thronged and crowded - A. Not particularly so; I found nothing unpleasant till this bustle; there might be ten or twelve round me; I was passing a butcher's shop; there was no oyster stall near. The prisoner was scuffling with the men and bustling to stop the progress of the people - he in particular pushed me about.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he scuffling with the other men - A. Boxing each other with their arms. There was nothing but duplicates and memorandums in the pocket-book. When I saw him in Queen-street, he was not pointed out to me. I had been to the pawnbroker's in Covent-garden and Long-acre, as some of the duplicates belonged to these shops, and found somebody had been there. He said he found the pocket-book.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Calthorpe-place, Gray's Inn-road. I know Mrs. Morgan. On Monday morning, a little before ten o'clock, the prisoner came into one of the boxes of my shop, and presented two duplicates, which he said he wanted out; Mrs. Morgan had been in the shop two minutes before, to stop them; they were for a child's coat, earrings, and a piece of silver. Mrs. Morgan was still in the shop. I went round the passage and beckoned her out; I took her to the box door, and asked her if she knew the prisoner; she said in his bearing she knew him perfectly well; that he was the man who robbed her. I told him the prosecutrix had lost a pocket-book, and he had better give it her, as I dare say she did not wish to hurt him. He produced a pocket-book, and said he picked it up; she claimed that and the two duplicates. There were some papers in it, and another duplicate of my shop; he went to the passage-door, pretending to call a person who was with him - none came. Two officers took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He came under no concealment - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>MRS. MORGAN. The duplicates are for things I pawned myself, in the name of Smith.</p>
               <p>CHERUBIM LACY. I live in Francis-street, Gray's Inn-road. I went to market with Mrs. Morgan. I noticed a scuffle and people pressing on her; and Mrs. Morgan soon after missed her pocket-book; they pressed on me at the same time. She shewed me her pocket, which was cut and slit down. I remember the features of one man, but have not seen him since. I do not know the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it in the middle of the market - A. About the middle; there were a great many round; we were close to a butcher's. I saw no oyster stall.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was going by Loveday's, and heard prosecutrix say to the prisoner, that he was the man who hustled her on Saturday evening; he said he was an honest man - that he found the pocketbook, and if she would pay him for finding it, he would deliver it up; she insisted that he was the man, and I took him. I found three silver tea, and four plated spoons, and two dessert spoons, two pair of earrings, one brooch, one ring, and one knife, and four duplicates on him. Mrs. Morgan claimed them all.</p>
               <p>MRS. MORGAN. They are all mine, and what I had pawned - and the duplicates of which were in my pocketbook; the four duplicates are mine; they had been redeemed from Turner's, Bridge-street, and Page's, in Long-acre.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110049"></xptr>I lost eleven duplicates in all - two are missing, and the goods redeemed.</p>

            . I live in Love-grove, Fleet-market. On this Saturday night, the prisoner's wife employed me to mind the children. I was there till one o'clock in the morning. I saw him come in - he told his wife he had found a prize - that he had picked up a pocket-book; he opened it on the table, and found nothing in it but tickets; he cannot read or write, and did not know what to make of them; this was about half-past twelve o'clock; he said he found it by his stall in coming home.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Does his wife read - A. No, nor I; he went out about twenty minutes past seven o'clock on Monday. I do not know how he found his way to the pawnbrokers.</p>

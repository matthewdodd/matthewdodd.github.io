            . I took William Peacock about five o'clock in the afternoon, with this sack of oats, beans, and chaff in his hands outside Mrs. Mary Gibb's gates, to whom I am servant; I asked how he came by it, he made no answer - I took him into the yard, and sent for an officer; Peacock is a milkman, and keeps a green-grocer's shop - he wished me not to make a piece of work; before I saw Peacock I saw a coal-waggon outside the door, I do not know whose it was - I had been called to look under the manger, where I saw the same bag, with the same articles<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040021"></xptr>in it - I set a person to watch it; Ade worked for my mistress - the value of this is about 3s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is Mrs. Gibbs here? A. No; I am ostler there, and Ade was employed there - I did not see Peacock speak to the persons with the waggons, they had three or four horses in each - he had served me with milk; he came across to me; I had not called him - he held out the bag to Ade; I had hold of him by the collar - what he said was so very low, I could not hear him; I did not hear him say "Here's this bag back, I don't know what it is;" I was in a bustle at the time - I took Ade up, and gave him in charge - he was let go out of the yard - the gate was shut; there was another way he might have gone out - he went by himself to get his coat and hat; Peacock was going towards his own home when I first saw him, but he came across to me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you first saw him. did you see any thing in his hand? A. Not at first, but when he came back, just passing the horses' heads, I saw the bag in his hand, he had got about fifteen yards; I cannot say whether he saw me before he turned back - I suspect so; he could have seen me, his side face was towards me.</p>

            . I am a gentleman's servant. I went to Mrs. Gibbs' stables about nine o'clock in the morning of the 7th of November, to see a young man, and while I was talking to him I saw this bag under the manger; I asked him what was there - he said he did not know; I pulled it from under the manger, and then went and told the ostler, who came and looked at it, and desired me to put it back again, which I did - he then told me to watch to see who took it away; I stopped till about five o'clock in the afternoon, and Ade went to the public-house to get a light - during that time Summers told me to lie down in the next manager; I lay there about ten minutes, and saw Ade come and take this bag up - I followed him, and saw him deliver it to Peacock, who was about ten yards from the gates.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was Peacock there to serve milk? A. Yes; I did not see how far he got from the gates - I saw him again in about five minutes; I did not hear him say he got it from Ade.</p>

            . Q. Did you see any thing of its being put into the waggon? A. No - but the waggoner came into the yard, and said that Peacock had put it into the waggon; I do not know the bag.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you ever say you saw Peacock put it into the waggon? A. No; the carter came into the yard, and said Peacock had put it into the waggon, then served a house with milk, and then came and took it; I keep the key of the corn-bin, but do not always lock the door - and did not that morning.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What does the bag contain? A. Oats, beans, and chaff, mixed, and a stable rubber, which I know- it is such a mixture as we regularly feed the horses with- I told Peacock he ought to be ashamed of himself to rob us; they both said, "Don't make a peace of work" - I said I could not look over it, because we had lost so much- I told Mrs. Gibbs' son of it.</p>

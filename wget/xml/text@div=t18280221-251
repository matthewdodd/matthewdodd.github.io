            . I bought the duplicate of a bed of the prisoner; she said it was a new tick, and a very good one. I sent for the bed; she called upon me again, to know if I could let her have any more, and I said, "Is that a new tick?" she looked round, and said, "Dear me, how came it so dirty?" She then said her aunt had pawned it; and I told her, if she would return the 2s. which I had given her, she might have it again; I afterwards sold it.</p>

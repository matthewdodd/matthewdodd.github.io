               <p>I am servant to Mr. Coxe.</p>
               <p>Do you know of any damage being done to Mr. Coxe's house? - Yes; it was on a Wednesday morning in Jene. I know the prisoner was concerned in it.</p>
               <p>Were there many persons there? - I suppose there might be twenty boys and men concerned. I was in the old dwelling-house which Mr. Coxe used to live in. The old dwelling-house was not injured at that time.</p>
               <p>How far is the old house from the house which was injured? - It may be ten or fifteen yards.</p>
               <p>What was done to Mr. Coxe's house? - They pulled the inside of it out; I saw them carry out the linings of the window's and the skirting of the house, and the middle part of the stairs were entirely destroyed. I could see that from the old dwelling-house, for I never was in the new house. Afterwards some of the floors were taken up.</p>
               <p>Where did you see the prisoner? - I saw him pull the skirting down, which was part of the dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>How long did you see him there? - Ten or fifteen minutes; then I went back again.</p>
               <p>Did you hear him say any thing? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see him do any thing else? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know why they went away? - No.</p>
               <p>Were any of these fifteen or twenty persons employed at the same time? - Yes. They were employed in pulling the boards of the house down.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see the prisoner before? - Yes; I know him by sight.</p>
               <p>What is he? - A <rs id="t17810110-33-deflabel201" type="occupation">carpenter</rs>

               <p>How many people might there be assembled? - Twenty or more. I saw Davy Miller there between the hours of eight and ten, on the Wednesday morning. I saw him pulling at the sash weight.</p>
               <p>How were the others employed? - Some were carrying out boards and timbers belonging<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178101100038"></xptr> to the house. I was standing at the back of this house, in the counting-house of Mr. Coxe's old dwelling-house, with the last witness.</p>

               <p>How came you just now to do it? - There were three or four of us together.</p>
               <p>Is he so desperate a fellow you could not have done it before? - No.</p>

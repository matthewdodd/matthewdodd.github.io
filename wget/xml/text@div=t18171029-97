I went to the prisoner's lodgings and searched her boxes, which the landlady pointed out to me, and found a cap, on which was some lace, which the prosecutrix claimed. When the prisoner came in, I told her I had found it in her box and must take her to the office - She said she knew nothing about it. I enquired for duplicates-she gave me one of a shift, which she took from a drawer in her room; she said it was not the prosecutrix's shift; she told me she had pledged the shift at Mr. Balis's, in Portland-street. I took her there and found it.</p>

I did not know her.</p>

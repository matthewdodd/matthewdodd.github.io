               <p>buildings, Houndsditch. On the 2nd of Sept. I wrote a letter to my brother who was at Loughborough—I enclosed in it a printed card and a half-sovereign—I cut two pieces off the top of the card, and one off the side—both these pieces of card were inclosed in the letter—(<hi rend="italic">looking at two pieces)—they</hi> were in one piece when I put them in—it is the same card—I found this third piece in the house afterwards—I addressed the letter to Mr. A.

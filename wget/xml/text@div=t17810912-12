             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 3d of August, Friday morning, there was a good many officers in Smithfield. Coming by the Rose and Crown, a man came up to me, and said, A young fellow has been offering a horse to me; I believe it is stolen: and he asked me to go to the stable and see it. I went and saw the prisoner, and asked him if he had any horse to sell: he said he had, and shewed me the horse: the prisoner was in the stable at the Rose and Crown in Smithfield, close behind the horse: it was a bay horse. I then asked him how he came by it: he said it was his own; his father gave it to him; that he lived at Honiton in Lincolnshire. I then searched him, and found this pistol upon him, loaded; my partner took another out of his other pocket.</p>
               <p>What did he say that his name was? - I can't recollect now; but he gave a wrong name. We took him to the office, and he was committed: the same afternoon, Mr. Lowe came up, and owned his horse, which I had taken to the George, in Long-acre; I was present.</p>
               <p>What time in the afternoon did he go there? - About five or six in the evening.</p>
               <p>Was the horse led out and shewn him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came Lowe to come there? - He went and enquired after the horse in Smithfield, and was told the man was taken up for horse-stealing; and he came to the office. I am positive the horse the prosecutor saw at the George was the horse found with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>To Lowe. When you went to the George, in Long-acre, the horse was brought out to you? - Yes. I am sure it was mine: he had a black mane and tail, and a blaze in his forehead; he had black legs, with two white heels behind: I bred him from a colt.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the prisoner? did you ever see him? - I never saw him before that day.</p>
               <p>Was the field shut or open? - It was an inclosed field; there were other horses with it.</p>

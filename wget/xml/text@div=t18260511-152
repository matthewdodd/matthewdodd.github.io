The prisoner came to my shop on the 11th of May, about half-past four o'clock - she asked to look at some buttons - my young man showed her some, which she did not like, and told him to show her some others - while he was gone for them I saw her take this card of buttons from the counter; I went to the top of the shop - watched her, and saw her trying to conceal them between those she had in her hand, and so drop them into her apron; I said nothing, but followed her out, and asked her to walk back into the shop, which she did; I said"You have something which does not belong to you" - she then threw them down on the counter, and said "There they are."</p>

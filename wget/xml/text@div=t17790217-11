               <p>I am a watchman belonging to St. Giles's parish. At about a quarter after four in the morning, as I was crying the hour, I saw the prisoner with the drawers on his head; I asked him where he was going; he said he came from Greek-street, and was going to Fullwood's-rents; he said he was sent by his master, who was a barber; I asked him if he had the keys, he said no; I asked him the contents of the drawers, he said it was linen. I secured him, and took him to the watch-house; the patrol were in the watch-house; I desired them to assist me to see what was in the drawers, we examined them; I left them in the possession of Atwood, one of the patrol.</p>

He bid me go on while he made water, and while he stopped to make water the watchman secured me.</p>

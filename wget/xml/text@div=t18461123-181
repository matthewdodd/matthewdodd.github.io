I was on duty about ten o'clock at night, on the 6th of Nov., near the Ship public-house, at Wands<lb></lb>worth—the prisoner came out and told me he meant to have some of those bricks (pointing to a stack) to pave a sty—I said, "You are not going to be so foolish as that; you may be put into the station-house"—(I had known him some time, and knew nothing against him)—he said, "Well, call me up at two o'clock"—he works at Mr. Watkins's distillery—I went to his house at two o'clock, and saw something white in the corner of the yard, and there I found nineteen bricks—I went to the stack, and found they corresponded with the bricks there—the stack is 167 yards from his house one way, and the other way 147 yards—I produce one of the bricks—they are marked, and have a hole in them—I called the prisoner, but he never got up till six o'clock—I then went up to him—I said, "I want you down stairs about the bricks"—he said, "I have not brought them there"—his father said, "They were not there last night."</p>

I went to his lodgings on the Monday morning, and there found three yards of blue huffily. I lost six yards; and two yards of Manchester velvet, and five yards of fustian. I found him at the Thistle and Crown, an alehouse in Russel-court. I charged him with stealing some duffil out of my shop that same day. The landlord said, he had courted him four or five days to have a remnant of Manchester velvet, which he said was in pawn. I said, I had lost a piece torn at the end. When I saw it, I found it was my property. The remnant of the other duffil I found at a pawnbroker's. I found the fustian at a piece-broker's shop, named Reynolds, in White-horse-yard.</p>

I carried them to Mrs. Reynolds, and pawned them for 14 s. He gave me some beer; and I gave him the money. After that, he came and brought me some fustian, which I pawned for him. After that, he went for a soldier, and said, if I would fetch these things out of pawn, I might have them for myself.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose any property there - A. I did, on the 1st of February last; I lost a twenty pound note; I saw the note on the evening of the 31st of January, and missed it on the 1st of February; it had been placed in a writing desk which had been locked up in a cupboard in my drawing room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your writing desk locked - A. No; the cupboard was locked, and the key kept in a small drawer in the glass; the prisoner lived in the house, she was Mrs. Atkins' <rs id="t18090215-19-deflabel105" type="occupation">servant</rs>

               <p>Q. Did she know that you used to keep the key in the glass in the drawer - A. I do not know. I have seen the bank note since in the possession of the officer. The money belonged to some money which Mrs. Atkins sent down to Oxford for me; I went down to Oxford on the 27th of January; I received it on the next day at Oxford.</p>
               <p>Q. How many bank notes did you receive of Mrs. Atkins - A. One hundred and twenty six pounds I received of Mrs. Atkins.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that all in bank notes - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the bank note you lost was one of those you received of Mrs. Atkins - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any account of the number or the dates - A. Not I, but Mrs. Atkins did before she sent them me.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say that which you lost was the one you received from her - A. Yes, because I had no other money, except that I had from her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. If Mr. Holmer will forgive me this time I will never do so again.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner at Mrs. Atkins' house, in Cork street, on the 1st of February; I searched her; I asked her if she had heard any thing of a twenty pound note that Mr. Holmer had lost; she said she had heard of it; I asked her if she knew any thing about it; she said she did not, she knew nothing of any note but a one pound note which she had in her box, I was very welcome to look at it; I then asked her if she would let me look at was in her pockets; she put her right hand in her right hand pocket; I supposed she was pulling something out; I laid hold of that hand and pulled it out myself; in her hand was this green leather purse; I asked her what she had got there; she said nothing; I said I must see what was in it, I opened it and in it was this twenty pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Atkins. Is that one of the notes that you sent - A. I believe it is the same note; it is the same number, 1464 for twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you took the number of the notes - A. I wrote no more than twenty pounds, 1464.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has the prisoner lived with you - A. She came to me on the 20th of January, she had been with me a fortnight; I made a mistake, she came to me on a Friday.</p>

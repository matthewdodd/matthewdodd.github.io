            . My husband is a lighterman; I live at No. 8 in the Almonry. On Sunday the 26th of August, between twelve and one, I heard murder called out, I went to the passage of the deceased's house, I saw the deceased, she was all in a gore of blood, and she had hold of the prisoner's jacket, the prisoner was trying to get away from her, and she was trying to go after him, she had got still hold of his jacket: there is a dark place in the passage where Carney used to keep pigs; he called her a very bad name, and said, let loose my jacket; I will not, she said, I am murdered; he turned round and gave her a woeful blow over the mouth with the hammer, and twisted himself out of her hands, and he ran to his own back door, got within, and shut it; then his wife came to the door and called out to the deceased, for God's sake go away; she spoke through a hole in the door; the deceased said she would not, she was murdered; he put his arm through the hole in the door and hit her another violent blow with the hammer in the same place, and the blood flowed over the mouth, then she fell back into my arms; Mrs. Douglas took the deceased from me, and I went for a constable. I saw the deceased go to the hospital, and I saw her on the next day, I never saw her after that. I never saw Carney afterwards until I saw him here, I know he was away.</p>

            . I was house-surgeon at Westminster Infirmary. On Sunday the 26th of August Martha Birt was brought to the Westminster Hospital as a casualty; I saw her on the Monday morning, she had received a wound on the upper lip, which had divided it, and which had been dressed on the day proceding by a surgeon in attendance. The upper jaw was not injured in the least; I perceived no other injury. I was informed that she was in a state of intoxication when brought to the hospital; there did not appear any injury but the one on her lip. She was admitted an out-patient, and came to the hospital as directed for six or seven days; an inflammation having attacked the place, spreading towards the head, it was judged proper to make her an in-patient.</p>
               <p>Q. The inflammation attacked what place - A.About the lip, and it did spread generally over the face, and head, and then from certain symptoms it was considered to extend to the brain; she had a violent pain in her head, with blood-shot eyes, it was considered of having attacked the brain; six or seven days previous to her death she became delirious, in which state she continued attended with a sympathetic fever until the 26th of September, and that day she died. The lips of the wound, when first brought to the hospital were put in amputation, and retained there with a silver pin and ligature; the lip was nearly healed on the fourth day subsequent to the receipt of the injury; it was about this time the inflammation, which was of the erysipelas kind, appeared, though it was too slight to occasion a disunion of the edges of the wound; however, it extended gradually all over the face and head, and finally it appeared to have attacked the membranes of the brain, which, with the accompanying sympathetic sever terminated her existence. Early on the morning, the day after her death, I opened her head, I found the membranes covering the brain, much inflamed evidently with the vessels loaded with blood, a serum and lymph coagulated upon the membranes, and between them. No injury had been received at any part of the body. The liver was much diseased, which I imputed to her intemperance of drinking spirits.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, having told us this poor woman's complaints, what in your opinion was the cause of her death - A. I have no doubt her death is to be ascribed to the inflammation of the brain.</p>
               <p>Q. And by what, in your judgment was that inflammation caused - A. I think from the wound. I think she inflammation was caused from the local injury, because it first shewed itself in that part. But I should wish to observe that inflammation was very likely to come on in a constitution like hers, without any wound - in a constitution injured by drinking spirits.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any means of knowing whether she was conformable to your rules and directions - A. I believe she had not; when she came she always had the appearance of having drank spirits, and in examining the lip I perceived her breath smell of gin.</p>
               <p>Q. Under these circumstances are you able to say whether that inflammation was brought on by the wound or by her intemperance - A. I conceived the wound of such a trivial nature that I should not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181105290028"></xptr>hesitate much of having one in my own lip. Where there is a local injury, however slight, the inflammation will seize that part first. I do not say so in a good constitution, but in a bad one, injured by drinking and unwholesome food, and in an unhealthy atmosphere; it was not a wound the least in the world, in my opinion, to occasion death. It has been said that the wound was inflicted by a hammer, I much doubt it.</p>

             I was surgeon that week. I remember the case perfectly well, I remember seeing her, she appeared to me to be a person addicted to drinking spirituous liquors to excess, of consequence she seemed to have an unfound and bad liver, especially liable to a disease called Erysipelas, that is, St. Anthony's Fire, which is considered as a constitutional disorder, spreading itself without limits, unlike other inflammations which stop at certain periods. When I saw 
               <persName id="t18110529-25-person277">
                  Martha

                  </persName>
             about the second day after the reception into the hospital, I saw symptoms of that disorder all over her head and face, the marks of St. Anthony's Fire distinctly so, there being a continuity of the membranes of the head on the outside of the head with those inside. We always expect Erysipelas of the head, it spread in this manner; - the wound that was received upon the lip was not upon a vital part, even the thin bone of the upper jaw was not shattered, which is thin and cancellated; I considered the wound by no means a mortal wound, but that the subsequent disease was a dangerous disease, to wit, the Erysipelas. I directed the body to be examined but was not present.</p>
               <p>Q I will now ask you, sir, whether, from the account you have heard Mr Downing give, you think the injury she received was the cause of her death - A. Any less injury, bleeding, or the pricking of a pin I think simply; the wound on the lip produced the Erysipelas, or it might have arisen spontaneous, but as we traced it from the wound we ascribe that as the cause of it; I consider that was the producing cause.</p>
               <p>Mr. Downing. I think there must be a mistake about the hammer producing the injury of the lip, if I had cut it with a knife it could not have been more smooth; I saw it within forty-eight hours after the receipt of the injury. If it had been cut by the edge of a hammer it must have injured the gum or teeth; a slight blow will knock the front teeth out; I saw no injury of the gum. I never heard her complain of ill-treatment from any person whatever. She complained of a fall.</p>

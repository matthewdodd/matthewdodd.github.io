                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, living at Pleasant Cottage, King's Road, Tottenham—on 21st March, about 5.30 o'clock, I was walking along the High Road, Tottenham—I heard a noise behind me, looked round and saw two empty waggons with two horses to each, going from eight to ten miles an hour—Henson was driving the first van—I could not swear to the other—I saw the deceased in the road, stooping, collecting manure—I heard a deal of shouting from the drivers of both vehicles as they passed me, they were standing up and throwing their arms about—it appeared to me that they were urging their horses on—I then saw the old man down in the road and the two off wheels of the first van went over him—the driver pulled up afterwards as quickly as he could—I went to the deceased's assistance and carried him into Mr. Hall's surgery.</p>

I was about 100 yards from the waggons when I first observed them, going in the same direction—it was quite light—there was a great clattering of the wheels—they were large, heavy, high waggons—it was the noise they made as well as the voices that caused me to look round—the deceased was 50 or 60 yards from me when the waggons passed me—the road seemed very clear for that time of day—there are usually a great number of vehicles going home from market—the motion in the men's arms might be in attempting to pull up the horses—if I had been in the position of the deceased it is quite likely I could have got out of the way—he was deaf.</p>

I am a printer, of Wilton Cottages, Tottenham—on 21st March I was walking on the High Road, and saw the two vans coming towards me, racing—they were urging their horses on—I saw the deceased in the road gathering manure—the hinder van was trying to pass the other—I heard Henson call out—I saw the old man knocked down—when I first saw the vans they were about 40 yards from me, and about 20 yards from the deceased—I can't say how far from him the van pulled after he was knocked down—the driver tried hard to pull up before the deceased was knocked down—he was shouting out "Hie! hie!" for him to get out of the way—I never saw vans go so fast before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a meat salesman, of 49, Central Meat Market—I was walking in the High Road, near Bruce Grove, and saw the waggons—Henson was in the first waggon, standing up and urging the horses along by thrashing them and shouting out to them—the waggoner behind was also doing the same, trying to pass the first waggon—I went into the middle of the road, held up my umbrella, and said, "Steady, steady, you stupid fellows!"—they were going about 10 miles an hour, as I judged, going very fast for a short distance—they passed me—they continued shouting and driving fast as before—I saw some persons trying to stop them—there was a general excitement on the path—I saw the old man knocked down, and the two off wheels of the waggon pass over the middle of his body—I was about 10 or 15 yards from them—I should think Henson's waggon was pulled up within 20 feet beyond him—there was a separation of about 10 feet between the two waggons—when they stopped, the body of the deceased was between the two waggons—the hind one pulled up before it came to him—I spoke to both the drivers afterwards, and they were quite sobers—when I raised my um<lb></lb>brella I think the man in the second waggon did tighten his reins—I don't know whether the first driver noticed me—he did not pull up until he had run over the man.</p>

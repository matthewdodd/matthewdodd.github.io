               <p>FRANCES NALDER. Q. You are a marshall - A. I am. On the 18th of June, a very serious fire took place in Bury-street, St. Mary Axe; I was called to it in the situation I hold; I observed the prisoner very active in and out of several houses. I observed him coming from the house which I understood was occupied by Mr. Samuda, he had then on a similar jacket to what he has on now, perhaps the very same jacket. I observed his pockets to be very bulky; I went up to him and asked him what he had in his pockets; his answer was what was that to me, he had nothing belonging to me; I shewed him my staff of office, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181107100019"></xptr>told him who I was, and insisted on searching him, he resisted me immediately; with great difficulty and with the assistance of four or five people I searched him, I found several articles, three pair of stockings, braces, a hat brush, and a pair of shoes. Upon looking into the shoes I observed the makers name in Shoemaker row, I went to the shoemaker, he told me they were Mr. Samuda's shoes; I found where Mr. Samuda was, at a house, No. 5, Coopers row, Tower Hill; I went to him, and asked him if he had lost any thing; he said he did not know that he had; I produced the shoes to Mr. Samuda, he laid they were his; I searched the prisoner, I found a watch and eleven guineas in gold; however I could not get an owner to anything but the shoes; I understand the prisoner up to this time has borne an exceeding good character.</p>
               <p>MR. SAMUDA. Q Are these your shoes - A. Yes. When I last saw then they we in the back room of our house in Bury-street next door to the fire.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence.</p>

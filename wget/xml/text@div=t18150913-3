On the 24th of July last, at eleven o'clock at night, I locked my cellar door; the window of the cellar was barred. I was called up the next morning at five o'clock, and then the cellar door was fast; I unlocked it, and on going in, the casement of the window was open, and the bar was taken down, and placed on a ledge inside the cellar. I can't say that I looked at the window, to see if it was fast the night before; but it was impossible for any one get out while the bar was up. I know nothing of the contents of the cellar.</p>

            , in the capacity of laundry-maid. There were some cheese and loaves in the cellar before my master locked it, on the night of the 24th of July; there were three quartern loaves, two half quartern loaves, a large piece of cheese, a small piece of boiled beef, and a small piece of roast beef; there was also some salt beef uncooked; altogether they were worth more than seven or eight shillings. I called my master at five o'clock in the morning of the 25th, and he went into the cellar. I saw the state of the window the night before, and it was safe; it was tried, but I was not present. I opened the casement the night before, to admit the air; the bar was then fast. I then went into the laundry, and missed the ironing cloths. The laundry is about two yards from the dwelling-house. I had been in the laundry the night before, and saw the ironing clothes, and a pair of sheets; and at five o'clock in the morning, I missed them. They were worth ten shillings at least.</p>

            . I am a hair-dresser, and live at No. 1, George-street, St. Giles's. I purchased some articles from the prisoner at the bar, about two months ago; I saw him at a public-house in my neighbourhood one morning; there was lot a of victuals laying on a table, and the people all round were eating of them. I asked him, if they were to be sold; and he said, yes, and I should have them all very reasonable; there was a piece of cooked beef, and a piece of uncooked, a quartern loaf, a piece of cheese, and half of another quartern loaf; these things were in a basket, but that, he did not sell. I bought all for six or seven shillings. I conveyed the victuals in the basket to my place. He told me on my enquiring of him, that he knew an old house-keeper who used to save broken victuals for him, and used to give him several old things about the house; and the next day he was to go, and fetch some old pieces of blankets. He brought me the blankets by agreement the next day, and some old sheets; and I bought them of him. The basket he left till he came again, for he said, he must take it back again to the house-keeper. When I was asked a few days go, I gave up all I had.</p>

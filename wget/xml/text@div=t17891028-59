               <p>I know the two prisoners by sight; I saw them the 21st or 22d of September, between four and five, or about five, I observed two men from a window where I lodge, No. 15, Quebec-street, taking off some lead from an unfinished house in the Circus; I knew them by sight: I can only speak to one of the prisoners, which is

            , his jacket and apron, and every thing correspond: I saw one take a hammer and wrench some of the lead off the gutter, and sold it upon the parapet wall; they appeared to me to put it into the garret window; I saw no more at that time: about five minutes after I saw him on the ground, in the Circus, and in about half after six I saw one at the watch-house.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178910280058"></xptr>Court. Are you sure Lucas was one of them? - I can only speak as to his dress; he had a kind of flannel like jacket, white, and a canvass apron, like, and a round hat; I knew his person again when I saw him; he had the same dress on.</p>
               <p>Did you know him to be the same man, when you saw him at the watch-house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know whose house this was? - One Mr. Esquire Tapps, so named.</p>
               <p>Do you know of your own knowledge? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoners Counsel. You from a window saw a man behind a parapet wall doing something to the roof? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That man had the appearance of a workman, in a flannel jacket, and apron on? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There were many workmen about that building, at that time? - Yes, there were several.</p>
               <p>Therefore of course some of them might be very lawfully employed about that building? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You afterwards saw the prisoner with such a jacket on, and apron, like a workman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He is a workman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Afterwards the prisoner was at the magistrates? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And he was admitted to bail? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And he surrendered here to take his trial? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now I do not understand you to swear to this man positively, behind the parapet wall? - This person was on the back front of the house, doing something to the garret windows; he went from that house.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear more to Lucas, than by the circumstance you set out with fairly and honestly, that he had the same sort of dress with the man ripping the lead? - That is all I can say.</p>
               <p>Was you in the coach the next day, going to the magistrates? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you say then, that Lucas was not the man you had seen behind the parapet, or that if he was he had changed his dress? - I did not say any such thing.</p>

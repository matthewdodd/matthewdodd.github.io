On Tuesday, the eighteenth of this month I lost the property; about seven o'clock in the evening I crossed the street to speak to an opposite neighbour, and on my turning my back to his house, I saw the prisoner walking backwards and forwards at the front of my house; after seeing him make two or three attempts to go into the shop, I went over to my shop and informed my wife, who was in the parlour; she disturbed him two or three times; I came to the door and looked at him; he would not go away; I went across the way and waited a considerable time; he after two or three times attempting, went into the shop, took the goods mentioned in the indictment from off a pile. I then crossed the street, and when he came out, with the assistance of a neighbour, took him by the collar; he attempted to drop the goods; I caught them as he was dropping them. I took him to Worship-street office.</p>
               <p>Q. What are the goods - A. Thirty yards of Gingham, and twenty yards of printed cotton.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to character.</p>

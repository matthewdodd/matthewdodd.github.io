On 21st April I went to 130, Drury Lane, with another officer—it is a second-hand tool shop, kept by the prisoner Treasure—I saw him there, and told him we were police officers, and had information that he had some opera glasses—he said "I have no opera glasses in the place except one"—he produced that from the window—I said "You have some more, some better ones than this"—he said "No, I have no other opera glasses in the place"—I asked him if he had any tickets relating to any—he said he did not know, he would see—he opened a desk, and produced three pawn tickets, relating to opera glasses—I said I believed he had others in the place, and I should search—he moved a carpet bag from the shop into the parlour—I said "What is in that bag?—he said "A lot of things"—the bag was taken in the back parlour, and I opened it, with Sergeant Cole—we found five opera glasses in the bag, a watch, and toilet bottles—these two opera glasses were given up to me by the pawnbroker, when I presented the tickets—we found forty-four toilet bottles in the carpet bag—thirty-eight have been identified—when the prisoner produced the opera glass from the window he said that was the only thing he had received from Carter, meaning McCarthy—I had not mentioned Carter's name at all—I also found two dishes, eight match boxes, and a tobacco jar in the carpet bag—they have been shown to the Prosecu<lb></lb>tion—I found a letter dated April 5th in the bag; a second letter on that mantelpiece, and a third in a bureau in the back parlour—I took Treasure in custody for the unlawful possession of the opera glasses and other things—on the way to the station he said the china and the opera glasses were got wrong; but the watches were his own property.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Davis. The prisoner never bought any black-lead; I believe this is our black-lead - we make our bags in a peculiar manner, exactly to fit a weight of 14lbs.; this bag is not now in the state in which we have our's - there are Spanish, Scotch, and Cumberland black-lead - this is Spanish, but it is darker than Spanish generally is.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you make this bag? A. No, I did not see it made, but we always cut our bags of the same size; I have no particular mark on it.</p>

            . I am a Thames-police constable. On the evening of the 12th of January, I saw the prisoner on Tower-hill, about seven o'clock, carrying a basket under his arm; I asked what he was carrying - he said, "A few bits of wood" - I said I doubted he had something more; he then said, a little lead, from where he worked for his own use, which he was going to take to his sister's, in Goodman's-yard; he said he worked for Mr. Davis, in Joiner-street. I asked him if his master knew it - he said yes, he had paid him for 4lbs. on the Saturday night, when he took his wages; I said I thought there was more; he said he thought it was no harm to take a little more (as he worked amongst it,) than the neat weight; there was just 9lbs.</p>

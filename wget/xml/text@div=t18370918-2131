                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Josiah Iles Wathen, a solicitor, in Bedford-row. On Saturday afternoon, the 16th of September, about a quarter after four o'clock, I went down stairs to trim a lamp, and afterwards went to my bed-room, at the top of the house—I found the prisoner there, and said, "Halloa, what do you do here?"—she made no answer—I took her down stairs, and sent for an officer, who went into the room with me, and I found my watch lying on a cap on my drawers—I kept it on a brass hook—it had a chain and leather to it—it was worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it</p>

               <p>about two years ago—I had seen it on the hook about ten minutes before—I also missed a fourpenny and sixpenny piece, which I had left on the table in that room ten minutes before—I had seen the prisoner before when she came there begging—she said nothing when I found her in the room.</p>

I was at work at the prosecutor's house on the 16th of September—the prisoner came in at the parlour door, and asked for Mr. Wathen or the servants—I told her the servant had gone up stairs—I saw her go up stairs, and saw no more of her till she was brought down by the prosecutor—the maid servants were in the garret, as the kitchens were under repair—the street door was open.</p>

I never saw the articles till the man showed them to me—I went there, having known Mr. Wathen many years, and inquired for him—I was informed he was not at home—I asked to see the servants—he directed me up stairs—I went up, and the door was half open—I saw a man coming out of the room—I inquired for the female servants—he said if I would sit down a minute he would send them to me, but I saw nothing till this man came in and gave me in charge—I can bring proof where I had the fourpenny-piece—I got it in Gray's—I nn-lane out of 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have been laundress for seventeen years, to a friend of Mr. Wathen's—if I had allowed the footman to have taken liberties with me, he would not have done as he has.</p>

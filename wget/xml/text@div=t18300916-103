                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18300916-103-defend932 t18300916-103-deflabel551"></join> by profession, and after wasting a rather lengthened career in the uses and abuses of the press, I find myself a solitary individual of the world, a vagabond in appearance, and a beggar, in fact.</p>
               <p>While smarting under this mortifying condition last summer, I composed a work allied to the honour and interest of H. R. H., the Duke of Cumberland, and I refused from the booksellers one hundred guineas for the work. I confided the work to the hands of H. R. H., on the strict condition that he should return it to me, or explain to me the motives of its detention. H. R. H., has detained it in his possession ever since last summer, and has resolutely refused to give me any explanation whatever on the subject. I have wrote to every person attached to the honour and interest of H. R. H.; many remain silent, while others assert that they have been enjoined by H. R. H. by no means to enter into any explanation with me about the work in question. I begged of Mr. Conant, the Magistrate, to apply to H. R. H.; his interposition is interdicted. I caused Messrs. Mounsey and Grey, the Solicitors, to institute legal proceedings against H. R. H.; for the recovery of my work; they wrote to the private secretary of H. R. H.; he made no reply, and they refused to proceed further without I advanced the cost of proceeding by action of trover. I have not, Sir, wherewith to meet the exigencies of the day, much less to go to law with a Prince of the Blood Royal? What am I to do? Am I submissively to lose the subject and fruit of my labour, or am I to recover them, and to repel cruelty and contumely by such means as Fenton and Bellingham were driven to employ? I am doomed, and determined to recover them, or to perish in the attempt, and I now swear by the faith and honour of a man, and by that God who witnesses my distress, arising out of the Duke of Cumberland's conduct towards me, that if H. R. H. persists in detaining my property without explanation, that I will proceed up to London, and make the matter a personal question between us. This must make the question a question of Police, one that must fall within your jurisdiction, but as "prevention of crime" is said to be a marked feature of the New Police, I would implore you, Sir, to communicate with H. R. H., and to see that I recover my property from him without having recourse to measures that appal and horrify the mind. Bellingham wrote a letter of this nature to the late Sir

H. but my work; my property which he detains in his hands, and in proof that I wish to recover my work through legal agency, I invoke your interposition; If you refuse me that interposition, and regard this letter as an idle menace, you will act after the manner of Sir N. Conant, and invite the commission, in place of preventing crime.* I have the honour to be. Sir, your obedient Servant,

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you deliver to Mr. Mayne more than one letter of that description? A. I did, but one other, that was to the same import as this.</p>

            . I am an officer of the Police. On the 17th of July I was stationed at Kensington, and at seven o'clock that morning I saw the prisoner come out of a house, No. 17, King-street, Kensington-square; I followed him to Kew-green, and there saw him accost a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160052"></xptr>man who had the appearance of a servant, dressed in morning, with a white apron on; this was about two hundred yards from the Duke of Cumberland's gate, the servant went in a direction for the Duke's gate; I did not see him enter, as a carriage drove up and hid him from view - I saw the prisoner looking very earnestly into that carriage - I afterwards saw the servant come back, and speak to him; the prisoner walked backwards and forwards in front of the Duke's house for an hour and a half, and then walked away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Who instructed you to follow my steps? A. My superintendent (Mr. Williams) directed me closely to observe you, and follow you wherever you went; he did not tell me for what purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Where you informed my object was assassination? A. Not directly; I had no directions whatever in that respect - I had no instructions to hinder you from committing mischief.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you have prevented me from murdering the person I addressed that day, or any other person? A. Most certainly I would - it did not appear to me that you and the person you spoke to were strangers to each other by any means; I did not see him smile at you; but from the affability of manners, I thought the prisoner and him were acquainted; there was a report of a marriage taking place that morning; I observed a few people going in a direction for the chapel, but not many; there was no public assemblage - I did not know that the Rev. Mr. Jelf, the tutor to Prince George, was going to be married that morning to a lady in waiting.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You did not know that any body belonging to His Royal Highness' household was to be married that day? A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were there not several carriages rolling by the residence of the illustrious personage in question? A. I observed two, one stopped at His Royal Highness' gate; two or three people got out and entered His Royal Highness' residence; two of them were ladies; I cannot swear whether there was a third person or not; I do not know whether you were reading the motto on the carriage, nor whether the motto was"Felix in Felix" - I cannot tell whether you were armed; I saw no arms - he kept his right hand in his coat pocket; the pocket was in the pleat - I could not judge whether any arms were there, as it was a large surtout coat; I saw nobody but the servant hold any conversation with you - I had no instructions to prevent you assassinating any person, but on my own responsibility I would have done it.</p>

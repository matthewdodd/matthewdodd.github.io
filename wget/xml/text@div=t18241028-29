I left them safe about half-past five o'clock on Saturday evening, in a basket on the first floor; the doors were not in at the bottom of the house, nor the windows - they could not be seen by any person passing the house; when I came to work about seven o'clock on the Monday morning they were gone - they were worth about 3 l. I believe some other workmen had been there before me, but they had not missed any tools. I saw a side pillaster and a plane of mine in a house in York-street, on the Saturday following - the prisoner Watts lives in York-street, Westminster. I live at No. 7, Knightsbridge-terrace.</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square. On the 9th of October, I received a warrant to search the house of Watts - Booth was with me; we found a great many carpenter's tools which Booth claimed as his property - the female prisoner was in the house at the time; we understood that they were husband and wife till they were asked the question before the Magistrate - they said they bought the tools of a man who was a carpenter, and appealed to each other to recollect the man's name - it is a sort of old iron shop; part of the tools were exposed for sale - there are two sliding sashes in the window, and they were lying in the window, any person might have seen them.</p>

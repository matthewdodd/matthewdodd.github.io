I came on shore a fortnight ago last Monday; I met the prisoner on the 16th of May, when I had been paid; I went home with her - she said the place belonged to her, and she put her hand into my pocket and took out my sovereigns; I asked what she did that for; she said to take care of them - I would not let her have them, but she would in spite of me; I still stopped, and a man came in and wanted some money of her; I rested still till the man knocked me down - I had given them the last 1s., I had to get some beer - he said she was his sister, or sister-in-law.</p>

The prisoner lodged at my house; I remember the prosecutor coming - he went with her to the front room; they were there some time; the prisoner then went out for pork-chops; I saw some sovereigns in her hand, and said I hoped they did not belong to the man she brought into my place - Crouch, a man who had lived with the prisoner, came in - he knocked the prosecutor down, and I picked him up; he then knocked me down, and almost put my shoulder out - the prosecutor asked the prisoner for his money; she said if he wanted his money he might go elsewhere - he said he did not want to hurt her, he would be contented if she gave him one sovereign.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You saw him give me two sovereigns out of his pocket, when I went to get the chops? A. No, I did not; the usage he had from your young man was shameful; every thing I had in my room was broken to pieces.</p>

             (Police-constable K 61.) The prosecutor fetched me to the house - I found the prisoner there; he charged her with robbing him, and said the man had knocked him down; the prisoner came to the table, took up a knife, and said, "If you charge me with such a sort of thing, I will stick you, or rip you open;" she said the prosecutor gave her the money, and he denied it - I found no money on her.</p>

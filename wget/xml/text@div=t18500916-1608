                  </hi>. I am foreman to George Brown, and two others, chemical manufacturers. The prisoner was in their employ till 3rd Sept.—between five and six o'clock that evening I saw some lead under some dirt near a wall—about a quarter-past six I saw the prisoner—I called him, and charged him with stealing the lead—he said he had taken some lead, and put it on his clogs—there was some sheet lead on bis clogs, but I told him that was not the lead I wanted, and if he did not give it up I should give him into custody—he then took two pieces of lead from his bosom, went into the office, and delivered up some more pieces from his bosom, and a few copper nails: we had such in the manufactory—I knew the two pieces of lead; they belonged to a pump, and were what I had seen by the wall in the dirt.</p>

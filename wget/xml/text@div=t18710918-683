I am a contractor, and live at Fortis Green, Muswell Hill—on Wednesday night, 2nd August, about 7.15, I had five cart horses in a field there—I missed one next morning, and found men's footmarks in the field, the grass was dewy, also the tracks of a cart, which had been driven a short way into the field, and marks of horses' feet, one Bet of which were very much smaller than the footprints of my cart-horse—I distinctly traced the track of the small stranger horse out of the field, and also the track of the big missing horse, and in the dust on the road afterwards, but I cannot say which horse was pulling the cart—I saw the footmarks of a big horse a short distance below the gate, on the road going to Colney Hatch Lane—mine was a powerful light bay horse, fired on the hind legs, sixteen hands high, and worth 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was with James when he measured the foot-marks of the small horse—he took a shoe with him.</p>

On 2nd August, about 11 o'clock at nighty I was on duty at Crouch End, and saw two men in a cart, driving a bay horse, going towards Hornsey Road—Wade was one of them—I am certain, as I have known him eighteen months or two years, and am perfectly certain he is one of the men; I take my oath to it—it was a light spring cart, very dirty, and I noticed that the horse was too large for it—I mad* a communication to my inspector.</p>

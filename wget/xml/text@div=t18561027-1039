                  </hi>. In the years 1853 and 1854, I was carrying on the business of a contractor for iron houses for Australia, and general contracting business. I had premises at Millwall, where the business was chiefly eon<lb></lb>ducted, and a counting-house in Arthur-street, City—I stopped payment in September, 1854—I paid fifteen shillings in the pound, and a great many in full—I dealt very largely with the defendant Fossey, to the amount of 9,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—the articles that form the subject of this investigation ought to have been sent to my premises at Millwall—the amount of the invoice for February was about 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was about the avenge amount of ay dealings; some months it was 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that lasted from the beginning of 1853 till about September, 1854—during the whole of those transactions Neary was one of my clerks at the office in Arthur-street—when goods were brought from Fossey's to Millwall it was the duty of my clerks there to count the number of boards the wagon contained, to compare them with the delivery notes brought with them, and enter them in the delivery books at the factory—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the two delivery books that refer to the period we are now inquiring about, from October, 1853, to May, 1854—they were used on alternate days—one was sent to the office in Arthur-street every morning with the delivery orders—it was Neary's duty to copy the contents of these books into the bought book at the office—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the bought book for that period—Neary made up the ledger "from the bought book, and by the ledger I tested the accuracy of any account that might come in—this is the account sent in to me by Fossey for goods said to have been delivered in February, 1854—it amounts to 830<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I find in the invoice an entry on 1st Feb., "50 20-feet 1 1/4 inch fir boards, 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—that item is not entered in the receiving book at the factory—I have watched among the delivery orders, and have found no delivery order cor<lb></lb>responding with that item—this entry in the bought book of 1st Feb. is in Neary's writing—it contains that item, interlined between other entries—there</p>

               <p>are other items in the invoice on 1st Feb. which appear in the bought book—I find an item on 3rd Feb. in the invoice "90 inch white planed flooring boards, 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—there is no entry of that in the receiving book, nor any delivery order referring to it—it is entered in the bought book in Neary's writing, in an interlineation—on the 6th here is "155 white boards, 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>." charged in the invoice—that does not appear in the receiving book—it is entered in the bought book in Neary's writing, in an interlineation—I have carefully looked at these items of 10th Feb., 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; 11th, 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 15th, 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; the 18th, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and 27th, 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—in all those instances there is no entry in the receiving book, nor any delivery order, but there are entries of all of them in the bought book by Neary, and every one of them are interlined—I find here an entry on 1st Feb. of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for boards—that is reckoned on the assumption that the measurement is <hi rend="italic">super</hi> and not linear—in the account it is written "square" over the "25"—if it was linear measure that item should have been 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; there is an excess of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—in the receiving book it is entered 220 inch white flooring boards, 2540 "ft" put after the finish of the "0"—that means linear feet—in the delivery order it is "220 inch white floor boards, 2540 feet," the word "feet" written in full—I think that is Fossey's writing—that means linear, or running feet—on 2nd Feb. there is in the invoice, "100 inch planed white flooring boards"—that is charged, "12 squares 48 feet, 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—in the receiving book it is entered "1248 feet," and the same in the delivery order, in Fossey's writing.</p>

Kennard and Co., that is the gentleman who was sheriff once, he is of the highest respectability—this account of Polglase and Co. is crowded with interlines<lb></lb>tions—their people went to different parts of the country, and these things do not pass through my factory, some of them do, and they are in Neary's writing—a delivery note is not sent of all goods which I purchase—the receiving books are at the different places of business, some are at Liverpool—there are accounts which have interlineations, but very few—I do not know that when a monthly account is sent in, and it is ascertained that there are not delivery notes for all the items, that inquiries have been made at Millwall, and that then the account has been paid—I am not sure that nothing of that kind has taken place—I do not think accounts hare been brought in of which I have no entries in the receiving book, and inquiries have been made as to their delivery—I dare say six, eight, and ten loads a day were delivered by Fossey—we were very busy in 1853, but not in 1854, business had decreased—we had large contracts, but nothing very tremendous—that was previous to my compounding with my creditors—I am not a timber merchant, but have had a great deal to do with timber.</p>

                  </hi>. In Feb., 1854, I was in the service of Mr. Walker—when timber came from Mr. Fossey or elsewhere, it was my duty to receive the delivery orders in the absence of Mr. Holt, and to enter the contents of those orders in the receiving book—about 15th Feb. Mr. Holt was absent, and that duty devolved on me entirely—these entries of 15th Feb. in this delivery book are mine—in book C, page 87, here is no entry on the 15th of 76 three quarter-inch yellow boards, amounting to 1,044 feet, delivered</p>

               <p>at the factory, and I am able to say that they were not delivered, nor were 60 one inch planed case boards, 750 feet, on the 18th (<hi rend="italic">looking at D</hi> 82)—if such boards were delivered, they would be in those books—I made these entries, and speak without doubt at all—here are other entries in my writ<lb></lb>ing, it goes on to the end of the month—I see no entry of 48 fourteen<lb></lb>inch packing case boards, 1,153 feet, on 27th Feb. in C 93, and the whole of the entries that day are in my writing—as to the flooring boards received in Feb., I never saw a flooring board over nine inches.</p>

Walker, of Mill wall—my duty was to attend to the whole of the duties of the joiners, and to see that the timber was con verted, that is, used up—the extreme width in Feb., 1854, was turned nine inches; some were as small as seven inches—in Feb., 1854, my time for leaving the factory varied from 7 to 10 o'clock—I had to go home to Poplar—I have met Neary going home, but not very often, some few times, I cannot enumerate the exact number—he has had a square parcel with him at times, which I should naturally suppose was books, but of course I could not see inside—I have seen Fossey, not exactly at the same time between the two walls of the dock, when Neary was at the side of the ship yard, and I have afterwards seen Fossey with Neary—I cannot enumerate the times I have seen them together—I have also seen Steel, he was generally with Fossey—I have seen thousands of people in the course of my life—I have measured the floor boards, but not exactly at the time they were delivered—I checked them as to quantity as to the bill.</p>

                  </hi>. I was clerk to Mr. Fossey, and am his nephew. My duty was in his yard and counting house—I know of the dealings that he had with Mr. Walker, and of the goods supplied to him—my attention has been called to the Feb. account—this is my writing; I made it out from either the day book or the journal—the books kept were the deli<lb></lb>very note book, the day book, and the journal—the floor boards in this bill appear to be made out in squares, but I believe it was sent out in linear measurement—I have entered it in squares in this book by Mr. Fossey's orders, the same as I have the other accounts—I kept the books, and Mr. Fossey assisted me; he made entries in the delivery note book, the day book, and the journal, but he only made a few entries in any of the books—some of these entries are his writing, some mine, and Home Wilson's—the feet appear here, I should think, as lineal; I should read it as lineal feet—I have no recollection about the interlineations and additions in this account in Feb.—I believe I saw Mr. Neary in Feb., he was in the habit of visiting Mr. Fossey's house, but I might have been out of town—I have no recollection whether I saw him or not in Feb.—I have no recollection of Feb. at all, no more than I made out this account, and I see the floor boards are charged in that way—I have no recollection but the account itself—Mr. Fossey's delivery note book was on that desk the last time I saw it, the old delivery note book; I am certain I saw the counterfoil of it there the last time I was present—it was among the papers on that desk—I did not notice in whose hands it was—I might be mistaken, but I could have sworn that it was the old counterfoil of the delivery note book—this is not it (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) this is an old delivery note book, but it is not the one I saw—I do not know that I saw the one of Feb.—I nave since seen the journal at the assignees, but not the delivery note book.</p>

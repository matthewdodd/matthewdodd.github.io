               <p>The Evidence for the King being gone through, the Prisoner was call'd upon to make his Defence.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner deny'd that he was guilty of the Indictment, and urg'd two Points of Law to be argued by his Council.</p>
               <p>I. That the Fact, if proved upon him, was only an Embezzlement and Breach of Trust, and did not amount to Felony. That he did not come within the Statute of the 2d of King George 2d. for that the Terms there, were in the Plural Number, any Bank-Notes, &amp;c. And as to these Points referr'd himself to his Council, who were Mr. Serjeant Darnel, and Mr. Strange. The Prisoner's Council argued, That the Constitution of Offices was to be inquir'd into, that there were eight or nine of the Sorters, through whose Hands the Letters went promisouously , and that they gave Security for the faithful Performance of their Trust. That there are six Mails, and 50 or 60 Bags in each Mail, and many Letters in a Bag; that they are put together, and these Bags are not distinguish'd in a Heap, and the Sorters take from thence and sort them. That it being common for the Officers to give Security, as they suppos'd, (and it was admitted by the King's Council) the Prisoner had done, upon Account of any Embezzlement, the Security was answerable.</p>
               <p>II. That as to the second Point, i.e. the Statute, the Expression being in the Plural Number, and the Fact being charg'd upon the Prisoner, being but one single Bank Note, they apprehended that the Design of the Parliament, was not to take a Man's Life away for stealing one single Bank Note, &amp;c. but that there must be a Number of Notes. That Penal Acts are to be construed strictly, and no Act of Parliament can affect the Property, Liberty, or Life of Persons, but according to the Words of the Act. That in the Act, I.

            6th. which made it Felony without Benefit of Clergy, to steal Horses, Geldings, or Mares, in the Plural Number; it was doubtful whether that extended to a Person that should steal one Horse, and that two or three Years after, viz. 2 and 3 Edward 6th, An Act was made that it should be Felony without the Benefit of Clergy, to steal one Horse, Gelding, Mare, &amp;c. That as the Statute of 21 of Henry 8th, for rendering Servants liable for robbing their Masters, it required that their Masters should be the Owners of the Goods; but in the Defendant's Case, he was no Servant to the Owner of the Note; and that as to the Act of the 9th of Queen Anne, Chap. 10th, there are many Regulations. And in this particular Case they are required to take an Oath of Office, and that no Person shall detain or convey away any Letter that is deliver'd in at the Post-Office, without an Order under the Hand of the Secretary of State, upon the Forfeiture of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173010160008"></xptr> 20 l. and render'd incapable of any Employment in the Post-Office. And that was all the Punishment design'd to be indicted by the Parliament for such Offences, therefore the Offender cannot be found Guilty of a Felony; but it was a Breach of Trust, as all that send Letters by the Hand of other Persons, repose a Trust in the Hands of those to whom they were committed. That all Penal Laws are to be construed strictly according to the Letter, and not to be extended by Equity. That the Words of the Statute being in the Plural Number, as Exchequer Notes, Bank Notes, &amp;c. the Defendant being charg'd only with one single Note, cannot come within the Words of that Act, and so cannot be Guilty of the Offence by that Statute.</p>

               <p>To these Objections it was answer'd by the Council for the King. As to the First, That this Offence was plainly Felony, and not a Breach of Trust, for the Prisoner had no possessory Property in the Bank-Note, but only a bare Charge over the Letter in which it was contain'd, to sort and put it in its proper Place; and therefore it was like the Case of a Butler, who had a Charge over Plate; or of a Shepherd, who had a flock of Sheep committed to his Care; or a Workman, who had Silk deliver'd to him to work, by a Silk-Throwster; in all which Cases, it had been held to be Felony, to steal any of the Goods so deliver'd to them, notwithstanding the Delivery. And Secondly, It was argued, That if the Prisoner had even a possessory Property in the Letter, as a Carrier has in the Goods deliver'd him to carry, (tho' it was insisted that he had no such Property, but only a Charge over it as before mention'd) yet still he would be Guilty of Felony, for by opening the Letter, the Privity was determin'd; and it had been adjudged, That if a Pack of Goods, or a Ton of Wine, were deliver'd to a Carrier, and he open'd it, and took out part of the Goods, or Wine, it was Felony in the Carrier.</p>
               <p>And to the second Objection it was answer'd, That tho' the Penal Statutes are to have a strict Construction, yet they are to be construed reasonably, and according to the common Sense of Mankind; and the Sense and Meaning of this Statute, was very plain to extend to one Note, as well as to many: For the Words of the Statute, are any Notes, &amp;c. and it afterwards follows, notwithstanding any of the Particulars may be termed in Law; a chose in Action, which plainly shews, that it was the Intention of the Legislature, to make the stealing of a chose in Action, which one single Bank-Note is Felony. And it would be a most unreasonable Construction, to say, that the Legislature intended to make it Felony to steal two Notes for 5 l. each, and yet that it should not be Felony to steal one Note of 10,000 l. And also what was said by the Council for the Prisoner, upon the Stat. 1

            6. It was answered, that there the Words were Horses, Mares, or Geldings, and not any Horses, &amp;c. as in this Statute. And yet there it was only doubted, whether it did extend to one Horse; And that Stat. 23.

            6. only declared, That the stealing of one Horse, should exclude the Felon of the Benefit of Clergy; which shewed, that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173010160009"></xptr> the Parliament only gave their Judgment that it was Felony without the Benefit of Clergy, by Virtue of the first Acts, and the second was only to remove Doubts, and not make a new Law. And it was observed, that the Statute which makes it Felony to burn Barns, Hayricks , &amp;c. was in the plural Number and it had never been doubted, but the burning one Barn, &amp;c. was Felony by the Statute.</p>
               <p>After these Objections were fully debated on both Sides, the Court declar'd their Opinions unanimously and clearly, that there was nothing in either of the Objections; but that the Offence, if the Jury believ'd the Witnesses for the King, was plainly Felony, without the Benefit of Clergy. - And the Prisoner's Objections as to the Point of Law being over-rul'd, he proceeded to make his Defence as to the Fact.</p>
               <p>And he alledg'd he never saw the Note in Question, nor was in Devereux Court on the 16th of June; that he having been at the Swan and Hoop Tavern , in Cornhill, to eat Part of a Haunch of Venison, on the 15th of June at Night, the Company had made an Appointment to go to eat the Remainder hash'd the next Morning, that he on the 16th of June did not rise till 9 o'Clock in the Morning, and coming down Stairs, the Family were drinking Tea, that he drank Tea with them, that he being undress'd, his Brother came in, and he invited him to go with him to eat Part of the Haunch of Venison; that a Gentlewoman having sent her Maid to desire him to go with her that Morning to speak to a Gentleman at the Globe and Scepter Tavern in the Old Jury, the Maid coming to call him, he went thither with Mrs. Hall and the Maid, and inquir'd for one Mr. Burnaby , that he went from thence to the Swan and Hoop Tavern in Cornhill , in Company with the Gentlewoman and her Maid, and it was then between 10 and 11 o'Clock, that there he found Mr. Cadwallader , and other Gentlemen that had supped with him there the Night before, and did not go from that Tavern .</p>
               <p>To prove this he call'd the following Evidences.</p>

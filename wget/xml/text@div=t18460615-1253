On Saturday evening, the 25th of April, at five minutes past eight o'clock, I was going through Drury-lane, and met the prisoner—as I passed him I pushed against him by accident—he made use of a bad expres<lb></lb>sion, and said, "What made you do that?"—I begged his pardon—he made use of the same expression, and told me to go along—I called him a puppy, tod turned the corner into Princes-street—he followed me and said, "What made you call me a puppy?"—I said, "What made you call roe a w—1, can you prove me one?"—after that he went back into Drury-lane, and came back again, and caught hold of me by the shoulder—he said he would do for me, only for one thing, to-night, and called me the same name—I then saw a pistol under his right arm, under his coat—I told him if he did not go away, I would give him in charge for threatening my life—I called out for the police, and he ran towards Drury-lane—I saw no more of him till I saw him go in at the station-house door with the policeman, half an hour after or more—I had gone into Clare-market.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a compositor, and live at Harford-place, Drury-lane. On Saturday evening, the 25th of April, about twenty-five minutes to nine o'clock, I was in Drury-lane, and saw the prisoner with a pistol in his hand—he was holding it out with his arm stretched out at full length in this way—he crossed the road towards me—the muzzle of the pistol was towards me—he walked up almost close to me—I moved on one side—he stopped, and I stopped and heard the report of a pistol—I was standing still then, and he was standing still—I had not lost sight of him—after hearing the report I heard the man who was shot say, "I am shot"—I am sure the prisoner fired the pistol—the man was close by me—I went up to him—I had never seen him before, but now know that his name was Bluett—the prisoner ran away with the pistol in his hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a picture-dealer, and live in Orange-street, Bloomsbury. On Saturday evening, the 25th of April, about half-past eight o'clock, I was in Drury-lane, going from Holborn towards Drury-lane theatre—there was a cook shop near where I was—I observed the prisoner and the deceased near that shop—the prisoner was walking towards Holboro—the other man was coming towards him, meeting each other, about a yard and a half from each other or more—when I first observed them, the prisoner appeared to be carrying something in his right hand, and sup<lb></lb>porting it with bis left—I could not see what it was—the instant after that I heard the report of fire arms, and saw a flash—there was not anybody passing within a yard or so—at the time I heard the report, there was not anybody near enough to the prisoner to have touched him—to deceased staggered—I did not go to his assistance—the prisoner remained there for a minute or a minute and a half—I kept my eye on him and the crowd began to assemble—I could not see what he had in his hand—alter that minute and a half he ran away—I saw him brought back in a few minutes, and he said several times that it was an accident.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a tobacconist's-shop in Black<lb></lb>friars-road. On Saturday, the 6th of Jan., about seven in the evening, the pri<lb></lb>soner came and asked how many cheroots I would let him have for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said six—he asked if I would not let him have seven—I said no—he said he would take a shilling's-worth—I counted them out, and laid them on the counter—he tried to change one, it being chipped—I would not allow that—I laid them on one side, to wrap them up—he snatched them up, threw down a bad shilling, and ran out—I do not give credit—I could not prevent his snatching them up, he did it while I turned—I laid the shilling on the counter while my brother ran after him—it was there about five minutes—my brother looked at it when be returned without the prisoner—I then threw it into a drawer where I had two other bad shillings, two half-crowns, and a sixpence—I gave the policeman all the bad shillings I had from that drawer—I saw it was a bad shilling before he got out, and called out, "This is a bad one," loud enough for him to hear—I cannot swear which of the shillings he gave me, as I threw it with the others, but I gave them all to the policeman—it was about the same brightness as the others.</p>

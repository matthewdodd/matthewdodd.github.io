                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. John Jacob Isaacs, of Dor<lb></lb>set-square. On Monday, a week before I was before the Magistrates, I was in the pantry down stairs, at one o'clock in the afternoon—the window looks into the front area—I saw the prisoner come down—I am sure it was him—he looked in at one pantry window, and then into the other, then lifted up the window which had been shut close, and took a spoon from a tea-cup and saucer which stood in the window—I saw the spoon in his hand—I asked him to give it me—he asked me if I had any old bottles to sell—I again asked him to give me it—he did not, but put it into his right pocket, and turned to go away up the area steps—I went to the front door, but no person was passing at the time, and he escaped—I am positive he is man—I saw him again at the Police-station—there were several other persons there, but I knew him immediately, and pointed him out.</p>

B.," and that is on a part of the hide that has been cut off in those hides that are here—it is not usual to have that part cut off—I know the prisoner—I had seen him on the day before the hides were missed, between 7 and 8 o'clock in the morning—he knew of the entrance between Half Moon Passage and our place—I have seen him come and go that way.</p>

I said, "I will try"; he said he lived in Whitechapel; I got the hides, and met the first witness with them on my head; I went to two or three places to try to sell them; I took them to the witness who sold them for me; if I had known they had been stolen I would not have taken them in that way; I have always maintained an honest, hard working character; I think no one can say to the contrary; but I was careless, and not over cautious that morning, and was rather intoxicated; on the Thursday I heard that the hides were missed; I went to try to find the person who gave them to me; I went to the market on the Friday, and was taken.</p>

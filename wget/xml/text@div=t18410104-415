                  </hi>. I am shopman to Charles Meeking, a draper, on Holborn-hill. The prisoner came in about eight o'clock, on the 24th of December, and asked for some handkerchiefs, and bought one—I saw her take half a dozen handkerchiefs from the counter, and put them under her shawl—she afterwards paid 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the one she bought—she was leaving the shop, and had got just against the door—I asked her to walk back and sit down, and told a person to call a policeman—he came and took her to the end of the shop, and the handkerchiefs dropped from her—she had got seven or eight yards from where she had taken them from—they were lying under the handkerchief which she bought.</p>

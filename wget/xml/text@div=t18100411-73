When I missed them I looked about to see if I could find them, I could not; I went and told my master. I saw the brass plates at Bow-street when Yates and Field were in custody. I knew the plates again when I saw them, I had been at work upon them. They did not take all the brass plates from the shop, they took sixteen and left twenty in the shop.

             there in the parlour. When I went in I knew his person, and I saw these things. I went to the dresser where these sixteen pieces of brass were which I produce now. I said to him, how came you by them: he said two boys left them there on the over night, and they were to fetch them the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say Robinson was one of them - A. No, Robinson went with me, he pointed out the house. I sent him back to the public-house. Field could not see him. I asked him who the boys were, he said he did not know. Mr. Low said they were his property. I took them to the office; I have kept them ever since. I returned back to the public-house in Queen-street, and sent Robinson into the Three Tuns, the corner of Shorts Gardens. Robinson came out and told me Yates was there, playing at shove-halfpenny. I went in, found him there, and took him in custody, and just before I got him to the office I asked him what he had done with the brass; he said he did not know what I meant. Robinson said Mann was going to be chairman of a free and easy club at the two Brewers in Bembridge-street. I took Robinson with me. I came from the two Brewers, and came to the Turks's head, in Dyot-street, and as I was standing there Robinson pulled me by the coat and said that was the man. I took him in custody. I said nothing to him till I took him to the office.</p>
               <p>THOMAS MANTZ. I am a patrol of Bow-street. On the 10th of this month Limbrick took Yates into custody, and delivered-him up to me. Yates said, I know what I am brought here for. He said a boy came to him last night to ask him to sell some copper. I asked him what boy; he replied, a boy that lives with a last-maker; be said that he sold it at Field's.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>

             came to me on the night he got the plates. I was in the public-house. He asked me if I knew where to sell them. I said I did not know where to sell them. We saw Mr. Field's door open as we were going along; I asked him if he would be so good as to let them be there till tomorrow morning, I would call for them.</p>
               <p>Mann's Defence. I know nothing of what I am brought here for. I never saw Robinson before I saw him at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Field's Defence. The plates were brought to me by two young lads; they said they were going to the club at the next door to me; they asked my leave to let them leave them there. They were put down on the dresser, and left there till the officer came and took them; they were never purchased, I had no use for such things.</p>

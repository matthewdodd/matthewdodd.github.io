            . I lived at Pitt-street, Tottenham-court-road. I had known the prisoner about two months before this first occured; I washed for him occasionally. On Saturday, the 6th of April last, he came to my lodging in Pitt-street, about eleven o'clock in the morning; he asked me if I could accompany him to the City upon a little business; I hesitated at going at first, because I nursed children; his washerwoman being in my room, she offered to take charge of the children while I went; by which reason, I agreed to go. The prisoner told me he would pay me for my trouble, and loss of time. I then went with him. He told me he was going to the Bank, to receive a little money, it was his sister's. He said, he had received a letter from his sister, who being in the country, in situation, she could not possibly come to Town; and he had received this letter, with instructions to get a woman to go with him to the Bank. Mr. Gregory in his way thither, told me I was not to write in the book. I had asked him a question whether I was to write my name; and he said, I was not; but to make a mark. I then asked him if writing my name, would not answer the same purpose; he told me, no. I don't remember whether he mentioned the young woman's name or not; I don't think he did; but he said, her mark was in the book before, and therefore it must be a mark. We then proceeded onwards towards the Bank. He told me if the broker asked me any questions, to say, my time was very limited, and to beg the favour of the broker to dismiss us as soon as possible. I don't recollect any thing else. I then sat down, and he told me, he would go and speak to the broker. When he returned, I don't recollect any thing particular that he said to me. He gave me his papers; but I don't recollect whether he went to speak to the broker or not. I think he told me one of the papers was the power of attorney, and the other was of no use. I saw Mr. Weeden, the broker, soon after, he came up together. I think Weeden gave me that paper. (Paper put into the hand of the witness.) But Gregory stood by. The broker put a name on it, and then put it by, and I went into the office with him. I then went to a place, and saw a book, and put a mark in it, by the direction of Gregory; Gregory was present at the time, as was Mr. Weeden. (A book produced to witness.) That is the mark I made. That being done, we returned to the broker's desk, and the broker gave Mr. Gregory a check, it was a bit of paper; I did not read it, Then Gregory and I went to Banbury's and Co, the bankers; we went into the bankers. I saw Gregory give the check to the clerk, and the clerk asked him what notes he would have it in, and he said, one-pound notes; and he received twenty-one, and some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181605290024"></xptr>silver and halfpence, but I don't know how much; we then returned as far as Bloomsbury-square together; he then left me to go into a watch-maker's; I then went on by myself, and Mr. Gregory overtook me, in Store-street, near Goodge-street. He had left me for about ten minutes, and then came again. On our way home, he told me not to mention this to any one person. When he came to my lodging, he still wanted it to be kept a secret before me and his washerwoman; he might stay about half an hour in Pitt-street; this was on the Saturday. I communicated what passed to Mr. Hutchins, the father of two children that I had the charge of; I communicated it also to my brother, and on the Tuesday morning, I went to Marlborough-street; then I sent to the Bank of England. I went of my own accord to the magistrates.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. I had only known the prisoner two months before. They did not read over what it was to me which I put my mark to.</p>
               <p>Examined by the COURT. The broker never read any thing to me. I was able to read, as well as to write. I saw the broker write after I had made the mark; I did not see what name he wrote. I don't recollect that the prisoner gave me any directions when he gave me the papers. The prisoner was a tailor.</p>

            . I am a stock broker. On the 24th of March, I first saw the prisoner; he was introduced to me by a gentleman named Pidlake; he stated that he wished for a power of attorney for the transfer of some stock, that he was ignorant of the business, that it was stock standing in the name of

            ; he said there was only twenty five pounds navy five per cents. I then asked him to let me look at the stock receipt, which he did.(Receipt put into the hand of the witness.) That is the receipt. I stated to him then the impropriety of of having a guinea and sixpence for so small a sum of stock; he said, it was a great deal of money to pay, I told him he had better put it off all together, and he wished me a good morning, and went away. On the next day, he came again, and stated that he had seen the party, or heard from her; he said that she was in the country, and wished for the money, and I was to procure a power of attorney for the money. I then inquired of him for the Bank stock receipt a second time, and then I prepared the necessary instructions for drawing the power of attorney; before I lodged instructions I examined, and found it correct. That is the power of attorney. (paper put into the hand of the witness.) He waited on me at the Bank at twelve o'clock on the next day, and I asked him for a guinea and sixpence, and he said he had not so much, but would thank me to pay the same for him. I paid the guinea and sixpence, and I asked him when it would be likely to be returned; he said in the course of a day or two. He came to me on the following morning, and stated that the family were Miss Coward was in service had arrived unexpectedly in town, from Brighton, and she would attend herself to make the transfer. He did not return me the power of attorney. I saw no more of the prisoner for three, four, or five days. I then met with him on the Rotunda, on the 31th of March; I then asked him were Miss Coward was; he waited there from eleven to twelve o'clock, He told me he had made an appointment with her to meet that day. No one came that day. He stated he was much surprized at her not coming, as he had said she was coming at twelve o'clock. On Saturday, the 16th of April, he came to me in the Rotunda; I had then only left my clerkship three days, he stated that Mrs. Coward would be there, and he would thank me to put the ticket forward, as he hoped she would not be kept long. I then prepared the transfer ticket. I paid a private transfer on the ticket, and sold the stock to Mr.

The prisoner was present at the time, I said, now, Mr. Gregory, we will walk to the five per cent office, to make the transfer. I then went to the division, and enquired if a ticket was entered in the name of Coward, and found it was. (Turning to the book.) This is the transfer. The prisoner was standing close by at her elbow when she made this mark."

I attested it, and Mr. Mappel and Mr. Gibbins witnessed it, and I witnessed the identity. We then went back to the desk in the Rotunda. I then enquired of them who was to pay the guinea and sixpence for the power of attorney, and the prisoner told me to pay myself; I made him out an account, and paid him twenty-one pounds and three-pence; I gave a check for that amount.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LONG. I never asked the woman whether her name was Coward; but I think I said to her at the time I saw her, good morning, Mrs. Coward.

From the power of attorney, and from my examining the account, and finding it correspond, I thought it was all correct. I asker her to sign her name, and she said, she could not; but she made her mark. I told her it was for twenty-five pounds navy five per cents. I did not read over any part of the transfer to her, except saying it was transfer twenty-five navy from Coward to Partridge; I don't recollect that I read the words

            . I lived with a family in Hanover-square. I know the prisoner at the bar; I have known him about two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever make any application to you for money - A. Yes; he was always asking me for money. From time to time, I lent him different sums. I had a sum of twenty-five pounds in the funds. I did not purchase it myself. I received the dividends on that stock.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner ever ask you for your receipt - A. Yes; but not to destroy. I can't recollect what time I lent it to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in the course of last year - A. I can't tell what month; it was since Christmas; he had it about a month, before I asked him for it. I don't remember when he was taken up. It was on a Friday he asked me for it again; and as I learn, this transfer was made the next day, Saturday. He asked me for it again on the same evening that he had returned it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever go to the Bank in the course of this last year to make any transfer of that stock - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever make any mark in any book for transfering that stock, or to any receipt - A. No. I once went with the prisoner to the Bank; but did not get it out. I saw the prisoner on the Friday before this happened; he did not say any thing about going to the Bank.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LONG. Q. How came you to lend him this receipt - A. Only to shew people that he had money. He often asked me to get it out, but I always said, I could not promise him to go. I went with him once for the purpose of getting it out; but could not get it out, for the Bank was shut; I don't know when that was; it was since Christmas; but before I received my January dividend.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he propose to you to get it transfered - A. He asked me; but I refused it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing about its being transfered without your going to the Bank - A No; he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you some one else could supply your place in transfering it - A. I believe he did once; but I told him he could not do it.</p>
               <p>Q. He requested you to consent to that, and you refused - A. No. He asked me to allow some one else to supply my place, and I said, no one else could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say he could not get a person-did you not say he might if he could - A. No. I never authorized him to get it out.</p>
               <p>Examined by the COURT. Did you mean to give him permission to get another person, if such person could be found - A. No; never.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever lent him money by going to the Bank, and transfering money there - A. Yes; I took seven pounds out for him last year.</p>
               <p>MR. SERJEANT BOSANQUET. Did you ever go with him to take out money to lend him - A. Never.</p>

On the 9th of April last, I went with Craig, the officer, to apprehend the prisoner, and I apprehended him in a public-house in Pulley-street; I did not tell him what for.

             I have known two years. On the 5th of April, she called on me; she asked me if I would take a walk with her; I told her I could. Before we went from the door, she asked me if I had got the transfer of the money, and I told her I had, and accordingly gave it to her. She asked me if I could go home with her, and I told her my circumstances, and that I had got some things to do, and if she could lend me some money, I would thank her, and she said, she could, but she had not got it about her, it was in the Bank, and if I could get a person to go with me to get it, I was wellcome. I did not know the danger of these things, and I went to this person, and asked her to come, and we went. When I got to the Bank, I saw Mr. Weedon, and I told him this person was going to receive the money; I told him

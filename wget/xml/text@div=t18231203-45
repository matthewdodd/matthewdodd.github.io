This money was in a box in my bedroom closet, which was locked, the key of the box was on the top of it. On Tuesday morning I went out about nine o'clock, having locked the closet. I returned about twelve o'clock, the door was as I had left it. I went out again at half-past two o'clock - returned at six o'clock, and about eight o'clock I went to the closet, found it still locked, the box was shut, but the money gone; the note was a Gravesend one. I immediately charged the prisoner with the robbery; she denied it. I had her apprehended, but nothing was found on her. We received the 10 l. note on Wednesday in a letter from the others prisoner.

            . I live in Jeffrie's-buildings, Newcastle-street, Westminster. One Tuesday evening, between eight and nine o'clock, Ann Hyder Clay's husband called on me and gave me a note to take to his mother (the other prisoner), which I did; it was wrapped in the leaf of a Bible, he told me to give his kind love with it, and say he was going into the country, and had sent her a 10 l. note. I took it to her next morning between nine and ten o'clock. She told me if I saw him to tell him to be off as quick as he could into the country, for they were after him. He had nine sovereigns, which he said he received from the country. The mother lived in Cooper's-place, Newport-market.</p>

I said I was certain he had; she repeatedly denied it. I said he had been seen up stairs. She then said he had been in the sitting-room, but not in the bed-room. Next morning at nine o'clock I went to fetch her from the watch-house, and on our way towards the elder prisoner's house, I told her I had found that her husband and her had been in the bed-room together; she then said they had. We met the elder prisoner, who wished me to go to a public house while she fetched the younger prisoner's sister, which I did; she returned, and soon after went in search of her again till nearly twelve o'clock - the sister never came, and I took the younger prisoner to Bow-street, and in consequence of information, I went to Hiverson's, and about nine o'clock, that night, met the elder prisoner, near her own house, and asked if she had seen her son; she said not - I asked if she had received some of the stolen money from him; she said No. I took her up to her own apartment, and told her I was confident she had received it - she repeatedly denied it. I said I knew she had the 10 l. note, for I had the girl in custody who brought it to her; she then said, "I did have it, and have sent it to Mr. Byrn." As I took her to the watch-house, I said, "You had the 10 l. note in your possession all the time you were with me this morning, why did not you deliver it up?" she said she was afraid, she did not know what to do, she did it for the best.</p>

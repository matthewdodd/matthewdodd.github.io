                  </hi>. On the 1st of February, last year, I was cook on board the barque <hi rend="italic">Kingston</hi>. I went on board at Liverpool—the prisoner was the captain—I knew the deceased Lewis Handford—he was the steward—the crew consisted of twenty or twenty-one—on the 2nd of March we sailed for the coast of Africa, and on the 17th of April we arrived at New Calabar—on the 20th of May we were at the Island of Baracoon, in the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183801290130"></xptr>
               <p>Calabar River—that is about ten miles from the mouth of the river—the tide flows there—we carried about 300 tons—on the afternoon of the 20th of May, I observed the steward pumping some rum off—that was part of his duty—he came to me, and asked me to clean some candlesticks for him—he was going to get some tacks out of the cabin—he then left the deck, and went into the cabin—I afterwards heard the carpenter cry out for the Kroo boys to come to the cabin, and some of the native boys, who were also in the cabin, called out for them too—the Kroo boys are natives of the coast—full-grown men are called Kroo boys—I did not hear the captain say any other words at that time—the Kroo boys came out of the cabin, and at that time there were some other Kroo boys coming alongside in a canoe—there were three Kroo boys, four "pull-away boys," and the second mate—they came out of the canoe on to the deck.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have said the captain called for the Kroo boys to come, after that what did he do? was any thing said about the steward? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he said, "Fetch this b—son of a b—on deck, out of the cabin; he has struck me in my own cabin"—three of the Kroo boys, named Walker, Gray, and "Bottle-o'-beer," then rushed into the cabin—I saw them fetch the steward out on deck, on to the starboard side, by the companion-door—the cabin is only two steps down from the deck—after the steward was brought out of the cabin, the captain came from the cabin—he followed the men on deck—he had a <hi rend="italic">cat</hi> In his hand—a <hi rend="italic">cat</hi> Is a stick with twelve tails attached to it—the stick is from eighteen inches to two feet in length, and about two-and-a-half-inches round—the tails are made of log-lines—it is a mere plain line made up very hard—the captain had one of these in his hand—I saw him strike the steward with the butt<lb></lb>end of it on the head, and it knocked him down like a bullock—the cap<lb></lb>tain then said, "Pay that black son of a b—, he has struck me in my cabin, he has catched me by the p—s and the throat, and tried to choke me"—he then said, "Lay on him, and kill him, a black son of a b—, kill him!"—the captain was addressing the Kroo boys, and the natives of the country, the boys who had been in the cabin—they had <hi rend="italic">cats</hi> In their hands, and sticks and pieces of rope besides—pieces of lead-line, which it what they sound with.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came that in their hands? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The captain ordered it to be cut up when they were flogging him—there were from twelve to eighteen flogging him at different times—he never rose from the deck after the cap<lb></lb>tain knocked him down with the butt-end of the <hi rend="italic">cat</hi>—they flogged him while he was down; and while they were flogging him on the deck the cap<lb></lb>tain kicked him more than twenty times—he kicked him at his side, face, and head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the steward say any thing while this was going on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he said, "Oh Lord, I am a dead man," several times—that was while the flogging was going on—the captain came half-way forwards to me after that, and said, "Cook, you know something about this"—I said, "Captain Cain, I know nothing about it"—I told him I knew nothing about his and the steward's affairs—he then said to me, "Cook, you black son of a b—I I will shoot you."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any flogging after your hearing the steward cry out that he was a dead man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he was flogged till he was dead—the captain still remained kicking him—I did not hear the steward say any thing more—all I heard him say was, "Oh Lord, I am a dead man"—he said that three</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183801290131"></xptr>
               <p>or four times—I remained close to where the flogging was, standing on the starboard side, aft—the steward was dressed in a striped shirt, a flannel singlet, and a pair of trowsers, but the captain ordered the shirt and singlet to be torn off after the flogging had continued some time—they were partly torn off, and he said, "Never mind the son of a b—; kill the black son of a b—; flog him"—I am a native of the West Indies—the steward was an American born.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In what state was he when they left off flogging; do you mean that the flogging continued till he was dead? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And the captain standing by all the time, was he? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he stood there from the time became on deck till the steward died, omitting once, when he came half forward, and said he would shoot me—he never went below till the stew<lb></lb>ard was dead—that I am sure of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had any complaint been made against you before the 20th of May? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and I had been flogged—that was on the 2nd of May—it was on a charge that I was going to run away with the ship's boat—the steward and me were the only black men on board the ship, the only ones that sailed from Liverpool, but at Calabar several other black men joined in working the ship—I had no dispute with the captain after this respecting my wages—none whatever—I assisted a boy, named Lees, to do the steward's duty after the steward's death—I made no demand for that—I never made any demand for more wages than I had first agreed for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had the captain arrived at Liverpool before you made this charge against him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A fortnight I believe, or three weeks—I cannot say whether he was on board every day after the ship arrived there—I was not on board the ship but twice, and he was not to be found then—I knew where the owners resided—they are Messrs. Stevens and Horsfall—I knew where they were—I tried to find the captain after his arrival on the 2nd of January—I inquired at the office, and could not find him,—he was not to be found for two or three weeks after the ship's arrival—I made a com<lb></lb>plaint against him to the owners, Messrs. Stevens and Horsfall, on the 2nd of January—we arrived on the 1st of January, and I made a complaint to them the next day, and then looked out for the captain, but could not find him for three weeks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the length of time, according to your judgment, between the steward going down below to look after the tacks and the time he was brought on deck? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From five to ten minutes—I did not hear any scuffle in the cabin when the captain came on deck—I observed a wound on his head—it was not bleeding much, not worth speaking of—it was bleeding—it was on the back part of his head—I did not observe any marks of fingers on his throat—I did not observe his throat, to see whether there were or not—he did not seem exhausted—he seemed very passionate—he seemed very fresh, as far as I could see.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean he did not appear to you as if he had been ill-used; do you mean that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were either of the Kroo men called Walker? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he was one that flogged first—him and Gray—both of them laid on at once, and "Bottle-o'-beer" at the same time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there a boy at Calabar called Dogaboo? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I saw him flogging the steward about the eyes—the captain was on deck at that time.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there a boy who went by the name of <hi rend="italic">Three-fingered Jack</hi>? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and he had a stick, beating him—it was a heavy stick—I cannot say whether he gave the steward severe blows with it, but he was beating him all the time, every chance he could get at him—I cannot say where he hit him, but I saw him beating him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean the captain saw him do that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was standing kicking him at the time—he was so near that he must have seen him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you swear that the captain had not gone below, before <hi rend="italic">Three-fingered Jack</hi> struck the steward with the stick? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was striking him all the time—I never saw him go below till the man was dead—he did not go below—<hi rend="italic">Three-fingered Jack</hi> struck the steward from the beginning, as often as he had a chance—the flogging continued three quarters of an hour, till he died—<hi rend="italic">Three-fingered Jack</hi> had the stick, and was beating him with it all that time, whenever he had a chance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you not examined on this subject, when you were on board the ship? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—she was lying in the Calabar river at the time—Captain Hemmingway and Captain Dawson came on board at the time, and I was examined before them—there was no promise or persuasion made to me then, with respect to the account I was to give of it—there was no threat held out to me—I was desired to speak the truth—the account I then gave was taken down in writing, and read over to me, and I signed it—this is the paper—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was Captain Cain present when you were-examined? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was walking backwards and forwards in his own cabin—I was examined in the main cabin—there are two cabins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What sort of shoes did the captain wear? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were strong shoes—the natives do not wear any shoes in that climate—the captain generally wore strong shoes—I cannot say whether he wore strong shoes that day or not, but he had shoes on—he generally wore strong shoes on the coast of Africa, when going on shore, and when he was on board, at times, unless he had on his slippers in the morning, when he first got up—generally speaking, he wore strong shoes on the coast of Africa.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ever said that the steward was not punished except in an ordinary way? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that taken down in writing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When Captains Hemmingway and Dawson examined you, hady on not an opportunity of stating what you pleased respecting the transaction <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I had not, because I was in danger of my life from Captain Cain and the Kroo boys—the examination was better than a week after the steward's death, but I cannot exactly say how long—it might be a month—there had been no disturbance on board after the steward's death—no threat was held out to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why were you afraid then of stating this, if they had not threatened you, and there had been no disturbance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was threatened before this—before the flogging—I was put in double irons, and chains round my neck, with a padlock to my neck, and was kept on deck all</p>

BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where was the captain standing at the time the car<lb></lb>penter told him the man was dead? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Just at the cabin-door—the steward was about four or five yards off, I believe—there are but two steps from the deck to the cabin—a person in the cabin could see what was going on on deck, on the starboard-side, the side the flogging took place—I saw the steward's body that night, and again next morning, when he was buried—I helped to put him in—we did not see his back—his body was not cut, but it was a complete swell as if it was all <hi rend="italic">masticated</hi>—all about his body was completely swollen up—a complete mass of <hi rend="italic">mash</hi> and blood—his face was completely swollen, and his eyes were kicked in.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean as if it had been kicked? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—as if it had been kicked and knocked with ropes together—I could not under<lb></lb>stand what the steward said while he was being flogged—I do not hear very quickly.</p>

ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you hard of hearing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I was standing seven or eight yards off—sometimes I was nearer—I could hear what the captain said, but not what the steward said—the captain seemed in a terrible rage when he came on deck—he seemed hurt, and in a very exhausted way—he seemed to be out of breath—his head was bleeding, but I did not notice it bleeding much—there was a good-sized plaster on it the next day—I cannot tell how long he wore the plaster—I saw it on for a fortnight or more—I heard the scuffle down below in the cabin—I did not observe any marks on the captain's throat—he walked backwards and forwards, and I did not take that notice—the captain remained on deck from the time he came on deck till the steward died—I am positive he never went into the cabin—I do not know a Cala<lb></lb>bar-boy named <hi rend="italic">Three-fingered Jack</hi>—there were some Calabar-boys on board with sticks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What sort of sticks were they? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Canes—they were not big enough to do any mischief—not like English sticks at all—I saw them standing round with their sticks.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You did not see a Calabar-boy who went</p>

               <p>by the name of <hi rend="italic">Three-fingered Jack</hi>? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, nor any one that had a stick larger than the others—I did not hear the steward ask for a glass of water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see him sit up at any time after the flogging was over? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was sometimes half sitting—he never sat up—the handle of the cat was three inches thick in the round, and it might taper off to about an inch and a half—I did not observe what kind of shoes the captain wore—when he did not go ashore he used to have nothing but slippers—he wore slippers on board—sometimes they were made of morocco—they were light slip<lb></lb>pers—the steward died during the flogging—any person who was looking on might perceive that he was dead—I perceived it—I saw him stretch himself out, and the captain was looking on—he was walking backward and forward—he must have seen it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said something about stretching out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he stretched out, and never moved after, and he was flogged after that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> After it was clear and evident that he was dead, they continued flogging him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, the captain being by—after it was clear that he was dead, the captain ordered him to be put in irons—they might give him a dozen lashes or so after he was dead—I could not see any movement whatever after he was dead—it was after that he was ordered to be put in irons—I was examined on this subject before Captains Hemmingway and Dawson.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you not on that occasion desired to speak the truth? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; they told us to say what we knew concerning it—they did not hold out any promise, or make any threat—what I said was taken down in writing, and read over to me, and I signed it—this is the paper, with my signature to it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You saw the man stretch himself out, was it from that you concluded he was dead? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He had not the least appearance of life in him after that—he stretched himself out as if he was dead, laying himself out—the captain was just on the larboard side, sitting down at the time—whether he saw it I cannot say—it was rather dark then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then the captain was not in a situation to see him at that moment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I cannot say whether he was.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say the captain generally wore light slippers unless he went ashore? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Unless he went ashore, or on board some other vessel—if he had been ashore or on board any other vessel that morning it must have been very early—he had not been since eleven o'clock, for he had been on board—as far as I know, he had not been ashore at all—I cannot say whether he had light slippers or light shoes on during the flogging.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At what time did the flogging take place? Between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, it might be,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At what time were you examined before the two captains, at night or day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At night, and I was half asleep—I was called out of my hammock—it was from ten to twelve o'clock at night—I was examined in the captain's private cabin—there are two cabins, a fore cabin and a main cabin—I was examined in the private cabin, where the captain slept—the captain was walking about in the main cabin at that time—they are both on one deck—he was in one cabin, and I was being examined in the other, but the door was open—they both join each other—the captain could hear all that took place in the course of the examina<lb></lb>tion—I knew he was there when I was examined.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At the time you were-examined were you under any fear? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I was afraid of telling the truth on board the ship, because I had to come home in the ship—I had not had any quarrel with the captain—there was no quarrel between the captain and any of the people in the voyage home, only just what might be on board a ship—nothing to notice.</p>

                  </hi>. I was cooper on board this vessel. I remember on the 20th of May being at Calabar—between five and six o'clock in the evening of that day I heard a great noise in the cabin—after hearing that noise I saw Captain Cain come out of the cabin, and three Kroo boys—when he came out, the three Kroo boys brought out the steward—the cap<lb></lb>tain had a cat in his hand, and when they got the steward out, the captain struck him on the head—I cannot say exactly where he struck him with the stump of the cat—he knocked him down, and he never rose again—the captain said, "He is a black b—to take me by the throat and * * * *, and throw me down in my cabin;" and "I will have your life this night"—the captain hit him several lashes himself with the tails of the cat—he then called to Mr. Carr, the second mate, to make some cats for the three Kroo men, Gray, Walker, and Bottle-o'-Beer—the mate made them, and they were given to the Kroo men—he cut them off the log-line—Captain Cain then ordered them to commence flogging him—they had not been flogging him before that—they did then flog him, the steward being down—the cap<lb></lb>tain was by at the time—they were flogging him all the time, from beginning to end, until his death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the captain himself do any thing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He kicked him every time he got a chance, about the head and neck mostly—the steward had his shirt on—it was ordered by Captain Cain to be pulled off, and it was pulled off his back—after the shirt was off he told them to go on flogging—the steward said, "Lord, save me, I am a dead man"—the captain was on deck at the time he said that, and after he said it, the captain said, "You black b—, I will have your life this night."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, according to your account, he used that expression more than once? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, many times.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DOANE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you hear the steward say any thing else? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he said, "Lord, save my eyes"—there was a boy named Dogaboo, and every time he could get a chance to cut the steward, he was trying to cut him in the eye—the captain was by at the time—every time he called out.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see him at the moment you judge he died? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he turned himself on his face, and stretched his arms and legs to the greatest extent, and they still flogged him on his back—the captain must have seen that—he was there at the time—I observed his face and neck in the morning after—the neck and head was all in a jelly, and all of a thick<lb></lb>ness nearly—his eyes were closed—he was cut terribly about the eyes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the eyes project, or were they knocked in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were rather out a little—they were not knocked into his head—I returned to</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you see him first on board the vessel, when she arrived? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On Friday, the 19th of January—(she arrived on the 1st, and during those eighteen days I did not see the captain on board)—I went on a stage which a cask had been landed from, and I said, "Captain Cain, how are you, I hope you will shake hands with me now?"—he was taking off his glove to shake hands—I said, "Captain Cain, you must come now, for that man's life"—I called two policemen, and gave him into custody—the ships to which Captains Hemmingway and Dawson belonged were at Calabar before we were—we were in the river before the <hi rend="italic">William</hi> brig—Dawson was the captain of that—the name of Hemmingway's vessel is the <hi rend="italic">Snowden</hi> barque—they were not lying near the <hi rend="italic">Kingston</hi>—they were lying higher up—the <hi rend="italic">Haywood</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Ann</hi> were the nearest vessels—they were both nearer than the other vessels.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you recollect being examined before Captains Hemmingway and Dawson? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—they desired me to tell what I knew about the trans<lb></lb>action—they did not offer any reward, or throw out any threat about my speaking the truth, but I durst not tell the truth because the captain was a cruel man to others, and I thought he would be the same to me—he had never hurt me nor struck me either before nor after.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to say that the captain absconded on his arrival at Li<lb></lb>verpool? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was a boat came alongside, and he engaged it, and just as we got round the Dock he got into it, and before the ship came to anchor he left it—it was then in charge of the pilot.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it not usual for a captain to go ashore to meet his owners as soon as he arrives? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have seen them go before—it is usual for captains to remain in the ship to see her discharged, and to attend the vessel during her discharge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is not that the duty of the chief-mate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is the duty of both—I have seen them both do it—it is not the captain's place to attend the delivery of cargo.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the boatswain reply to you that he had said that the captain flogged the steward on such a day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He told me he knew he had flog<lb></lb>ged him on a certain day—I do not recollect saying that I had said the very same—I recollect the boatswain did say that to me.</p>

BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember going before the Magistrate at Liverpool? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I was taken there on the part of the prisoner, and was examined at very great length—I was bound over to ap<lb></lb>pear as a witness here—I left Liverpool on Friday to come to London—I came with Mr. Stathen, the attorney for Captain Cain—I have been living at Wood's Hotel, Holborn, since I have been in London—Mr. Stathen went to the same hotel—he went away on Sunday night, and left me there—Mr. Currie came, and staid there after he left—I do not know whether he is his partner—I was there the first two or three days of this week—I did not know that the Sessions began on Monday—nobody told me that—I have come here to-day for the first time during this session—this is the first time I have been told to come here—I have done as Mr. Currie told me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you came up out of the cabin after the steward was taken on. deck, did you not find him lying down on the deck? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—he was kneeling down—the Kroo-boys had hold of him—I went out of the cabin before the captain, and stopped when I got to the steps, and then the cap<lb></lb>tain went on forward—the cabin is very nearly on a level with the deck—only three steps down—you can see every thing that takes place on deck, from the cabin-locker—I stopped at the steps for the captain to go on, and I followed him on deck—I stopped by the captain on the starboard side of the steward—the captain was quite close to the steward some times, and at other times a distance off—he told them to pay him well, using violent language—he called him a black son of a b—, and to pay him well—I saw the lead-line brought and cut up—the captain ordered it to be cut up—it was cut into small pieces about two feet long, to make into a cat—they whipped the ends of them, and tied a piece of twine round the ends to keep them from becoming unravelled—the twined end was the end they struck with.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many men. did you see flogging the steward? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Six at one time, besides the captain—he was standing by—he was there when. Doga<lb></lb>boo struck the steward over the eyes—whilst the men were flogging the steward, I saw the captain kick him—whenever he could get a chance, he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183801290146"></xptr>
               <p>kicked him—I did not notice where he kicked him every time—he kicked him on the head, and on the face—I cannot say whether he kicked him on the neck—he did on the body—any part he could get at—it did not matter what—that was whilst the men were flogging him as I have described.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you cry? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The tears were in my eyes to see the man get<lb></lb>ting ill-used so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not the captain on the deck when hand-irons were ordered to be put on the steward? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I think he was, but I cannot be sure to that—he ordered them to be put on, and at that time the steward was dy<lb></lb>ing, if not dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean you thought he was dying, if not dead? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you examined by the captains about a month after this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, by Captains Hemmingway and Dawson, about two weeks, or so, after—it was not a month.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, have you not said that you and all the rest of the men were afraid to tell the truth when you were-examined by the captains? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and that was so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you or the captain first come on deck? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The captain, and I was close alongside of him—if he had struck the steward with the butt-end of the cat, and knocked him down, I must have seen it—he did not knock him down, nor strike him with the butt-end of the cat at all—the Kroo-boys knocked him down before the flogging began, and held him down, but he was not knocked down by the butt-end of the cat—he made an attempt to go into the cabin again, where the captain was—he was very violent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From what you saw, did it appear to you that the captain was in danger from him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I observed the marks of his five fingers on the captain's throat, and his face was a blue colour—Walker was the first Kroo boy that flogged—he was striking, and the others were holding him—five of them were flogging at the same time—Walker, and Bottle-o'-beer let him go a bit, and then they flogged him again—they took his shirt and singlet off, and then let him go for a time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before you went down with the captain, what injury did it appear to you the steward had received? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was nearly killed before I went down—he could just roll about, but he could not sit up—that was before I went down into the cabin with the captain—the captain got his head dressed—his head was not bleeding much at that time—the blood was getting very hard—I was washing his neck.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you were below, did the captain see what was going on on deck? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he did not seem to look—he could not see what was going on on deck, from where he was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could you tell from the noise on deck that the beating was going on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; any one could hear that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the beating continue till you went on deck again? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; they had given over before we got on deck again—<hi rend="italic">Three-fingered Jack</hi> was on deck when we returned—he was not there when we went below—I did not see him—he is a Calabar-boy—I heard the steward call for some water before I went below, several times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the captain aware that he had been much hurt when he ordered him to be put in irons? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know—the captain was in such a</p>

               <p>great passion—I heard the order given to send for the surgeon of the <hi rend="italic">Ann</hi> to see if he was dead.</p>
               <p>(Several respectable witnesses gave the prisoner an excellent character for humanity and good conduct.)</p>

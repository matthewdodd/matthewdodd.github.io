            . I am in the employ of George Drake Sewell and Thomas Cross. On the 1st of February the prisoner came to the door of the shop, and asked me to cut off some print; she bought that and several articles, amounting to about 5 s., which she paid for - she then asked me to show her some ribbons - I showed her some different drawers of ribbon, and she bought two or three yards of narrow. In one of the last drawers of ribbon which I showed her, she asked me the price of one particular ribbon several times; and, as I was putting that drawer back, I missed that ribbon - she had then left the shop - I pursued and brought her back. Mr. Sewell met her by the shop, and she gave him two pieces of black ribbon, and hoped to God he would forgive her; I immediately said, she had got some more; she put her hand under her cloak, and brought out the piece I alluded to, and that was all she had got. There were other persons serving in the shop. The ribbons which she stole had been in three separate drawers. I saw her searched - she had 11 s. about her, a few halfpence, and twenty duplicates.</p>

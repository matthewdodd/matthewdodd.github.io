On Sunday the 28th of June, Mr. Mordica came to me to know if I had not lost a silver milkpot, I found I had, and went to his house and own'd it to be my property: then I went to the poultry compter, I saw the prisoner but did not know him, but upon asking him questions how he came into my house, he own'd he took the silver milkpot from off my shelf in my kitchen; and that the maid used to let him in, and he used to make her fire.</p>
               <p>Mr. Mordica. I live in Shoemaker row and keep a glass-shop. On Sunday between 9 and 10 in the morning, there were two men and the prisoner offering to sell a silver milkpot, the people told me they believed it was stolen. I being Constable, took it out of Gaines's hand, who had it to sell, he asked 3 s. or 3 s. and 6 d. he said it is not mine, but that persons there, and said I know him. Then I said he should go before the Alderman. There the prisoner said, he found it, and it was his, the other ran way. I took them and brought them to the Compter. On the way Gaines told me, if I'd go to one Mr. Goostree, I should find that the pot was his property. I went there and told him of it; he then missed it and came with me and saw it, and said it was his property.</p>

            . I worked in the garden at Brumpton, and have known the prisoner two years, he scowers clothes; I attended a sick gentleman at Brumpton ; he desired me to go out the 28th of June in the morning to get some mushrooms, going thro' the five fields at Chelsea, betwixt five and six, I met the prisoner, he said Frank, I can go and get a good breakfast if you'll go along with me. I consented, we went to Mr. Goostree's house at the corner of a street, he knock'd at the parlour window, a servant maid open'd the window, and said, I'll come presently, she open'd the door in about a quarter of an hour and let him in, I stood just by the corner of the street. He came out with an apron full of bread and cheese, and said, we'll go and have a breakfast, which we did. Then at his desire we went and took a walk over the new Bridge, and to Dukes-place, there I believe were a hundred Jews walking about. He said to me, I have found a very fine thing, I'll sell it, and pull'd it out of his pocket, I thought it was the case of a watch. He gave it me in my hand, I shewed it to a man who went to the Constable who came up to me, and asked me whose it was? I said a man has found it, and he'll sell it for three shillings and sixpence an ounce. He took hold on us both, when we came to the Compter, I took the Constable into the large, and said, he came from a very creditable house, and may be he has took this from thence. He asked me where? I said Mr. Goostree's, and gave him directions to find it, so he went there.</p>

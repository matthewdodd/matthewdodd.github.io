In Queen-street, I saw several people very riotous; they were in Mr. Cox's house, and bringing the things and furniture out, and burning it. I saw them throw out of the window chairs, tables, and beds. At about half after eleven I went up one of the coachyards, as I came down again; thinking to get home as fast as I could, I saw a man in a blue jacket; I then thought he had trowsers on. He had an iron bar in his hand. I took particular notice of him; there was a boy by him, in a brown coat with a red collar. He had a piece of wood in his hand like the bar of a window. I could not see whether the man had trowsers on till he got the window quite down; then I saw it was the skirts of a white coat sewed to a sailor's jacket *; he knocked the brick-work out till he got it down to the floor.</p>
               <p>* The Prisoner's dress at the time of his tryal answered this description.</p>
               <p>Who was that man? - The prisoner is the man to the best of my belief; he has the same jacket on now. His face was disguised with dirt.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see the man before? - Never to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>You will not be positive now that he is the man? - No, but I know the jacket.</p>

               <p>I was in Queen-street, on the 6th of June, at about a quarter before eleven o'clock. There were a great number of people knocking Mr. Cox's house to pieces; I particularly observed the prisoner at the bar in the house; he was knocking the brick-work out with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280114"></xptr> an iron crow; I was on the opposite side of the street.</p>
               <p>How was you able to see him? - There were a number of fires in the street, it was light enough to pick up a pin.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner is the man? - I am; I had seen him before on the same day; he was dressed in the same coat he has on now, the skirts of which are white.</p>
               <p>Repeat what you saw him doing? - He had an iron bar in his hand longer than this stick; he knocked out the frames of the windows, and then the bricks. There was a boy by him in a brown coat with a red cape.</p>
               <p>How many persons were present? - Two or three hundred. They quite demolished the house.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>

               <p>You knew where he lived? - I believe at Paddington.</p>
               <p>You might have taken him before? - I could not hear of him before; he was not at Paddington as I know of.</p>
               <p>Did you go to Paddington in search of him? - I live at Paddington.</p>
               <p>You knew where to find him, did you go to Mr. Willans's where he works, to enquire for him? - I did not know that he worked for Mr. Willan.</p>
               <p>When did you take him up? - On Friday se'nnight; I believe it was the 17th.</p>
               <p>From the 6th to the 17th you never offered to take him up? - Nobody dared to take persons up at that time.</p>

Hawes has lived with me six weeks; he came to me like a beggar; he said he came from Shepherd's Bush; that he had been sick and lame, and had been in the workhouse six months. I enquired and found that what he told me was true, and that he bore a very good character, I employed him. He was at his work morning and evening, and was very sober. My men are called over every morning and evening. If I had not thought that he was as clear of this offence as I am, I would not have appeared for him.</p>

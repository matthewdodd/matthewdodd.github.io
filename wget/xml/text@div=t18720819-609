                  <hi rend="largeCaps">CHARLES WALTER LOVEJOY</hi>. I am the son of Mr. William lovejoy of 37, Russell Square—on Sunday, 14th July between 4 and 5 o'clock a.m, I had occasion to get up early, and heard a noise down stairs and voices—I went down and saw Pocock in the hall—I watched him a few minutes, and heard him say "How shall we move these things?" and another voice said "We had better take a cab"—I went up stairs put on some clothes, and went back and saw the prisoners folding up some clothes, and told them the best thing they could do was to, go they made no answer—they had some coats on belonging to the house—I kept my eye outside the door, and seeing a figure pass who I believed to be a policeman, I told them they had better go—I was talking to them five or six minutes—I had ample opportunity of observing their faces—I looked out at the door and saw a policeman there—I talked to them at the door half a minute, and suddenly called "Police!" and "Thieves!"—they ran away, and the policeman pursued them—the door open into Montague place, where it joins the square—the policeman came down Montague place to<lb></lb>wards the square—I called my father, and in about five minutes Bell, the policeman, came to the house, and I went over it with him—the side board and cupboard in the dining-room and library had been turned but—I found a cupboard and door open down stairs, and the drawing-room the same—a bag was in the hall, containing a cruet forks a toast rack, mustard pot, wine strainer, salt cellars, eighteen forks a flute, some billiard balls, and other articles belonging to my father—the silver cruet frame was crushed—there were footmarks on the portico railing, and the bell had evidently been bent from being stood upon, and there were marks on the top of the portico and on the window-sill—both the lower and upper parts of the window were open—I am not sure whether we had been played at billiards the night before, but the billiard balls were all there when I last played—they were not there when I examined the room—there were marks on the carpet by the window, as if a man's feet had been wiped there—I saw no marks by the door—I picked out Hastings from a number of men at the station, and on the following morning I picked out Pocock—there were about four persons on each site of him—I had no doubt about their identity, then or now.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Hastings. Q.</hi> When you went there did the policeman give you a descrip<lb></lb>tion of me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I was not told that you were the accused.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I looked at the clock when I came down and it was about 4.40—I was the last person in the billiard-room overnight—I went to bed about 11 o'clock—I smoked overnight, and had some sherry and water—we always leave the window open at night—no one was in the billiard-room but me and my brother—I am sure I played at billiards; I said that I was not sure because I could' net recollect—I had not taken anything to stupify me—I had taken medicine overnight, and got at 5 o'clock because I felt unwell—one or two of the men at the station were older than the</p>

On Sunday, 16th July, a little before 5 o'clock, I was on duty in Montague Place—I heard cries of "Thieves!" and "Police!"—I turned round and saw two men crossing the end of the street from the direction of 37, Russell Square—I chased them about 600 yards up Montague Street into Bury Street, and Hastings was brought back by another constable—I then went to 37, Russell Square—Mr. Lovejoy has correctly described the state of the house—there was a bag full of silver, a flute, and some billiard balls—I found marks of men's feet on the area railings, and on the bell knob and portico—the footmarks only went a little way on the carpet—Mr. Lovejoy identified Hastings among a number of others at the station, without difficulty—no suggestion was made to him.</p>

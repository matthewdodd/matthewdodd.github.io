I catch'd hold of his Great Coat, and recover'd my self, for I was not willing to lose my Hat; but he got away, and I follow'd, and cry'd, Stop Thief, and I kept him in Sight till he was taken by a Constable. I had ty'd my Hat fast upon my Head with a Ribbon, and he pull'd so hard that he left the Ribbon about my Neck. So when I came up to him again, the Constable took a Man's Hat from under the Prisoner's Great Coat, and said, Is this your Hat? No, says I, mine is a Bermudas Hat, lined with blue Silk. I had not let him go so easily at first, but I had got a pair of Stays in my Apron, and I was afraid of losing 'em. I lost 2 s. besides, but I can't swear he had it.</p>

            . I heard a Woman cry, Stop Thief! my Hat! my Hat! and saw the Prisoner running across the way; I let him pass me, and then seiz'd him. Presently the Prosecutrix came up to us with a String about her Neck, and accus'd him of Robbing her. I found a black Hat under his Great Coat, but the Woman said that was not her's, for that her's was a Bermudas Hat lin'd with blue Silk, and that the Prisoner had pitch'd her Face with a Link. I look'd on the Ground, and within two Yards found this Bermudas Hat, which she presently said was her's. The Prisoner offer'd to make himself an Evidence against his two Companions.</p>

She said be quiet, or I'll cry out; they thrust her into the middle of the Street, and the Prisoner pull'd her Hat off, put it under his Arm, ran as fast as he could, and was not out of my Sight till he was taken. When he was in the Round-House, he at first said, that what they did was only in Rognery to have a little Fun with the old Woman, by pulling and hauling her about, and then letting her slipdown; but afterwards he own'd, that they thrust her into the middle of the Street, and knock'd her down.</p>

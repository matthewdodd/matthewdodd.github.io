            . I left the prisoner to look after my door, on the 29th of June about eight in the morning. I went to the bake-house to fetch a two penny loaf.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you gone?</p>
               <p>Parker. I believe I was gone above a quarter of an hour. I found her on the bench where I left her. I had my money to pay away that day I took it out of the drawer, and put it upon the chest of drawers, fearing I should forget when I came back again.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did you lose?</p>
               <p>Parker. There was nineteen guineas and a shilling, that made twenty pounds, four guineas, and half guinea, and five shillings and sixpence, which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176207140010"></xptr> made twenty five pounds. I was to blame, not the girl. The chamber door was open, so she opened no lock. It had an acquaintance called that day that I had not seen a great while so I did not go that day. I intended to pay it on the morrow.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss your money?</p>
               <p>Parker. When I went up stairs to go to bed, I did not look for it. I did not go the next day; I went to hear a sermon in Broad-street, and did not miss it till Thursday night the 29th of June, then I hunted every where. I rummmaged up stairs and down. I was afraid to speak of it. I was afraid she took it; and on Monday morning I taxed her about it. I said, did nobody come into my house that took something out? She said, no, I said, somebody had taken something that did not belong to them, nor me neither. I said, if you took something, I will forgive you. She said, do not talk to me, and went away. I said, tell; you had as good tell; for if you have broke into it, I will forgive you. She would not hear me, she ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure she heard you?</p>
               <p>Parker. She heard me, and ran up stairs, and laughed at me. She lives in the back part of my house. A person told me I might have a warrant on suspicion. I said, I would trust the Providence of God. I would not have a warrant. Mrs. Bell saw her buying a cardinal. She came to me, and said, she had seen some of my money. Said I, it is my fault; I will forgive her, if she will deliver the rest. She would not come near me. I went and got a warrant from justice Berry: I would not swear she had it, but it was on suspicion: for several days we could not find her; at last she surrendered. On Friday morning following she sent word she would surrender to me, and was very sorry for what she had done. I went and told Mr. Berry; then Mr. Cragg brought me that message, this was on Friday. I asked the justice if I could make it up with her. I was contented with what was left, be it what it will. The justice said I must have a warrant, and sent to the headborough, and she was carried before the justice. When she came there, she said she would give me all that was left. The justice told her she need not part with any thing. She said she knew it was very hard with me, and she took it, and she would give me all the things she had bought with it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she return of the money?</p>
               <p>Parker. I believe about sixteen pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she give an account how she laid the money out?</p>
               <p>Parker. She had bought a pair of stays, and other things; them I gave to her, as she had been so kind. I said God bless you, I never knew any m of you before. I hope the jury and my lord will take it in consideration to do you no hurt. It was my fault in laying that temptation in her way. I hope the court will it take into consideration; for God Almighty will provide for me.</p>

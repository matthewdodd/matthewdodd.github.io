                  </hi>. I am manager to Thomas McCarthy, a tobacconist of 164, Oxford Street—on 8th November, between 2 and 3 p.m., the prisoner came in for three cigarettes, and gave me a sovereign—it looked suspicious—I weighed it, found it was not weight, returned it to him, and he gave me a good one—he said that he knew where he took it, and he came again for three cigarettes, and tendered a similar sovereign—a young lady followed him into the shop—he had his purse in his hand, and I saw him give her something—I gave him in charge, with the coin.</p>

On 8th November, at 11 o'clock, I went to 364, Oxford Street, and found the prisoner detained by Western—he and a young lady were given into my custody—the prisoner said that he knew the coin was bad, but he took it from some one, and thought he was at liberty to get rid of it—I searched him and found ten sovereigns, four half-sovereigns, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in bronze, and this billhead (<hi rend="italic">this was headed</hi> "Dalton to L.

                  </hi>, F. R. S. I have been chemist to the Mini for seven years, and have considerable experience in respect of coins—these two coins are good gold, but they have been reduced in weight by the action of a solvent, one 10 gr. 6, and the other 11 gr. 1, which is 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in value respectively—the standard of a sovereign is 123.27—the estimated loss in a year on a sovereign is 0.43, so that in four years these coins ought only to have lost by legitimate wear 2/10 ths and 1/4 of a grain respectively. I have a sovereign here which I reduced by a solvent in an hour, and I produce the gold taken from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I lightened one of Her Majesty's coins by the direction of the Master of the Mint, and got off of it 10.6 of gold—there is copper in sovereigns, and I may have brought the copper to the surface—a solvent makes the surface frosted or honeycombed—the majority of sovereigns leave the Mint a fraction of a grain under 123.27, but one of these coins comes from Melbourne—it is quite possible for a light sovereign to leave the Mint—in 1866 two florins left the Mint, one worth 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the other 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—some sovereigns pass the best part of their lives shut up in banks—coins which are in great circulation bear evidence of being more worn than my average—I call Professor Jevons an authority—he states that coins passing from hand to hand at the East End of London wear a great deal more than those at the West End—gold varies in softness—I do not know that the gold used in 1873 was of a soft quality—I weighed these sovereigns, one weighs 112.624, and the other 112.174.</p>

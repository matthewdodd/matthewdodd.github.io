The Paisley shawl and the silk skirt were pledged at Machlin's on the 15th, and from the description he has given of you I believe it was you who pledged them," and I said to Stone, who was with me, "Is it her that pledged them?"—he said "Yes"—she said "I pledged a Paisley shawl, but it was my own" her husband said "Well, you will have to go with them; you had better put your waterproof on"—she went from the front room to the bed room at the back, taking a light, and I saw a Paisley shawl hanging on the foot of the bed—I said "Why there is a Paisley shawl there"—she made no answer—on the road to the station she said "The pawnbroker must be mistaken, as he would not know the difference between me and my daughter."</p>

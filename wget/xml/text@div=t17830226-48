               <p>I am a pawnbroker in Oxford-street; the prisoner at the bar brought this piece of cloth to me to pledge; from his appearance and that of the goods, I supposed he had stole it; I sent for a constable and took him into custody, I saw the constable take out of his pocket a direction to Mr. Peach in the Strand; the prisoner said the cloth was given him by one Sevington in Fleet-market.</p>
               <p>Court to Peach. Whose hand writing is that direction? - It is the hand writing of Mr. Capel, a clothier in Glocestershire, who was my correspondent, it was to come up by the waggon, this is but half the quantity.</p>
               <p>Did you ever receive any cloth corresponding to what you expected? - No, I did not, I had a letter from Mr. Capel informing me, that he had sent it on such a day, and I expected it at that time.</p>
               <p>Court. Then how do you know that that is the same cloth that Mr. Capel sent? Here is a servant of Mr. Capel's that can swear to it.</p>

               <p>I am a porter to Mr. Niblet's waggon, I saw the truss of cloth directed to Mr. Peach, with this direction that has been shewn now, and I am sure it is the same; it was upon the cloth when the waggon was unloaded at Blackwell Hall, and I saw it at the Old Change, and the prisoner unloaded the waggon for the waggoner, he rode in the waggon, and as it was a wet day, I told him to cover the truss with straw, which he did; I went to get my dinner, and when I came to clear out the waggon, the truss was gone, the carman said, the prisoner got out in Newgate-street.</p>

               <p>I never was in no waggon, I came out of Wiltshire; you cannot think I am a thief, I am a countryman, I have no friend or foe, I have no friend nor acquaintance in London, I met with a man in Fleet Market, with this cloth in a bundle; he asked me to go to pawn this cloth, he said he would give me a shilling, I had lodged my coat the night before for 1 s. 6 d. and I said I had lodged my coat the night before, and I carried it to the same pawnbroker's, I was to meet the man at the Harrow in Fleet Market, with a guinea, they would not let me go to see for the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, and live at Woolwich. On the 19th of May, about one o'clock in the morning, I was returning from Green<lb></lb>wich to Woolwich; I had just got beyond the-dock, and near Air-street, where I live, the prisoner ran right up to me, meeting me—she caught hold of me, said, "Where are you going?" putting her arms round me—I said, "I am going home"—she said, "Come along with me"—in the mean time the got her hand into my pocket, and my purse was taken out in a few minutes—it contained 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in sovereigns and half-sovereigns—she kept the purse on the side of her—I saw it in her hand, and said, "You have got my money"—she said, "Yes, come along, it is all right"—I said, "Give me my parse"—she said, "Come home with me and I will, it will be all right," and dragged me along the street, saying, "D—n the policemen, come home with me, it will be all right"—I had been drinking myself, and cannot say whether she had or not—I asked her all the way for the purse—she would not give it up—she had an opportunity of taking money out on the road, as she kept shuffl<lb></lb>ing it about, and before I got to the door I heard the money jink—I caught hold of the purse, as she knocked at the door, and took it out of her hand—Parry, who kept the house, got up to get a light—she wanted me to go up stain—I said, "Stop a bit, let me see that my money is right"—I counted the money on the table, and found 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. short—she still said, "Come up, it is all right"—I took hold of her—Parry and his wife were a long time arguing with me, saying, "Look at the disgracefulness of the thing, Mr. Bland, what will your wife say?"—I held her till a policeman came.</p>

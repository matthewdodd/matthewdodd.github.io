                  </hi>. I am servant to Henry Benthall, a ceal and wine-merchant, of No. 18, Cecil-street, Strand. On the 26th of February, be<lb></lb>tween seven and eight o'clock in the morning, I missed the articles stated—I was about my work, and left the street door for about two minutes—the clock was taken from the mantel-piece in the back parlour, and the card-counters from the front parlour—I cannot say how many were gone, but there was a good many.</p>

               <p>it—my brother brought me a papier macho case, containing counters, from China—each counter was marked with a Chinese device, and engraved with my crest—I should not like to swear to such articles as these, although I have a clear conviction they are my property—the clock has never been found, nor the box—I am certain this counter is one that I lost, by my, crest being upon it.</p>

On the 26th of February, in consequence of information, I went about two o'clock in the morning to No. 15, Peter-street, Saffron-hill, and went to the prisoner's room—he was in bed with two females—I told him I wanted him for a robbery, and to get up and dress himself, which he did—while he was dressing I searched the room—I found these counters on the mantel-shelf, and these four keys on the table—Cole, who was with me, also found some keys, these cards, and some files—the prisoner said, when I found the counters, that a man brought them there the morning before, while he was in bed, to leave them for two hours.</p>

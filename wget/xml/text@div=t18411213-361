                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Weaver, a butcher, and live in Lower-road, Islington. On Saturday, the 5th of December, about a quarter to eleven o'clock at night, I missed a salted leg of pork from the stall-board—I had seen it safe five minutes before—I did not see any one take it, but a little boy I had with me did—I ran out, and up Church-passage, but saw no one with the pork—this is the leg of pork—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was brought to me on Sunday—I had salted it with salt-petre and sugar, and it was cut in a different way to what pork-shops in general cut it—it was cut more like a leg of mutton—I am positive this is the leg of pork I missed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher. I cut up a leg of pork for Mrs. Weaver—I cannot positively say whether this is the same—I cut it very badly, as I had a very bad knife, and this is cut badly—I cut it from a side, which was all cut up into joints, and left in the shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in Mr. Weaver's employ. I did not see the leg of pork taken—a person passing by told me of it, and I ran out—I saw a boy running, with the leg of pork in his hand—I was about three yards from him when I first saw him—he turned round the passage leading to the church—I could not see his face—he was bigger than me, but was not a grown man—I followed him till I got into the dark part of the church-yard—I was fearful of going any further—I cannot tell who it was—his dress answered to that of Wybrow—he had a coat and a flat cap on—it was eleven o'clock at night.</p>

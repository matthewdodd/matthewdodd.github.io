In August, 1827, Hoffman and Co. were brokers of a ship in which we were interested, and were indebted to us 64l. 1s. 11d. on account of one ship, and 166l. 3s. 1d. on account of another - the 64l, 1s 11d. has been brought to account, but the other amount has never been entered in the cash-book, and has never come to our hands.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. It was customary, on Thursdays and Fridays, on busy days, for money to be placed on a desk for you to enter. Witness.

             re-examined. The prisoner left the prosecutor's service on the 24th or 25th of the eighth month, 1827 - two days after this payment was made; he had a very sudden discharge I believe.</p>
               <p>MR. LILLWALL. The prisoner was dismissed almost immediately after this circumstance; we discovered this about a month after, and employed an officer, but could not find him till now.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This prosecution has come most unexpectedly upon me - those who have preferred it might have made it a subject of enquiry last Session; on my return from America I requested a friend to call on them, and express my contrition for my imprudence - they received him in the kindest manner, spoke in the highest terms of my services, and said if I had not gone astray they intended to place me beyond the situation of a clerk; this friend found no difficulty in bringing them to a compromise - they told him they thought me entitled to reversionary property, and would take that if it could be made over, and would take the amount in easy instalments if my relatives would give security for it; my friend left it to their solicitor to draw up the document to be signed by my mother and myself for 20l. a-year to liquidate the debt; satisfied with this, and relying on their word, which I would have taken as a most solemn oath of any person, I began business on my own account, hoping, by diligent attendance, I should regain the character, to which before I had been always entitled to, as well as prevent my mother being called on for payment of the 20l. yearly; I was suffered to carry on business a very short time - it was daily on the increase, when, through the treachery of some concealed foe, the party who had lent me a small sum to begin with, demanded it and arrested me, and threw me into prison; this did not prevent my exertions - I got out of prison and expected the refusal of two situations, which would enable me to liquidate the prosecutor's demand, and notwithstanding their solemn affirmation, on the 16th I was taken on a charge for felony; convinced of the evil of my follies I had determined to become a steady man: let me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110024"></xptr>leave my fate in your hands, fully confident you will not attribute the prosecution to love of justice, but to some other motive, and under these circumstances will restore me to society; if you think there is not enough to produce an acquittal, you will consider the Act now in force, admitting the affirmation of Quakers, was not in existence at the time the offence was committed, and I submit my case is not within it.</p>
               <p>MR. LILWALL. I was called on by a friend of his about four months ago - I said I regretted the circumstance very much on account of the high opinion entertained of him and his talents, and we had a view of making him a traveller - I gave him no encouragement to set up in business, nor did I know he was in business - his friend did not say where he was to be found; the officer has been in search of him ever since; Mr. Cochrane came and proposed it should bepaid by instalments - I immediately referred him to my solicitor.</p>
               <p>- COCHRANE. I called on the prosecutors on the prisoner's behalf - he declined entering into any arrangement in consequence of the absence of his partner, and made an appointment on the 14th of June, which I attended - Evans' proposition was, if they would allow him to become a useful member of society he would endeavour to pay him 20l. a-year, and would make over some property which he had in reversion, and would submit to any privation if they would allow him to reinstate himself in some employ - I believe I stated that he was in England, but not where; they stated distinctly whatever arrangement might be entered into, should be without prejudice to any proceedings they might adopt, but if he gave security they had respected him, and did not wish to hurt him.</p>

            , it was the day that Enfield races began; Mr. Ray had the same parcels from my house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You spoke to Sparrow about it, and he brought Roberts to you? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear Sparrow claim these things as his? - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it true, that that man at the bar ever said that this property was his, and that he was going to take them into the country? - A. He never did in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, if any such thing has been sworn to have been said in your presence, it must be a mistake? - A. Yes; I never heard it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you remember meeting with Ray and the prisoner, and Roberts? - A. Yes, in Finsbury-square.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any conversation took place? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Ray has sworn, in direct and pointed terms, that the prisoner said they were his own, and that they were going to a country job; - now do you mean to say, upon your oath, that that conversation did not pass? - A. It did not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. If it has passed, must you have heard it? - A. I must have heard it to be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Roberts say any thing about it one way or the other? - A. I understood Roberts they were his, that he was going into the country to work.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Ray.) Do you insist upon what you have sworn now? - A. I do; and I wish your Lordship would ask him whether he was sober or not; when I went for the property, he said, d-n my blood you shall not have them out of my place.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. This man was a witness of your own, for the prosecution? - A. Yes; but he is subpoenaed for the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Before this man contradicted you, why did not you tell the Court that he was drunk? - A. He is seldom sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose he had confirmed your story, would you then have said he was drunk? - A. Yes, I should, if I had been asked the question. (The property was deposed to by Wheeler).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am not guilty.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him an excellent-character.</p>

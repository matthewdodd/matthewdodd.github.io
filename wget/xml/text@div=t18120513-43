               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. I have some slight recollection of him from the distance of the time; I saw him but very little.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember upon what occasion you saw him - A. Purchasing stock.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the stock receipt, is that your writing - A. That is the entry of my clerk at the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you buy in any stock of that amount on that day - A. I did; it appears to be in December, 1806.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he bought in some stock upon his own account at that time - A. He did, two hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember, on the 17th of April, 1807, seeing the prisoner again. Look at the transfer of April, 1807, is that your signature - A. That is my hand-writing, as witness to the identity of the persons who transfered the stock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you sell both the two hundred pounds that day - A. The tranfer of both were made at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner the person who came to transfer, or did any other person come with him - A. Another person.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the prisoner that employed you to sell the stock, or the other person that came with him - A. Him. He was the only person that employed me, and is the only person that I mean.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner sign the transfer in your presence - A. Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he, Miller, introduce the other person to you, and how did he introduce him - A. As Brissenden, to make the transfer in the usual way.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I believe, sir, as soon as a broker identifies the person to whom the transfer is made he is responsible to the Bank. If you introduce a person to the Bank you do not think you are responsible, do you - A. I am not aware of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. In consequence of this person employing you and Brissenden, what did you do - A. I afterward deducted the commission, and gave him a draft of the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that draft, is that the draft - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the amount of that draft - A. It is composed of both the two hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>COURT. You gave it to Miller - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You are a stock-broker. In the course of the last five years how many transfer of stocks were you a witness to - A. A great number.</p>
               <p>Q. Thousands. Have you any doubt - A. A very considerable number.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the persons of all those for whom you transfer stock - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. You began by telling us that you had a faint recollection of the prisoner himself - A. Respecting him I have a faint recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted that faint recollection is, you have seen him at a time when you have transacted business with him - A. Yes, I have.</p>


               <p>Q. Now, sir, I ask you whether your recollection respecting him goes any further than this, that upon some occasion you have seen him - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what you have been telling us of his employing you, and his introducing Brissenden, is what you have formed your opinion from these papers - A. Yes, of having bought and sold stock.</p>
               <p>Q. It appears that you are a witness; that you vouched to the Bank of the persons of a Miller and a Brissenden - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any other knowledge than that a person of the name of Miller having introduced a Brissenden - A. I have no other knowledge, that I furnished the stock to him than from my own books.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, you vouched to the Bank that the person that came there, and signed, was Brissendon; now, have you any recollection of any such a person on your mind - A. I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether he was a tall man, a lusty man, or a short man, you cannot tell me - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, I ask you, whether you have any recollection of Miller as identifying that particular transaction - A. I have a faint recollection that this is the same man that employed me. If I had met him in the street I should not have known him.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing this to be the same man, sir, have you any recollection of the person of the prisoner, as applying to the first purchase of the stock - A. A very faint one. If I had met him in the street I should not have known him.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot tell me whether Brissenden was a black man, or a white man, can you - A. I have no recollection of that circumstance.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, Mr. Jones, as you cannot tell me whether Brissenden was white or black, can you recollect that Brissenden was introduced to you by any person - A. I suppose Miller introduced him at my office.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether you do not speak of the circumstance<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181205130035"></xptr> of a person being introduced to you by a person of the name of Miller; how can you recollect that when you do not recollect whether Brissenden was a white man or a black man - A. I do not recollect Brissenden at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me how it is possible that you can recollect that Brissenden was ever introduced by any other person - A. I do not recollect whether he was or was not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. In the first place your recollection of Miller is faint with respect to both transactions - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had seen Miller twice - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Miller recommended to you or did you know him before - A. He was recommended to me.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that your memory goes faintly to remember him in these two transactions - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. And (be it who it will) the same person that bought was the same person that transferred, are you quite sure of that - A. Yes, I am.</p>

               <p>Q. What sum - A. Two hundred in the 3 per cents. In November, 1807, he paid me, on the behalf of the society, the dividend of two hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any application to him after that time; any desire to sell that stock - A. I wrote a letter to him.</p>
               <p>COURT. You wrote to him to sell it - A. Yes, at the request of the society. I received an answer to that letter.</p>
               <p>(The letter read.)</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present any time in January 1812, when the prisoner's brother paid any money to Goodwin and Woodward - A. I was. They were the stewards at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money was it - A. Five pound eight shillings; that is, a year's dividend, deducting the income tax, on account of the society.</p>
               <p>Q. That was Miller's brother - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you asked the prisoner at any time to sell the stock - A. He called on me personally, nigh two months back, in this year, merely to know what we wanted to do with the money in the funds. One question he put to me was, whether I understood what money we had in the funds, because I mentioned in my letter two hundred pounds. I told him I understood it very well, two hundred pounds stock. He asked me what we intended to do with the money; I told him the club had come to no resolution what to do with it. He said he would not sell out; his objection then was because the stocks were then low; he asked me what was better than Bank of England security. I told him I considered for my own part that we had not got Bank of England security for our money. I told him I considered it necessary that Mr. Brissenden, and him should sign some instrument to prove, in case either of them should die, that the money belonged to the society, not to them. I asked him if he would be willing to sign an instrument of that kind if the society should think proper to let it remain in the funds, as the stocks were then low; he said he would.</p>
               <p>Q. This conversation took place about two months ago - A. Yes, since the letter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing about any letter that he had written to you - A. I do not remember that.</p>

               <p>SIR,</p>
               <p>I received your letter respecting the money in the funds, which I should have answered before, but waited to see what you would do with the money, as I have received two letters, one before yours, and one since. One letter informs me that the club intends to divide four hundred pounds among its members.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181205130036"></xptr> The other letter said the club intended to draw all the money out in bonds, and place it in the Kentish bank, and left me to think which is the safest, the Kentish bank or the bank of England. When you appoint a safer place, then it shall be sold out, and not before that.</p>

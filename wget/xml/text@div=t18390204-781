                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">a prisoner.</hi>)I have been an errand-boy, and lodged with my mother, in East-street, Manchester-square. I have known Broad a little while—I bare only seen Holton twice or three times at most—he lives in Tom's-court, Thomas-street, Oxford-street—I know a per<lb></lb>son named El wood. On Wednesday week, the 30th of January, between six and seven o'clock, Broad and El wood came to my house, and wanted me to come to Gilbert-street, Oxford-street, to get some lead—Mrs. Parry's stables are at the back of Gilbert-street—we went to the stable in Cock-yard—Elwood and Broad lifted me up on the wall—I had no knife—I pulled the lead off with my hands, and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> it down, and gave it to Elwood and Broad—there were two pieces—Elwood took the lead into the mews, left it there, and went and borrowed a sack of Holton—I got down from the wall into Gilbert-street, and went with Elwood into Holton's shop, with a piece of lead, for which he received 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he was to receive <hi rend="italic">As.</hi> 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was not paid—Holton put the lead underneath the counter—this was between six and seven o'clock—I afterwards met Broad in Duke-street, and he told me he had got 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the other piece of lead—Elwood gave me half-a-crown—I did not see Mott at all that night—we went again the following night, and that night I saw him in Tom's-court—Broad was with me—Mott saw us together—nothing was said when we took the lead into Holton's the night before—Broad produced the lead—Holton said nothing, but put it into the scale and weighed it—he did not say what it weighed, but said it came to 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. the two pieces—both the pieces were there—Broad took one, and Elwood the other, into the shop—when I went in with Elwood, his piece came to 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Holton paid him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was not there when Broad took in the second piece—I did not hear Holton say it came to 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but that was what it did come to—he asked no questions where it came from, but put it into the scale.</p>

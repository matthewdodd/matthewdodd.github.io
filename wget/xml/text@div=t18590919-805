                  </hi>. I was a licensed victualler of Dowgate-hill, but have since left—the prisoner was a regular customer of mine, and I used to give him change for notes—I remember changing a cheque for him—do not remember this identical one, but I can see by the date that I paid this cheque over to Messrs. Nicholson, my distillers—it was in my hands on 31st January.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Moser and others—the prisoner was our clerk—it was part of his duty to receive money and to pay it over the same day, or the following morning—he never accounted to me for this 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it was his duty to open our Dowgate letters.</p>

Q.</hi> Did you ever say anything to the prisoner about this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—the cheque is dated 29th January—I never asked him why he had not paid it in, because I did not know it—I know that he has not accounted for it, because I searched the cash-book in August and found no entry—this is the cash-book; the different partners and clerks made entries in it—if the cheque was posted on the afternoon of 29th it would, I believe, arrive at 5 or 6 o'clock; but I am not there at all—I am at the house of business at Southwark—the counting-house is closed at 5 o'clock on Saturdays—the cheque might have arrived just as the prisoner was leaving, and he would open it—there is only one entry on 31st, Huntley and Palmer of Reading; that was a country cheque, and the entry is in the prisoner's writing—there are no entries of his on the Saturday.</p>

                  </hi>. This receipt for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is in the prisoner's writing—on the day that Mr. Brown sent the cheques for the balance of his account, 8th of May I think, I told the prisoner that I had received a letter from Castel and Brown saying that they had paid their previous account and held his receipt—he said that he could not understand it—he did not recollect receiving the cheque; but he would go and see them—I had at that time received the receipt for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I forget whether I showed it to him—he subsequently told me that he had seen Mr. Brown, and saw his own receipt for it, and was satisfied that he had received the money—I said, "It is very odd you have not credited it"—he said, "I must have paid it away"—I said, "But you have no authority to pay it away"—he said, "Will you let it stand over for two or three days?—I asked him two or three days afterwards if he had found out about it—he said, "No," and that he would refund it on the following Tuesday, but he did not bring the money; and I said, "Mr. Hopkins you are discharged, and you are very lucky that you are not prosecuted"—we gave him in custody afterwards.</p>

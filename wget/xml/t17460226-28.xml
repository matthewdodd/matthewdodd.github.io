               <p>Court, (to William Basson.) Give an Account of what you know of the Prisoner at the Bar .</p>
               <p>Basson. My Lord, he brought to my House, on the 30th of January, 140 Ounces of Gold Plate , or Silver gilt Plate; out of the Parcel he took 10 Ounces and a half. I receiv'd the Whole in Custody, and I never perceiv'd any was missing 'till last Saturday, when I sent to the Person that employs me; he said we had no such Parcel, it wanted 10 Ounces and a half. The Prisoner had alter'd the Paper and forg'd another Paper, and so made it 10 Ounces and a half less. The Gentleman told him, this is not the Paper, this is not my Hand, this is your own Hand.</p>
               <p>Court. But you say the Prisoner at the Bar took 10 Ounces and a half back.</p>
               <p>Basson. Yes, my Lord, by his own Confession he sold it at a Silversmith's in Whitechapel at 5 s. 5 d. an Ounce.</p>
               <p>Court. You say he carry'd it to a Person in Whitechapel, and there sold it.</p>
               <p>Basson. Yes, my Lord.</p>

            ) What have you to say against the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Stephens . The third of January last, the Prisoner came to my Shop and offer'd to sell some Gilt Plate, what we call Waste. I ask'd him how he came by it. He said it was his own, he was a Master Olrice-Weaver, and he kept several Men under him. Don't some of the Master's employ you? Yes, he said . What is the Reason you don't carry this back again ? My Master won't give me so much by 6 d. an Ounce as I cansell it to a Shopkeeper. I ask'd him where he liv'd and where his Master liv'd. I gave him 5 s. 5 d . an Ounce for the Silver.</p>
               <p>Q. It was gilt Plate, was it not?</p>
               <p>Stevens. Yes, gilt Plate, please you, my Lord.</p>

            ( to Basson .) How was the Plate when brought to your House?</p>
               <p>Basson. It was cut in a thousand Bits. It was upon Quills at first, when he took it away. The Length of it might be a thousand Yards, but he cut it off in Bits .</p>
               <p>Q. What was the Use of that Plate?</p>
               <p>Basson. To make Lace .</p>

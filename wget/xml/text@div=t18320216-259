               <p>Blyth. Q. Did you not meet me in Hanover-street? A. I was standing there, and you came up to me - I was not so sober as I am now - I did not say I had a small trifle, and give her the money.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was in Belton-street, and heard Blyth abusing the prosecutor, and using very bad language - I was going up to remove them for being disorderly, and when I got near, the prosecutor called Police - I went up, and seized Barry; she threw from her hand a purse, enclosed in this handkerchief, which she afterwards denied being hers - I said, "This is the woman that had the purse," and the prosecutor, whom I did not consider at all tipsy said, "This one (meaning Blyth) took it from me" - I took both the prisoners to the station, and found on them 4s. 6d. in silver, and 3d. in copper.</p>
               <p>Blyth. I threw it down myself. Witness. No, Barry threw it down - Blyth was tipsy, and said she took it; she used the grossest language that ever I heard come from a woman - the prisoners are old acquaintances, and lived in the same street, in St. Giles'.</p>
               <p>Blyth. He gave me the money to go home with him, and then he called the Policeman - Barry came up by accident, hearing the piece of work, and asked what was the matter - he said he was robbed, and I threw the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183202160093"></xptr>money down - I never saw Barry before that night - the prosecutor was very much in liquor.</p>
               <p>Barry's Defence. I met the prisoner and the prosecutor in Hanover-street - I stood to see what was the matter, and the Policeman came and said that I dropped the purse, which I never had in my hand.</p>

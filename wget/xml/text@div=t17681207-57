Last Tuesday night, about half an hour after six in the evening, my mistress sent me for two yards of three-penny ribbon; I had six pennyworth of halfpence in my hand; I was got but three doors from our house, the prisoner whom I had never seen before, to my knowledge, came and got hold of my hand; he tried to open it, and could not; he put a blue and white handkerchief to my mouth; and put his foot out and throwed me down upon the pavement; and tried to get my money out of my hand. I screamed out murder, for God's sake; he roiled me about, and made me very dirty. He run away at last, and a gentleman catched hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say nothing to you?</p>
               <p>A. Roch. He d - d me, and said I was a b - h, and said he would tell my father, and that he knew him extremely well; he had the blue and white handkerchief in his hand, when he was brought to me again. She produced her cloaths all very dirty.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did I strike you?</p>
               <p>A. Roch. No, you throw'd me down though. There was a halfpenny missing. I kept the rest in my hand.</p>

            . I had been in Wood's-close; coming home I heard a child cry out bitterly. At last I heard her cry, don't murder me for God's sake. I ran and saw the prisoner make off; and he clapped his back against a door. seeing he could not get away; I was within ten yards of him before he left the child. She had a lump on her head, by the fall, as big as an egg.</p>

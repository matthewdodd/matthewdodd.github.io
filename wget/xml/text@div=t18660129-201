I went to look for a policeman, but could not find one; I then returned to Mr. Smallman's house and had another twopenny worth of rum, and stayed there about twenty minutes or half an hour, and went to a private house; one of the lodgers came to me and told me that a policeman was looking for me; I said, "I will go and see. "I went out, but the police man was gone; I had two glasses of rum in the Manchester Arms; when I came out the policeman was there, and told me the charge. I went with him without force; as I was going along, I threw away a piece of a pick wick I was smoking; that was all. <hi rend="smallCaps">
